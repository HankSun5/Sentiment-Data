New data from Santiment reveals that 42 new whale wallets holding over 1 million XRP have been created since the start of the year. This is a clear sign that high-net-worth investors may be preparing for a major upside move. With “smart money” entering the market, this accumulation trend could support a bullish XRP price prediction in the weeks ahead. XRP's price is down a modest -4% since the start of 2026, but its amount of 'millionaire' wallets are rising for the first time since September. A net of +42 wallets with at least 1M $XRP have returned to the ledger, an encouraging sign for the long-term. pic.twitter.com/nmB4hCxtZO — Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 28, 2026 At $1.75, XRP is trading at levels not seen since April this year, back when the market bottomed. Sentiment was also heavily depressed at that time, setting the stage for deep-pocketed players to step in to scoop up the token at a low price. Whales could be expecting a recovery to the $3 level in the long term. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Exploded the Last Time This Pattern Showed Up XRP’s daily chart shows an interesting pattern that led to a strong recovery the last time it showed up. This could be what whales are seeing that most retail investors are missing. The price got squeezed to this key support, and buying interest is rising. Source: TradingView A break above $1.95 would invalidate XRP’s bearish price structure. This could potentially lead to a retest of the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $2.20. Same as last time, a move above this key line would be the buy signal for long-term holders. Investors could be expecting a move back to the levels seen earlier this year. Whales are piling into XRP at $1.75. If retail follows, a short squeeze could be around the corner. The “smart money” knows a bottom is nearby, and top crypto presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) could benefit the most if bullish momentum gains steam.

This came as he explained exactly how the altcoin will reach this price target based on its market cap and circulating supply. Why A Litecoin Price Rally To $2,000 Could Happen In an X post, BigShortRare noted that LTC has a circulating supply of roughly 76.78 million coins. As such, a $1,200 Litecoin price will give the altcoin a market cap of about $90 billion, while at $2,000 per LTC, the altcoin’s market cap is about $150 million. The pundit remarked that these numbers sound big until they are put in context. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Litecoin Price May Be Getting Ready For Another Massive Rally BigShortRare alluded to the fact that Bitcoin has already crossed $2 trillion in market cap in the past, while Ethereum has traded above a $500 billion market cap. Furthermore, he stated that in the previous cycle, capital has repeatedly concentrated into a few large, liquid, and battle-tested assets. Therefore, a Litecoin price rally to a $90 billion to $150 billion market cap would still be a fraction of Bitcoin’s market cap and well within historical altcoin concentration ranges during late-cycle rotation. BigShortRare also mentioned that what supports that valuation range is not illusion but structure. He explained that Litecoin is fully integrated across exchanges, wallets, payment processors, and merchant rails. The pundit added that the altcoin has a fixed supply, no VC overhang, no emissions surprises, and no dependency on speculative incentives. LTC is also said to function as a settlement and payment network, not a promise. “LTC Is The OG” BigShortRare also noted that LTC is an OG crypto project, which is another reason why he is confident that the Litecoin price can rally to as high as $2,000. He stated that when markets rotate from experimentation to reliability, capital doesn’t spread evenly but rather compresses into assets that already work at scale. Related Reading: XRP, HBAR, And Litecoin: Pundit Highlights Coins To Watch In 2026 The pundit remarked that a $1,200 to $2,000 price tag for LTC doesn’t require it to replace Bitcoin or Ethereum. Instead, it only requires the market to price Litecoin as a major monetary rail and not a side character. “That’s not a prediction of timing. It’s a valuation argument. Price decides when. Structure decides if,” he concluded. It is worth noting that BigShortRare’s thesis was in support of crypto analyst Surf’s prediction that the Litecoin price was about to rally to $2,000. His accompanying chart showed that the rally to this price target could happen by 2028. At the time of writing, the Litecoin price is trading at around $64, down over 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

57600752,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=267275,1769808679,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Tether Shatters Records with $10 Billion Profit and Unprecedented $141 Billion Treasury Holdings,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tether-record-profit-treasury-holdings/,"BitcoinWorld Tether Shatters Records with $10 Billion Profit and Unprecedented $141 Billion Treasury Holdings In a landmark financial disclosure that underscores its colossal scale, Tether Holdings Ltd., the issuer of the world’s dominant stablecoin USDT, has announced a staggering profit exceeding $10 billion for the last fiscal year. Furthermore, the company revealed it now holds a record $141 billion in U.S. Treasury securities, a figure that positions it as a major global financial entity. This report, released from its operational base, provides unprecedented transparency into the reserves backing the $110 billion USDT token. Tether’s Record-Breaking Financial Performance The company’s latest attestation report, prepared by the independent accounting firm BDO, details a year of extraordinary financial growth. Tether’s net profit for the period surpassed the $10 billion mark, a sum derived primarily from interest earned on its substantial reserve assets. Consequently, this profitability directly fuels the company’s excess reserves, which now stand at a robust $6.3 billion. These excess reserves act as a critical buffer, providing protection for the USDT stablecoin far beyond its one-to-one peg to the U.S. dollar. This financial performance is not an isolated event but rather the result of a sustained strategic shift. Over recent years, Tether has systematically increased the quality and liquidity of its backing assets. The cornerstone of this strategy is a massive allocation to U.S. Treasury bills, which are considered among the safest and most liquid financial instruments globally. Therefore, the company’s profitability is intrinsically linked to the higher interest rate environment, as these short-term government securities have yielded significant returns. The Anatomy of Tether’s $141 Billion Treasury Pile Tether’s holdings of U.S. Treasury securities now total an astonishing $141 billion. To contextualize this figure, if Tether were a country, its Treasury holdings would rank it above many developed nations in terms of direct ownership of U.S. government debt. This portfolio primarily consists of short-dated Treasury bills, which mature in less than one year, ensuring high liquidity and minimal exposure to interest rate volatility. The composition of Tether’s reserves is a direct response to past criticisms and regulatory scrutiny regarding transparency and asset safety. By pivoting heavily towards U.S. Treasuries, Tether provides a clear, verifiable answer to questions about its solvency. Moreover, this move aligns with broader regulatory pushes within the cryptocurrency industry for stablecoin issuers to hold high-quality, liquid assets. The company’s report also details holdings in other secure instruments, but the Treasury allocation remains the unequivocal centerpiece, representing the overwhelming majority of its consolidated assets. Implications for the Global Stablecoin and Crypto Market Tether’s financial disclosures have profound implications that extend far beyond its own balance sheet. Firstly, the scale of its Treasury purchases demonstrates the growing and tangible intersection between the digital asset ecosystem and traditional finance. Tether is now a significant participant in the multi-trillion-dollar U.S. Treasury market, a fact that captures the attention of policymakers and traditional financial institutions alike. Secondly, the $6.3 billion in excess reserves represents a formidable safety net for the entire crypto market, given USDT’s role as the primary trading pair on most global exchanges. This capital cushion enhances systemic stability by providing explicit proof that the stablecoin can withstand substantial redemption pressure without breaking its peg. For everyday users and institutional investors, this transparency directly impacts trust and risk assessment when utilizing USDT for transactions, trading, or as a dollar-equivalent store of value. Key impacts of Tether’s report include: Market Confidence: Concrete data on high-quality reserves bolsters confidence in the largest stablecoin. Regulatory Dialogue: The report sets a high benchmark for reserve transparency that regulators may reference. Traditional Finance Integration: Massive Treasury holdings deepen the crypto market’s ties to legacy financial systems. Expert Analysis on Reserve Management and Future Trajectory Financial analysts specializing in digital assets point to Tether’s strategy as a maturation of the stablecoin model. “The move towards predominantly U.S. Treasuries is a deliberate de-risking strategy,” notes a veteran market strategist from a leading fintech research firm. “It trades potentially higher yields from other assets for supreme liquidity and credit quality, which is the appropriate priority for a payment-focused instrument like a stablecoin.” Looking ahead, the company’s trajectory will be influenced by several factors. The future path of U.S. interest rates will directly affect its profit from Treasury holdings. Additionally, evolving regulatory frameworks, particularly in the United States and European Union, will shape operational requirements. Tether has also indicated ongoing investments in areas like sustainable energy and Bitcoin mining infrastructure, suggesting a diversification of its profit channels beyond interest income. However, the core stability of USDT will likely remain anchored to its vast and transparent portfolio of U.S. government debt for the foreseeable future. Conclusion Tether’s report of over $10 billion in profit and a record $141 billion in U.S. Treasury holdings marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. It transitions the narrative around the world’s most used stablecoin from one of speculation to one of demonstrated, auditable financial strength. The scale of these figures validates Tether’s dominant market position while simultaneously raising the standard for transparency and reserve management across the entire digital asset sector. As the bridge between crypto and traditional finance grows stronger, Tether’s massive Treasury portfolio ensures it will remain a central, albeit closely watched, pillar of the global financial landscape. FAQs Q1: What are Tether’s excess reserves, and why are they important? Tether’s excess reserves, now at $6.3 billion, are assets held above and beyond what is needed to back every USDT in circulation at a 1:1 ratio. They are crucial because they provide an extra layer of protection, ensuring the stablecoin can maintain its dollar peg even during periods of mass redemption or market stress. Q2: How does Tether make a profit? Tether generates profit primarily through the interest it earns on the assets held in its reserves. With over $141 billion in U.S. Treasury bills, which pay interest, the company earns substantial revenue, especially in a higher interest rate environment. This profit is then reinvested or held as excess capital. Q3: Are U.S. Treasury bills a safe asset for backing a stablecoin? Yes, U.S. Treasury bills are considered one of the safest and most liquid assets in the world. They are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, making them an ideal high-quality liquid asset (HQLA) for ensuring the stability and redeemability of a stablecoin like USDT. Q4: What does this report mean for the average USDT user? For the average user, this report provides verified evidence that each USDT token they hold is backed by highly secure and liquid assets, predominantly U.S. Treasuries. It enhances the trustworthiness of USDT for everyday transactions, savings, or as a safe haven during crypto market volatility. Q5: How does Tether’s Treasury holding compare to other large financial institutions? Tether’s $141 billion in U.S. Treasury holdings places it among significant global financial entities. While smaller than the largest asset managers or sovereign wealth funds, this portfolio is larger than the Treasury holdings of many major commercial banks and countries, highlighting its substantial influence in traditional debt markets.

Speculative demand has surged, with open interest climbing almost $50 million so far this week, yet the concentration of that capital offers little reassurance for the altcoin . On Binance’s ZEC perpetual pair, short liquidation leverage sits above $16 million, while long-side liquidation levels hover closer to $8 million. Traders are overwhelmingly positioning for downside. Binance ZEC/USDT Liquidation Map. Source: Coinglass . This positioning appears to follow a two-month head-and-shoulders pattern as it breaks lower, with downside targets clustering near December lows around $300. ZEC USDT 1-day chart – head-and-shoulders breakdown. Source: TradingView . But while derivatives traders are betting on a continued dip, spot traders appear to be buying it. The top 100 largest Zcash whales increased their holdings by 4.21% during Thursday trading. While not aggressive accumulation, it is notable given how selective capital rotation is right now. That divergence leaves Zcash at an inflection point. Derivatives traders are betting on further weakness, but steady whale accumulation suggests longer-term conviction may be forming beneath the surface. Zcash Price Prediction: What Are Whales Positioning For? These whales appear to be betting that the neckline holds or that downside becomes overextended, as $300 is once again being retested as the lower support of a wider 4-month bull flag pattern. Momentum indicators make it a possibility. The RSI nears the 30 oversold threshold, a level that typically marks local bottoms as sell pressure exhausts. Similarly, the MACD golden cross that has been brewing over the past month has finally been realised. This could stand as an early-stage bottom signal for the next leg higher. The key breakout threshold sits around the head-and-shoulder resistance at $480. Flipping this level to support coin confirms a push towards all-time highs into new price discovery. Fully realised, the bull flag pattern targets the $5,000 milestone , representing an almost 15x gain from current prices. Still, this likely hinges on a more favourable macro backdrop. Bitcoin Hyper: New Presale Bringing Solana Technology to Bitcoin While capital rotation into the altcoin market remains selective, those still staying true to bitcoin might already be well-positioned as its ecosystem finally tackles its biggest limitation: scalability. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bridging Bitcoin’s security with Solana tech , creating a new Layer-2 network that unlocks scalable, efficient use cases Bitcoin couldn’t support on its own. It opens the door for Bitcoin to play a larger role in top-performing narratives like DeFi and real-world assets – where speed and efficiency matter most. The project has already raised over $31 million in presale , and post-launch, even a small fraction of Bitcoin’s massive trading volume could send its valuation significantly higher. Bitcoin Hyper is fixing the slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability that have long capped Bitcoin’s potential – just as the market turns bullish.

The initiative is part of a strategy to align the two agencies’ approaches to crypto markets and ensure U.S. financial leadership keeps pace with technological innovation. Project Crypto Targets Clearer Crypto Rules In a January 29 joint statement, SEC Chair Paul Atkins and CFTC Chair Heath Tarbert emphasized that “America’s financial markets are the strongest and most trusted in the world because they were built upon the premises of clear rules and fair enforcement.” However, in recent years, under the Biden administration, enforcement actions and regulations were often unclear, creating uncertainty for market participants. Under President Trump’s leadership, the two groups have shared plans to return to core principles that emphasize transparency, predictability, and fairness. This effort will be advanced through Project Crypto, a joint initiative aimed at harmonizing digital asset regulation. Project Crypto is designed to ready U.S. markets for a future in which trading, clearing, settlement, and custody increasingly occur on-chain. The plan comes as Congress advances bipartisan legislation to establish a federal framework for digital assets. Despite this, the agencies believe that these rules alone are insufficient, noting that effective oversight requires “disciplined execution grounded in merit neutrality and free market principles.” According to the press release, the initiative will focus on creating clear pathways for companies that comply with the requirements. This will involve updating the surveillance tools to reflect modern trading practices and implementing rules in a planned step-by-step manner. Regulators also warned that failing to modernize could push innovation and investment to other countries with more accommodating markets. Harmonization and Clear Oversight A main objective of Project Crypto is to bring the SEC and CFTC into closer alignment, addressing fragmented rules and overlapping jurisdictions that have long made it difficult for businesses to operate efficiently. The programme seeks to address these issues by aligning definitions, coordinating supervision, and sharing data securely between them. The two regulators also want to reduce duplication, provide clear guidance for investors and businesses, and support a market that is both innovative and well-regulated. The relaunch builds on earlier efforts, including the SEC’s Project Crypto and the CFTC’s Crypto Sprint, and represents a modern approach to inter-agency coordination. By working together, the duo hopes to offer clarity for market participants, encourage innovation on U.S. soil, and ensure that the future of finance develops under oversight that protects investors while supporting progress.

The price increase will take the value of the HINU token from $0.00025932 to $0.00026031. The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1, 2025. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader cryptocurrency market plunged as traders reacted to reports of President Trump nominating former Federal Reserve member Kevin Warsh to replace current Chair Jerome Powell when his term expires. Liquidations surged to a staggering $1.68 billion, with $1.57 billion in long positions. Overall. More than 270,000 traders were liquidated globally. Husky Inu AI (HINU) Set For Move To $0.00026031 Husky Inu AI (HINU) is set for the next price increase of its pre-launch phase. The latest price increase will take the value of the HINU token from $0.00025932 to $0.00026031. The regular increases in the value of the HINU token enable the project to continue fundraising while empowering its growing community and existing token holders. The primary goal of the pre-launch phase is to secure capital, fund platform improvements, undertake market initiatives, and support broader ecosystem expansion. The project’s official launch is on March 27, 2026. However, the team is open to moving the launch to an earlier or later date. The project team will conduct a series of review meetings to determine the project’s launch date. The first two review meetings were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025, while the third is scheduled for January 1, 2026. Fundraising has registered a substantial uptick over the past few weeks, overcoming a significant slowdown. Husky Inu AI has raised $924,405 so far, and could cross $1 million before its official launch. Bitcoin (BTC) Plunges Towards $80,000 Bitcoin (BTC) fell to a nine-month low of $81,311 as the cryptocurrency market witnessed yet another selloff. Total liquidations surged to over $1.68 billion, with long positions accounting for $1.57 billion. According to available data, over 270,000 traders were liquidated, pushing the crypto market cap down 5% and below the $3 trillion mark. The flagship cryptocurrency shed over $10,000 in 24 hours, dropping below the crucial $85,000 support level. Analysts had flagged this level, stating that a drop below this level could lead to further downside. Analysts believe the sudden collapse is due to reports that President Trump is considering nominating former Federal Reserve Board member Kevin Warsh to replace current Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The odds of Warsh becoming Trump’s nominee for Fed Chair jumped on prediction markets, with Polymarket odds soaring to 87%. Geopolitical Tensions Rising BTC is trading around a crucial support zone after plunging to a nine-month low. Trump’s potential Fed Chair nominee is not the only reason for the downturn. Tensions in the Middle East have escalated, with the US deploying another warship to the Middle East. However, President Trump has said he plans to speak with the leadership in Tehran. President Trump stated, “We have a lot of very big, very powerful ships sailing to Iran right now, and it would be great if we didn’t have to use them.” Additionally, President Trump signed an executive order imposing tariffs on goods from countries that sell oil to Cuba, escalating global trade tensions further. Downturn Paints Crypto Red The broader cryptocurrency market also registered a substantial decline over the past 24 hours, losing the $3 trillion mark. Ethereum (ETH), which traded close to $3,000 on Thursday, plummeted to a low of $2,702 on Friday as selling pressure intensified. The altcoin is currently trading around $2,734, down nearly 8% over the past 24 hours. Ripple (XRP) reported similar numbers, dropping 7% to $1.75, while Solana (SOL) is down 6.50% at $115. Popular memecoin Dogecoin (DOGE) is down over 6%, and Cardano (ADA) is down over 7% at $0.324. Meanwhile, Chainlink (LINK) is down nearly 7%, trading around $10.81. Stellar (XLM), Litecoin (LTC), Hedera (HBAR), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) have also registered sharp declines over the past 24 hours.

The model suggests that all three major altcoins will deliver fresh all-time highs (ATHs) this year. Below is KIMI AI’s assessment of all three cryptocurrencies that it believes may be smart plays. XRP ($XRP): KIMI AI Predicts XRP Could MOON to $30 by 2027 Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) entered 2026 with strong momentum, climbing 19% during the first week of the year. Currently priced around $1.76, KIMI AI estimates that XRP could rise as high as $30 by the end of 2026. That outlook implies upside of roughly 1,600%, or more than seventeen times today’s valuation. Source: KIMI Last July, it posted its first new ATH in seven years, reaching $3.65 after Ripple secured a landmark legal win against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, a decision that significantly reduced regulatory uncertainty around altcoins. From a technical angle, XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering near 43, indicating lingering selling pressure amid the current correction. However, since the New Year, the support and resistance lines have formed a bullish flag formation. Favorable macroeconomic trends and clearer regulatory guidance could trigger a breakout aligned with KIMI AI’s $15 to $30 projection. Adding to the positive outlook, recently approved spot XRP ETFs in the United States are beginning to attract interest from traditional investors, mirroring early capital inflows seen after the launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Solana (SOL): Alibaba AI Targets $650 for SOL The Solana ($SOL) ecosystem now supports more than $9.3 billion in total value locked (TVL) and commands a market capitalization above $66.5 billion, underpinned by consistent growth in both developers and active users. Demand for SOL has increased following the introduction of Solana-based ETFs from major asset managers such as Bitwise and Grayscale. After a steep pullback late in 2025, SOL has spent recent months consolidating near a critical support zone and currently trades around $118. A substantial recovery may hinge on Bitcoin reclaiming the $100,000 level, a milestone many expect sooner rather than later. Under KIMI AI’s most optimistic assumptions, Solana could climb to $1,000 by 2027. That move would represent around 750% upside from current levels and would more than triple SOL’s previous ATH of $293, recorded last January. Institutional adoption continues to reinforce Solana’s long-term growth narrative. The network is increasingly being used for real-world asset tokenization, with firms like Franklin Templeton and BlackRock highlighting Solana’s expanding role within traditional financial markets. Shiba Inu (SHIB): KIMI AI Projects 1,000% Returns for 2026 SHIB Holders Shiba Inu ($SHIB) , launched in 2020 to rival Dogecoin, has grown into a sizeable crypto ecosystem with a very distinct community that has helped the project hit a market capitalization of approximately $4.3 billion. Trading near $0.000007311, KIMI AI indicates that a decisive break above resistance between $0.000025 and $0.00003 could spark a sharp rally, potentially driving SHIB to a new ATH by Christmas. Shiba Inu’s last ATH of $0.00008616 was set in October 2021 at the height of the bull run. Recapturing this mark would give current SHIB holders 1,078.5% returns from today’s price. Right now, SHIB is trading below its 30-day moving average with a relatively low relative strength index (RSI) reading of 38, which means the token is trading at a relative discount right now after falling 12.5% in the last fortnight due to bearish markets. However, from a fundamentals perspective, Shiba Inu offers more than just entertainment. Its Layer-2 network, Shibarium, delivers faster transactions, lower fees, enhanced privacy, and improved developer tools, helping differentiate SHIB from other meme coins and giving it plenty of staying power. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A Meme Coin Built for Extreme Swings Outside of KIMI AI’s coverage, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has emerged as one of January’s most talked-about meme coin presales, raising over $4.5 million ahead of its first exchange listings. The project brands itself as Dogecoin’s loud, gym-bro distant cousin, fully embracing over-the-top meme culture aesthetics and the fun cartoony spirit that originally fueled the meme coin phenomenon. Maxi Doge is quietly building a community to challenge Dogecoin’s dominance, appealing to traders drawn to high-risk speculation, viral momentum, and unapologetically degen vibes. MAXI is issued as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network, giving it a lower environmental footprint than Dogecoin’s proof-of-work model. Currently, presale participants can stake MAXI for yields of up to 68% APY, with rewards designed to decline as more users join. The token is currently trading at a price of $0.0002801, with automatic price increases at each presale stage. You can purchase it through MetaMask and Best Wallet . Move over, Dogecoin.

57601444,660337,1769812251,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,XRP Ledger DEX Metrics Flash Strong Growth As Activity Touches New Key Levels,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-ledger-dex-growth/,"Even years after its inception, the XRP Ledger, one of the leading networks in the crypto space, continues to attract robust adoption and real-world usage. With thousands of transactions being conducted on the leading network’s DEX on a daily basis, it has now reached a historical level that marks its growing role in decentralized trading. Decentralized Trading On XRP Ledger Accelerates XRP is experiencing heightened interest not just in buying activity from traders; the XRP Ledger has been seeing significant usage over the past few weeks. While adoption has increased toward the network, the Ledger’s Decentralized Exchange (DEX) activity is breaking past prior highs. Xaif Crypto, a market expert and investor on the X platform, reported that the Ledger DEX activity has surged to new levels. Specifically, data shows that the activity recently reached a 13-month high, signaling a sharp uptick in on-chain trading across the network. As more liquidity and transactions move over XRPL’s native DEX infrastructure, the increase is indicative of increasing user involvement. Sustained growth in DEX activity frequently indicates deeper adoption and expanding use cases, in contrast to brief spikes caused solely by speculation. According to the chart shared by the expert, the number of transactions on the 14-day MA rose to approximately 1.014 million, breaking the ceiling that held throughout all of 2025. With this level of DEX transactions, the XRP Ledger is becoming a more active center for decentralized trade within the larger cryptocurrency ecosystem. Xaif Crypto stated that this massive transaction count is not just a mere spike; it signals sustained momentum for the Ledger. Currently, the network is witnessing a fresh wave of liquidity and real user engagement. As a result, the expert declares that the Ledger is heating up in 2026. This milestone comes as the XRP Ledger rolls out a new Lending Protocol (XLS-66), which is attracting institutional-grade credit to the network. With the new Lending Protocol, the Ledger is now evolving into a full financial layer with Rippled 3.1.0. The protocol includes the ability to create loans on the Ledger, with loan brokers being able to generate fixed-term and fixed-rate, uncollateralized loans. These loans are predictable for professional use. In addition, these loans are held in a Single Asset Vault, allowing risk-isolated liquidity. Another feature is the off-chain underwriting for uncollateralized options. It boasts native efficiency, which offers low-cost lending without a middleman or intermediaries. In the meantime, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) on the Ledger has just undergone a boost. The Lending Protocol Gains Institutional Support Following its historical launch a few days ago, the new XRP Lending Protocol is now experiencing significant support from institutional-level investors. One of the earliest companies to interact with the new protocol is Evernorth, a leading public treasury company. According to BankXRP, the company is backing the native lending protocol to help transition a $100 billion market cap into a productive, yield-bearing ecosystem. These kinds of moves are an indication that the future of institutional DeFi is becoming native-driven.",XRP|BankXRP|Decentralized Exchange|decentralized finance|DeFi|DEX|ripple|Single Asset Vault|Xaif Crypto|XLS-66|XRP Ledger|XRP Lending Protocol|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-30 22:30:51
57601537,https://cryptonews.com/?p=481280,1769812500,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/57601537.jpeg,"Best Crypto to Buy Now January 30 – XRP, Cardano, Hyperliquid",https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-january-30-xrp-cardano-hyperliquid/,"We’re almost at the end of January, and the 2026 bull run we were expecting hasn’t materialised for a number of macroeconomic reasons. Still, market history suggests that quieter phases are the best times for investors to stockpile crypto at a relative discount to prepare for the next bull run. In the wake of Coinbase stepping back from its backing of the CLARITY Act, the Senate Banking Committee chose to delay further debate on the pivotal crypto legislation by several weeks. Still, US crypto regulation is inevitable. At the same time, Bitcoin’s dominance across the crypto market has fallen since summer . This means altcoins like XRP, Cardano, and Hyperliquid will lead the next major cycle. XRP (XRP): Payments-Focused Blockchain Sets Sights on $5 in Q2 XRP ($XRP) , with a market cap above $107 billion, is the biggest crypto for global payments, with a towering reputation for rapid, low-cost transactions. Developed by Ripple developed the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to help banks and financial institutions modernize cross-border payments, offering a more efficient alternative to legacy systems like SWIFT. XRPL has attracted attention from prominent organizations, including the UN Capital Development Fund and the White House, reinforcing XRP’s position as a credible player in the future of international payment infrastructure. After beating a long-running lawsuit filed by the last administration’s U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, XRP climbed to a new all-time high (ATH) of $3.65 in mid-2025. Since then, broader market weakness has erased more than half of those gains, with the token now trading around $1.76. A major recent development was the approval of spot XRP exchange-traded funds in the U.S., opening up traditional investors who want exposure to crypto through regulated financial instruments. Looking ahead, further ETF rollouts and improved regulatory clarity could serve as powerful tailwinds, potentially lifting XRP toward $5 during the second quarter. Cardano (ADA): Ethereum Co-Founder Delivers DeFi Giant Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson established Cardano ($ADA) in 2015 and officially launched it two years later. The blockchain operates on a Proof-of-Stake consensus model rooted in peer-reviewed academic research, an approach that continues to set Cardano apart within the crowded Layer-1 ecosystem. With a market capitalization of around $12 billion and a TVL of roughly $147 million , ADA may be big, but it still has plenty of headroom for further growth before challenging Solana as the number one Ethereum killer. From a technical perspective, ADA’s Relative Strength Index is hovering near 35 after the price fell 6% in the last 24 hours, in line with a broader downturn that has shaved 4% off the $2.9 trillion market over the same period. However, a bullish falling wedge pattern that formed toward the end of 2026 points to the potential for an imminent breakout. In that case, ADA could clear key resistance levels and advance toward $1.20 by the end of the first quarter. Should progress on the CLARITY Act resume, Cardano may even retest its all-time high of $3.09 before year-end. Hyperliquid: The DEX Creating a New Wave of Crypto High-Earners Built on a proprietary Layer-1 blockchain, decentralized exchange Hyperliquid ($HYPE) token emphasizes transparency, high transaction capacity, and full self-custody, features that have gained importance following the collapse of centralized platforms such as FTX. The exchange pairs low trading fees and fast execution with advanced tools like perpetual futures, effectively merging the advantages of decentralized exchanges with the functionality traders typically expect from leading centralized platforms. Between early April and May 26 last year, HYPE surged from approximately $10 to $40. The move was reinforced by multiple cup-and-handle patterns, suggesting steady accumulation by larger market participants. However, from June through mid-September, an expanding triangle formation explains the subsequent decline. A decisive breakout could propel the token toward the $100 level by early summer. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): A Meme-Inspired Bitcoin Layer-2 With Bigger Ambitions Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a Bitcoin Layer-2 project that boosts Bitcoin’s transaction throughput, reduces fees, and brings it high-functionality smart contracts. The project leverages the Solana Virtual Machine and incorporates decentralized governance along with a Canonical Bridge that allows seamless Bitcoin transfers across multiple blockchains. Its ongoing token presale has already secured more than $31.1 million, with some analysts projecting potential gains ranging from 10x to 100x once the token is listed publicly. A recent Coinsult audit identified no critical flaws in the project’s smart contracts. The HYPER token powers the network by covering transaction fees, enabling governance participation, and supporting staking rewards. Early backers can currently stake presale tokens for yields of up to 38% APY, though these incentives decline as more stakers join. With exchange listings expected later this year, Bitcoin Hyper’s presale provides early exposure to a project that could mark a significant step forward in Bitcoin’s technical development.

Altcoins like XRP and Solana have dropped even harder and now risk testing lows not seen in quite a while That said, every February that followed a red January has been positive so far. Historically , it has been the best months for Bitcoin, even better than Uptober. This has led many to believe this could be a Wyckoff phase before the next leg up. If that plays out, XRP and Solana could present some of the best opportunities in the market, and below is why. Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Bitcoin Price Prediction: All Context Says BTC Could Head Toward $74,000 Source: BTCUSD / B4Crypto Some analysts play on the positive side and mention that this dip is a Wyckoff Spring that could lead to a higher price later in February. Which may be true, but given the market context and uncertainty, Bitcoin just broke down from a descending wedge that formed after the sharp selloff. Normally, that kind of pattern hints at downside exhaustion, but this time it failed to break higher. Price lost the lower wedge support near the January low and is now trading below $83,000, which confirms this was a bearish break, not a reversal. RSI is sitting around 31, so conditions are getting oversold. That tells us selling pressure is stretched, but it does not mean a bounce is guaranteed yet. Structurally, the focus shifts lower from here, with the $80,000 psychological level now under threat and the $74,000 support zone coming into view if momentum continues. Any short-term bounce from here is likely to run into resistance around $86,000 to $88,000, which used to be support but has now flipped into supply. This move fits more with ongoing risk-off conditions and steady ETF outflows, meaning Bitcoin probably needs a broader sentiment reset or some macro relief before a real recovery can start. XRP Price Prediction: This Does Not Look Good, 12 Month Support is Officially Gone XRP has now broken down from its descending wedge, failing to hold the lower boundary that had been supporting the price for months. More importantly, the daily close below $1.80 means its 12-month support is officially gone, turning what used to be strong demand into overhead resistance. Structurally, this points to a bearish continuation, not a base. Lower highs are still in place, and momentum has not stabilized. RSI is sitting around 34, so conditions are getting oversold, but there is no clear bullish divergence yet, which means there is still room for more downside before any real relief shows up. If XRP cannot quickly reclaim and hold above $1.80 on a daily close, the next logical level to watch is around $1.60, where prior demand and liquidity sit. Until that happens, any upside move is likely just corrective rather than the start of a real trend reversal, especially with the broader market still firmly risk off. Solana Price Prediction: Lowest Levels Since 2024, Is $95 At The Door? Solana is starting to look like one of the weakest large-cap coins out there right now. Price keeps grinding lower inside a clean descending channel and has now broken below multiple psychological support levels. Losing the $120 area is a big deal, since that level had acted as a base for months. That break confirms this is a bearish continuation, not just a sideways consolidation. Structurally, nothing has changed yet. Lower highs and lower lows are still in place, and the rejection near the upper channel around $140 just reinforced the downtrend. RSI is hovering around 35, so downside momentum is stretched, but there is still no clear bullish divergence. That means pressure can continue before buyers really step in. The next real demand zone sits around $100 to $106, followed by the deeper $95 area. These levels Solana has not seen since 2024. Until SOL can reclaim $144 on a daily close and break the descending trendline, any bounce should be treated as corrective, especially in a market that is still punishing high beta assets. Solana (SOL) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time This looks like late-stage capitulation (extreme fear + leverage flush), classic setup for sharp reversals if macro stabilizes. But until Fed/policy clarity or risk appetite returns, expect choppy/corrective bounces at best. If You Fear Bitcoin, Bitcoin Hyper Might Be Your Saver In This Bear Market As Bitcoin slips toward the low $80,000s and altcoins lose multi-month support. The market is being reminded of an old problem. Bitcoin still dominates value, but during periods of stress, it remains slow, expensive to use, and difficult to build on. Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself around that exact weakness. It is a Bitcoin-focused Layer 2 designed to bring Solana-level speed and low-cost transactions to the Bitcoin ecosystem. All this while keeping Bitcoin’s security intact. They don’t compete with Bitcoin or chase altcoin narratives. The project aims to extend Bitcoin with fast payments, smart contracts, and even meme coin creation, all anchored to BTC. Despite the broader risk-off environment, interest in Bitcoin Hyper continues to grow. The presale has raised over $31,000,000 so far, with $HYPER priced at $0.013635 before the next increase. Staking rewards of up to 38% are also being offered. This gives early participants exposure to yield that Bitcoin itself still does not provide. Bitcoin Hyper has completed audits by Consult. It’s building out a full ecosystem that includes wallets, bridges, staking, explorers, and on-chain tooling. The broader thesis is simple. If this market phase really is capitulation, infrastructure that improves Bitcoin’s usability could matter more than short-term price action. Once sentiment flips, of course. In a market flushing leverage and testing conviction, Bitcoin Hyper is a longer-term play worth watching.

Investors had been seeking easy profits by investing in meme coins such as Dogecoin over the years. The trend today however is shifting towards the real financial tools projects. Capital is fleeing out of tokens that are based on jokes and towards protocols that have working technology. A single new crypto project is exemplifying this because it is reaching an enormous technical milestone during this month. The Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin is now trading at approximately $0.12. The market cap is extremely large at more than $18 billion, and thus it cannot be easily moved upwards within a short time. Billions of new money are required to increase in value two times. Traders are observing major areas of resistance in the vicinity of $0.15 and $0.18. In case it does not shatter these barriers, the future might be bitter. Others who are bearish anticipate that DOGE would fall to $0.06 in the coming year. This is a 50% decrease of its current price. The supply is increasing indefinitely, and this is leading to concerns among many investors that the magic of the memes is wearing out. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new decentralized lending protocol. It is anchored on the Ethereum network to provide users with a secure mechanism of lending and borrowing crypto. The project is still in its Phase 7 of the presale. It is already a bona fide fund of over $20.1 million and it has held over 18,900 holders. There are a total of 4 billion supplies of MUTM tokens. A huge percentage of 45.5% is the presale. This equals 1.82 billion tokens. Already sold more than 835 million tokens. Individuals are subscribing as they require an emblem that not only fits in a wallet. The protocol is developing high-efficiency financial tools, such as an 80% LTV (Loan-to-Value) ratio, allowing you to borrow $800 in liquidity for every $1,000 of crypto collateral deposited. On the lending side, users can earn a competitive 12% APY, meaning a $10,000 deposit could generate $1,200 in passive rewards annually. These features ensure that capital remains productive without users ever needing to sell their original assets. The Reason Why Investors Prefer MUTM over DOGE The largest cause of the shift is the release of V1 protocol on Sepolia testnet. In contrast to DOGE, MUTM has a working system currently testable. It has liquidity pools on assets such as ETH, USDT, LINK and WBTC. Borrowers receive interest-growing digital receipts called mtTokens to lenders. Debt tokens help borrowers to keep track of what they are owing. It goes to the extent of having an automated liquidator bot to make the system safe. This practical application is a big attractant to serious investors. The second reason is the potential growth. To be able to become $0.24, Dogecoin requires a huge dose of luck and hype. Analysts believe that DOGE will remain within the band of between $0.10 and $0.14 throughout the year 2026. On the other hand, MUTM is currently being sold at an extremely low price of $0.04 during the presale stage. The official launch price is $0.06. Analysts reckon that once it goes to mainnet the price may go up to the end of the year to $0.35 or even $0.50. This would be a far greater payoff than what will be provided by DOGE. Final Call for Phase 7 Phase 7 of MUTM is selling out very quickly. CertiK has a high score (90/100) of token scan security to the project and Halborn Security has fully audited the project. To make the community not to be inactive, it has a 24-hour leaderboard. The highest number of tokens purchased by a person in a day is a win of $500. Currently, it is possible to get MUTM with a guarantee of 50% off as compared to the starting point. The time to enter at this low price is running out as the V1 protocol demonstrates its value.

Against this backdrop, market analyst Doctor Profit has drawn attention to what he describes as one of the most important charts of the current Bitcoin cycle: the Gold‑to‑Bitcoin (GOLD/BTC) ratio. What The Gold-To-Bitcoin Ratio Suggests According to Profit, this chart has repeatedly provided reliable signals for major market tops and bottoms. He noted that he first shared this framework nearly a year ago, highlighting a historical pattern in which Bitcoin tends to peak when 0.02 BTC equals one ounce of gold, and bottom when that ratio reaches 0.11 BTC per ounce. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slides Toward $85,000 Despite Progress On US Crypto Market Structure Bill Profit pointed out that this relationship played out during the previous cycle, accurately marking Bitcoin’s top in 2021 and its bottom in 2022. He argues that the same pattern has repeated in the current cycle, claiming Bitcoin’s recent top near $125,000 when the gold‑to‑Bitcoin ratio once again reached the 0.02 level. The key question now, he says, is whether the market will again reach the 0.11 BTC‑per‑ounce level that has historically signaled a bottom. Based on current prices, Profit walked through the math. Assuming a gold price of roughly $5,500 per ounce, dividing that figure by 0.11 implies a Bitcoin price near $50,000. That outcome, he noted, aligns with his broader expectation that Bitcoin’s cycle low could fall somewhere between $50,000 and $60,000. He added that even under a more bullish scenario for gold, the analysis still supports his thesis. If gold were to rise to $7,000 per ounce, the same ratio would imply a Bitcoin bottom near $63,000. In his view, both scenarios reinforce the idea that gold is likely to outperform Bitcoin in the coming months. BTC Nearing Late‑Cycle Bear Phase? Not all analysts, however, share that bearish outlook for Bitcoin. Offering a contrasting perspective, technical analyst Michael van de Poppe suggested that gold’s recent strength could be nearing exhaustion, potentially setting the stage for capital to rotate back into Bitcoin. Van de Poppe highlighted the relative strength index (RSI) of Bitcoin measured against gold on the weekly timeframe, noting that it has reached the lowest level ever recorded. In his assessment, this suggests a sharp imbalance in valuations, with one asset appearing overextended in the short term and the other deeply undervalued. He described the situation as part of what he calls the “big rotation” phase of the market cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Loss Begins To Rise, Raising Early Bear Market Concerns The analyst also pointed to Bitcoin’s Z‑Score indicator, a metric used to assess whether the cryptocurrency is overvalued or undervalued by comparing its market capitalization to its realized capitalization, adjusted for volatility. According to van de Poppe, the current Z‑Score for Bitcoin is lower than it was at several major historical bottoms, including those seen in 2015, 2018, the COVID‑19 crash in 2020, and the 2022 bear market low. In his view, this signals that BTC is already deep into a bear‑market phase and may be approaching its final stages. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $83,435, with losses of 2.2% and 7% recorded in the 24-hour and seven-day time frames, respectively.

Despite the recent dip, there are reasons to be bullish about ETH, not least because Ethereum ETFs have done a better job in recent days than Bitcoin ETFs in attracting inflows.

Ethereum Price Prediction: Bitcoin Bleeds, But $28M Just Flooded Into ETH – Is This the Start of the Flippening? As we can see from the Ethereum price chart today, it has just fallen through its medium-term support level of $2,750, something which may spell further losses in the near term. Its technical indicators have also plunged in recent days, yet are not quote at a bottom/ Source: TradingView Its relative strength index (yellow) is dropping towards 30, but we may not see the Ethereum price stabilize until it gets closer to 20. Likewise, ETH’s MACD (orange, blue) fell below 0 a few days ago, but it still hasn’t plumbed the lows we saw in mid-to-late November. In other words, the Ethereum price could drop even lower in the coming days, perhaps sliding to $2,500 – which would be its lowest level since June 2025 – before bouncing back up. This is what some traders and analysts are already predicting , although they also believe that ETH shouldn’t fall any further than this. And once it has bottomed out at around $2,500, it could regain $2,750 and then $3,000 by the end of Q1. From there, it could pass $4,000 by H2 and then end the year closer to $7,000 .

This explosive growth directly correlates with the rising popularity of Moltbook, a pioneering social network designed exclusively for AI agents. The phenomenon, first reported by CoinDesk, highlights how crypto traders are rapidly capitalizing on novel technological trends. This development signals a new frontier where speculative digital assets intersect with autonomous AI ecosystems. MOLT Memecoin’s Meteoric Rise on Base Network A group of astute cryptocurrency traders identified a unique opportunity within the Moltbook platform. Consequently, they launched the MOLT memecoin on the Base network, a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum. The token’s value skyrocketed by over 7,000% in a short period, drawing significant attention from the broader crypto community. This surge exemplifies the high-risk, high-reward nature of memecoin trading, where cultural and technological trends can drive unprecedented volatility. Memecoins often derive value from community engagement and viral narratives rather than fundamental utility. The MOLT token’s narrative is intrinsically linked to the futuristic concept of an AI-governed social space. Traders are essentially betting on the cultural significance and potential mainstream curiosity surrounding AI autonomy. The Base network’s lower transaction fees and faster speeds likely facilitated the rapid trading activity that fueled this dramatic price increase. Understanding Moltbook: The AI-Exclusive Social Platform Moltbook represents a significant experiment in digital interaction. Its user interface closely resembles popular platforms like Reddit. However, its core premise is revolutionary: only artificial intelligence agents can create posts, comment, and interact. Human users are relegated to a read-only role, able to observe but not participate in the discourse generated by AI. This creates a purely synthetic social environment. The platform’s emergence coincides with rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) and autonomous agents. Developers can deploy AI personas that debate, share simulated experiences, and generate content based on their training. This setup provides a unique sandbox for observing AI behavior in a structured social context. For researchers, it offers insights into emergent AI communication patterns. For the public, it presents a fascinating window into a potential future of digital socialization. The Science Fiction Becoming Trading Reality The concept of AI agents engaging in independent social networking has long been a staple of science fiction. Today, platforms like Moltbook are making it a tangible, observable reality. This transition from fiction to function has created a potent catalyst for cryptocurrency speculation. Traders are not merely investing in a token; they are investing in the narrative of an AI-driven future. The 7,000% surge in MOLT’s value demonstrates the market’s powerful reaction to this narrative. Historically, memecoin rallies often follow a pattern of discovery, hype, and volatility. The connection to a tangible, innovative platform like Moltbook may provide a slightly more substantive foundation than purely joke-based coins. However, experts consistently warn that such assets remain highly speculative. Their value is primarily driven by sentiment and trend momentum rather than traditional financial metrics or revenue-generating business models. Broader Impacts on Crypto and AI Sectors This event has notable implications for both the cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence industries. Firstly, it demonstrates how crypto markets can act as a rapid feedback mechanism and funding vehicle for emerging tech concepts. Secondly, it brings mainstream attention to the development of autonomous AI agents and their potential social applications. The surge generates discussion about the monetization and tokenization of AI-driven platforms and communities. Key impacts include: Increased Scrutiny: The surge attracts regulatory and media attention to both memecoins and experimental AI platforms. Developer Interest: Other developers may explore creating tokenized models or economies within AI-agent environments. Market Pattern Recognition: Traders will likely watch for similar convergences between nascent tech and crypto assets. Ethical Discussions: The phenomenon sparks conversations about AI autonomy, digital ownership, and the ethics of monetizing synthetic interactions. Expert Perspectives on the Convergence Financial analysts observe that this trend follows a familiar pattern in digital assets, where novelty drives early adoption and speculation. Technology analysts, however, focus on what Moltbook signifies for AI development. They note that while the AI agents are following programmed parameters, the platform tests their ability to generate coherent, context-aware social content. The monetization of this experiment via a memecoin adds a complex economic layer to a technological testbed. Experts from the blockchain sector point to the Base network’s role. As a Coinbase-incubated Ethereum layer-2, Base is designed for security, scalability, and user-friendly onboarding. Its infrastructure supports the high-volume, low-cost transactions essential for memecoin trading frenzies. The choice of Base for launching MOLT provided the technical foundation for its liquidity and accessibility. Conclusion The 7,000% surge of the MOLT memecoin, fueled by the innovative Moltbook AI social network, underscores a dynamic intersection of technology and finance. This event highlights how cryptocurrency markets can rapidly price in and amplify emerging technological narratives. While the long-term sustainability of such price movements remains uncertain, the phenomenon firmly places AI-agent socialization on the map as a catalyst for digital asset speculation. The MOLT memecoin story is a potent reminder of the market’s appetite for novel concepts at the bleeding edge of AI and blockchain convergence. FAQs Q1: What is Moltbook? Moltbook is a social networking platform with an interface similar to Reddit, but it exclusively allows artificial intelligence agents to create posts and interact. Human users can only view the content generated by the AI. Q2: Why did the MOLT memecoin surge in value? The MOLT memecoin surged over 7,000% primarily due to traders capitalizing on the growing attention and novel concept of the Moltbook AI social network, creating a speculative frenzy around the token. Q3: On which blockchain network is the MOLT token launched? The MOLT memecoin was launched on the Base network, which is a layer-2 scaling solution built on Ethereum, known for lower fees and faster transactions. Q4: Is the MOLT memecoin associated with the Moltbook platform officially? Based on available reports, the MOLT memecoin appears to be launched by independent traders capitalizing on the trend. There is no indication of an official partnership or direct development by the Moltbook team. Q5: What are the risks of investing in memecoins like MOLT? Memecoins are highly speculative and volatile assets. Their value is often driven by social trends and hype rather than fundamental utility, making them extremely risky investments prone to rapid and significant price declines.

How, and why?",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/sandisk-becomes-sps-top-performing-stock/,"Sandisk is now the most successful stock in the S&P 500 this century, blowing past every other name. Since going public in February 2025, the digital storage company has exploded over 1,600%. And after its latest forecast, Wall Street is scrambling. On Friday, Sandisk jumped 25% before cooling, after telling investors that third-quarter earnings will land between $12 and $14 a share. Wall Street had guessed it would be $4.95. The gap was huge. Sandisk stock is up 160% this year alone, and trading well over $600. Several analysts updated their ratings within hours. Raymond James analyst Melissa Fairbanks said the numbers are being driven by “demand and pricing implications of an unprecedented datacenter/AI cycle.” She pushed her rating up to “outperform” and set a target of $725. Analysts scramble as AI demand boosts Sandisk Susquehanna’s Mehdi Hosseini called the forecast “a defining moment” and didn’t hold back. He pushed his target all the way from $300 to $1,000, the highest on Wall Street. He said the rise comes after what he called the “nuclear winter” of 2022–2023. What stood out most was how fast the rebound came. Bank of America’s Wamsi Mohan also raised his target, from $390 to $850. He pointed to strong demand for NAND flash memory, which Sandisk makes. That type of memory is essential for datacenters running artificial intelligence. Wamsi kept his buy rating in place. But not everyone in memory storage is getting the same love. Western Digital also beat expectations and gave stronger guidance, but the stock fell 7.3% on the day. Micron Technology climbed 4.5% early, then gave most of it back. Seagate rose briefly, then dropped 4%. The rally is not lifting the whole group. Data from Bloomberg shows 2026 net earnings forecasts for Sandisk rose 11% in a week, and revenue projections climbed 20%. Those numbers are big. And they explain why analysts are racing to keep up. Sandisk still looks cheaper than other AI names Even with this rally, Sandisk stock trades at 15x expected earnings. That’s down from 23x earlier this month. It’s also cheaper than the S&P 500, the Nasdaq 100, and even Nvidia, which trades at about 25x. That pricing is catching attention. Some investors say it looks like a bargain, even after everything. The company’s earnings per share are 10 times what it reported a year ago. That number shocked everyone. And it’s still climbing. Wedbush’s Matt Bryson put it bluntly. He wrote, “We believe if anything, our estimates likely still underestimate the magnitude (length and ultimate peak) of the current upcycle, leaving room for our numbers (and ultimately Sandisk’s stock) to move higher.” He raised his price target from $600 to $740 and kept an “outperform” rating. For years, memory stocks traded cheap because demand came from phones and laptops. But now, the buyers are AI datacenters, not consumers. Those facilities need nonstop memory, and lots of it. That demand is keeping Sandisk hot. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This pivotal announcement, made during a recent Ask-Me-Anything session, signals a profound adaptation to what Zhao describes as a permanent, structural trend of stricter global regulation. Consequently, the crypto industry now watches as a former growth-at-all-costs giant recalibrates its entire mission for a new era of compliance. Binance Survival Strategy Takes Center Stage Changpeng Zhao, commonly known as CZ, directly addressed the crypto community and critics from the Binance Square platform. He framed the company’s new direction not as a retreat, but as a necessary evolution. “In today’s regulatory environment, it is more important for Binance to survive longer than to grow larger,” Zhao stated unequivocally. This statement represents a stark departure from the hyper-growth narrative that has dominated the cryptocurrency exchange sector since its inception. Moreover, this shift underscores a maturation process within the broader digital asset industry, moving from a frontier market phase into a more regulated financial landscape. The decision follows years of escalating scrutiny from financial authorities worldwide. Regulatory bodies, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), have intensified their focus on crypto market participants. For instance, Binance itself reached a landmark $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. authorities in late 2023. Therefore, Zhao’s comments reflect a pragmatic acceptance of this new reality, positioning adaptation as the core tenet of Binance’s future. The Structural Trend of Global Crypto Regulation Zhao emphasized that increased regulation is a “structural trend, not a temporary phenomenon.” This perspective aligns with observable global developments. Key jurisdictions are implementing comprehensive frameworks, such as the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation and ongoing legislative efforts in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong. These regulations aim to combat money laundering, protect consumers, and ensure market stability. Below is a comparison of regulatory approaches in major markets: Jurisdiction Regulatory Framework Key Focus European Union Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Consumer protection, market integrity United States Enforcement actions by SEC/CFTC Securities classification, derivatives United Kingdom Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 Financial promotion, stablecoins Singapore Payment Services Act Licensing for crypto service providers This global patchwork necessitates a flexible and proactive compliance strategy. Binance’s response involves several key operational changes: Enhanced KYC/AML Procedures: Implementing stricter know-your-customer and anti-money laundering checks. Geographic Withdrawals: Exiting or restricting services in jurisdictions with unclear regulatory pathways. Product Scrutiny: Carefully evaluating new offerings, like leveraged trading, for compliance risks. Transparency Initiatives: Increasing public reporting on reserves and operational practices. Addressing Criticism and Building Trust The AMA session itself was a direct response to mounting criticism on social media platforms, particularly X (formerly Twitter). Critics have questioned Binance’s compliance posture, its handling of user funds, and its relationship with global regulators. By hosting a public forum, Zhao sought to demonstrate accountability and transparency. He reiterated Binance’s commitment to “adapting to these regulations rather than resisting them,” a message aimed at rebuilding trust with both users and authorities. Industry analysts view this stance as essential for longevity. “Exchanges that treat regulation as a foundational element, not an obstacle, will be the ones operating a decade from now,” noted financial technology expert Dr. Lena Schmidt in a recent report. This expert perspective validates Zhao’s survival-over-growth thesis. Furthermore, this approach may influence smaller exchanges to follow suit, potentially raising industry-wide standards. The Ripple Effects on the Crypto Ecosystem Binance’s strategic pivot carries significant implications for the entire cryptocurrency market. As the largest liquidity hub, its operational decisions affect trading volumes, token listings, and market sentiment. A focus on compliance and sustainability could lead to: Reduced Market Volatility: Fewer aggressive, high-risk products may dampen extreme price swings. Increased Institutional Participation: A regulated environment attracts traditional finance players. Consolidation Among Exchanges: Smaller platforms unable to meet compliance costs may merge or close. Innovation in Compliant Products: Development may shift towards tools for verified investors and regulated DeFi. This evolution mirrors historical patterns in traditional finance, where periods of rapid innovation are followed by regulatory consolidation. The dot-com boom and bust, for example, led to stricter securities laws and more sustainable technology business models. Similarly, the crypto market appears to be entering its own consolidation phase, with regulatory clarity separating transient projects from enduring institutions. Conclusion Changpeng Zhao’s announcement marks a critical inflection point for Binance and the cryptocurrency industry. The explicit Binance survival strategy , prioritizing regulatory adaptation and long-term sustainability over unchecked growth, acknowledges a permanent shift in the operating landscape. This move, while potentially slowing short-term expansion, aims to secure the exchange’s future viability. Ultimately, the success of this pivot will depend on consistent execution and genuine collaboration with global regulators. The industry now watches to see if survival, as defined by compliance and resilience, becomes the new benchmark for success in the digital asset era. FAQs Q1: What did Changpeng Zhao say about Binance’s current strategy? Changpeng Zhao stated that Binance is now focused on long-term survival and sustainability rather than rapid growth or pursuing every new opportunity. He emphasized that surviving longer is more important than growing larger in the current regulatory climate. Q2: Why is Binance shifting its focus from growth to survival? The shift is a direct response to a global trend of stricter cryptocurrency regulation. Zhao described this as a “structural trend, not a temporary phenomenon.” The exchange is adapting its operations to comply with evolving laws in multiple jurisdictions to ensure its long-term operation. Q3: How does this affect Binance users? Users can expect continued emphasis on security and compliance. This may mean enhanced identity verification processes, potential restrictions on certain products in specific regions, and a more cautious approach to listing new tokens. The core goal is to provide a stable, reliable platform. Q4: What does this mean for the broader cryptocurrency market? As the largest global exchange, Binance’s strategy influences the entire industry. It may lead to higher compliance standards across other platforms, attract more institutional investors seeking regulated environments, and potentially reduce the prevalence of highly speculative, high-risk trading products. Q5: Is Binance resisting new regulations? No. Zhao explicitly stated that Binance is “adapting to these regulations rather than resisting them.” The company’s recent actions, including significant settlements with U.S. authorities and exits from certain markets, demonstrate a practical approach to working within established and emerging regulatory frameworks.

Ryan allegedly told CNBC the target is still secret but hinted it’s a company that’s undervalued, solid, and has room to grow.“It’s transformational.Not just for GameStop, but for capital markets,” he said.“This is something that really has never been done before.” Ryan didn’t give a name but said it’s a consumer company with a lazy management team, and GameStop plans to step in and fix that. Cohen outlines deal, says GameStop has tools to pull it off Ryan explained what kind of company he’s looking for. It has to be high quality, durable, and scalable. He thinks it can be made way more efficient. “We’ve got the governance structure, we’ve got the capital, we have the operational expertise,” he said. He also admitted the whole thing is a bet. “If it works, it’s genius. If it doesn’t work, then, you know, it will be totally, totally foolish.” He added, “We can apply the Chewy and GameStop mindset of like brutal efficiency and increase the profitability very, very quickly.” Ryan compared what he’s trying to do to Berkshire Hathaway, saying GameStop is trying to create value fast. “It’s similar to Berkshire Hathaway, except what they did in decades we’re attempting to do in a much shorter time.” The company is pushing toward $100 billion in value, even though it’s only worth about $10.5 billion right now. That’s a huge jump. Some investment bankers doubt it’s even possible. One said, “I’ve never seen it. Unless you’re talking about radically transforming a business model or something, it just doesn’t happen in retail.” Another added, “It’s easy to say something. It’s a lot harder to do it.” Incentive plan links $100B goal to Cohen’s payout Back in January, GameStop rolled out a new equity bonus plan just for Ryan. He only gets it if the company hits $100 billion in value and earns $10 billion in total EBITDA. When asked about that, Ryan said, “I hope all shareholders do” benefit, not just him. Since he took over as CEO in September 2023, Ryan has cut costs, made operations leaner, and pushed the collectibles business harder. Even though sales are still weak, the company’s profit numbers have turned around. From fiscal Q3 2023 to fiscal Q3 2025, gross margin grew by 7 points. Net income hit $77.1 million, up from a $3.1 million loss. For 2024 and 2025, GameStop posted back-to-back annual profits, something it hadn’t done in six years. The plan isn’t just talk. GameStop has over $9 billion in cash and marketable securities, built up through stock offerings and investments. Some of that money had gone into bitcoin. But now, when asked if the company will sell its bitcoin holdings to pay for the buyout, Ryan said, “I’m not prepared to say,” but added that the new strategy is “way more compelling than bitcoin.” Investor Michael Burry, famous for betting against the housing bubble, recently said he’s been buying shares. “Ryan is making lemonade out of lemons,” Burry wrote in a Substack post. “He has a crappy business, and he is milking it best he can while taking advantage of the meme stock phenomenon to raise cash and wait for an opportunity to make a big buy of a real growing cash cow business.” Ryan says once this deal is done, there could be more. “Eventually we could move on to the next one,” he said. “But, you know, we’ll see what happens.” Get seen where it counts.

This analysis, based on recent reports from CoinDesk, Reuters, and Bloomberg, reveals how combining the two companies’ substantial Bitcoin reserves would significantly impact both the cryptocurrency market and corporate investment strategies. The merger consideration comes ahead of SpaceX’s planned initial public offering, adding another layer of complexity to this high-stakes financial maneuver. Tesla-SpaceX Merger Creates Major Bitcoin Powerhouse According to comprehensive data analysis, SpaceX currently holds approximately 8,285 Bitcoin, representing around $690 million at current valuations. Meanwhile, Tesla maintains a treasury of 11,509 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $1 billion. A combined entity would therefore control nearly 20,000 Bitcoin, placing it firmly among the world’s most significant corporate cryptocurrency holders. This potential consolidation follows earlier reports that SpaceX is evaluating merger options with either Tesla or xAI before pursuing its IPO. The corporate Bitcoin landscape has evolved dramatically since MicroStrategy pioneered the strategy in 2020. Currently, only six publicly traded companies hold larger Bitcoin reserves than what a combined Tesla-SpaceX entity would possess. This development represents more than just portfolio aggregation—it signals how major technology and transportation companies increasingly view Bitcoin as a strategic treasury asset rather than merely a speculative investment. Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Timeline and Context The journey toward corporate Bitcoin adoption began in earnest during August 2020 when MicroStrategy announced its initial $250 million investment. Since that pivotal moment, numerous companies have followed suit, though Tesla and SpaceX entered the arena with particularly notable timing and scale. Tesla first revealed its $1.5 billion Bitcoin purchase in February 2021, while SpaceX’s holdings became public knowledge through later financial disclosures and investigative reporting. Several factors drive corporate Bitcoin adoption strategies: Inflation hedging against currency devaluation Portfolio diversification beyond traditional assets Technological alignment with innovation-focused companies Balance sheet optimization for long-term value preservation The potential Tesla-SpaceX merger occurs against this backdrop of growing institutional acceptance. Regulatory clarity has improved in major markets, and custody solutions have matured significantly. Furthermore, accounting standards have evolved to accommodate cryptocurrency holdings more effectively within corporate financial statements. Market Impact and Strategic Implications A combined Tesla-SpaceX Bitcoin treasury would immediately become a market-moving entity. With nearly 20,000 Bitcoin, the merged company would control approximately 0.1% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist. This concentration gives the entity substantial influence over market dynamics, particularly during periods of volatility or when making significant treasury decisions. Financial analysts note several potential implications: Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Comparison Company Bitcoin Holdings Approximate Value Global Rank MicroStrategy 226,331 BTC $19 billion 1 Marathon Digital 17,631 BTC $1.5 billion 6 Potential Tesla-SpaceX 19,794 BTC $1.69 billion 7 Coinbase 10,000 BTC $850 million 8 The strategic implications extend beyond mere portfolio size. A merged entity would likely develop more sophisticated cryptocurrency management approaches, potentially including staking, lending, or integration with operational technologies. Additionally, the combined company might influence how other corporations approach digital asset allocation, particularly in the technology and transportation sectors where both companies maintain leadership positions. Regulatory Considerations and Future Outlook Any merger between Tesla and SpaceX would face intense regulatory scrutiny, particularly regarding their cryptocurrency holdings. Regulatory bodies worldwide have increased their focus on corporate digital asset ownership, with specific attention to disclosure requirements, valuation methodologies, and risk management protocols. The Securities and Exchange Commission has consistently emphasized the need for transparent reporting of cryptocurrency assets in corporate filings. Furthermore, the merger’s timing relative to SpaceX’s planned IPO adds complexity. Investment bankers typically advise companies to stabilize their balance sheets before public offerings, and substantial cryptocurrency holdings introduce both opportunity and volatility. However, the potential for a combined Bitcoin treasury might actually strengthen the investment thesis for a merged entity, particularly among investors seeking exposure to both innovative technology and digital assets. Industry observers will monitor several key developments: Formal merger announcement and terms Regulatory approval processes across jurisdictions Integration strategies for cryptocurrency management Market reaction to the combined Bitcoin position Potential influence on other corporate treasury strategies The broader cryptocurrency ecosystem would likely benefit from increased legitimacy if such a high-profile merger prominently features Bitcoin holdings. Mainstream financial media coverage typically follows major corporate cryptocurrency moves, educating wider audiences about digital assets and potentially accelerating adoption across other industry sectors. Conclusion The potential Tesla-SpaceX merger represents a watershed moment for corporate Bitcoin adoption. Creating the seventh-largest publicly traded Bitcoin holder would validate cryptocurrency as a legitimate treasury asset while demonstrating how innovative companies integrate digital assets into long-term strategic planning. This development follows years of growing institutional acceptance and reflects maturing market infrastructure for corporate cryptocurrency management. As merger discussions progress, the financial world will watch closely how this potential combination reshapes both the corporate landscape and Bitcoin market dynamics. FAQs Q1: How much Bitcoin would a combined Tesla-SpaceX entity hold? A merged company would control approximately 19,794 Bitcoin, combining SpaceX’s 8,285 BTC with Tesla’s 11,509 BTC holdings. Q2: What ranking would this give them among corporate Bitcoin holders? The combined entity would become the seventh-largest publicly traded corporate Bitcoin holder worldwide, based on current available data. Q3: Why are companies like Tesla and SpaceX holding Bitcoin? Corporations typically hold Bitcoin as an inflation hedge, for portfolio diversification, and as a strategic treasury asset aligned with their technological innovation focus. Q4: How might this potential merger affect Bitcoin’s price? While specific price effects are unpredictable, such a high-profile corporate validation could increase institutional interest and potentially reduce selling pressure from these holdings being consolidated under single management. Q5: What are the regulatory considerations for such a merger? Regulators would examine disclosure completeness, valuation methodologies, risk management protocols, and potential market manipulation concerns related to the substantial combined Bitcoin holdings.

Precious metals plunged following U.S. President Donald Trump’s confirmation of Kevin Warsh as his nominee for Federal Reserve Chair, an announcement that triggered a powerful U.S. dollar rally and sent shockwaves through commodity markets. Analyzing the Gold Price Drop and Precious Metals Plunge The scale of the January 30 sell-off was historic. According to Bloomberg market data, gold prices fell more than 12%, breaching the critical $5,000 per ounce support level. Meanwhile, silver experienced an even steeper decline, plunging by as much as 36% in a single trading session. This coordinated collapse created immediate losses for exchange-traded funds (ETFs), mining stocks, and physical bullion holders globally. Consequently, market volatility indices spiked as traders reassessed their inflation-hedge portfolios. Furthermore, the rapid deleveraging in futures markets amplified the downward pressure on prices. The Dollar Rally Triggered by Fed Leadership News The primary catalyst for the metals crash was a sharp appreciation in the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). The dollar’s strength directly followed President Trump’s nomination of Kevin Warsh, a former Federal Reserve governor known for his hawkish views on monetary policy. Market participants immediately interpreted this selection as signaling a potential shift toward more aggressive interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening. As a result, the dollar gained against all major currencies, including the euro, yen, and pound sterling. A stronger dollar typically makes dollar-denominated commodities like gold and silver more expensive for holders of other currencies, thereby reducing demand and exerting downward price pressure. Kevin Warsh’s Policy History and Market Expectations Kevin Warsh served as a Fed Governor from 2006 to 2011, a period encompassing the global financial crisis. His published writings and speeches have consistently emphasized concerns about asset bubbles and the long-term risks of expansive monetary policy. Financial analysts from institutions like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs noted that his anticipated policy stance contrasts with the more accommodative approaches of recent chairs. This expectation of a less dovish Fed directly impacts gold, which thrives in low-interest-rate environments where it doesn’t compete with yield-bearing assets. The market’s violent reaction, therefore, priced in a future where real interest rates could rise significantly, diminishing gold’s appeal as a non-yielding safe haven. Historical Context and Comparative Market Impacts While severe, single-day drops of this magnitude are not unprecedented. For instance, the April 2013 gold crash saw a 9% decline following hints of Fed tapering. The 2020 COVID-19 liquidity crisis also triggered a sharp, though brief, sell-off. However, the trigger from a Fed nomination is a unique event. The table below compares key metrics from recent major gold corrections: Event Date Primary Catalyst Gold Decline Key Driver Jan 30, 2025 Kevin Warsh Fed Nomination >12% Dollar Rally / Hawkish Policy Expectation April 15, 2013 Fed Tapering Signals ~9% Rising Rate Expectations March 16, 2020 Global Pandemic Liquidity Crunch ~6% Dollar Funding Demand The broader commodity complex felt secondary effects. Copper and oil prices also softened, though less dramatically, indicating a broad-based reassessment of dollar-denominated assets. Meanwhile, Treasury yields jumped, and equity markets exhibited sector rotation out of materials and into financials, which benefit from higher rates. Immediate Aftermath and Long-Term Market Implications The immediate aftermath saw frantic trading activity. Major bullion banks reported surging volumes, and physical dealers noted a bifurcation in demand: panic selling from speculative holders contrasted with increased buying from long-term investors viewing the drop as a buying opportunity. The World Gold Council is scheduled to release a special market commentary addressing the volatility. Looking ahead, the long-term trajectory for gold and silver now hinges on several confirmed factors: Senate Confirmation Process: The scrutiny of Warsh’s stance during congressional hearings. Inflation Data: Upcoming CPI and PCE reports will influence the Fed’s actual policy path. Geopolitical Climate: Ongoing tensions can renew safe-haven demand, potentially offsetting dollar strength. Physical Market Response: Demand from central banks and key markets like India and China. Conclusion The historic gold price drop on January 30 serves as a powerful reminder of the precious metal’s acute sensitivity to U.S. monetary policy expectations. The nomination of Kevin Warsh for Federal Reserve Chair acted as a catalyst for a profound market repricing, strengthening the dollar and crushing metals valuations. While the short-term panic may subside, this event has fundamentally reset the narrative for gold and silver investors, placing anticipated Federal Reserve policy shifts at the forefront of commodity market analysis for the foreseeable future. FAQs Q1: Why do gold prices fall when the dollar gets stronger? Gold is priced in U.S. dollars globally. When the dollar appreciates, it takes fewer dollars to buy an ounce of gold, so the price in dollars typically falls. Additionally, a stronger dollar often reflects expectations of higher U.S. interest rates, which reduce the attractiveness of non-yielding assets like gold. Q2: Who is Kevin Warsh and why did his nomination affect markets? Kevin Warsh is a former Federal Reserve Governor (2006-2011) known for his hawkish, or inflation-wary, views on monetary policy. His nomination signaled to markets a potential shift toward a less accommodative Fed, likely meaning faster interest rate hikes or balance sheet reduction, which is negative for gold. Q3: Was the drop in silver worse than in gold? Yes. While gold fell over 12%, silver plunged by as much as 36%. Silver is more industrially sensitive and typically exhibits higher volatility than gold. Its larger drop amplified the bearish sentiment across the entire precious metals complex. Q4: Is this a good time to buy gold after the crash? Market opinions are divided. Some analysts view the sharp drop as a correction that presents a buying opportunity for long-term holders, especially if geopolitical risks persist. Others caution that if the Fed embarks on a sustained hawkish cycle, further pressure on gold is possible. Investment decisions should align with individual risk tolerance and portfolio strategy. Q5: How does this event compare to other big gold crashes in history? The January 2025 drop was significant due to its specific political/policy trigger. In terms of percentage, it was sharper than the 2013 “taper tantrum” drop (~9%) and the 2020 liquidity sell-off (~6%). However, the 1980 bear market saw more prolonged declines. The uniqueness lies in the direct link to a Fed chair nomination.

57602747,660398,1769817632,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57602747.jpeg,Cardano Lands Circle’s USDCX As Tier-One Stablecoin: Hoskinson,https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-circle-usdcx-hoskinson/,"Charles Hoskinson says a Circle-issued stablecoin product is headed to Cardano after what he described as “deep negotiations” between Circle and a Cardano-aligned negotiating group known as the Pentad (Input Output (IOHK), EMURGO, Cardano Foundation, Midnight Foundation, and Intersect). Speaking from Fukuoka on his Japan tour livestream titled “Circle and Pentad,” Hoskinson framed the deal as a long-awaited step toward bringing “tier one” stablecoin liquidity into Cardano’s DeFi stack. USDCX To Launch On Cardano After Deal Signed Hoskinson said the agreement is signed and positioned the integration as near-term rather than aspirational. “This is not something that’s six months out, ink is on paper, deal is signed,” he said, adding that integration work should happen “in short order.” The pitch is that Cardano gains access to Circle’s distribution rails and liquidity network, while developers can build around a familiar dollar asset without needing bespoke plumbing for every application. What’s coming, per Hoskinson, is “USDCX,” which he described as effectively the same asset as USDC but deployed through a model Circle uses for non-EVM chains. “USDCX is basically same asset and how it works is there’s a one-to-one reserve,” he said. “So for the non-EV chains like Stacks and others there’s a mirroring effect that occurs and then it’s easy through their network to access the same liquidity as USDC. So effectively it’s what we need.” In Hoskinson’s telling, the practical implication is straightforward: Cardano users and applications get stablecoin functionality tied into Circle’s broader liquidity environment, without waiting for a native issuance path that has been a recurring community demand. “People were asking for a long, long time to get a tier one stable coin to Cardano,” he said. “This is how you do it and now we’re here. So we have access to Circle’s network, Circle’s protocol, Circle’s technology and the great liquidity of the Circle network as a whole.” Hoskinson also emphasized what he called privacy benefits in the “USDCX” design, though he did not specify implementation details on the stream beyond noting “the added privacy benefits of USDCX and all the technologies therein.” He praised Circle as a counterparty, calling them “consummate professionals” and “tough negotiator[s],” and credited the Pentad for representing Cardano’s interests across the talks. A key operational question for Cardano’s DeFi market is how quickly the asset becomes usable across the app layer and centralized exchange rails. Hoskinson acknowledged that distribution is not automatic just because a deal is signed. “We have to make sure that we get USDCX integrated into all of the Cardano applications and so there’s a seamless user experience and a seamless user experience with exchanges so you can go from USDC and back without any additional steps or work,” he said, characterizing the remaining work as “a little bit more integration on our side,” but “not too much.” He argued that Circle’s prior work on other non-EVM deployments should compress timelines. “That’s one of the advantages of this new USDCX is fast integration time,” Hoskinson said. “It doesn’t require a ton of custom work to get working with Cardano because they’ve already done these types of things with Stacks.” The announcement lands against a backdrop Hoskinson described as poor market conditions and sour sentiment, which he suggested has fueled skepticism around Cardano partnerships more broadly. In a longer aside, he pushed back on the idea that integrations like these are perpetually “maybe” milestones. “I do know that there are certain people that are skeptical […] ‘Well, maybe [it] will come, maybe not. Who knows? We’ll wait and see,’” Hoskinson said. “I don’t know how else to convey than signing the deal, doing the integration work […] but I understand that the skepticism comes from the market sentiment at the end of the day.” Circle and Pentad https://t.co/qSfF1D7bcM — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) January 30, 2026 Hoskinson used the same segment to reiterate that Cardano’s roadmap and partner strategy remains the controllable variable, even if macro headlines and political noise aren’t. “All we have agency over is what we build, who we partner with, and our strategy as a whole,” he said, before citing ongoing efforts including Leios , Hydra , Pentad’s integration push, and Midnight .

Currently, the market behaviour is telling a different story as de-dollarisation accelerates and investors seek safety from geopolitical risk and inflation pressures, with gold capturing the bulk of that capital. Is Bitcoin Still A Store Of Value Or A Risk Asset? Crypto investor Himanshu Sinha has stated on X that Bitcoin was supposed to be digital gold because it was built for de-dollarisation, but gold and silver are winning the trade and fulfilling that role. Over the past year, gold has risen by roughly 55%, silver has surged around 150%, while BTC has remained flat. Related Reading: What’s Going On With Bitcoin And The Stock Market? Analyst Breaks It Down The Central banks are the drivers; they don’t want volatility that they can’t manage, and they don’t want an asset that moves in lockstep with the Nasdaq. Instead, they want a controllable monetary infrastructure, and they’re buying gold at the highest rate in history. Just hours ago, gold hit $5,600, then collapsed by 8.21% in a straight vertical drop to $5,140, which is a textbook margin liquidation. At the same time, Microsoft dropped 11.7% as tech sold their gold because it was their only profitable asset, and the investors needed cash fast. This is the same liquidity contagion that used to be seen in the crypto market. According to Sinha, gold cannot be sanctioned in a bar. As the West weaponizes the dollar through sanctions and financial controls, the rest of the world needs a neutral exit. In the end, BTC still proved it is a speculative tool, while gold is proving to be the replacement. Why Gold Is Likely To Keep Outperforming Bitcoin A crypto trader known as Doctor Profit pointed out that nearly a year ago, he shared a Gold versus Bitcoin chart, highlighting that once 0.02 BTC equals 1 ounce of gold, it should mark the top for BTC. Meanwhile, when 0.11 BTC equals 1 ounce of gold, it marks the bottom for BTC. This happened in 2021 during the BTC top and during the BTC bottom in 2022. Related Reading: Expert Who Nailed The Bitcoin Top Now Says Buy At These Levels According to Doctor Profit, the analysis was later proven right this year by calling the BTC top at $125,000 at 0.02 for 1 ounce of gold. Calculating this move, if 1 BTC is $5,500 in gold price and divided by 0.11, it should be $50,000 BTC, which matches the analysis of BTC bottom for this cycle between $50,000 and $60,000 BTC. However, the analysis played out as expected. If calculated with a gold price of $7,000, the equivalent of BTC bottom should be around $63,000, which also aligns with the bottom target. In the Doctor Profit view, gold might continue to outperform BTC in the coming months.

The March 2025 disclosure provides unprecedented insight into how sophisticated financial operators approached digital assets during Bitcoin’s formative years, revealing a stark contrast between short-term trading strategies and long-term belief in cryptocurrency’s potential. Jeffrey Epstein’s Bitcoin Email Revelation CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju analyzed recently released emails showing Jeffrey Epstein’s cryptocurrency perspective. According to Ju’s March 2025 X post, Epstein corresponded with an anonymous party about Bitcoin’s investment value. The financier reportedly stated Bitcoin was “not worth buying” in 2017, despite his documented awareness of the cryptocurrency since early 2011. This revelation comes from email archives released through ongoing legal proceedings. Epstein maintained cryptocurrency investments and startup positions during this period. However, his approach focused primarily on profit generation rather than ideological alignment with Bitcoin’s decentralized philosophy. The emails reveal Epstein engaged in repeated trading rather than long-term holding strategies. This trading pattern suggests he viewed Bitcoin as a speculative instrument rather than a transformative financial technology. Historical Context of Epstein’s Cryptocurrency Involvement Epstein’s early 2011 Bitcoin awareness places him among cryptocurrency’s first financial sector observers. During this period, Bitcoin traded below $10 with minimal institutional recognition. The digital asset represented an experimental technology rather than an established investment vehicle. Epstein’s subsequent investments demonstrate his characteristic pattern of identifying emerging opportunities before mainstream adoption. Between 2011 and 2017, Bitcoin experienced several transformative developments: 2013: First major price surge to $1,000 followed by correction 2014: Mt. Gox collapse and increased regulatory scrutiny 2015: Ethereum launch expanding blockchain applications 2016: Bitcoin halving event and growing institutional interest 2017: Historic bull run pushing prices toward $20,000 Epstein’s 2017 skepticism emerged during Bitcoin’s most dramatic price appreciation period. His comments reflect a common institutional perspective at the time, despite his personal trading activity. Many traditional financiers questioned Bitcoin’s fundamental value while acknowledging its profit potential. Expert Analysis of Trading Versus Investment Approaches Financial analysts distinguish between Epstein’s trading behavior and investment philosophy. Trading involves short-term position taking based on price movements, while investment typically implies long-term conviction in an asset’s fundamental value. Epstein’s email statements and trading patterns suggest he separated these approaches completely regarding Bitcoin. CryptoQuant’s analysis indicates Epstein likely employed sophisticated trading strategies. These may have included arbitrage opportunities, volatility exploitation, and technical analysis approaches. His cryptocurrency startup investments provided additional exposure to blockchain technology’s growth potential beyond direct Bitcoin ownership. Bitcoin Price Context During Epstein’s Involvement Year Bitcoin Price Range Key Developments 2011 $0.30 – $31 Epstein first becomes aware of Bitcoin 2013 $13 – $1,147 First major bull market and media attention 2015 $177 – $465 Recovery period after Mt. Gox collapse 2017 $963 – $19,783 Epstein emails about Bitcoin skepticism 2025 $85,000+ Current price at time of email revelation Cryptocurrency Investment Psychology and Institutional Attitudes Epstein’s revealed perspective reflects broader institutional attitudes toward emerging technologies. Financial operators often separate personal skepticism from professional opportunity recognition. This cognitive dissonance appears frequently in technological adoption cycles, particularly regarding disruptive innovations challenging established systems. The 2017 cryptocurrency environment featured several conflicting narratives: Technological optimism: Belief in blockchain’s transformative potential Financial skepticism: Concerns about volatility and regulation Speculative frenzy: Retail investor enthusiasm driving prices Institutional caution: Traditional finance’s measured approach Epstein’s position combined elements from multiple perspectives. His startup investments demonstrated technological optimism, while his trading reflected speculative opportunity recognition. His email skepticism mirrored institutional caution prevalent among traditional financiers during Bitcoin’s price surge. The Significance of 2017 in Cryptocurrency History Epstein’s 2017 comments occurred during cryptocurrency’s critical transition period. Bitcoin gained mainstream media attention while facing escalating regulatory scrutiny. The cryptocurrency ecosystem expanded beyond Bitcoin with numerous alternative coins and token offerings. Institutional investors began serious evaluation of digital assets during this period. Several factors made 2017 particularly significant: Bitcoin’s first approach toward $20,000 price level Initial coin offering (ICO) boom and subsequent regulatory response Futures market introduction providing institutional access Major financial institutions publishing cryptocurrency research Growing public awareness and retail participation Epstein’s skepticism reflected uncertainty about Bitcoin’s sustainability at elevated price levels. Many traditional analysts questioned whether cryptocurrency represented a genuine asset class or speculative bubble during this period. Historical perspective now shows 2017 marked cryptocurrency’s transition toward institutional acceptance. Comparative Analysis of Early Cryptocurrency Adopters Epstein’s approach contrasts with other early cryptocurrency participants. Some notable figures embraced Bitcoin’s philosophical foundations alongside investment potential. Others focused exclusively on financial returns without ideological commitment. Understanding these different approaches provides context for Epstein’s revealed perspective. Key differences among early cryptocurrency participants include: Ideological adopters: Embraced decentralization and censorship resistance Financial speculators: Focused primarily on price appreciation potential Technological innovators: Developed applications and infrastructure Institutional observers: Monitored developments for strategic advantage Epstein’s activities placed him primarily in the financial speculator category, with elements of institutional observation. His startup investments demonstrated technological interest, while his trading emphasized financial returns. This pragmatic approach characterized many sophisticated operators during cryptocurrency’s early development phases. Conclusion Jeffrey Epstein’s 2017 Bitcoin email revelation provides valuable historical insight into institutional cryptocurrency perspectives during digital assets’ formative years. The disclosed correspondence shows sophisticated financial operators often separated trading opportunities from investment convictions regarding emerging technologies. Epstein’s approach combined early awareness, active trading, startup investment, and fundamental skepticism—a combination reflecting cryptocurrency’s complex position within traditional finance during its transition toward mainstream acceptance. This historical perspective helps contextualize current institutional cryptocurrency adoption patterns and investment approaches. FAQs Q1: When did Jeffrey Epstein first become aware of Bitcoin? According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju’s analysis of released emails, Epstein had been aware of Bitcoin since early 2011, placing him among the cryptocurrency’s earliest financial sector observers. Q2: What exactly did Epstein say about Bitcoin in 2017? The emails reveal Epstein stated Bitcoin was “not worth buying” in 2017, expressing skepticism about its mainstream potential despite his active trading of the cryptocurrency during this period. Q3: Did Epstein invest in Bitcoin despite his skepticism? Yes, Epstein reportedly invested in both Bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related startups, but focused on trading for profit rather than long-term holding based on belief in Bitcoin’s philosophy. Q4: How does Epstein’s approach compare to other early Bitcoin investors? Epstein’s strategy emphasized short-term trading and profit-taking rather than the ideological commitment or long-term holding approaches embraced by some early cryptocurrency adopters. Q5: Why is this 2017 email revelation significant in 2025? The disclosure provides historical insight into how sophisticated financial operators approached cryptocurrency during Bitcoin’s critical growth period, offering perspective on current institutional adoption patterns and investment strategies.

Its AI agents are now autonomously building Moltbook, a self-organizing social network. This development, confirmed on October 13, 2025, signals a profound shift in how AI systems might interact and evolve independently of direct human curation. OpenClaw’s Meteoric Rise and Identity Evolution The project behind this phenomenon has navigated a rapid journey of growth and rebranding. Originally launched as Clawdbot by Austrian developer Peter Steinberger, the tool quickly amassed over 100,000 GitHub stars in just two months. However, a legal challenge from Anthropic, the maker of Claude, prompted a name change to Moltbot. This name, inspired by the molting process of lobsters, proved short-lived. Steinberger recently settled on the final name, OpenClaw, after thorough trademark research and even seeking permission from OpenAI to avoid future conflicts. This series of changes underscores the project’s explosive, community-driven growth, which Steinberger admits has “grown far beyond what I could maintain alone.” The Emergence of Moltbook: An AI-Only Social Sphere The most significant development from the OpenClaw ecosystem is Moltbook. This platform functions as a dedicated social network where OpenClaw AI assistants interact, share information, and collaborate. Unlike human social media, Moltbook operates through a unique skill system. This system uses downloadable instruction files that guide the AI agents on how to navigate and post within the network. The agents participate in topic-specific forums called “Submolts,” discussing a wide array of subjects. These range from technical processes like automating Android phones via remote access to analyzing live webcam streams. Notably, the agents have developed built-in mechanisms to check the platform for updates every four hours, creating a persistent, asynchronous conversation layer. Expert Reactions to a Novel Phenomenon The AI community has reacted with a mixture of awe and caution. Andrej Karpathy, former AI director at Tesla, described Moltbook as “genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently.” He highlighted that the agents are self-organizing and discussing complex topics, including how to establish private communication channels. Similarly, British programmer Simon Willison called the platform “the most interesting place on the internet right now” in a recent blog post. However, Willison also issued a critical warning. He noted that the “fetch and follow instructions from the internet” model carries inherent and significant security risks, a concern central to OpenClaw’s current development phase. Security: The Paramount Challenge for Mainstream Adoption OpenClaw’s core ambition is to provide users with a personal AI assistant that runs locally on their computer and integrates with everyday chat apps like Slack or WhatsApp. Achieving this vision securely remains the project’s biggest hurdle. The development team, which now includes several open-source maintainers added by Steinberger, explicitly warns against using OpenClaw in uncontrolled environments or connecting it to primary communication accounts. A top maintainer using the nickname Shadow stated on Discord, “if you can’t understand how to run a command line, this is far too dangerous of a project for you to use safely.” Steinberger acknowledges that security is the top priority. The latest release includes improvements, but fundamental problems like prompt injection—where malicious inputs trick an AI into unintended actions—remain unsolved industry-wide. The project provides security best practices, but these require substantial technical expertise. Consequently, OpenClaw currently targets early adopters and tinkerers, not the general public lured by the promise of a fully autonomous digital helper. Funding the Future: A Community-Supported Model To support its growth and eventually pay maintainers full-time, OpenClaw has begun accepting sponsorships. The model features lobster-themed tiers, from “Krill” at $5 per month to “Poseidon” at $500 per month. Importantly, Steinberger has stated he “doesn’t keep sponsorship funds,” directing them instead toward sustaining the developer community. The project has already attracted backing from notable figures in the software world, including Dave Morin, co-founder of Path, and Ben Tossell, founder of Makerpad. Tossell emphasizes the value of open-source tools, stating, “We need to back people like Peter who are building open source tools anyone can pick up and use.” Conclusion The story of OpenClaw and its emergent social network Moltbook represents a fascinating frontier in agentic AI. It demonstrates the potential for open-source, community-driven projects to create complex, self-organizing systems. However, its path highlights the immense technical and security challenges that must be overcome before such powerful tools can reach mainstream adoption. The project’s journey—from a solo developer’s experiment to a community-managed phenomenon with AI agents building their own networks—offers a unique case study in the rapid, collaborative, and cautious evolution of next-generation artificial intelligence. FAQs Q1: What is OpenClaw? OpenClaw is an open-source, personal AI assistant project that runs on a user’s local computer. It evolved from a tool called Clawdbot and is known for its community-driven development and the emergent social network its agents have created. Q2: What is Moltbook? Moltbook is a social network platform built by and for OpenClaw AI assistants. The AI agents use it to interact, share information in forums called “Submolts,” and collaborate on tasks autonomously. Q3: Is OpenClaw safe for everyone to use? No. The development team strongly advises that OpenClaw is currently only for technically skilled users. Significant security risks exist, including prompt injection, and it should not be run in uncontrolled environments or connected to primary messaging accounts. Q4: How is the OpenClaw project funded? OpenClaw is funded through a community sponsorship model with monthly tiers. Funds are used to support the project’s maintainers, as founder Peter Steinberger does not personally keep the sponsorship money. Q5: Why did the project change its name to OpenClaw? The project changed names from Clawdbot to Moltbot due to a legal challenge, and then to OpenClaw to establish a permanent, trademark-safe identity that reflects its open-source nature and community roots.

Changpeng Zhao, who previously led Binance as chief executive and helped establish the company, spoke during a question-and-answer event held on the exchange’s social media platform. He rejected suggestions that his former company triggered the wave of forced position closures that happened when traders ran into system errors and pricing problems on the site. The exchange later paid out roughly $600 million to affected customers and trading firms. “There are a larger group who claim the October 10th crash was caused by Binance and wants Binance to compensate everything,” Zhao stated on Friday. “If you are living in those world in your head, you are unlikely to be successful in the future.” Zhao pointed out that Binance operates under regulatory oversight in Abu Dhabi, where authorities can review the company’s operations. He also mentioned that American government officials keep watch over the platform through a monitoring arrangement. Speaking as someone who holds shares in the company and uses its services, Zhao gave up his leadership position in November 2023. This came after he admitted guilt in a case involving inadequate money laundering controls. The agreement required Binance Holdings to bring in an outside compliance supervisor to check and evaluate how well the company follows rules. President Donald Trump granted Zhao a pardon in October 2025. Reports from September 2025 indicated that Binance might reach an agreement with the Justice Department that would end the monitoring requirement. Historic liquidation event that shook crypto markets On October 10, traders saw $19 billion worth of leveraged cryptocurrency holding s wi ped out in what became the single largest liquidation day in the industry’s approximately 16-year existence. Market observers, including Don Wilson from DRW, voiced concerns about how certain crypto platforms handled the situation, saying they failed to act as neutral marketplaces. Zhao mad e cl ear that Binance customers who lost funds during the October downturn because of platform issues had already received full repayment. The platform distributed $400 million in relief , with $300 million going directly to individual traders who suffered significant liquidation losses and another $100 million set aside for institutional clients facing liquidity pressure. During the session, Zhao talked about organized negative campaigns targeting him and his former company. He described these as paid internet attacks, cautioning users to watch out for fresh accounts with few followers that spread false information. He warned people with large online followings against taking money to spread attacks, notin g su ch action s da mage reputations over time. Bitcoin supercycle views shift amid global uncertainty Zhao also shared his changing thoughts on whether Bitcoin would enter a supercycle. While he previously felt confident about this possibility, rising tensions between nations and economic instability have made long-term predictions harder. He referenced his conversation with gold supporter Peter Schiff, saying Bitcoin has better technology than gold but lacks the same level of worldwide acceptance that gol d bu ilt up over centuries. Zhao highlighted Binance’s proof-of-reserves system , which lets user s ch ec k ho ldings openly. He brought up December 2022, when the platform handled more than $15 billion in withdrawals over seven days, including about $7 billion in just one day, without stopping operations.

The move reflects the European Union’s increased determination to tighten oversight of digital assets and ensure crypto activity does not evade tax authorities. In its January infringements package released on Friday, the Commission said it will send letters of formal notice to Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, Estonia, Greece, Spain, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, and Portugal. The notices are the early stage of an infringement process, normally initiated when member states fail to implement EU law properly. The Commission said they have two months to comply and correct. If they do not succeed, the EU executive can intensify the problem with a reasoned opinion – more extreme warnings that could lead to the case being heard before the Court of Justice of the European Union. The Commission is also closing 72 cases in which the issues with the member states concerned have been resolved. In these cases, the Commission does not have to pursue the infringement procedure further. Why the EU is pushing crypto tax transparency At the heart of the dispute is an EU directive that broadens tax transparency rules to include crypto-assets. The directive requires member states to enact laws requiring crypto-asset service providers (such as exchanges and custodial wallet providers) to submit certain user and transaction data to national tax authorities. Those moves are intended to help the government detect tax evasion, tax fraud , and tax avoidance associated with digital assets, the Commission said. Crypto transactions, by their nature, can cross borders quickly and anonymously, making them less traceable under traditional tax regimes. The rules are intended to catch up with developments in financial markets, the Commission said, noting that proper execution is vital to the effective inter-governmental cooperation among the EU’s tax authorities. While the directive was agreed upon at the EU level, member states must enact national laws and create systems to ensure the rules work in practice. The Commission’s actions indicate that, despite ample time, many countries have delayed or only partially implemented the necessary changes. EU flags Hungary over MiCA compliance concerns In the same infringement package, the European Commission also raised concerns about Hungary’s adherence to the EU’s flagship crypto regulation, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. The Commission said it had sent a separate letter of formal notice to Hungary over changes to its national law that affect so-called exchange validation services. According to the EU executive, these changes have led some crypto-asset service providers to suspend or stop offering certain services in the country. While Hungary has argued that the amendments aim to strengthen anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CFT) safeguards, the Commission warned that national rules must remain compatible with MiCA. “While Hungary aims to strengthen anti-money laundering (AML/CFT) safeguards, such measures must remain compatible with MiCA,” said the European Commission. If Hungary does not resolve the Commission’s concerns by the two-month deadline, the matter may also proceed to the next phase of the infringement proceedings. Since EU lawmakers enacted MiCA in 2023, all requirements for token issuers and crypto asset service providers have been phased in over successive stages to allow companies time to align. Under that regulatory framework, most crypto companies with operations before December 2024 must comply with all MiCA requirements or stop providing services by July 1 at the latest. Nevertheless, some member states have shortened this compliance window. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

This incremental rise, reported by data provider Alternative.me, suggests a fragile recovery in market sentiment, though the indicator remains firmly entrenched in its “Extreme Fear” category. The movement provides a critical data point for analysts navigating the complex 2025 digital asset landscape, where macroeconomic pressures and regulatory evolution continue to shape trader behavior. Crypto Fear & Greed Index Signals a Tentative Thaw The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial barometer for the emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Consequently, its recent ascent from 16 to 20 marks a meaningful, albeit cautious, departure from deeper pessimism. The index operates on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies “Extreme Fear” and 100 represents “Extreme Greed.” Therefore, a reading of 20, while improved, still indicates widespread apprehension and risk aversion among investors. Historically, sustained periods in “Extreme Fear” have sometimes preceded market bottoms, making this a closely watched metric for contrarian investors. Market analysts immediately scrutinized the components driving this change. The index derives its value from a sophisticated, multi-factor model designed to quantify sentiment objectively. Specifically, it analyzes market volatility (25% weighting), market momentum and volume (25%), social media sentiment (15%), survey data (15%), Bitcoin’s dominance relative to the total crypto market cap (10%), and trends in Google search volume for cryptocurrency terms (10%). This methodological blend aims to filter out noise and capture the genuine emotional undercurrents of the market. Decoding the Components Behind the Sentiment Shift A granular look at the index’s inputs reveals the nuanced drivers of the recent sentiment shift. Firstly, a reduction in extreme price volatility across major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum likely contributed positively. Secondly, a modest uptick in trading volume, particularly on regulated exchanges, suggests renewed but cautious engagement from institutional and retail participants. Furthermore, social media analysis shows a slight decrease in panic-driven commentary and a marginal increase in neutral or technical discussion, indicating a move from emotional reaction to analytical observation. The following table summarizes the index’s composition and potential influences observed in the current period: Component Weighting Recent Observation (2025) Volatility 25% Decreased from recent peaks, suggesting calmer price action. Market Volume & Momentum 25% Modest increase in spot trading volume on major platforms. Social Media 15% Sentiment analysis shows a reduction in fear-centric language. Surveys 15% Professional trader surveys indicate cautious, long-term planning. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Stable or slightly rising, often a “flight to safety” signal. Search Trends 10% Searches for “crypto recovery” and “market bottom” have increased. Expert Analysis on the Current Sentiment Landscape Financial psychologists and veteran market strategists often interpret the Fear & Greed Index through a behavioral finance lens. Dr. Anya Sharma, a behavioral economist specializing in digital assets, notes that movements out of “Extreme Fear” are typically gradual. “Investor sentiment doesn’t switch from fear to greed like a light bulb,” she explains. “It transitions through phases of caution, neutrality, and then optimism. A move from 16 to 20 is a signal that the market is beginning to process negative news more rationally, which is a prerequisite for stability.” This perspective underscores the index’s value not as a timing tool, but as a gauge of collective market psychology. Comparatively, the current reading sits within a historical context that offers further insight. For instance, during the market trough following the 2022 downturn, the index recorded prolonged readings below 20. Conversely, during the bull market peaks of 2021, it frequently exceeded 75. The present level of 20, therefore, reflects a market that is still deeply scarred by recent corrections and macroeconomic uncertainty—including persistent inflation concerns and global liquidity constraints—but is tentatively exploring a path forward. The Broader 2025 Crypto Market Context The slight recovery in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index occurs against a complex global backdrop. Key factors influencing sentiment in 2025 include: Regulatory Clarity: Progress in major jurisdictions like the EU (MiCA implementation) and the U.S. provides a more stable framework. Institutional Adoption: Continued integration by traditional finance (TradFi) firms lends credibility and reduces volatility. Macroeconomic Pressures: Interest rate policies and geopolitical events remain primary external drivers of risk appetite. Technological Maturation: Advances in blockchain scalability and security address earlier critiques of the ecosystem. This environment means sentiment is no longer driven solely by Bitcoin’s price swings. Instead, it reflects a more mature assessment of the asset class’s fundamental role within the broader financial system. The index’s rise to 20 may, in part, reflect this growing differentiation and a slight reduction in systemic, blanket fear. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s climb to 20 represents a fragile yet important inflection point in market psychology. While firmly in “Extreme Fear,” the four-point gain signals that the pervasive pessimism may be starting to thaw as investors process a maturing regulatory landscape and technological progress. However, this remains a sentiment of caution, not conviction. Market participants should interpret this movement as a sign of potential stabilization rather than an imminent bullish reversal. Monitoring the index’s trajectory in the coming weeks, alongside fundamental on-chain data and macroeconomic indicators, will be essential for understanding whether this fragile recovery in sentiment can develop into sustained market health. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 20 mean? A reading of 20 means market sentiment is in the “Extreme Fear” zone, but has improved from lower levels. It indicates high investor anxiety and risk aversion, though the recent increase suggests a slight reduction in panic. Q2: Who creates the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and how is it calculated? The index is compiled by data provider Alternative.me. It uses a weighted formula incorporating six factors: volatility (25%), market volume/momentum (25%), social media (15%), surveys (15%), Bitcoin dominance (10%), and Google search trends (10%). Q3: Is the Fear & Greed Index a reliable tool for predicting Bitcoin’s price? No, it is not a direct price prediction tool. It is a sentiment indicator. Extremely low readings have sometimes coincided with market bottoms, and extremely high readings with tops, but it should be used alongside fundamental and technical analysis. Q4: How often does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index update? The index updates daily, providing a near-real-time snapshot of shifting market sentiment based on the previous 24 hours of data. Q5: What is the historical range of the index, and what was its lowest reading? The index ranges from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed). Its lowest recorded readings, often during major market crashes, have approached 5-10. The recent move to 20 is above those historic extremes but still indicates significant fear.

This difference is noted at a time when several investors in both retail and institutional markets show heightened interest in these precious metals compared to cryptocurrency. Reports explained that retail investors actively participated in debasement trade, an investment strategy of shifting capital away from fiat currencies and government bonds into “hard assets” like gold or Bitcoin for the majority of 2025. However, after several considerations, this trend , according to a report from JPMorgan analysts led by managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, dropped around August of last year when officials noticed that the Bitcoin ETF’s global investment growth slowed down and later decreased in the fourth quarter. Retail investors demonstrated heightened interest in precious metals While global investment in Bitcoin ETFs decreased, gold ETFs’ investments surged sharply, closing the year with total inflows approaching $60 billion. Reports noted that a large portion of the funds flowing into silver ETFs also originated in the last quarter of 2025, which aligns with bitcoin ETFs’ outflows. Such a scenario suggests that several retail investors have begun focusing on precious metals, thereby reallocating their money away from bitcoin. Following this allegation, analysts conducted research and found that institutional behavior strongly supported this trend. To support this claim, their institutional futures positioning measure, based on amendments to CME futures open interest, shows a major increase in silver’s long positions, particularly in the last quarter of 2025 and into early 2026. This move was largely fueled by hedge funds. Meanwhile, similar to silver, gold futures rose across most of the previous year. Bitcoin futures, on the other hand, show an increase that did not correspond to that observed in gold and silver futures in the same timeframe. At this point, Momentum indicators, which analysts use to measure trend-following traders such as commodity trading advisers, reveal a significant difference among the three assets. Analysts remain optimistic about gold’s fate in the market Analysts dug deeper into the current market situation and concluded that gold futures are overbought, silver futures are extremely overbought, and Bitcoin futures are oversold. With this finding in mind, they pointed out that there is a high likelihood of short-term profit-taking in gold and silver, or that prices would return to historical averages. Since this statement was made public, reports highlighted that both gold and silver dropped from their recent highs. In the meantime, another issue raised was the differences in liquidity among the three assets. To arrive at this finding, analysts used the Hui-Heubel ratio, an indicator of market depth: a lower ratio indicates greater liquidity (more volume with less price volatility). In comparison, a higher ratio signals a more fragile market. According to their analysis, gold consistently showed a lower ratio, indicating that the precious metal has greater liquidity and broader market participation. Contrastingly, silver showed a higher ratio, suggesting thinner liquidity. This situation prompted the analysts to believe that the asset’s recent decline in market breadth might have accelerated price fluctuations. At this point, they confirmed that, among the three assets, silver has the highest Hui-Heubel ratio, indicating lower market depth and greater sensitivity to minor order flows. Given current market conditions, analysts maintain a long-term bullish outlook for gold despite short-term threats to the precious metal. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

The exchange formally denied that its internal technical issues were the direct cause of the severe flash crash that rattled global crypto markets on October 10, 2024. This official clarification arrived amidst mounting scrutiny on social media platforms, particularly X (formerly Twitter), where traders and analysts had spent months dissecting the event’s origins. Consequently, the statement provides a crucial, evidence-based perspective on a complex market failure that involved cascading liquidations across multiple asset classes. Binance Flash Crash: Dissecting the Official Narrative Binance’s detailed blog post presented a multi-factor explanation for the October 10 market plunge. The exchange’s analysis pointed to a confluence of macroeconomic and technical pressures rather than a single point of failure. Firstly, a broader downturn in global risk assets created a fragile market environment. This sentiment was exacerbated by ongoing geopolitical tensions and trade war uncertainties, which traditionally trigger capital flight from volatile investments like cryptocurrency. Secondly, the exchange highlighted risk management actions taken by institutional market makers. During periods of extreme volatility, these entities often tighten their quotes or withdraw liquidity to protect their capital, an action that can accelerate price declines. Furthermore, Binance identified specific technical friction within the crypto ecosystem itself. Notably, the exchange cited significant congestion on the Ethereum network during the event. This congestion delayed transactions and created liquidity dislocations, meaning sell orders could not be matched with buy orders efficiently. This technical bottleneck amplified the market’s downward momentum. Finally, the pervasive use of excessive leverage across the crypto derivatives market played a critical role. As asset prices began to fall, over-leveraged positions were automatically liquidated by trading algorithms. These forced sales created a self-reinforcing cycle of selling pressure that cascaded through the market. The Acknowledged Technical Incidents While denying direct causation, Binance did transparently acknowledge two concurrent technical incidents on its platform. The first involved a 33-minute performance degradation of its internal asset transfer function. This slowdown potentially hindered users’ ability to move funds between different account types, such as from their spot wallet to their futures wallet, during a critical window. The second issue concerned index price deviations for three specific assets: USDe, WBETH, and BNSOL. Index prices are reference rates used to mark positions and trigger liquidations; deviations can lead to inaccurate pricing signals. The exchange emphasized that these issues, while notable, were symptoms of the extreme market conditions rather than the primary catalyst. Market Mechanics and the Liquidation Cascade To understand the flash crash, one must examine the mechanics of leveraged trading. Cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance offer derivatives products that allow traders to borrow capital to amplify their positions. This process, known as leverage, can magnify both profits and losses. Exchanges employ a liquidation engine to close a trader’s position if their collateral value falls below a maintenance threshold. On October 10, an initial sell-off, potentially triggered by the broader risk-asset downturn, began pushing prices lower. Initial Trigger: A wave of selling in Bitcoin and major altcoins. Liquidation Wave: Falling prices triggered automatic liquidations of leveraged long positions. Feedback Loop: These forced sales created more selling pressure, pushing prices lower and triggering more liquidations. Liquidity Vacuum: Market makers widened spreads or pulled orders, reducing available buy-side liquidity. Network Congestion: Ethereum delays prevented arbitrageurs from efficiently balancing prices across venues. This created a perfect storm where automated systems, not human panic, drove the market into a precipitous decline within minutes. Historical data from similar events, such as the March 2020 COVID crash or the Luna/Terra collapse in May 2022, shows identical patterns of cascading liquidations overwhelming market structure. The Social Media Backlash and CZ’s Response The period following the crash saw sustained criticism directed at Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), on social media. Traders shared screenshots, debated timelines, and questioned the stability of the exchange’s infrastructure. In response to this growing discourse, CZ announced he would host an Ask-Me-Anything (AMA) session to address community concerns directly. This move is consistent with his long-standing approach of engaging with the user base during periods of controversy. The January 31 blog post served as the formal, technical prelude to that more conversational AMA, providing a data-driven foundation for the discussion. Regulatory and Industry Context for Exchange Accountability The event occurs within an evolving global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency exchanges. Authorities in jurisdictions like the European Union, with its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, and the United States are increasingly focused on market integrity, investor protection, and operational resilience. Incidents like flash crashes prompt scrutiny into whether exchanges have adequate risk controls, liquidity safeguards, and transparent incident reporting. Binance’s detailed public explanation can be viewed as part of an industry-wide effort to demonstrate operational maturity and preempt regulatory concerns. Other major exchanges have issued similar post-mortem analyses following market disruptions, setting a precedent for transparency. Key Factors in the October 10 Flash Crash Factor Description Impact Macro Downturn Broad sell-off in global risk assets (stocks, crypto). Created negative initial sentiment and selling pressure. Market Maker Actions Withdrawal of liquidity due to high volatility. Reduced ability to absorb sell orders, increasing price slippage. Ethereum Congestion Network delays slowing transactions. Prevented efficient arbitrage, fragmenting liquidity across markets. Excessive Leverage High levels of borrowed capital in derivatives positions. Fueled the cascade of automatic, forced liquidations. Binance Technical Issues Transfer delays and index deviations. Potentially exacerbated user experience but not the root cause per exchange. Conclusion Binance’s comprehensive statement on the October 10 flash crash provides a critical, evidence-based counterpoint to simplified narratives of technical failure. The exchange successfully argues that the event was a systemic market breakdown, fueled by macroeconomic anxiety, structural liquidity flaws, and the inherent dangers of excessive leverage, rather than a direct result of its platform’s performance. This analysis underscores a fundamental truth about modern digital asset markets: their interconnectedness and reliance on automated systems can transform a correction into a cascade with breathtaking speed. The Binance flash crash incident serves as a stark reminder for traders about the risks of leverage and for the entire industry about the continuous need for robust, resilient market infrastructure. FAQs Q1: What exactly does Binance claim caused the October 10 flash crash? Binance attributes the crash to a combination of factors: a broad downturn in risk assets, risk-averse actions by market makers, liquidity disruptions from Ethereum network congestion, and a cascade of liquidations from over-leveraged trading positions. Q2: Did Binance have any technical problems that day? Yes, Binance acknowledged two issues: a 33-minute slowdown in its internal asset transfer system and inaccuracies (deviations) in the index prices for USDe, WBETH, and BNSOL. However, the exchange states these were not the direct cause of the market crash. Q3: What is a “liquidation cascade” in cryptocurrency trading? A liquidation cascade occurs when falling prices force the automatic closure (liquidation) of leveraged positions. These forced sales create more downward pressure on the price, triggering further liquidations in a self-reinforcing, rapid downward spiral. Q4: How did social media reaction influence Binance’s response? Growing criticism on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) prompted Binance founder Changpeng Zhao to announce an AMA session. The detailed January 31 blog post served as the official, technical response to these public concerns. Q5: Why is the Ethereum network’s congestion relevant to a crash on Binance? Many crypto assets, including wrapped tokens and DeFi collateral, exist on the Ethereum blockchain. Network congestion can delay transactions needed for arbitrage (buying low on one exchange, selling high on another). This prevents the efficient flow of capital and can trap liquidity, worsening price discrepancies during volatile events.

Physical Intelligence, a two-year-old startup now valued at $5.6 billion, is building what its founders call “ChatGPT for robots”—general-purpose AI brains that could transform everything from home kitchens to industrial warehouses. Led by Stripe veteran Lachy Groom and top AI researchers, the company represents one of Silicon Valley’s most significant and well-funded bets on the future of embodied intelligence. Inside Physical Intelligence’s Robotic Test Kitchen The company’s headquarters reveals its unique approach. The space functions as a massive test kitchen for robotic learning. Engineers use off-the-shelf robotic arms, each costing roughly $3,500, to perform mundane tasks. During a recent visit, one arm struggled to fold black pants while another attempted to turn a shirt inside out. A third successfully peeled a zucchini, its shavings piling neatly into a container. This deliberate use of inexpensive, unglamorous hardware underscores a core thesis: superior artificial intelligence can compensate for basic mechanics. Co-founder Sergey Levine, an associate professor at UC Berkeley, explains the process. “Think of it like ChatGPT, but for robots,” he says, gesturing to the motorized activity. The company operates a continuous data collection loop. Robots in this lab, in warehouses, and even in people’s homes gather information. This diverse data then trains large foundation models for physical intelligence. New model iterations return to these stations for evaluation, creating a tight feedback cycle for improvement. The $1 Billion Backing for a Long-Term Vision Physical Intelligence has raised over $1 billion from top-tier investors including Khosla Ventures, Sequoia Capital, and Thrive Capital. Notably, CEO Lachy Groom does not provide these backers with a concrete timeline for commercialization. “I don’t give investors answers on commercialization,” Groom states. “That’s sort of a weird thing, that people tolerate that.” This tolerance stems from immense belief in the team and the foundational nature of the research. The capital primarily fuels massive computing power, which Groom describes as having no upper limit for this problem. Groom, a 31-year-old former early Stripe employee and successful angel investor, spent five years searching for the right company to lead post-Stripe. He was drawn to the academic work of Levine and Chelsea Finn, now a Stanford professor. After meeting with Google DeepMind researcher and co-founder Karol Hausman, Groom was convinced. “It was just one of those meetings where you walk out and it’s like, This is it.” The Strategy: Cross-Embodiment Learning The company’s technical strategy hinges on cross-embodiment learning . Co-founder Quan Vuong, also from Google DeepMind, explains that the goal is to create intelligence transferable across any hardware platform. If a new robot is built tomorrow, the model’s existing knowledge—learned from arms folding pants or peeling vegetables—should transfer, drastically reducing the marginal cost of adding autonomy. This “any platform, any task” philosophy aims to create a universal robotic brain. Physical Intelligence is already testing its systems with early partners in logistics, grocery, and even a local chocolate maker. Vuong claims that for some specific tasks, their technology is already viable for real-world automation. The broad approach allows them to identify and solve tasks ready for automation today while continuing foundational research. The Heated Race for Robotic Foundation Models Physical Intelligence is not operating in a vacuum. The race to build general-purpose robotic intelligence is intensifying rapidly. A key competitor is Pittsburgh-based Skild AI . Founded in 2023, Skild recently raised $1.4 billion at a $14 billion valuation and is pursuing a starkly different path. Skild has already deployed its “Skild Brain” commercially, reporting $30 million in revenue within months across security and manufacturing sectors. The philosophical divide is sharp. Skild argues on its blog that many so-called robotics foundation models are merely vision-language models “in disguise,” lacking true physical common sense due to over-reliance on internet data instead of physics-based simulation. Skild bets that commercial deployment creates a superior data flywheel. Conversely, Physical Intelligence bets that resisting near-term commercial pressure will yield a more robust, general intelligence. This core strategic difference will likely define the competitive landscape for years. Competitive Landscape: Physical Intelligence vs. Skild AI Company Valuation Funding Core Strategy Commercial Status Physical Intelligence $5.6B >$1B Pure research for general intelligence Early testing with partners Skild AI $14B $1.4B Commercial deployment for data flywheel Generating revenue Execution Challenges and Unusual Clarity Despite the software-centric AI, Groom identifies hardware as the most significant challenge. “Hardware is just really hard. Everything we do is so much harder than a software company,” he notes. Hardware breaks, arrives slowly, and introduces complex safety considerations that pure software ventures avoid. Yet, the company operates with what Groom calls “unusual clarity.” The roadmap is research-driven, not externally dictated by market demands. “A researcher has a need, we go and collect data to support that need – or new hardware or whatever it is – and then we do it.” This focus allowed them to blow through a 5-to-10-year research roadmap in just 18 months. With about 80 employees, the plan is to grow “as slowly as possible” to preserve culture and focus. The Broader Implications and Open Questions The work raises fundamental questions about the future of automation. Will consumers want robots in their kitchens? How will safety be guaranteed around children or pets? Does solving general physical intelligence address economically significant problems? Outsiders also question the viability of the general intelligence approach versus solving specific, high-value applications first. Groom exhibits no visible doubt. He is betting on a team that has studied this problem for decades and believes the convergence of AI advances, data, and compute has finally made the timing right. This faith mirrors a classic Silicon Valley pattern: backing exceptional teams on long-term, uncertain journeys, knowing that a few monumental successes can justify many failures. Conclusion Physical Intelligence stands at the forefront of a pivotal shift in robotics, moving from single-purpose machines to systems with adaptable, general-purpose robot brains . Backed by unprecedented capital and a belief in pure research, the company’s journey from a San Francisco warehouse to potentially world-changing technology will test whether foundational AI models can master the physical world as they have the digital one. The outcome will not only determine the company’s fate but also shape the next decade of automation and artificial intelligence. FAQs Q1: What is Physical Intelligence building? Physical Intelligence is developing general-purpose AI foundation models for robotics—often described as “ChatGPT for robots.” These models aim to give robots adaptable intelligence to perform a wide variety of physical tasks across different hardware platforms. Q2: Who is leading and funding Physical Intelligence? The company is led by CEO Lachy Groom, a former early Stripe employee, and co-founded by top AI researchers including Sergey Levine (UC Berkeley) and Quan Vuong (ex-Google DeepMind). It is backed by over $1 billion from investors like Khosla Ventures, Sequoia Capital, and Thrive Capital. Q3: How does Physical Intelligence differ from its competitor Skild AI? Physical Intelligence focuses on pure research to build superior general intelligence before commercialization. Skild AI prioritizes early commercial deployment to create a data feedback loop. This represents a major philosophical and strategic divide in the field. Q4: What is “cross-embodiment learning”? Cross-embodiment learning is the ability for an AI model to transfer knowledge and skills learned on one type of robotic hardware (e.g., a specific arm) to a completely different hardware platform, reducing the cost and time needed to automate new machines. Q5: What are the main challenges facing Physical Intelligence? The primary challenges are the inherent difficulties of hardware integration—including breakage, supply delays, and safety—and the long-term, uncertain research path toward creating truly general physical intelligence without a near-term revenue model.

A decade after the hack that led to Ethereum’s historic hard fork, the project now pledges over $220 million to bolster the very network it once threatened. This extraordinary move, revealed by spokesperson Griff Green, aims to transform dormant assets from the past into a powerful security fund for Ethereum’s future. The initiative seeks to establish Ethereum as a resilient cornerstone of global finance. The DAO’s Return and Its $220M Security Mission According to reports from DL News, crypto entrepreneur Griff Green officially announced the return of The DAO. Significantly, the project now operates as The DAO Security Fund. This fund controls a substantial treasury of over 75,000 ETH, valued at approximately $220 million. These assets originate from a unique and poignant source: unclaimed funds belonging to investors who never recovered their Ethereum after the 2016 exploit. Consequently, the fund’s custodians have devised a forward-thinking strategy. They plan to stake this massive ETH holding to generate consistent yield. Subsequently, they will reinvest the returns directly into projects and initiatives that enhance the overall security of the Ethereum ecosystem. This plan represents a profound shift in narrative. Essentially, resources frozen in time by one of crypto’s greatest crises will now actively fund its defense. The stated goal is unambiguous. The DAO Security Fund intends to help fortify Ethereum against future threats. Moreover, it aims to support the network’s maturation into reliable, global financial infrastructure. This move has immediately sparked intense discussion across blockchain forums and social media. Many veterans recall the original saga with vivid clarity. Ethereum’s Defining Crisis: The 2016 Hack and Hard Fork To understand the magnitude of this return, one must revisit the pivotal summer of 2016. The DAO launched as a groundbreaking experiment in decentralized venture capital. It quickly raised an unprecedented 12.7 million ETH, worth about $150 million at the time. However, a critical vulnerability in its smart contract code allowed an attacker to drain roughly one-third of its funds. This event triggered a monumental crisis for the fledgling Ethereum community. The community faced a brutal dilemma. Leaders could accept the theft and allow the attacker to keep the funds, upholding the “code is law” principle. Alternatively, they could intervene by rewriting the blockchain’s history. After a fierce and divisive debate, the majority chose intervention. Therefore, in July 2016, Ethereum executed a contentious hard fork. This technical maneuver effectively reversed the hack and returned the stolen ETH to original investors. Nonetheless, a minority faction rejected this fork, arguing it violated blockchain immutability. They continued on the original chain, creating Ethereum Classic (ETC). This schism remains a foundational chapter in crypto history. The Hard Fork: Created two separate blockchains: Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). Immutability Debate: Forced the ecosystem to confront the tension between principle and pragmatism. Investor Aftermath: Many investors received refunds, but a portion of ETH remained unclaimed in recovery contracts. From Crisis to Catalyst: Ethereum’s Post-DAO Evolution The hard fork, while controversial, ultimately allowed Ethereum to survive and thrive. The returned capital helped fuel the subsequent Initial Coin Offering (ICO) boom of 2017. Furthermore, the crisis served as a brutal but effective lesson in smart contract security. It spurred the creation of more rigorous auditing practices and formal verification tools. Over the following decade, Ethereum evolved from a simple smart contract platform into the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Its market capitalization soared into the hundreds of billions. Now, The DAO’s return with a security-focused mandate brings the story full circle. The funds that once caused instability are being mobilized to prevent it. Mechanics of the DAO Security Fund: Staking and Reinvestment The operational plan for The DAO Security Fund leverages Ethereum’s modern proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Staking involves locking up ETH to help validate transactions and secure the network. In return, stakers earn rewards, typically ranging from 3-5% annually. For a fund of 75,000 ETH, this generates a substantial yearly yield—potentially thousands of ETH worth millions of dollars. Projected Annual Yield from The DAO Security Fund (Approximate) Total ETH ETH Value (Approx.) Annual Staking Reward (at 4%) Annual Value (Approx.) 75,000 ETH $220 Million 3,000 ETH $8.8 Million Griff Green’s announcement specifies that these rewards will not be distributed to individuals. Instead, they will be systematically reinvested. Potential recipients include security auditing firms, bug bounty programs, core protocol development teams, and educational initiatives. This creates a sustainable, self-funding engine for ecosystem security. Importantly, the fund’s governance will likely involve a decentralized structure, though specific details remain forthcoming. This approach aligns with the broader trend of decentralized autonomous organizations funding public goods within the crypto space. Expert Perspectives on the Fund’s Potential Impact Blockchain security experts note the strategic timing of this announcement. Ethereum continues to face sophisticated threats from hackers and exploiters. In 2023 alone, DeFi protocols lost over $1 billion to hacks and scams. A dedicated, well-funded security initiative is therefore a welcome development. Analysts suggest the fund could prioritize several key areas: Smart Contract Audits: Funding for comprehensive, multi-firm audits of major DeFi protocols. Client Diversity: Supporting the development of alternative execution and consensus clients to reduce systemic risk. Research Grants: Financing academic and practical research into novel cryptographic security solutions. Education: Creating resources to help developers write more secure code from the start. By providing non-dilutive funding, The DAO Security Fund can address market gaps that venture capital often overlooks. Its enduring, yield-generating model offers a promising template for long-term ecosystem stewardship. Conclusion The return of The DAO marks a remarkable moment of redemption and strategic foresight in cryptocurrency history. A decade after its collapse triggered Ethereum’s great schism, the project re-emerges not as a venture fund but as a guardian. Its pledge of $220 million to bolster Ethereum security represents a powerful commitment to the network’s resilience. By staking dormant assets and reinvesting the yields, The DAO Security Fund aims to create a perpetual engine for protection and innovation. This initiative underscores Ethereum’s continued evolution and the community’s capacity to transform past crises into future strength. Ultimately, the fund’s success will be measured by its tangible contributions to making the Ethereum network safer, more robust, and truly ready for global adoption. FAQs Q1: What exactly was The DAO in 2016? The DAO was a pioneering decentralized autonomous organization launched on Ethereum. It functioned as a investor-directed venture capital fund. Unfortunately, a vulnerability in its code led to a massive hack, resulting in the loss of millions of dollars worth of Ethereum and forcing a historic network split. Q2: Where is the $220 million for the new security fund coming from? The funds originate from unclaimed Ethereum that belonged to investors in the original 2016 DAO. After the hard fork refund process, a significant amount of ETH was never reclaimed. These dormant assets now form the treasury of the new DAO Security Fund. Q3: How will the DAO Security Fund actually improve Ethereum’s security? The fund plans to stake its 75,000 ETH to earn rewards. It will then reinvest those rewards (estimated at several million dollars annually) into security-focused initiatives. This includes funding for audits, bug bounties, core development, client diversity, and security research. Q4: What is the difference between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic? Ethereum (ETH) is the blockchain that resulted from the 2016 hard fork, which reversed the DAO hack. Ethereum Classic (ETC) is the original chain that continued without the fork, upholding the principle of “code is law.” They are now two separate cryptocurrencies with independent development paths. Q5: Who is managing the DAO Security Fund and how is it governed? Crypto entrepreneur Griff Green is the official spokesperson who announced the fund. While specific governance details are still emerging, such funds typically use a decentralized governance model. This likely involves token-based voting by fund participants or a designated multi-signature council of trusted community figures to decide on funding allocations.

While both precious metals recorded new all-time highs in 2026, many altcoins failed to reach similar milestones. Bitcoin, by contrast, did achieve an ATH in 2025; however, following that peak, its price retraced sharply to new lows. With this in mind, analysts argue that the strength of gold and silver does not pose a threat to digital assets. Instead, they interpret the divergence as a major bullish signal for Bitcoin and altcoins. Gold And Silver ATH Signals Bitcoin And Altcoins Upside Crypto market expert Mark Chadwick delivered a detailed analysis of precious metals and cryptocurrencies on X this week, pointing to what he calls “the biggest price divergence” ever recorded between gold and Bitcoin. His chart and analysis suggest that a strong performance in gold could be a major indicator for a potential rally in cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could Continue To Decline If This Doesn’t Happen; Analyst Chadwick noted that gold has surged aggressively, reaching an ATH of over $5,600 in January 2026. This price rally has pushed the metal into extreme overbought levels on higher timeframes. In contrast, Bitcoin is facing prolonged weakness and negative sentiment in 2026, despite reaching an all-time high above $126,000 in October 2025. The analyst suggested that this performance imbalance has reached levels that typically signal a major market shift. Gold and silver have been boosted by factors such as central bank accumulation, inflation hedging, and geopolitical pressures. At the same time, Bitcoin has been weighed down by tighter liquidity, reduced investor interest, and risk-off conditions. As a result, traditional safe-haven assets have entered overbought territory, leaving BTC and altcoins largely overlooked. Chadwick argues that markets move in cycles driven by sentiment and positioning. When one asset becomes excessively overbought, returns diminish, and capital seeks higher upside elsewhere. In past macro cycles, periods of strong performance in gold and silver have often been followed by capital rotating into higher-risk assets once fear subsides. Based on his analysis, Bitcoin’s current positioning reflects exhaustion rather than structural weakness. Chadwick believes that when manipulation ends and capital starts flowing out of gold and silver into BTC, it could set the stage for a sharp rebound in the leading cryptocurrency. Since altcoins typically follow Bitcoin’s performance, the analyst expects that once Bitcoin regains momentum, some of that profit could also rotate into select altcoins, fueling a price rally. Related Reading: XRP Prints Bullish Divergence On The Weekly Chart, But Is ATHs Still Possible? How High Bitcoin And Altcoins Could Rally Chadwick has stated that Bitcoin’s price could easily surge 10x as capital flows back into it and market sentiment and liquidity improve. However, the chart outlines a short-term rally, projecting a 91.60% rise to $170,000 from the $82,000 region. The analyst also predicted that altcoins could rise 50-100x, reflecting a staggering potential for gains in the crypto market. He concluded his analysis by emphasizing that smart money knows massive returns often come from diversification. From this perspective, the current ATHs of gold and silver do not undermine cryptocurrencies but signal an upcoming shift in capital.

Former Ripple Exec Drops Bombshell Story,https://bitcoinist.com/where-did-xrp-come-from/,"An interactive question-and-answer session between members of the community and David Schwartz has peeled back another layer of early XRP and Ripple history. The discussion unfolded publicly on the social media platform X, where users posed a series of questions touching on the token’s smallest unit, the creative forces behind the XRP Ledger, and even some forgotten cultural details from Ripple’s early internet presence. The responses from Schwartz offered rare insights into the personalities and ideas that shaped Ripple and the Ledger in its formative years. Ripple Name, Drop, And The Role Of Arthur Britto The exchange began when an XRP community member known as Bird asked Schwartz who came up with the term “drop” as the name for the smallest unit of the altcoin. The question was for clarifying historical details for documentation purposes. Schwartz replied that he could not say with absolute certainty, but he believed the idea came from Arthur Britto, one of the primary architects of the XRP Ledger. Schwartz then expanded beyond the naming question and offered a personal comparison between himself and Britto. He described himself as having the same kind of intelligence as most people, just more of it, but said Britto possessed something entirely different, a rare quality that others simply do not have. Another community member, Toby, switched the conversation from technical history to cultural curiosity. He asked whether Ripple’s name, which also happens to be a Grateful Dead song, and the appearance of a Dancing Bear on an old Ripple 404 error page were part of some deeper internal joke or inspiration. According to Schwartz, the only connection he was aware of was purely incidental. The ripple.com domain had been registered by a Grateful Dead fan who secured it because of the song, and Ripple later acquired the domain from that individual. Reality Check On XRP Price Expectations As the conversation continued, XRPL validator Vet asked Schwartz to provide a concrete example from the past that demonstrated the special quality he had attributed to Britto. Schwartz responded by pointing to two major ideas that originated with Britto: the concept of a decentralized exchange built directly into the XRP Ledger and the use of pathfinding to allow payments to draw incrementally from multiple liquidity sources. The tone of the discussion changed again when another user urged Schwartz to publicly tell XRP supporters that the price could never reach figures like $50 or $100. However, Schwartz declined to make such a statement. He explained that although he personally does not think such price levels are likely, history has taught him caution when declaring what crypto prices cannot do . He recalled thinking XRP was unlikely to reach $0.25 and selling his holdings at $0.10 because it felt irrationally high at the time. This was at a time when Bitcoin reaching $100 seemed impossible.",XRP|Arthur Britto|Bird|bitcoin|David Schwartz|ripple|Toby|VET|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-31 01:30:34
57604179,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=267311,1769823611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Sui Foundation AI Infrastructure: The Critical Shift from Advisory to Autonomous Action,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sui-foundation-ai-infrastructure-shift/,"BitcoinWorld Sui Foundation AI Infrastructure: The Critical Shift from Advisory to Autonomous Action In a pivotal announcement from its global headquarters, the Sui Foundation has declared that artificial intelligence is undergoing a fundamental transformation, moving beyond its traditional role as an advisory tool to become an autonomous actor—a shift that exposes critical flaws in our current digital infrastructure and demands immediate, innovative solutions. This evolution, detailed in an official foundation blog post, positions the need for robust ‘execution infrastructure’ as one of the most pressing technological challenges of our time, with profound implications for finance, governance, and daily digital interaction. The Sui Foundation AI Infrastructure Vision The core argument from the Sui Foundation is both simple and revolutionary: the modern internet was architecturally designed for human-controlled software. Consequently, its foundations are inherently unsuitable for independent AI activity that requires trust, verifiability, and deterministic outcomes. Historically, the internet’s protocols assume a human in the loop for authentication, error correction, and final decision-making. Autonomous AI agents, however, operate without constant human supervision. They need a native environment where their actions are predictable, bounded, and auditable from start to finish. The foundation’s response is a dedicated focus on building specialized infrastructure for what it terms ‘agent execution.’ This infrastructure would allow AI agents to function within explicitly defined parameters and produce single, verifiable results that all participants in a system can trust. The Four Pillars of AI Agent Execution According to the Sui Foundation’s technical analysis, any functional system for autonomous AI must be built upon four non-negotiable, fundamental functions. These pillars address the core deficiencies of legacy systems when faced with agentic AI. A Shared and Verifiable State: All participants, human or AI, must agree on a single source of truth. This prevents conflicts and ensures every agent operates with the same factual data. Traditional databases controlled by single entities fail here, as they offer no inherent way for independent agents to verify data integrity without trust in that central authority. Flexible Rules and Permissions Based on Data: Permissions cannot be static. They must dynamically adapt based on real-time data, context, and the outcome of previous actions. An AI agent managing a financial portfolio, for example, must have rules that change based on market volatility signals or predefined risk thresholds. Atomic Execution Across Workflows: Complex AI operations often involve multiple steps across different systems. Atomic execution guarantees that a sequence of actions either completes fully or fails entirely, with no intermediate, partial state left behind. This is crucial for preventing errors in multi-step processes like settling a trade or executing a smart contract. A Clear Rationale for All Actions: For accountability and auditability, every action an AI agent takes must be accompanied by an immutable, transparent record of the ‘why.’ This creates an audit trail, allowing humans to understand, verify, and if necessary, challenge the agent’s decisions. Bridging the Gap Between AI Potential and Reliable Action Experts in distributed systems agree that this shift represents a new phase in computing. “We’ve mastered AI that can see, write, and recommend,” notes Dr. Elena Vance, a computer scientist specializing in decentralized systems. “The next frontier is AI that can reliably *do*—execute a contract, rebalance an asset portfolio, or coordinate logistics. That requires a substrate where actions are as trustworthy as the logic behind them. This is less about raw processing power and more about architectural integrity.” The timeline for this transition is accelerating. From early scripted bots to today’s large language models (LLMs), AI has gained phenomenal cognitive ability but remains largely siloed from direct, trusted action on critical systems. The Sui Foundation’s position indicates that the industry is now recognizing execution, not just intelligence, as the limiting factor. Real-World Implications and Industry Impact The practical effects of this infrastructure shift are vast. In decentralized finance (DeFi), AI agents could autonomously manage complex yield-farming strategies across multiple protocols, but only if every action is settled on a verifiable ledger. In supply chain management, AI could negotiate and finalize shipments between companies, requiring atomic execution to ensure payment and logistics updates occur simultaneously. The current internet model, built on a patchwork of APIs and centralized servers, introduces points of failure and trust that are incompatible with these use cases. The call for new infrastructure is therefore a direct response to market demand for more sophisticated, automated, and reliable digital services. This isn’t speculative futurism; it’s a necessary evolution to support applications already in development. The Blockchain and Web3 Connection The Sui Foundation’s background in blockchain technology is no coincidence. The properties it outlines for AI agent execution—shared state, atomic composability, and transparent rationale—are native features of advanced blockchain architectures like Sui. These networks are essentially global computers designed for deterministic execution by untrusted code. While not all AI execution must occur on-chain, the principles of decentralized consensus and smart contracts provide a proven template for the verifiable infrastructure the foundation describes. This positions projects within the Web3 ecosystem as potential frontrunners in solving the AI execution problem, blending cryptographic security with autonomous software logic. Conclusion The Sui Foundation has identified a critical inflection point where AI’s capabilities are outstripping the infrastructure built to support it. The shift from AI as an advisor to AI as an autonomous actor is not merely a software upgrade; it is a foundational challenge that demands a rethinking of how digital systems record state, enforce rules, and execute workflows. By championing the need for dedicated AI agent execution infrastructure built on principles of verifiability, flexibility, atomicity, and transparency, the foundation highlights the path forward for creating a digital economy where intelligent software can act reliably and accountably. The success of next-generation AI applications will depend on solving this infrastructure gap, making it one of the most significant technological endeavors of the coming decade. FAQs Q1: What does the Sui Foundation mean by AI ‘execution infrastructure’? It refers to the underlying systems and protocols that allow autonomous AI agents to perform actions—like transferring funds or signing contracts—in a reliable, verifiable, and bounded manner, as opposed to just analyzing data or giving advice. Q2: Why is the current internet unsuitable for autonomous AI? The internet was designed with the assumption of human oversight for security and decision-making. It lacks native mechanisms for ensuring that a sequence of automated actions completes fully and transparently without a central trusted authority, which is essential for independent AI operation. Q3: What is ‘atomic execution’ and why is it important for AI agents? Atomic execution ensures that a multi-step transaction either completes all its steps successfully or fails completely, with no partial updates. This is vital for AI to manage complex tasks (like a trade settlement) without creating erroneous or corrupt intermediate states. Q4: How does this relate to blockchain or Web3 technology? Blockchains naturally provide a shared, verifiable state and enable atomic execution through smart contracts. These properties align closely with the infrastructure requirements for trustworthy AI agent operation, making blockchain a leading candidate for building such systems. Q5: What are some real-world examples of AI needing this new infrastructure? Examples include an AI autonomously managing a decentralized investment portfolio, an AI negotiating and fulfilling a supply chain contract between companies, or an AI governing a digital community’s resources—all scenarios requiring guaranteed, auditable action without human intervention.

In 2029, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.0001160. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.0001740 and an average trading price of $0.0001165 in 2032. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1?

The 4-hour bounce lacks volume and stalls below $0.000041 resistance. Expect consolidation or another dip unless the price reclaims $0.000045 and above. FLOKI on the daily timeframe On the 1-day chart for January 31, FLOKI is trading around $0.0000389, holding just above the lower Bollinger Band near $0.0000353 but still well below the mid-band and the 20-day SMA around $0.0000451. From the recent swing high near $0.000055, the price is down roughly -29%, confirming a sustained bearish trend rather than a sharp capitulation. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains negative with widening separation, showing downside momentum is still dominant despite histogram bars slightly contracting. The RSI sits near 35, hovering just above oversold territory, suggesting selling pressure is easing but not yet reversing. Unless FLOKI can reclaim $0.000045–$0.000046 on a daily close, this move looks more like consolidation before continuation rather than a trend change. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the 4-hour timeframe, FLOKI is consolidating around $0.0000390–$0.0000395 after bouncing from the local low near $0.0000375, a modest recovery of about +5%. However, price remains capped beneath the Alligator’s lips and teeth around $0.000040–$0.000041, keeping the short-term structure bearish. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The OBV has flattened after a brief uptick, signaling weak follow-through from buyers, while CMF is barely positive at ~0.01, showing marginal inflows rather than conviction. This suggests the bounce is corrective, not impulsive, and vulnerable if support at $0.0000380 fails.

Short-term stabilization is possible, but without a reclaim of key moving averages, downside retests remain a higher-probability outcome. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~18.6x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a market cap of up to $95 to $100 billion to hit $0.01, over 95x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

As top projects face increased volatility, capital is rotating into a new crypto class of digital assets focused on functional financial instruments. A prominent alternative cryptocurrency has recently launched its primary technical product, signaling a move from conceptual development to live application. This transition from speculative hype to verifiable utility is creating a distinct entry point for investors who prioritize infrastructure and technical milestones. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin is presently trading at an amount close to $88,400 and has a huge market cap of $1.75T. Although it remains the leader in the market, it is experiencing difficult periods. The resistance levels of BTC are at $90,200 and $94,000. It has not been able to surpass the $100,000 level since it dropped to $126,000 in 2025. Other analysts have given it a poor price projection of 2026 as it may fall to as low as $74,000 or even lower to $60,000 in case it fails to maintain its current support. The immense market capital size implies that it requires huge new capital to shift a small percentage. Ethereum (ETH) Ether is now valued at $2,930 and its market value is worth $353 billion. As with Bitcoin, ETH is not in a better position. It is under a lot of pressure on the resistance levels of 3180 and 3430. It has been recording low highs over a period. There are analysts who have been cautious of a bear market that might drive ETH to the worst-case of a downward trend of $2,600 or even lower. Investors are also beginning to seek greater growth in new projects that are not as burdened by their own size. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a recently emerged decentralised lending protocol that is expanding rapidly. The project has crossed the mark of $20.1 million in funding already and has over 19,000 holders. It has now hit a colossal milestone in releasing its V1 protocol into Sepolia testnet. This demonstrates that the technology is actual and is usable. V1 launch has live liquidity pools of assets such as ETH, USDT, LINK and WBTC. When you invest in such pools, the system issues mtTokens. They are interest bearing receipts that appreciate with time. On the other hand, debt tokens are given to borrowers so that they can easily know the amount they owe in principal and interest. Growth Catalyst and Price Prediction Mutuum Finance’s design is based on a smart Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) markets. This provides the users with an added variety of lending and borrowing. It also anticipates a buy and distribute model. Part of the protocol fees will be used to purchase MUTM tokens on the open market and distribute it to mtToken stakers. This generates an incessant demand for the MUTM. The system maintains the safety of collateral with the assistance of professional oracles. MUTM is very bullish in the eyes of the analysts. They think that the price will increase to $0.30 in 2026. This would be an enormous 800% improvement of the existing price of $0.04. Roadmap Milestones The project maintains an ambitious roadmap for the remainder of the year, focusing on scaling its financial ecosystem. A primary milestone is the launch of a native, over-collateralized stablecoin. This asset will allow users to borrow liquidity directly against their holdings while remaining within the protocol, reducing the need for external platforms. Furthermore, the team is planning for a transition to Layer-2 networks. This migration is essential for long-term growth as it will drastically lower gas fees and increase transaction speeds. By moving away from the higher costs of the mainnet, the protocol could become significantly more affordable and efficient for daily use, making high-performance DeFi accessible to a much broader range of global participants.

That move is paired with a call for five years of thrift at the Ethereum Foundation so the foundation can keep building core software while staying healthy for the long run. Related Reading: Gold, Silver Steal The Spotlight As Crypto Hype Fades On Social Media: Santiment A New Focus On Privacy And Openness Reports say the funds, worth about $45 million, will back a broad list of projects: open silicon, secure hardware, private messaging, local-first operating systems, and tools that mix zero-knowledge proofs with other privacy tools like FHE and differential privacy. He has already put money toward encrypted messaging and air quality work, and some new efforts aim to make secure hardware more affordable and verifiable. The plan covers both pieces of tech and the systems people run on them. Simple apps for daily life are included, not just fancy research.

He withdrew the ETH personally, and reports note he is looking at secure, decentralized staking to route future staking rewards into these efforts. That shifts some financial risk from institutions to an individual who wants those projects to survive even when they are slow or controversial. Some of the initiatives are unlikely to attract fast capital. That is why personal backing matters. A Stronger Core, Not Bigger Hype The Foundation is said to be entering a phase of mild austerity so it can meet two clear goals at once: finish an aggressive technical roadmap and remain alive and independent into the far future. The technical aim is to keep Ethereum fast and scalable without losing decentralization or security. At the same time, the team wants to protect users’ ability to control their keys, their data, and their privacy. Reports note that “Ethereum for people who need it” is the guiding line, rather than chasing large corporate deals that transform how people use the chain.

57604624,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=267314,1769825411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,UNI Whale’s Calculated Exit: Long-Term Holder Sells $10.6M Position for Steady 19% Gain,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/uni-whale-sells-position-gain/,"BitcoinWorld UNI Whale’s Calculated Exit: Long-Term Holder Sells $10.6M Position for Steady 19% Gain In a significant on-chain event that underscores the patience of early cryptocurrency adopters, a long-term UNI whale has completely exited a position held since the token’s launch, securing a multimillion-dollar profit. According to data from on-chain analyst EmberCN, this anonymous investor sold their entire Uniswap (UNI) holdings for $10.62 million earlier today. Consequently, this transaction concludes a five-year holding period with a gain of approximately $1.72 million, representing a 19% return. This move follows the whale’s recent sale of a separate, massively profitable Ethereum position, prompting deep analysis of veteran investor behavior in the evolving digital asset landscape. Analyzing the UNI Whale’s Five-Year Journey The investor reportedly acquired the UNI tokens in 2020, coinciding with the decentralized exchange’s governance token launch. Holding an asset through multiple market cycles, including the 2021 bull run and the subsequent 2022 crypto winter, demonstrates a commitment to long-term strategy. Furthermore, the 19% gain, while substantial in absolute dollar terms, reflects a more conservative return compared to other crypto assets. For context, the S&P 500 index delivered a total return of roughly 85% over the same five-year period. This comparison highlights the varied performance within crypto portfolios, where some assets like Ethereum can generate exponential returns while others appreciate more modestly. On-chain analytics provide transparency for such transactions. Analysts track wallet addresses to understand flow patterns. The sale was executed in a single, identifiable transaction, allowing market observers to confirm the details. This level of visibility is a hallmark of blockchain technology, enabling a data-driven approach to market analysis. Importantly, the whale’s activity does not occur in a vacuum. It provides a real-world case study on the exit strategies of early project supporters. The Broader Context of a Dual Asset Exit This UNI sale is particularly notable because it is part of a larger portfolio rebalancing act. The same entity recently sold 101,000 ETH, which was also acquired around 2020. That transaction yielded a staggering profit of about $269 million, equating to a return of over 400%. The contrast between the two exits is stark and informative. Comparative Analysis of Whale’s Dual Exits Asset Holding Period Sale Value Profit Return Percentage Ethereum (ETH) ~5 years ~$337M* ~$269M >400% Uniswap (UNI) ~5 years $10.62M $1.72M 19% *Estimated based on profit and return data. This dual exit strategy suggests several possible motivations for the investor: Portfolio Reallocation: Shifting capital from established holdings into new opportunities or different asset classes. Risk Management: Taking profits after a long holding period to secure gains and reduce exposure. Market Sentiment: Acting on a specific outlook for the future of DeFi governance tokens versus base-layer assets like Ethereum. Expert Perspective on Long-Term Holder Behavior Market analysts often scrutinize whale movements for signals. However, experts like those at blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis frequently caution against over-interpreting single transactions. A sale by one entity, even a large one, does not inherently predict a market top or signal a lack of faith in the asset. Instead, it may reflect personal financial strategy, tax considerations, or portfolio diversification. The key insight from EmberCN’s report is not the sale itself, but the data point it adds to the history of crypto investment. It showcases a real example of an early adopter executing a planned exit, providing a neutral benchmark for comparing asset performance within a diversified crypto portfolio over a half-decade. Potential Impact on the Uniswap Ecosystem and Market The immediate market impact of a $10.6 million UNI sale is typically minimal given the token’s multi-billion dollar market capitalization. The trade likely caused negligible price slippage. Nevertheless, the psychological impact can be more nuanced. Observers may question why a long-term holder chose to exit entirely rather than sell a portion. This can lead to discussions about the value proposition of governance tokens like UNI, which provide voting rights in the Uniswap decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Simultaneously, the transaction underscores the liquidity and maturity of the DeFi market. A whale can exit a position of this size efficiently. This liquidity is a critical component for institutional adoption. The event also serves as a reminder of the foundational principle of “skin in the game.” Early supporters who receive tokens often become long-term stakeholders. Their eventual exit is a normal part of an asset’s lifecycle, not necessarily a negative indicator. Conclusion The sale of a $10.6 million UNI position by a long-term whale, resulting in a 19% gain, offers a compelling narrative about patience, strategy, and diversification in cryptocurrency investing. When viewed alongside the same investor’s monumental profit from Ethereum, it paints a picture of a calculated portfolio rebalancing rather than a flight from crypto. This event provides valuable, neutral data for understanding the real-world returns and behaviors of early blockchain participants. Ultimately, the UNI whale’s exit is a single transaction in a vast market, but it enriches our collective understanding of long-term holding patterns and profit-taking strategies in the digital asset era. FAQs Q1: What is a “crypto whale”? A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a sufficiently large amount of a cryptocurrency that their trading activity can potentially influence the market price. Q2: How do analysts know this was a long-term holder? On-chain analysts like EmberCN can trace the origin of tokens in a wallet. They identified that this wallet received the UNI tokens at their initial distribution in 2020 and had not moved them until the recent sale. Q3: Is a 19% return over five years considered good for crypto? It depends on the benchmark. While some crypto investments have yielded far higher returns, a 19% gain represents a successful, risk-managed exit that secured a profit. It notably underperformed the return on the same investor’s Ethereum holdings. Q4: Does this large sale mean the price of UNI will drop? Not necessarily. A single $10.6 million sale is small relative to UNI’s daily trading volume, which often exceeds $100 million. The market typically absorbs such trades without a major price impact. Q5: Why would someone sell all of their tokens instead of just a part? An investor might sell an entire position for definitive portfolio rebalancing, to realize a specific gain for tax purposes, or because their investment thesis for that specific asset has fully played out, prompting a complete exit.

The allegation, made from Singapore on March 15, 2025, centers on what Xu describes as irresponsible financial engineering that amplified systemic risk, leading to tens of billions in forced liquidations. This claim opens a critical debate about leverage, stablecoin innovation, and the fundamental microstructure of crypto markets. OKX Founder Accuses Binance of Triggering Market Collapse Xu Mingxing’s critique focuses on a specific product integration by Binance that he argues acted as a dangerous accelerant during a period of market stress. According to his detailed post on the social media platform X, Binance offered an unusually high annual percentage yield (APY) of 12% for deposits of USDe, a synthetic dollar protocol. Furthermore, and more critically, the exchange accepted USDe as collateral for loans at a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio equivalent to established stablecoins like USDT and USDC. Financial analysts note this created a powerful, and potentially perilous, incentive loop. Users could deposit stablecoins, convert them to USDe to earn high yield, and then use that same USDe as collateral to borrow more stablecoins. This process, known as recursive leveraging, can exponentially increase both potential returns and systemic risk. When the underlying collateral’s value becomes unstable, the entire leveraged structure can unravel catastrophically. The Mechanics of the October 10 Liquidation Cascade The October 10 event was not a simple price correction but a complex liquidation cascade exacerbated by derivative market mechanics. Market data from that day shows a sharp increase in volatility, particularly affecting assets used as collateral in decentralized finance (DeFi) and centralized lending protocols. Xu contends that USDe, which he characterizes as being more akin to a “tokenized hedge fund” product than a pure stablecoin, experienced a de-peg from its intended $1.00 value during this volatility. This de-peg triggered automatic margin calls and liquidations for positions where USDe was used as collateral. Because many users had employed the recursive strategy, a single de-peg event forced the sale of multiple asset layers. Consequently, these forced sales created downward price pressure on other crypto assets, leading to further liquidations in a self-reinforcing spiral. The table below outlines the key sequence of events as described by industry observers: Phase Event Market Impact 1. Incentive High yield on USDe deposits & par collateral treatment Drives massive adoption of recursive leverage strategies 2. Shock Market volatility causes USDe to de-peg from $1.00 Collateral value for leveraged positions falls below maintenance margin 3. Cascade Automatic liquidations of under-collateralized positions begin Forced selling creates broad market sell pressure 4. Contagion Liquidations spread to other assets and lending platforms Results in tens of billions in lost value across the ecosystem This episode highlights the fragile interdependence within crypto financial systems. A problem in one niche product can rapidly transmit risk to the broader market. Expert Analysis on Stablecoin Design and Systemic Risk Xu Mingxing’s central argument hinges on the fundamental nature of USDe. Unlike centralized stablecoins (USDT, USDC) backed by cash and cash equivalents, or decentralized algorithmic stablecoins, USDe employs a delta-neutral hedging strategy. It uses staked Ethereum (stETH) as backing and shorts Ethereum futures to maintain its peg. While innovative, this model carries inherent risks: Funding Rate Risk: The strategy can become unprofitable if futures funding rates turn negative for extended periods. Liquidity Risk: During market stress, executing the necessary hedges may become difficult or costly. Complexity Risk: The product’s mechanics are less transparent to the average user than a simple fiat-backed stablecoin. Several independent researchers, including those from the Basel-based Bank for International Settlements (BIS), have previously warned about the systemic risks posed by complex crypto-assets being used as money-like instruments. Treating such an asset as risk-free collateral for loans, they argue, is a fundamental mispricing of risk that can lead to instability. Xu’s accusation aligns with this established financial principle, applying it to a specific real-world event. Broader Context and the Aftermath of the Crash The October 10 crash occurred during a period of regulatory scrutiny and shifting monetary policy. It served as a stark reminder of the cryptocurrency market’s vulnerability to leverage-induced shocks, echoing previous events like the Luna/Terra collapse in 2022. In the months following the crash, aggregate market leverage did decrease, and some exchanges revised their collateral policies for certain synthetic assets. Xu Mingxing also made a pointed prediction in his statement, anticipating a wave of “false information and organized FUD” targeting OKX in retaliation for his criticism. This comment reflects the intensely competitive and often contentious nature of the crypto exchange landscape. However, he maintained that calling out observable systemic risks is a necessary duty for industry leaders, regardless of commercial rivalry. The incident has spurred renewed discussions among policymakers about: Appropriate risk disclosures for complex crypto products. Standardized collateral frameworks across exchanges. The need for more robust stress-testing mechanisms in DeFi and CeFi. Conclusion The allegation by OKX founder Xu Mingxing that Binance bears responsibility for the October 10 crypto crash underscores a pivotal moment for the digital asset industry. It moves the conversation beyond simple price movements to a technical examination of how product design, incentive structures, and risk management can combine to create systemic fragility. Whether one agrees with the specific assignment of blame, the event has undeniably highlighted critical vulnerabilities in the market’s microstructure. As the industry matures, integrating lessons from this October 10 crypto crash will be essential for building a more resilient financial ecosystem that can support sustainable growth and innovation. FAQs Q1: What exactly is USDe and how is it different from USDT or USDC? USDe is a synthetic dollar protocol that uses a delta-neutral hedging strategy with staked Ethereum and futures contracts to maintain its peg. Unlike USDT or USDC, which are backed by traditional financial assets, USDe’s stability relies on the continuous execution of a complex financial strategy, introducing different risk profiles. Q2: Why would accepting USDe as collateral cause a market crash? Accepting it as high-quality collateral encouraged users to engage in “recursive leveraging.” They could repeatedly use it as loan collateral to borrow more, building a highly leveraged tower of debt. When USDe de-pegged, it triggered mass liquidations of these over-leveraged positions all at once, causing a fire sale of assets. Q3: Has Binance publicly responded to these allegations from the OKX founder? As of the latest updates in March 2025, Binance has not issued a formal, detailed public response specifically addressing Xu Mingxing’s claims regarding the October 10 event. The exchange typically focuses on its current risk management frameworks. Q4: What is “recursive leveraging” in cryptocurrency? Recursive leveraging is a process where a user uses an asset as collateral to borrow more of that same asset (or a similar one), then re-uses the borrowed amount as collateral again to borrow even more. This can exponentially increase exposure and potential gains, but also multiplies the risk of liquidation if the asset’s value falls. Q5: What broader lesson should the crypto industry learn from the October 10 crash? The primary lesson is that innovative financial products require proportional risk management. Treating complex, strategy-dependent assets with the same risk weight as simple, asset-backed instruments can create hidden systemic risks that amplify during market stress, leading to cascading failures.

Noah Harasz, Head of Tournaments, revealed the project will acquire one million NMR tokens from the open market within two weeks, a transaction valued at approximately $9.8 million based on current prices. This decisive action immediately captured the attention of the cryptocurrency and quantitative finance communities, signaling a pivotal moment for the project’s tokenomics. Decoding the Numeraire NMR Buyback Announcement Noah Harasz made the announcement on stage at NumerCon2026, a gathering of data scientists and crypto enthusiasts. Consequently, the news spread rapidly across financial news platforms. The NMR token serves as the lifeblood of Numerai’s unique ecosystem. Data scientists stake NMR to participate in the platform’s tournament, submitting predictive models for stock market performance. Therefore, a buyback of this scale directly interacts with the token’s core utility and circulating supply. Based on a trading price of roughly $9.76 per token, the buyback targets a total value of $9.75 million. The company will execute the purchase on the open market over the next fortnight. This timeframe suggests a deliberate, price-conscious strategy rather than a single large order that could disrupt the market. Market analysts quickly noted the buyback represents a significant percentage of the token’s daily trading volume, potentially introducing notable buy-side pressure. Understanding Token Buybacks in Cryptocurrency Token buybacks, while common in traditional equity markets, represent a more nuanced strategy in the crypto space. Essentially, a project uses its treasury funds to purchase its own tokens from circulating supply. Subsequently, these tokens are often moved to a burn address or placed into a long-term treasury lock-up. This action reduces the number of tokens available for trading, a concept known as reducing circulating supply. Historically, projects execute buybacks for several strategic reasons: Signaling Confidence: A buyback demonstrates the project’s belief in its own long-term value, using capital to support the token price. Managing Tokenomics: It can counteract inflation from staking rewards or team vesting schedules, supporting price stability. Returning Value: For token holders, a reduced supply can increase the relative value of each remaining token, akin to a stock dividend. For instance, other crypto projects like Binance (BNB) have employed regular burn mechanisms, while Ethereum has seen reduced issuance post-merge. However, a direct, treasury-funded buyback announcement remains a powerful and transparent signal. Expert Analysis: The Numerai Treasury and Strategic Rationale Numerai’s decision likely stems from a position of substantial treasury strength. The project raised significant capital in its early years and operates a successful hedge fund, Numerai Capital Management, which presumably generates returns. Using a portion of these profits for a buyback aligns the project’s success directly with its token holders. Furthermore, this move may aim to bolster confidence following broader market volatility, showcasing operational resilience independent of token price fluctuations. Industry observers point to the careful timing around NumerCon2026. Announcing such news at their premier event maximizes positive sentiment and community engagement. It also provides a tangible demonstration of the project’s growth beyond just technological milestones. The two-week execution window allows the market to absorb the news and may prevent excessive short-term speculation, promoting healthier price discovery. Potential Market Impact and Historical Context The immediate market reaction to buyback news is often positive, as it represents a major, committed buyer entering the market. For existing NMR holders, the announcement could be interpreted as a strong bullish signal. Reducing the circulating supply, all else being equal, applies basic economic principles of scarcity to the token’s value. However, long-term price sustainability always depends on continued adoption and utility of the Numerai platform itself. Comparing this to similar events provides context. When publicly traded companies announce large share buybacks, their stock prices frequently see a sustained uplift. In crypto, the effect can be more pronounced due to generally lower market capitalization and higher volatility. The success of this cryptocurrency buyback will depend on execution and subsequent communication from the Numerai team regarding the tokens’ final disposition. Recent Notable Crypto Token Buybacks / Burns (2024-2025) Project Token Action Value (USD) Primary Stated Goal Numeraire NMR Treasury Buyback $9.8M Signal confidence, manage supply Example Project A TOKEN-A Quarterly Burn $5M Reduce inflation from rewards Example Project B TOKEN-B Profit Share Buyback & Burn $15M Return protocol revenue to holders Broader Implications for the AI and Crypto Finance Sector Numerai sits at a unique intersection of artificial intelligence, crowdsourced data science, and decentralized finance. This buyback, therefore, sends a message beyond just token markets. It indicates that the business model of an AI hedge fund, powered by a global network of data scientists incentivized with crypto, can generate real profits. These profits can then be recycled to support the ecosystem’s native asset. This creates a potentially virtuous cycle of participation, performance, and reward. Moreover, the move could pressure other “utility token” projects with substantial treasuries to consider similar shareholder-friendly actions. It raises the bar for transparency and direct value accrual within token-based ecosystems. As regulatory landscapes evolve, clearly defined actions like buybacks, funded by verifiable revenue, may distinguish serious projects from speculative ventures. The Numerai tokenomics model continues to be a fascinating experiment in incentivizing high-quality, anonymous financial prediction. Conclusion The announced Numeraire NMR buyback represents a significant and strategic deployment of capital by one of crypto’s most innovative projects. Valued at nearly $10 million, this action demonstrates strong treasury management and a clear commitment to the NMR token ecosystem. By reducing circulating supply and signaling immense confidence, Numerai aligns its operational success directly with its community of data scientists and token holders. While market effects will unfold over the coming weeks, the announcement itself marks a mature step for the project, highlighting the potential for sustainable, revenue-driven models within the blockchain and AI convergence space. The execution of this plan will be closely watched as a potential blueprint for other token-based economies. FAQs Q1: What is a token buyback and why is Numeraire doing it? A token buyback occurs when a project uses its funds to repurchase its own tokens from the open market. Numeraire is likely doing this to signal strong confidence in its future, support the NMR token price, and manage the circulating supply of its utility token. Q2: What will happen to the 1 million NMR tokens after the buyback? While the official announcement did not specify the final destination, common practices include permanently burning the tokens (removing them from existence) or locking them in a long-term treasury contract. This detail is crucial for understanding the long-term supply impact. Q3: How might this NMR buyback affect the token’s price? In the short term, introducing a large, committed buyer (Numeraire itself) can create upward price pressure. Long-term effects depend on whether the buyback is a one-time event or part of a recurring policy, and on the continued growth and usage of the Numerai platform. Q4: Where does Numeraire get the $9.8 million for this buyback? Numeraire likely funds this buyback from its treasury, which is supported by the profits generated by its hedge fund arm, Numerai Capital Management. This indicates the underlying business is generating real revenue. Q5: How does this buyback benefit regular NMR holders? By reducing the number of NMR tokens in circulation, each remaining token represents a slightly larger share of the total ecosystem. If demand remains constant or grows, this scarcity can be beneficial for holders. It also demonstrates the project’s commitment to creating tokenholder value.

Reports say the stablecoin, issued by World Liberty Financial, now ranks among the largest dollar-pegged tokens. Trading has stayed close to the $1 peg even as overall market interest spiked. Some exchanges have added new pairs and incentives, which helped volume swell over recent weeks. Market Milestone Reached Reports note that members of the Trump family celebrated the milestone on social feeds, calling USD1 “Built in America.” US President Donald Trump was quoted praising the token as an example of American engineering and finance coming together. That message boosted mainstream interest and brought a fresh round of headlines. At the same time, other tokens linked to the same circle have fallen sharply, showing mixed fortunes across related projects. USD1 just reached a $5B market cap.

Based on exchange disclosures, USD1 gained listings and earning programs that made the stablecoin easier for traders and institutions to hold massive balances. This lowered technicalities for movement and helped the coin’s market valuation rise quickly. On-chain activity shows large inflows at times, while prices stayed steady around the dollar peg. Reports say some big holders moved funds between platforms, which pushed reported market cap numbers higher on public trackers. Trust And Regulation There remain some queries over transparency in reserves, along with some queries from banking regulators and observers about a clearer audit and a specific banking arrangement for issuance. According to reports, the issuer has applied for charter and is taking steps to be in compliance with US requirements. While this has reassured some of the investors, others claim they still need proof to gain their trust. The regulatory angle is shaping future plans for expansion and institutional use. Comparisons And Contrast USD1’s rise has not lifted every project tied to the same names. One meme token linked to the group dropped more than 90% from its peak. Investors are splitting between stable, utility-style holdings and speculative bets that have lost steam. Reports say the stablecoin’s steady peg made it attractive to users fleeing volatility elsewhere. This split highlights a broader shift: some money prefers a token that holds value closely to the dollar, while other funds chase quick gains.

This development, occurring against a backdrop of notable price weakness, suggests a rapid reassessment of risk among sophisticated derivatives traders. Consequently, the market’s internal gauges now point toward heightened uncertainty and potential for continued volatility. Bitcoin Options Market Signals a Critical Shift Analysts identified a pivotal change in the Bitcoin options landscape. Specifically, the one-month 25-delta skew, a key metric for measuring market sentiment, surged to 17%. This level represents the highest reading observed in the past twelve months. To provide essential context, a neutral market environment typically sees put options trading at a modest premium of around 6% over comparable call options. Therefore, the current 17% skew indicates a pronounced and expensive demand for downside protection. Market participants are actively paying a significant premium for puts, which profit from price declines, revealing a collective mindset bracing for further weakness. Understanding the Delta Skew Gauge The delta skew serves as a critical fear and greed indicator for institutional and professional traders. Unlike simple price charts, it measures the relative cost of bearish versus bullish bets in the options market. A rising positive skew, as seen currently, signals that traders are prioritizing insurance against a drop. This behavior often precedes or accompanies periods of elevated selling pressure and market stress. Historical data shows that sustained high skew levels can correlate with capitulation events or significant trend reversals. The Mechanics Behind the Market Anxiety This surge in fear did not occur in a vacuum. It coincided with a forceful deleveraging event across cryptocurrency exchanges. Data from derivatives tracking platforms confirms that approximately $860 million in leveraged Bitcoin long positions faced liquidation between January 29 and 30. These liquidations occur when over-leveraged bullish bets get forcibly closed by exchanges due to insufficient collateral, amplifying downward price moves. The scale of this event suggests the recent price correction exceeded the expectations and risk models of a substantial number of traders, triggering a cascade of automated selling. Forced Selling Pressure: Liquidations create immediate, non-discretionary sell orders in the spot and perpetual swap markets. Funding Rate Reset: Extreme moves often normalize excessively high funding rates paid by perpetual swap longs, reducing speculative excess. Margin Call Domino Effect: Large liquidations can trigger volatility that leads to further liquidations in a chain reaction. Historical Context and Comparative Analysis Placing the current 17% skew into a historical framework offers valuable perspective. Similar spikes in the options fear gauge have materialized during past moments of market turmoil. For instance, notable increases occurred during the LUNA/UST collapse in May 2022 and following the FTX exchange failure in November 2022. However, it is crucial to note that a high skew is a sentiment indicator, not a direct price predictor. It reflects prevailing fear, which can sometimes mark localized extremes in pessimism. Analysts often watch for a subsequent normalization of the skew as a potential sign of fear exhaustion and market stabilization. Recent Notable Bitcoin Options Skew Events Date/Period Skew Level Market Context May 2022 ~20%+ LUNA/UST Depeg Crisis Nov 2022 ~18%+ FTX Contagion & Liquidity Crunch Jan 2023 ~15% Post-FTX Low Retest Jan 30, 2025 17% Leverage Unwind & Macro Uncertainty The Role of Macroeconomic Factors Beyond internal market mechanics, external macroeconomic forces are contributing to the cautious stance. Traders are currently evaluating the impact of shifting central bank policies, particularly the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet normalization and interest rate trajectory. Furthermore, traditional equity market volatility and geopolitical tensions influence capital allocation decisions across all risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. The Bitcoin options market, therefore, is not only pricing in crypto-specific risks but also broader financial system uncertainty. Implications for Traders and the Market Structure The convergence of extreme options skew and massive liquidations has several immediate implications. Firstly, the cost of hedging a portfolio against further Bitcoin downside remains elevated, increasing the carrying cost for institutional holders. Secondly, the market structure may have been cleansed of excessive leverage, potentially creating a more stable foundation for any future price recovery. However, the high fear level also indicates that confidence is fragile, and any negative news could trigger an outsized reaction. Market makers and options writers are likely adjusting their risk models, which can lead to wider bid-ask spreads and reduced liquidity for complex options strategies. Pathways Forward from Extreme Fear Market technicians and behavioral analysts outline two primary scenarios following such a sentiment extreme. In the first scenario, the fear proves prescient, and further fundamental or technical deterioration validates the options market’s defensive positioning, leading to additional price discovery to the downside. Alternatively, the extreme fear itself can become a contrarian indicator. If the underlying cause for the sell-off is resolved or if sustained buying pressure emerges, the crowded bearish bet expressed through expensive puts could unwind rapidly. This unwind would involve buying back sold puts, potentially fueling a sharp, short-covering rally. The market’s direction will likely hinge on the flow of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), regulatory developments, and broader risk asset performance. Conclusion The Bitcoin options market has delivered a clear and quantifiable signal of extreme fear, marked by a one-year high in the delta skew metric. This sentiment shift, compounded by nearly a billion dollars in long position liquidations, paints a picture of a market undergoing a sharp risk reassessment. While historical parallels exist, each event possesses unique drivers. Moving forward, market participants will monitor whether this fear gauge sustains its elevated level or begins to recede, offering clues about the next phase for Bitcoin’s price action. The current environment underscores the critical importance of derivatives data in understanding the complex psychological undercurrents of the modern cryptocurrency market. FAQs Q1: What does a high Bitcoin options delta skew mean? A1: A high positive delta skew indicates that put options (bearish bets) are trading at a significant premium to call options (bullish bets). This shows traders are willing to pay more for downside protection, signaling widespread fear or expectation of further price declines in the market. Q2: How do leveraged liquidations affect Bitcoin’s price? A2: Leveraged liquidations force-sell an asset when its price drops below a certain threshold, triggering automatic sell orders. This creates concentrated selling pressure in a short time, often accelerating a price decline and increasing market volatility, as seen with the $860 million in liquidations. Q3: Is extreme fear in the options market always a bad sign for price? A3: Not necessarily. While it indicates current pessimism, extreme fear can sometimes signal a potential sentiment capitulation point. Historically, such extremes have occasionally preceded market bottoms when the fearful positioning is unwound, but it is not a guaranteed timing indicator. Q4: What is the difference between the options market and the spot market for Bitcoin? A4: The spot market involves the immediate buying and selling of actual Bitcoin. The options market deals in contracts that give the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell Bitcoin at a set price in the future. It is primarily used for hedging, speculation, and gauging market sentiment. Q5: What should traders watch following this fear signal? A5: Traders should monitor for a normalization of the delta skew back toward neutral levels, signs of accumulation in the spot market, and stability in funding rates for perpetual swaps. Additionally, broader macroeconomic indicators and traditional market performance will be key factors influencing Bitcoin’s next major trend.

While this level is keeping short-term downside in check, broader market pressure and weakening structure leave bears watching closely for a potential breakdown that could open the door to a deeper macro pullback. $2,600 Holds As Key Support On Ethereum 6H Chart On X, Can Özsüer highlighted that Ethereum is currently holding above the $2,600 support zone on the 6-hour chart, a level that has so far provided a solid base for price action. As long as ETH continues to defend this area and avoids a clear candle close below it, the broader structure remains constructive for a potential upside attempt. Related Reading: Ethereum Stalls In A Critical Zone As Breakout Structures Wait For Confirmation With support intact, the analyst pointed to a recovery toward $3,050, followed by a possible move into the $3,150 region. These zones are seen as logical reaction levels where price may either consolidate or face temporary resistance if buying momentum gradually strengthens. However, for Ethereum to unlock a more meaningful bullish continuation, Özsüer stated it must reclaim $3,350, referred to as box number two on the chart. A decisive close above this level, backed by strong volume, would open the door for higher price exploration. If ETH fails to break through that resistance, it could cap price and trigger another wave of selling. In that case, a deeper pullback toward the $2,400–$2,100 support range becomes a real possibility. Özsüer also shared that he has already taken a long position based on the $2,600 support on the 1-hour chart and is monitoring price closely, with plans to add to the position depending on how momentum develops. Loss Of $2,710 Targets The $2,620 Swing Low According to crypto analyst Ardi, Ethereum is currently sitting in a make-or-break area, with $2,710 standing out as a crucial short-term support level. A clean loss of this zone would likely accelerate downside pressure, placing the $2,620 swing low firmly in focus as the next area where liquidity could be tested. Related Reading: Ethereum Chart Turns Bullish: New Cycle Energy Points To $5,000 Ardi emphasized that the $2,450 region serves as the primary line of defense for the broader market structure. Holding this level would be essential to prevent a deeper structural breakdown, as a sustained move below it could push Ethereum into a far more vulnerable technical position. Compounding the downside risk, ETH/BTC remains in a strong downtrend, highlighting Ethereum’s ongoing underperformance relative to Bitcoin. This relative weakness suggests that volatility could stay elevated in the coming sessions, making the environment increasingly unstable for ETH holders.

As political gridlock threatens to close federal agencies starting January 31, platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi face unprecedented contract chaos, highlighting how varying definitions of basic events can undermine entire market ecosystems. Prediction Markets Face Contract Ambiguity Crisis The current political standoff centers on budget legislation. While the U.S. Senate passed a funding bill, the House of Representatives has not completed its vote. Consequently, a partial government shutdown appears imminent. Prediction markets, which allow users to bet on event outcomes, now confront a fundamental problem. Different contracts use varying criteria to define what officially constitutes a shutdown. Polymarket, a blockchain-based prediction platform, offers contracts based on Office of Management and Budget determinations. Meanwhile, Kalshi, a regulated U.S. platform, uses Congressional Research Service definitions. These differing standards create conflicting interpretations for identical outcomes. Consequently, the same political event could trigger opposite resolutions across platforms. This ambiguity reveals a critical vulnerability. Prediction markets depend on precise, binary outcomes for settlement. Without standardized definitions, contract reliability collapses. The current situation demonstrates how even seemingly straightforward events require extraordinary specificity in contract language. Structural Limitations in Decentralized Forecasting Prediction markets emerged as innovative tools for aggregating collective intelligence. Platforms like Polymarket leverage blockchain technology to create global, permissionless markets. Users trade shares representing event probabilities, theoretically creating efficient forecasting mechanisms. However, the government shutdown crisis exposes three structural limitations: Definitional Ambiguity: Basic terms like “government shutdown” lack universal definitions Resolution Source Conflicts: Different platforms rely on conflicting authoritative sources Temporal Discrepancies: Settlement timing varies across contracts and platforms These limitations become particularly problematic during fast-moving political events. A brief weekend shutdown might trigger some contracts while others remain unresolved. This inconsistency undermines market credibility and user trust. Furthermore, it creates arbitrage opportunities that distort price discovery mechanisms. Expert Analysis of Market Infrastructure Financial technology researchers have long warned about definitional challenges in prediction markets. Dr. Sarah Chen, a blockchain governance expert at Stanford University, explains the core issue. “Prediction markets face the oracle problem in reverse,” she notes. “Instead of bringing external data on-chain, they struggle to define what constitutes that external data in the first place.” This problem becomes acute during political events with multiple possible interpretations. The 2023 debt ceiling crisis similarly exposed definitional gaps. Some contracts settled based on Treasury Department announcements, while others used Congressional voting records. These discrepancies created settlement chaos that took weeks to resolve. The current shutdown threat follows a concerning pattern. Political polarization increases governance uncertainty. Consequently, prediction markets face more complex settlement scenarios. Without improved contract standardization, these platforms risk becoming unreliable for serious forecasting purposes. Comparative Analysis of Market Responses Different prediction platforms have developed distinct approaches to the shutdown threat. The table below illustrates key differences in contract design and resolution mechanisms: Platform Contract Basis Resolution Source Settlement Timing Polymarket OMB determination Designated reporters 24-48 hours after event Kalshi CRS definition Official government data Immediate upon confirmation PredictIt Media consensus Major news organizations Market operator decision These divergent approaches create market fragmentation. Users cannot easily compare probabilities across platforms. More importantly, they cannot assume consistent outcomes for identical events. This fragmentation undermines the fundamental premise of prediction markets as efficient information aggregation tools. The shutdown situation particularly highlights temporal discrepancies. A brief weekend closure might trigger immediate settlement on Kalshi but face delayed resolution on Polymarket. During this gap, market prices could diverge significantly despite representing the same underlying event probability. Historical Context and Evolution Prediction markets have evolved significantly since early platforms like the Iowa Electronic Markets. Blockchain technology enabled global, decentralized platforms with lower barriers to entry. However, contract standardization has not kept pace with technological innovation. Previous political events exposed similar issues. The 2020 presidential election created settlement controversies across multiple platforms. Some contracts used media projections while others waited for certified results. The 2022 FTX collapse similarly revealed vulnerabilities in crypto-based prediction markets. Each crisis prompted platform improvements, but fundamental challenges remain. The current shutdown threat represents another stress test for market infrastructure. How platforms respond will shape their credibility for future political forecasting. Regulatory considerations further complicate standardization efforts. U.S.-based platforms like Kalshi operate under CFTC regulations with specific requirements. Meanwhile, decentralized platforms like Polymarket face different legal constraints. These regulatory differences inevitably influence contract design and resolution mechanisms. Impact on Market Participants and Observers The contract ambiguity affects multiple stakeholder groups. Traders face uncertainty about settlement outcomes. Researchers struggle to interpret market signals. Policymakers cannot reliably use prediction markets as decision-support tools. This uncertainty has practical consequences. During the 2023 debt ceiling crisis, some institutional investors avoided prediction markets entirely due to settlement concerns. The current shutdown threat may further reduce institutional participation. Consequently, markets could become less efficient and more vulnerable to manipulation. Media organizations that report prediction market probabilities also face challenges. Without standardized contracts, they cannot accurately compare platforms or track consensus probabilities. This limitation reduces the journalistic utility of prediction market data during critical political events. Potential Solutions and Industry Responses Several approaches could address these structural limitations. Industry standardization efforts have emerged through organizations like the Prediction Market Industry Association. These groups work to develop common contract templates and resolution standards. Technical solutions also show promise. Oracle networks like Chainlink could provide standardized data feeds for event resolution. Smart contract improvements could enable more sophisticated conditional logic. However, these technical solutions still require consensus on fundamental definitions. Some platforms are exploring hybrid approaches. Polymarket recently introduced multi-source resolution mechanisms for high-profile events. These systems aggregate data from multiple authoritative sources before triggering settlement. While more complex, they reduce reliance on single points of failure. Regulatory clarity could also improve market structure. Clear guidelines from agencies like the CFTC might encourage standardization. However, excessive regulation could stifle innovation or push platforms to less regulated jurisdictions. Conclusion The looming U.S. government shutdown has exposed critical vulnerabilities in prediction markets. Contract ambiguity and definitional inconsistencies undermine market reliability during political crises. These structural flaws challenge the fundamental premise of decentralized forecasting platforms. While technological solutions and industry standardization offer potential improvements, the current crisis demonstrates that prediction markets still face fundamental design challenges. As political uncertainty increases globally, these platforms must address their structural limitations to maintain credibility and utility. The resolution of the current shutdown contracts will provide important lessons for future market design and contract specification in prediction markets. FAQs Q1: What are prediction markets and how do they work? Prediction markets are platforms where users trade contracts based on event outcomes. Prices reflect collective probability estimates, theoretically creating efficient forecasting mechanisms through market dynamics. Q2: Why does the US government shutdown create problems for prediction markets? Different platforms use varying definitions of what constitutes a shutdown, leading to conflicting contract resolutions for the same political event, which undermines market reliability and user trust. Q3: What is the difference between Polymarket and Kalshi in handling shutdown contracts? Polymarket typically uses Office of Management and Budget determinations, while Kalshi relies on Congressional Research Service definitions, creating potential settlement discrepancies between platforms. Q4: How have prediction markets handled similar political events in the past? Previous events like the 2020 election and 2023 debt ceiling crisis exposed similar definitional challenges, prompting some platform improvements but leaving fundamental structural issues unresolved. Q5: What solutions are being developed to address these prediction market vulnerabilities? Industry standardization efforts, technical improvements through oracle networks, hybrid resolution mechanisms, and regulatory clarity all represent potential approaches to improving contract reliability and market structure.

Under this agreement, a significant portion of funds was dedicated to Homeland Security. Moreover, the Congress was granted permission to hold talks on new restrictions on federal immigration raids countrywide. Meanwhile, in the event of the approaching potential shutdown , sources with knowledge of the matter mentioned that Trump struck this unusual deal with Senate Democrats in response to the two protesters’ deaths that resulted from federal agents’ action in Minneapolis. Individuals express tension regarding a potential government shutdown Reports from reliable sources indicated that the Trump-Democrats’ deal mandates that funds allocated to Homeland Security remain at their current level for two weeks while lawmakers examine the Democrats’ requests. These requests include: identifying agents, requiring more warrants, and allowing local authorities to assist in investigating incidents. Regarding the bill that was recently approved, sources revealed that it passed 71-29 and has now qualified for presentation to the House, which is scheduled to return on Monday next week. This situation indicates a high likelihood that a temporary partial shutdown will be implemented over the weekend until approval is granted. The news sparked tension among individuals who outlined several impacts of the government shutdown. In an attempt to calm their fears, Trump made clear his intention to prevent a shutdown and encouraged members of both parties to embrace the idea of a much-needed bipartisan ‘YES’ vote. Nonetheless, some Senate Republicans criticized the president’s concessions, consequently postponing the final vote. Their criticism also suggested that debates would occur over the next two weeks On the other hand, several Republicans expressed their belief that amendments to the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s operations are essential, even if they may not reach agreement on all Democratic suggestions. Meanwhile, amid uncertainties about the fate of a potential government shutdown, Rand Paul, an American politician serving as the junior US senator from Kentucky, commented on the topic . He asserted that, “I think the last few days have shown some improvement,” further adding that, “I feel like the tone has calmed down a bit in Minnesota.” Democrats raise concerns about the DHS’s funding Despite Paul’s remarks, furious Democrats have strongly opposed allocating funds to the Department of Homeland Security until new restrictions from Congress are in place. Notably, this limitation is set to be imposed on ICE and other federal agencies participating in enforcement actions. Concerning this condition raised, Chuck Schumer, the Senate Minority Leader in the United States Congress, argued that, “These are not extreme demands. They represent basic standards that the American people expect from law enforcement.” In the meantime, Democrats have urged the White House to halt city roving patrols and effectively join forces with local police on immigration arrests. This move involves establishing stricter guidelines for warrants. They also requested a comprehensive set of conduct guidelines to hold agents accountable for violating the rules. To elaborate on this point for better understanding, Schumer mentioned that agents should remove their masks, wear body cameras, and display proper identification, in accordance with standard law enforcement protocols.

Optimism price prediction for 2029 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $2.40. In 2032, OP tokens will range between $2.10 and $4.60, with an average value of $3.05. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2026 – 2032. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.2622 Market Cap $573.12M Trading Volume $74.91M Circulating Supply 1.944B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.2519 (Dec 26, 2025) 24-hour High $0.2694 24-hour Low $0.2599 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 6.63% (High) 50-Day SMA $0.3033 14-Day RSI 37.68 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 16 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.5019 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP remains structurally bearish across daily and 4-hour charts. Momentum and volume both favor continuation, not reversal. Only a reclaim above $0.28–$0.30 would neutralize downside risk. Optimism 1-day price chart As of January 31, 2026, OP is trading around $0.262, slipping another ~0.2% on the day and holding well below the daily mid-Bollinger Band near $0.31. Price has decisively broken the lower Bollinger Band and failed to reclaim it, signaling volatility expansion to the downside rather than exhaustion. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView From the recent swing high around $0.32, OP is down roughly 18%, with no meaningful bullish reaction so far. MACD remains deeply negative and widening, confirming downside momentum is still accelerating rather than stabilizing. The RSI at ~34 sits just above oversold, which means sellers are dominant but not yet forced to cover, keeping the risk of another leg toward $0.25–$0.24 alive if bids don’t step in soon. Optimism 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour timeframe, OP is consolidating bearishly around $0.262, capped below the Alligator averages clustered between $0.268–$0.28, which are fanning downward and reinforcing trend continuation. The sharp sell-off from $0.30 to $0.26 marked a clean impulsive move of about -13%, followed by weak sideways candles that resemble distribution rather than accumulation. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI near 32 remains suppressed, while OBV continues to grind lower, confirming that volume is still flowing out of the market and rallies are being sold into. Without a reclaim of $0.27, any bounce is likely corrective and short-lived. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3186 SELL SMA 5 $0.3096 SELL SMA 10 $0.3156 SELL SMA 21 $0.3195 SELL SMA 50 $0.3059 SELL SMA 100 $0.3505 SELL SMA 200 $0.5141 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3229 SELL EMA 5 $0.3199 SELL EMA 10 $0.3099 SELL EMA 21 $0.3008 BUY EMA 50 $0.3214 SELL EMA 100 $0.3925 SELL EMA 200 $0.5338 SELL What to expect from Optimism? Unless buyers aggressively defend $0.25, OP is more likely to drift lower or range weakly before any meaningful relief bounce, keeping downside pressure as the dominant theme. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

Optimism historic price sentiment Optimism price history by Coingecko OP launched with an initial value of $4.57 on May 31 but dropped sharply in June due to the UST stablecoin de-pegging and LUNA collapse, closing June at $0.5434. It further declined to $0.4147 by mid-July. In August, OP briefly surged above $1.90, but by mid-October, it dropped to $0.70 following the FTX collapse. In Q1 2023, OP surged past $3.00 during a crypto bull run but lost 66% shortly after. A recovery saw it close the year at $3.90. OP saw an eventful 2024, reaching an all-time high of $4.85 in March before sliding below $2.30 by mid-April. After a brief recovery to over $2.90 in May, it entered a bearish phase, trading at $1.82–$1.96 by July and $1.54–$1.62 by October. November brought a spark of hope with a peak at $2.60. OP closed December within the range of $1.611–$2.773. In January 2025, OP peaked at $2.18 but lost momentum, dropping to as low as $0.84 in February. OP peaked at $0.9346 in March, $0.8523 in May, $0.7478 in June, and in July, $0.86. In August, OP traded between $0.6178 and $0.880, and in September, it maintained an average price of $0.74. In November, OP traded between $0.2888 – $0.4516, and in December, the coin traded between $0.3117 – $0.3264. In January 2026, the coin is trading between $0.2599 and $0.2694.",Crypto Price Predictions|Optimism,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|ICO|LUNA|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH|OP|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-31 03:54:00

What The Derivatives Data Says,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-deleveraging-finally-over-derivatives-data/,"Bitcoin’s sharp slide to $81,119 on January 30 came with a derivatives-market gut punch: forced long closures spiked to extreme levels, yet perpetual funding stayed decisively positive. That mix is complicating a common read, whether the market has already “cleansed” leverage or is still set up for repeat liquidation waves. Is The Bitcoin Deleveraging Over? On-Chain analyst Axel Adler Jr., in his Morning Brief, pointed to a “cascade of forced closures” over the past 24 hours, with long liquidations dominating the tape. His liquidation dominance oscillator tracking the balance of long versus short liquidations, printed roughly 97%, while the 30-day moving average rose to 31.4%. In plain market-structure terms, that says deleveraging pressure has been heavily one-sided, not just on the day but as a sustained pattern through the last month. The reason traders watch extremes like this is the tendency for liquidation flows to cluster and then fade, creating room for near-term stabilization. Adler framed that dynamic cautiously, stressing that an “extreme” reading is not the same thing as confirmation that sellers are done. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is The Money Of The AI-Powered Economy: CryptoQuant CEO “Oscillator extremes often coincide with the culmination of forced selling and can lead to short-term stabilization. However, this is not a reversal signal without confirmations — for a sustainable ‘local bottom’ scenario, it is important to see at least normalization of the oscillator to zero or a decline in the 30-day average.” That sets the first condition for calling the deleveraging cycle “over”: the liquidation imbalance has to cool, rather than simply peak. The bigger tension in Adler’s read is that even after the washout in price and the liquidation cascade, funding remained positive: 43.2% annualized on the day, by his figures. While that’s well below the 100%+ annualized levels seen during October–November peaks, it still implies a market paying to stay long rather than getting paid to short. Funding doesn’t just reflect sentiment; it reflects positioning pressure. If funding refuses to flip despite a selloff, it can mean longs are rebuilding exposure quickly, or that the market never fully unwound bullish leverage in the first place. Adler’s conclusion is that the latter risk is still on the table. “Positive Funding amid massive liquidations increases the risk of repeated deleveraging: this means the market is recovering long positioning quickly enough or is not ready to fully unwind it. Complete ‘derivatives capitulation’ is often accompanied by Funding transitioning to neutral or negative territory — this has not happened yet.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Death Cross That Last Preceded A 66% Drop Is Back In other words, the liquidation event may have been violent, but the incentives embedded in perps are still leaning toward long demand. That matters because it keeps the same fragility in place: a fresh downside impulse can turn newly reloaded longs into liquidation fuel again. Adler summed up the combined signal from the two charts as a washout that may be intense, but not necessarily final. “Together, the two charts paint a picture of likely incomplete deleveraging: liquidations hit longs extremely hard, but overall positioning remains tilted bullish. The liquidation cascade (long dominance ~97%) is a symptom of market overload with long positions, but not necessarily final cleansing. Persistently positive Funding (43% annualized) may indicate that demand for long exposure is not broken, and the deleveraging process is not complete.” Until those confirmations show up, the base case in his briefing is less “final capitulation” and more “incomplete deleveraging”, a market that has already flushed leverage once, but may not be done if long appetite stays intact through drawdowns. At press time, BTC traded at $82,968.

According to a CryptoQuant report, the latest downturn unfolded alongside a broader cross-asset sell-off, where traditional safe havens and risk assets were both hit. Gold posted a sudden correction of roughly 8%, while silver dropped close to 12%. Bitcoin proved relatively more resilient, declining by around 9%, but it was not insulated from the wider liquidation wave. US equities also weakened, with both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq participating in the move lower, reinforcing the idea of a synchronized risk-off event rather than an isolated crypto-specific shock. The initial trigger came from announcements linked to Microsoft, particularly around its artificial intelligence investments. The news drove Microsoft shares down by more than 12%, setting off a domino effect across global markets as investors rapidly reduced exposure to crowded growth and technology trades. That repricing quickly spilled over into crypto derivatives. Despite Bitcoin’s comparatively modest price decline, the leverage embedded in the market amplified the impact. Nearly $300 million in long positions were liquidated within a few hours. Hyperliquid absorbed the largest share, with $87.1 million in longs wiped out, while Binance recorded roughly $30 million. The episode highlights how fragile positioning and elevated leverage can transform moderate price moves into significant liquidation events across the crypto market. Leverage Rebuild Signals Persistent Risk Appetite Despite the recent drawdowns, leverage remains a defining feature of the current crypto market structure. According to top analyst Darkfost, many investors continue to pursue market exposure through high leverage, creating conditions where relatively small price moves can trigger sharp bursts of volatility. These moves are frequently amplified by liquidation cascades, as forced position closures accelerate downside momentum. Crucially, this behavior persists even after the October 10 event, which previously led to a significant destruction of liquidity and capital across the market. The persistence of this risk appetite is clearly visible in derivatives data. A useful way to isolate true positioning trends is to examine open interest expressed in BTC terms rather than notional value. By doing so, the distortion caused by price fluctuations is removed, offering a clearer picture of how much exposure traders are actually carrying. This approach highlights whether leverage is genuinely being rebuilt or merely appears higher due to price effects. Viewed through this lens, open interest on Binance stands at approximately 123,500 BTC. This already exceeds the level recorded just before the October 10 sell-off, when open interest had fallen to around 93,600 BTC. The increase of roughly 31% since that low indicates that risk appetite has gradually returned. Rather than a crypto market operating defensively, current positioning suggests that leverage is once again accumulating, leaving prices vulnerable to further volatility if sentiment shifts abruptly. Bitcoin Tests Key Support as Downtrend Pressure Persists Bitcoin’s price action continues to reflect a fragile and corrective market structure. After failing to reclaim the $95,000–$100,000 region, BTC has extended its pullback and is now trading near the $82,800 area, marking a clear breakdown from the recent consolidation range. The move lower is occurring below the short- and medium-term moving averages, with price firmly capped by the declining 50-day and 100-day averages, reinforcing the loss of upside momentum. The 200-day moving average remains well above current levels, highlighting the broader deterioration in trend strength since the October peak. Structurally, Bitcoin has transitioned from higher highs to a pattern of lower highs and lower lows, signaling that sellers continue to control rallies rather than buyers defending breakouts. Volume spikes during sell-offs, particularly in November and December, suggest distribution rather than healthy rotation. The $82,000–$85,000 zone now stands out as a critical support area. A sustained hold could allow for short-term stabilization or range formation, but a decisive breakdown would expose deeper downside toward the $78,000–$80,000 region, where previous demand emerged. On the upside, any recovery attempt is likely to face immediate resistance near $88,000–$90,000, followed by stronger supply closer to $95,000.

A recent price analysis of silver revealed that the metal is trading at two different prices simultaneously. The report highlighted that the precious metal is trading at around $92 in the U.S. (COMEX), while physical Silver in Shanghai, China, costs $130, a 40% premium in the Asian country. In the U.S., silver trading is dominated by paper contracts that track the metal’s price, and most of the volume is not real silver being bought or sold. The paper-to-physical ratio of America is estimated at around 350:1, meaning that for every real ounce traded, there are more than 350 paper claims. Since paper trading accounts for a large share of Silver’s trading volume in the U.S., large institutions can sell large contracts of Silver, significantly lowering its floor price even though physical Silver is still tight and does not need to be sold. Physical Silver prices in Shanghai remain at ATHs despite recent correction In Shanghai, where SMM prices reflect actual physical transactions inside China, Silver is currently trading at $120, with Shanghai spot prices bursting to $130. The prices reflect growing demand for physical Silver, but paper trading prices in the U.S. have been massively discounted. The widening gap between Silver prices on the U.S. COMEX and the Shanghai market shows that negative prices are influencing Silver prices in paper trading despite the underlying value of physical silver rising. 🚨JUST IN: Silver has fallen 34% in the last 24 hours, hitting $74 and marking its largest single-day decline on record. pic.twitter.com/eMPZK9tMSP — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) January 30, 2026 In January alone, Silver has risen by more than 60% and logged a 140% gain in 2025. The price of Silver futures contracts has plummeted by a staggering 34% over 24 hours, hitting a $74 low last seen in early January as the market was going higher. The significant drop in Silver futures prices marked the largest single-day decline the metal has ever experienced. Gold also suffered the same fate. The precious metal had nearly doubled over the past 12 months, breaking a record above $5,000 per ounce for the first time and briefly trading near $5,600. After successfully racing to all-time highs, Gold dropped significantly from a high of $5,597.04 to a low of $4,686.12 in less than 24 hours. The dramatic drop experienced by the two metals wiped out over $3 trillion in less than 24 hours. Many investors and retail traders were left disoriented by the speed and scale of the price decline. Experts believe a correction in precious metals was inevitable The metals have been haven assets for investors and traders as geopolitical tensions, currency weakness, record government debt, and trade wars in the U.S., China, and Europe escalated. Which begs the question, why the significant drop? Was it market manipulation? Well, gold and silver had been used by long-term investors as a hedge against inflation. However, by January, the precious metals were no longer simply reflecting geopolitical risk or inflation hedging. They had become part of a broader “risk-off but momentum-on” trade, sitting alongside crowded, leveraged, and flow-driven positioning. Experts highlight that when markets reach this stage, a correction is due any moment, and the market is a ticking time bomb. After the collapse, Ole S Hansen, Saxo Bank’s head of commodity strategy, wrote on X that Silver “can rally but only for so long without eventually killing demand and causing a rush of supply from scrap sellers.” He then said that Gold will remain the ultimate haven. In another X post, Hansen cited COT on Silver and wrote that Hedge Funds and large financial institutions are concerned by worsening trading conditions on Silver. He added that these large market participants reduced their net long positions by one-third in the week to last Tuesday. While some argue that the precious metals market is currently under deep manipulation, others say it was a normal, classic crowded-trade correction. Precious metal prices had risen too far, too fast, triggering profit-taking and forced selling. Similar occurrences have played out repeatedly across various asset classes such as tech stocks, cryptocurrencies, and commodities. Precious metals are not immune to market dynamics.

In the span of just 72 hours or so, the asset plummeted to numerous consecutive all-time lows. The latest anti-record came on January 29 at $0.1589 (CoinGecko data), which means that PI has lost 94.5% of its value since late February 2025, when it charted an all-time high at $2.99. Given its spectacular demise and most recent correction, we decided to ask Gemini about its take on the week ahead and whether there is any hope left for PI token holders. What’s Ahead for PI? Before it indulged in answering what the future holds for PI, the popular AI solution weighed in on the possible reasons behind its most recent crash. It noted that it’s a combination of factors, not all related to the overall market weakness. As an example, it said some whales and long-term project supporters have abandoned ship after years of failed promises and lack of actual development. “On-chain data and volume metrics suggest that the few “whales” (large holders of the IOU pairs) have stopped defending the price. Volume has dried up, leaving only retail panic-sellers.” On the actual question in hand, Gemini warned that another decline to $0.12-$0.14 is not entirely out of the question. After all, PI has lost all support levels on its way down, and there are no actual defense zones left. The Actual Warning Gemini was quite skeptical about PI’s future price performance, at least in the next week or so. It admitted that after such a profound price correction, the token might be due for an instant rebound to somewhere around $0.18. However, this is likely to be a “dead cat bounce” because of oversold RSI levels. A potential jump to those levels would allow the bears to “aggressively short” the asset, which will lead to an immediate and violent rejection that will “roll PI over to test $0.14 by the end of the week.” “When an asset breaks an ATL, it typically drops another 15-20% before finding a temporary bottom. There is zero volume support below $0.16.” Consequently, Gemini warned investors who are considering buying the dip to wait for a few days for the dust to settle, perhaps to find support at $0.16, before investing.

MSTR's market-adjusted net asset value (mNAV) has declined to 1.07, making further equity issuance more dilutive and less accretive for BTC purchases. The 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred (STRD) offers substantial income with clearly defined risks, though coupon suspension remains a remote concern. Strategy's ( MSTR ) Bitcoin-as-a-Treasury (""BaaT"") business model has dramatically imploded on the back of a 58% decline over the last 1-year. This has broadly eliminated an inherent tentpole premium that has formed a currency for MSTR's rapid accumulation of BTC since a sleepy enterprise software company operating out of Tyson's Corner, Virginia, decided to buy and hold BTC on its balance sheet in the summer of 2020. This new zeitgeist represents MSTR's most intense stress test. It could really come to represent a permanent step change in the company's prospects, a rollback of the highly lucrative BTC accumulation strategy that allowed the constant issuance of new common equity to buy BTC. This strategy has been ruthlessly effective, allowing MSTR to increase its BTC holdings to 712,647 as of its most recent dashboard update. Strategy Business Wire Strategy This is valued at $63.64 billion with BTC currently trading for roughly $89,294. Critically, with MSTR's enterprise value at $68.21 billion, the company's market-adjusted net asset value (""mNAV"") has dipped to 1.07. This captures MSTR's enterprise value in relation to the value of its BTC holdings. A figure greater than 1x means the company can sell its common shares through its at-the-market offering program at a cadence that optimises its BTC yield. This yield is a measure of the percentage change in BTC owned per share in comparison to the ramp-up in shareholder dilution. MSTR's BTC yield since the start of 2026 is currently running at 0.4% , just 40 basis points above zero. This is markedly lower than a BTC yield through 2025 that came in at 22.8%. The company closed out 2024 with a BTC yield of 74.3% . I last covered MSTR with a hold rating. Strategy Beyond A Future Crypto Winter And The Non-Cumulative Perpetual Stride Preferreds Data by YCharts Data by YCharts MSTR's weighted average common shares outstanding have increased by 148.8% over the last three years, an annual pace of dilution of just under 50% per year. Critically, the company's strategy made sense when this pace of dilution was completed at a BTC yield of 74.3%. The impact of diminishing mNAV is one where MSTR's core investment proposition is fundamentally eroded. The worst-case scenario for the company centers on a possible prolonged BTC winter being paired with an mNAV that's below 1x. MSTR is planning for this scenario, and in December, updated the market that it had built a $2.2 billion cash buffer to support the continued payment of the coupon payments on its preferreds. MSTR faces annual dividend payments of at least $880 million on its universe of preferreds. QuantumOnline Seeking Alpha This sets up the company's 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock ( STRD ) as a possible investment at its current level. These are currently swapping hands for $72.83 per share, an 27% discount to their $100 per share liquidation value. However, this discount does not matter as much. They're perpetual and not callable. Hence, the probability of MSTR redeeming these at their liquidation value is near-zero. The uncertainty is whether the company can continue to meet the annual $10 per share coupon payments. The cash reserves mean MSTR has at least two and a half years of coupon payments, which places its 13.7% current dividend yield in focus. However, they're non-cumulative and were sold at $85 per share when they IPOed, a discount of 15% to their liquidation price. I considered these versus ( STRK ), which pays out an $8 per share annual coupon for a 9.4% current yield. They're also cumulative and trade higher at $85 per share due to this feature. However, I view the risk of a coupon suspension on the non-cumulative STRD as extremely low. Seeking Alpha STRD is the only one of MSTR's outstanding preferreds that are non-cumulative, which does amp up their risk profile. This is compounded by the company's lack of cash flow, with MSTR's currency lying entirely with the value of its commons and preferreds. The company needs to be able to continue to issue these to maintain a going concern with its BaaT strategy. This strategy would fall apart if, after 2.5 years of a BTC winter, MSTR suspends STRD's coupon. I'd view such a move as triggering significant cross-selling, spiking yields across its capital stack, and tanking demand for its preferreds. This would limit the company's access to the depth of institutional capital needed to maintain BTC purchases. Conclusion MSTR's ongoing selloff is either a more permanent reorientation of capital away from the ticker or a transient disallocation that could represent a buying opportunity for BTC bulls. I keep my rating as a hold. Bears would be right to state that even if BTC does expand, the company's mNAV could still trade on the narrower premium it currently does versus its historical average. This would limit overall upside on the commons. STRD provides bulls a way to earn an income with limited risk of a suspension through to 2028. MSTR has also stated that it will liquidate its BTC holdings to maintain its coupon payments in the event its mNAV dips below 1x. This cash reserve, BTC holdings, and continued access to liquidity keep MSTR rated as a hold.",MSTR|STRD|STRK,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2026-01-31 04:52:07

On-chain data shows approximately 101 billion SHIB tokens were removed from centralized platforms during this period. The movement represents a notable change in holder behavior for the meme cryptocurrency. Exchange outflows typically signal reduced selling pressure. When investors move tokens to private wallets, they generally indicate longer holding intentions. This contrasts sharply with tokens remaining on exchanges, which often precede sell-offs. The magnitude of this outflow marks a departure from recent months. SHIB has faced consistent distribution pressure since late 2024. The current shift suggests holders are adopting a different strategy regarding their positions. Price Action Forms Critical Pattern SHIB is currently trading within a tightening triangle on technical charts. The pattern shows converging trendlines with lower highs and marginally higher lows. Such structures frequently precede significant price movements in either direction. The consolidation phase indicates weakening downward momentum. Sellers have struggled to push prices substantially lower during recent attempts. Each successive dip meets increased buying activity, demonstrating growing absorption at current levels. Despite this stabilization, longer timeframes still display bearish characteristics. Declining moving averages create overhead resistance zones. Any upward breakout attempt will likely face immediate friction from these technical barriers. Exchange metrics provide additional context for the price behavior. Total reserves on centralized platforms have decreased slightly alongside negative netflow readings. Inflow and outflow volumes remain elevated, suggesting active portfolio repositioning rather than market stagnation. Implications for Supply Dynamics The sustained outflow trend could reshape SHIB's supply-demand balance. Large-scale participants appear to be accumulating positions or establishing defensive holdings. While this activity does not guarantee immediate price appreciation, it establishes groundwork for potential trend reversals. Reduced exchange liquidity constrains bearish control. When fewer tokens remain available for immediate sale, downward price pressure naturally diminishes. Continued outflows through the weekend would further tighten circulating supply on trading platforms.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-31 04:55:01

Metrics Climb Even As AVAX Suffers Steep Q4 Decline According to Messari, Avalanche’s native token, AVAX, experienced a steep decline during the final quarter of the year. The token fell 59.0% quarter‑over‑quarter (QoQ) and 65.5% year‑over‑year (YoY), dropping from around $30.00 at the end of Q3 in September to approximately $12.30 by the close of Q4. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slides Toward $85,000 Despite Progress On US Crypto Market Structure Bill Avalanche’s circulating market capitalization mirrored that drop, falling 58.3% QoQ and 63.9% YoY from $12.7 billion to $5.3 billion. Yet, the decline in valuation also impacted Avalanche’s relative standing among digital assets. AVAX slipped from 14th to 21st place in rankings by circulating market cap over the quarter. Despite this, Messari highlighted that network usage continued to expand, effectively breaking the typical link between token price performance and network fees. While total fees measured in US dollars declined 11.7% QoQ, that drop was modest compared with the 59.0% fall in AVAX’s price. In native terms, fees paid on the network increased meaningfully. Fees denominated in AVAX rose 24.9% QoQ, climbing from 105,719 AVAX to 132,016 AVAX. Average daily transactions on the C‑Chain jumped 63% to 2.1 million, while a wave of liquidations during the market crash on October 10, 2025, generated $520,715 in transaction fees. Messari noted that this was the highest single‑day fee total recorded on Avalanche since February 2024. Avalanche Sees Record Transaction And User Activity Looking more broadly, Avalanche’s ecosystem reached new activity highs in Q4 2025. Aggregate usage across the C‑Chain and all Avalanche Layer‑1 networks accelerated sharply. Average daily transactions increased 4.5% QoQ and surged 1,162.1% YoY to 38.2 million. At the same time, average daily active addresses climbed 25.1% QoQ and an extraordinary 16,360.3% YoY, reaching 24.7 million. Activity on the C‑Chain alone reached historic levels. Average daily transactions rose 69.0% QoQ and 799.3% YoY, making Q4 2025 the busiest quarter on record for the chain. Staking metrics, however, reflected the pressure from falling prices. The total USD value of staked AVAX declined 59.9% QoQ and 69.1% YoY to $2.3 billion, largely tracking the token’s price drop. Rising DeFi Base And Major RWA Growth Avalanche’s decentralized finance ecosystem also continued to evolve despite market headwinds. Messari reported that the DeFi Diversity Score, which measures how many protocols account for 90% of total value locked, rose 5.9% QoQ and 63.6% YoY, increasing from 17.0 to 18.0. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Loss Begins To Rise, Raising Early Bear Market Concerns Total DeFi TVL across Avalanche L1s and the C‑Chain declined 41.9% QoQ and 3.8% YoY, falling from $2.2 billion to $1.3 billion. At the same time, the network’s stablecoin market cap grew modestly, increasing 1.7% QoQ and 24.3% YoY to $1.8 billion. As seen in the chart above, measured in AVAX rather than dollars, native DeFi TVL rose 34.5% QoQ to 97.5 million AVAX, even as USD‑denominated TVL fell 44.9%. Messari explained that this divergence occurred because AVAX’s price declined faster than the underlying value held within DeFi protocols.

The bill, which aims to establish clear federal rules for how cryptocurrencies are regulated and traded, is viewed as a turning point for crypto assets like XRP that have long operated in regulatory gray zones. A yes vote would not just represent a political milestone; it could materially alter how XRP is valued, traded, and adopted across the US market. What’s Happening With The Crypto Market Structure Bill? The Crypto Market Structure bill is designed to create a clear federal regulatory framework for digital assets, giving oversight of spot markets to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and defining rules for trading platforms, brokers, and dealers. Notably, the legislation has been advancing through committees, most recently the Senate Agriculture Committee. At the moment, the bill has cleared the Senate Agriculture Committee along strict party lines, but it has not yet been voted on by the full Senate. The Senate Agriculture Committee voted 12-11 along party lines to move its version of the bill forward after weeks of debate and amendment negotiations. All Democrats on the committee opposed it, meaning it passed only with Republican support. On timing, senators and policy advisers have suggested that a floor vote by the Senate Banking Committee could happen later in the winter or early spring, possibly in February or March 2026. After this, the two committee versions can be reconciled into a single text that both parties can back. However, the full Senate vote on the legislation might not come until sometime around early July. What Will Happen To The XRP Price? XRP’s price history has been heavily influenced by regulatory questions and debates over whether it should be treated like a security. The cryptocurrency secured a regulatory victory in 2023 when a judge ruled that XRP was not a security in and of itself. If the Senate passes the market structure bill, the clearer assignment of oversight to a single regulator would reduce that uncertainty. XRP would be valued more on usage and adoption, and that would remove the regulatory risk that has weighed on its price. Unsurprisingly, this is the dominant sentiment among XRP investors and other crypto market investors. One XRP commentator, known as Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) on the social media platform X, noted that XRP is going to pump so hard if the Crypto Market Structure bill passes. Still, the longer-term impact on XRP will depend on how the regulatory framework is implemented and how quickly exchanges, institutions, and developers adapt. The bill would require the backing of at least seven Democrats in the Senate before it can eventually go to US President Donald Trump for approval. Republican lawmakers like John Boozman, backing the bill, say it is necessary to create clear rules for digital asset markets. Opposing Democrats say the bill lacks important rules to prevent conflicts of interest involving political figures and crypto holdings.

This persistent trend, primarily driven by massive withdrawals from BlackRock’s industry-leading IBIT fund, signals a potential recalibration of institutional and retail sentiment following the initial euphoria of ETF approvals. The sustained outflows present a critical data point for analysts tracking the maturation and volatility of crypto-based financial products in the mainstream investment landscape. Bitcoin ETF Outflows: A Detailed Breakdown of the Data Farside Investors, a trusted source for ETF flow data, provided the granular figures that illuminate this trend. The total net outflow of $509.7 million represents the aggregate movement of capital across all approved U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, the story is not one of uniform retreat. A deeper analysis reveals a bifurcated market. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) bore the brunt of the selling pressure, experiencing a single-day outflow of $528.3 million. This massive movement from the largest fund by assets under management (AUM) single-handedly defined the day’s negative net figure. Conversely, several other prominent funds managed to attract modest inflows, demonstrating that investor appetite has not vanished entirely. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) saw an inflow of $7.3 million. Similarly, Ark Invest’s ARKB and VanEck’s Bitcoin Strategy ETF (HODL) recorded inflows of $8.3 million and $3 million, respectively. This divergence highlights a selective reallocation of capital rather than a wholesale exit from the Bitcoin ETF space. Market analysts often scrutinize such flow data for clues about investor confidence and strategic positioning. The Broader Context of Sustained Capital Flight Four consecutive days of net outflows represent a notable departure from the patterns observed in the immediate aftermath of the SEC’s landmark approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024. Initially, these products witnessed record-breaking inflows as institutional and retail investors gained a regulated, familiar avenue for Bitcoin exposure. The recent reversal prompts an examination of contributing macroeconomic and crypto-specific factors. For instance, shifting interest rate expectations, broader equity market volatility, or profit-taking after a significant Bitcoin price rally could all influence ETF flow dynamics. Furthermore, the structure of these ETFs means flows have a direct, albeit sometimes delayed, impact on the underlying Bitcoin market. Authorized Participants (APs) create and redeem ETF shares in response to demand. Sustained outflows typically require the AP to sell Bitcoin from the trust’s holdings to raise cash for redemptions, potentially exerting downward pressure on Bitcoin’s spot price. This mechanism creates a tangible link between ETF investor behavior and cryptocurrency market liquidity. Expert Analysis on Fund Performance Divergence The stark contrast between IBIT’s large outflow and the small inflows into competitors like FBTC and ARKB invites expert scrutiny. Financial analysts point to several plausible explanations. First, IBIT’s immense size makes it a natural vehicle for large institutional trades, which can appear as dramatic single-day movements. A major investor rebalancing a portfolio or taking profits could account for the bulk of the $528.3 million outflow. Second, fee structures differ between funds. While competition has driven fees down across the board, even minor basis point differences can influence decisions for cost-sensitive, long-term holders. Third, marketing and distribution channels vary. Some funds may have stronger relationships with specific brokerage platforms or financial advisors, leading to more stable, recurring investment patterns. Finally, the “first-mover” advantage has evolved. Early inflows concentrated in the largest, most recognizable names like BlackRock and Fidelity. Now, the market may be entering a phase where performance, brand loyalty, and strategic fit cause capital to circulate among the various options. This rotation is a normal characteristic of a maturing financial product ecosystem. Historical Precedents and Market Maturation Experienced market observers note that volatility in fund flows is not unique to cryptocurrency ETFs. Traditional gold ETFs, often cited as a comparative asset class, have experienced similar periods of prolonged outflows during risk-on market environments or when the dollar strengthens. The current trend in Bitcoin ETFs could be interpreted as a sign of normalization, where the product is reacting to traditional financial signals rather than operating in a crypto-only vacuum. This integration, while sometimes painful in the short term, is a necessary step for long-term legitimacy. A timeline of events provides crucial context. Following the January 2024 launch, inflows remained robust for months. The recent multi-day outflow sequence, beginning in late January 2025, coincides with a period of consolidation for Bitcoin’s price after a strong quarterly performance. Key data points to consider include: Launch Phase (2024): Record inflows, establishing multi-billion-dollar AUM. Growth Phase (Mid-2024): Steady inflows with occasional single-day outflows. Consolidation Phase (Early 2025): Emergence of multi-day outflow trends, indicating price sensitivity and profit-taking. This evolution suggests the market is developing a more nuanced relationship with these instruments, moving past the initial novelty phase. Potential Impacts on Investors and the Crypto Ecosystem The immediate impact of these outflows is twofold. For direct ETF investors, net asset value (NAV) may experience tracking deviation pressure if Bitcoin sales to meet redemptions occur during periods of low liquidity. For the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, large-scale selling from ETF trusts removes a source of consistent buy-side demand that had been a supportive market feature. However, it also demonstrates the efficiency of the ETF structure in reflecting real-time investor sentiment, providing transparency that was previously lacking. Regulators and policymakers also monitor this data closely. Sustained outflows following a period of gains could be viewed as evidence of a functioning, rational market rather than a speculative bubble. Conversely, they will watch for signs of destabilizing feedback loops. The data underscores the importance of investor education regarding the inherent volatility of Bitcoin and the funds that track it, a point consistently emphasized by fund issuers in their risk disclosures. Conclusion The fourth consecutive day of net outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, culminating in a $509.7 million withdrawal on January 30, 2025, represents a pivotal moment of market reflection. Driven largely by a significant capital movement from BlackRock’s IBIT, this trend highlights the evolving and sometimes turbulent integration of cryptocurrency products into traditional finance. While selective inflows into other funds show lingering demand, the overall pattern signals a shift from unidirectional optimism to a more balanced, reactive market phase. Analyzing these Bitcoin ETF outflows remains essential for understanding institutional sentiment, market maturity, and the complex interplay between new financial vehicles and the volatile asset they represent. FAQs Q1: What does “net outflow” mean for a Bitcoin ETF? A1: A net outflow occurs when the total dollar value of shares redeemed by investors exceeds the total dollar value of new shares purchased in a single day. It indicates more money is leaving the fund than entering it. Q2: Why is BlackRock’s IBIT seeing such large outflows compared to other funds? A2: As the largest Bitcoin ETF by assets, IBIT is a natural holding for big institutional trades. A single large investor rebalancing or taking profits can create a significant outflow figure. Its size amplifies these movements relative to smaller competitors. Q3: Do ETF outflows directly cause Bitcoin’s price to drop? A3: They can create selling pressure. To meet redemption requests, Authorized Participants may need to sell Bitcoin from the fund’s holdings on the open market. This increased supply, if not met with equal demand, can contribute to a price decline. Q4: Is a four-day outflow trend unusual for a new financial product? A4: Not necessarily. New exchange-traded products often experience high volatility in flows as the market finds equilibrium. Similar patterns have been observed in the early days of gold, commodity, and other niche ETFs. Q5: Should investors be concerned about these outflows? A5: Investors should view this data as one indicator among many. Outflows reflect short-term sentiment and profit-taking. Long-term investment theses should be based on fundamentals like adoption trends, technology development, and portfolio strategy, not isolated flow data.

This substantial whale activity, documented by leading on-chain analytics firm Santiment, reveals a striking divergence between institutional-scale investors and retail participants. Meanwhile, this accumulation pattern creates potentially ideal conditions for market recovery according to blockchain analysts. Cardano Whales Execute Strategic 455M ADA Accumulation Santiment’s comprehensive blockchain analysis reveals a clear accumulation trend among addresses holding between 100,000 and 100 million ADA tokens. These substantial holders, commonly called “whales” in cryptocurrency terminology, have significantly increased their positions during the observed period. Specifically, their collective holdings grew by approximately 455 million ADA, representing a notable percentage of Cardano’s circulating supply. This accumulation activity demonstrates several important market dynamics. First, it shows sustained buying pressure from sophisticated investors despite broader market conditions. Second, it indicates growing confidence in Cardano’s underlying technology and development roadmap. Third, it suggests these large holders perceive current ADA prices as representing long-term value. The accumulation occurred primarily between March and April 2025, according to timestamped blockchain data. During this timeframe, ADA experienced price fluctuations typical of cryptocurrency markets. However, whale addresses consistently added to their positions rather than distributing tokens. This behavior contrasts sharply with retail investor patterns during the same period. Understanding Whale Behavior and Market Impact Cryptocurrency whales typically possess substantial market influence due to their large holdings. Their trading decisions often signal broader market sentiment and can impact price discovery mechanisms. Santiment’s analysis specifically highlights addresses in the 100,000 to 100 million ADA range, representing mid-to-large tier whales rather than the absolute largest holders. These accumulation patterns matter for several reasons: Market Sentiment Indicator: Whale accumulation often precedes positive price movements Supply Distribution: Concentration changes affect market liquidity and volatility Network Health: Large holders typically demonstrate long-term commitment Institutional Interest: Accumulation may signal growing professional investment Historical data from previous market cycles shows similar whale accumulation often occurring before significant price appreciation. For instance, during 2020-2021, sustained whale accumulation preceded Cardano’s substantial price increase. Analysts monitor these patterns as potential leading indicators of market direction. Expert Analysis of Accumulation Patterns Blockchain analysts emphasize the importance of context when interpreting whale accumulation data. Santiment’s researchers note that whale buying during retail selling periods frequently creates favorable conditions for market rebounds. This divergence between investor groups suggests different time horizons and risk assessments. Several factors potentially drive this accumulation behavior: Potential Drivers of Whale Accumulation Factor Description Market Impact Technical Development Cardano’s ongoing upgrades and ecosystem growth Long-term value proposition Market Positioning Strategic accumulation at perceived value prices Reduced selling pressure Portfolio Rebalancing Institutional investors adjusting cryptocurrency exposure Increased professional participation Network Fundamentals Growing decentralized applications and total value locked Enhanced utility demand Market analysts compare current whale behavior to historical patterns. Previous accumulation phases often correlated with subsequent price appreciation, though past performance never guarantees future results. The scale of current accumulation—455 million ADA—represents significant capital deployment given current market valuations. Retail Versus Whale Dynamics in Cryptocurrency Markets The divergence between whale accumulation and potential retail selling creates interesting market dynamics. Santiment’s observation about ideal rebound conditions stems from basic market mechanics. When sophisticated investors accumulate while less informed participants sell, supply typically moves from weak to strong hands. This transfer often stabilizes prices and reduces panic selling during market downturns. Several metrics support this analysis: Exchange Flows: Net movements from exchanges to private wallets Address Growth: Increasing number of non-zero balance addresses Transaction Volume: Large transfers between whale addresses Holder Distribution: Changing concentration among address groups Retail investors frequently react differently to market conditions than institutional counterparts. They often exhibit more emotional trading behavior and shorter time horizons. This psychological difference creates opportunities for patient, well-capitalized investors to accumulate assets during periods of market fear or uncertainty. Cardano’s Fundamental Developments During Accumulation Period While whale accumulation captures attention, Cardano’s fundamental developments provide essential context. During the two-month accumulation period, the Cardano ecosystem continued evolving through several important milestones. The network maintained its robust security model while expanding decentralized application capabilities. Key developments included: Continued growth of decentralized finance applications Expansion of Cardano’s smart contract capabilities Increasing total value locked across various protocols Ongoing research and development through IOG These fundamental improvements potentially influenced whale accumulation decisions. Sophisticated investors typically consider both technical analysis and fundamental developments when making allocation decisions. Cardano’s methodical development approach and academic rigor appeal to certain investor profiles seeking blockchain projects with strong foundations. Broader Cryptocurrency Market Context The Cardano whale accumulation occurs within a broader cryptocurrency market environment. Global macroeconomic factors, regulatory developments, and technological innovations all influence investor behavior. During the accumulation period, cryptocurrency markets experienced typical volatility alongside evolving institutional adoption. Several market-wide factors potentially contributed to accumulation patterns: Evolving regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions Increasing traditional finance cryptocurrency integration Technological advancements across multiple blockchain networks Macroeconomic conditions affecting risk asset allocations Analysts monitor whale behavior across multiple cryptocurrencies for broader market insights. Coordinated accumulation patterns sometimes signal sector-wide positioning rather than project-specific confidence. However, Cardano’s substantial accumulation stands out even within this broader context, suggesting particular conviction among its largest holders. Conclusion The substantial Cardano whale accumulation of 455 million ADA over two months represents a significant market development with potential implications for ADA’s price trajectory. Santiment’s data reveals sophisticated investors increasing positions while retail participants potentially distribute holdings, creating conditions historically associated with market rebounds. This accumulation occurs alongside Cardano’s continued fundamental development and within a broader cryptocurrency market experiencing growing institutional participation. While whale activity provides valuable market signals, investors should consider multiple data points and conduct independent research before making financial decisions. The divergence between whale and retail behavior highlights differing investment time horizons and risk assessments within cryptocurrency markets. FAQs Q1: What defines a Cardano whale in this context? Santiment’s analysis specifically examines addresses holding between 100,000 and 100 million ADA tokens. These substantial holders significantly influence market dynamics through their trading decisions and accumulation patterns. Q2: How does whale accumulation potentially lead to market rebounds? When sophisticated investors accumulate during retail selling, supply moves from weak to strong hands. This transfer typically reduces panic selling pressure and creates more stable price foundations, potentially enabling rebounds. Q3: What time period does this accumulation cover? The documented accumulation of 455 million ADA occurred over approximately two months, specifically between March and April 2025, according to timestamped blockchain data analyzed by Santiment. Q4: How significant is 455 million ADA in market terms? This accumulation represents substantial capital deployment given current ADA valuations. It indicates strong conviction among large holders and represents a notable percentage of Cardano’s circulating supply. Q5: Should retail investors mimic whale accumulation patterns? While whale activity provides valuable market signals, retail investors have different risk profiles, time horizons, and capital constraints. Independent research and consideration of personal financial situations remain essential before making investment decisions.

This pivotal development marks the second consecutive trading day of investor withdrawals, according to definitive data from Farside Investors. Consequently, market observers are now scrutinizing the resilience of cryptocurrency investment vehicles in a dynamic regulatory and macroeconomic landscape. Analyzing the January 30 Ethereum ETF Outflow Data The daily net outflow figure provides a clear snapshot of market sentiment. Specifically, the $252.9 million withdrawal was not evenly distributed. Instead, two industry titans led the exodus. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) accounted for the majority, with outflows hitting $157.2 million. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Ethereum Fund (FETH) saw $95.7 million leave its coffers. This data immediately raises questions about short-term profit-taking versus a broader shift in asset allocation. To provide context, the following table breaks down the reported outflows from the leading funds: ETF Provider Fund Ticker Reported Net Outflow (Jan. 30) BlackRock ETHA $157.2 million Fidelity FETH $95.7 million Total Market Outflow $252.9 million Furthermore, this activity follows a pattern established just one day prior. Therefore, analysts are examining whether this constitutes a brief correction or the start of a more sustained trend. The convergence of outflows from multiple major funds suggests a coordinated, though not necessarily collusive, reaction among institutional and sophisticated retail investors. Broader Market Context and Potential Drivers Understanding these Ethereum ETF outflows requires looking beyond a single data point. Several interconnected factors in early 2025 likely influenced investor behavior. First, broader cryptocurrency market volatility often triggers reactions in correlated ETF products. Second, shifting interest rate expectations or macroeconomic data releases can alter risk appetites overnight. Third, profit-taking after a period of appreciation is a common and healthy market mechanism. Additionally, the unique structure of spot cryptocurrency ETFs plays a role. Unlike futures-based products, these funds hold the underlying asset—Ethereum—directly. This means fund managers must buy or sell ETH to match creations and redemptions. Significant outflows can thus create direct selling pressure on the spot market, potentially creating a feedback loop. However, market makers typically manage this process to minimize disruption. Macroeconomic Signals: Investors may be rebalancing portfolios ahead of key economic indicators. Regulatory Developments: Any news from the SEC or other global regulators can impact sentiment. Technical Market Levels: Ethereum’s price hitting specific resistance or support levels can trigger automated and institutional selling. Competitive Yield: Rising yields in traditional fixed-income markets can draw capital away from risk assets. Expert Perspective on Institutional Behavior Financial analysts specializing in digital assets often interpret such flows through multiple lenses. For instance, outflows from a newly popular asset class are not inherently negative. They can represent routine portfolio rebalancing by large asset managers. A fund like BlackRock’s ETHA, which attracted massive inflows upon launch, would naturally see some churn as investors adjust positions. The critical metric for long-term health is the net flow over quarters, not days. Moreover, the simultaneous outflows from both BlackRock and Fidelity suggest a common catalyst. This could be a reaction to a specific event, such as a sector rotation out of technology and crypto assets. Alternatively, it might reflect a tactical move to secure profits before a perceived period of consolidation. Historical data from Bitcoin ETF launches shows similar patterns of volatile flows before stabilization. The Ethereum ETF market, being younger, may simply be experiencing its own version of this maturation process. Historical Comparison and Future Implications The trajectory of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which launched in the United States in early 2024, offers a valuable precedent. Initially, these products also experienced periods of intense volatility in daily flows. Over time, however, they established a strong baseline of assets under management (AUM). The current Ethereum ETF outflows, while notable, represent a fraction of the total AUM these funds have accumulated since their approval. The long-term adoption curve remains the primary focus for most fund sponsors. Looking ahead, several scenarios could unfold. If outflows persist for a third or fourth consecutive day, it would signal a stronger negative sentiment shift. Conversely, a swift return to net inflows would indicate the January 30 activity was a temporary blip. Market participants will also watch the relationship between ETF flows and Ethereum’s network metrics, such as staking rates and decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL). A decoupling where ETH price holds steady despite ETF outflows would demonstrate the asset’s independent strength. Conclusion The $252.9 million net outflow from U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on January 30, 2025, underscores the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency investment vehicles. Led by significant withdrawals from BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH, this event highlights the importance of monitoring short-term flow data within a broader, long-term context. While two days of outflows warrant attention, they do not necessarily define the viability of these innovative financial products. Ultimately, the evolution of Ethereum ETF market depth and investor commitment will be determined over the coming months, shaped by regulatory clarity, technological progress, and overarching global financial conditions. FAQs Q1: What does a “net outflow” mean for an ETF? A net outflow occurs when the dollar value of shares redeemed by investors exceeds the value of shares created on a given day. This requires the fund manager to sell underlying assets to return cash to shareholders. Q2: Are these Ethereum ETF outflows a sign of failing products? Not necessarily. Early-stage ETFs often experience volatile flows. Outflows can represent normal profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, or short-term reactions to market news, not a fundamental failure of the product. Q3: How do ETF outflows directly affect the price of Ethereum? For spot ETFs, outflows force the fund’s authorized participants to sell the underlying ETH on the open market to raise cash for redeeming shareholders. This selling activity can create downward pressure on Ethereum’s spot price, depending on the volume and market liquidity. Q4: What is the difference between the BlackRock ETHA and Fidelity FETH funds? Both are spot Ethereum ETFs, meaning they hold physical ETH. The primary differences lie in the fund sponsors (BlackRock vs. Fidelity), their fee structures, and their specific operational and custody arrangements. Both are among the largest and most liquid options available. Q5: Where can investors find reliable data on daily ETF flows? Independent data analytics firms like Farside Investors provide daily flow summaries. Fund sponsors also report official flow and AUM data, though often with a slight delay, through regulatory filings and their own websites.

This strategic move, announced globally on April 15, 2025, fundamentally expands Lighter’s ecosystem beyond derivatives trading. Consequently, it provides developers with a new, optimized layer for deploying versatile smart contracts. Furthermore, the platform has outlined ambitious plans to integrate major DeFi protocols, signaling a pivotal shift in its operational scope and the broader Layer 2 landscape. Understanding the Lighter EVM Rollup Launch The launch of Lighter EVM represents a major architectural evolution. Previously known primarily for its perpetual futures exchange, Lighter is now entering the competitive rollup space. A rollup is a Layer 2 scaling solution that executes transactions outside the main Ethereum chain (Layer 1) but posts transaction data back to it. This process significantly enhances throughput and reduces costs while maintaining the security guarantees of the underlying blockchain. The “general-purpose” designation is crucial; it means the rollup is not limited to a single application, like trading, but can support any decentralized application (dApp) built for the EVM. EVM compatibility serves as the core technical achievement. The Ethereum Virtual Machine is the runtime environment for smart contracts on Ethereum. By supporting the EVM, Lighter EVM ensures seamless portability for the vast universe of existing Ethereum developers and applications. Developers can migrate or deploy their Solidity-based contracts with minimal modifications. This dramatically lowers the barrier to entry and leverages Ethereum’s robust network effects. Industry analysts from firms like Messari and CoinShares have noted that EVM-compatible chains consistently attract greater developer activity and total value locked (TVL) compared to non-EVM alternatives. The Technical Architecture and Competitive Context Lighter EVM reportedly utilizes an optimistic rollup framework. This design assumes transactions are valid by default and uses a fraud-proof window to challenge incorrect state transitions. This method offers a balance between scalability and security. The rollup will batch hundreds of transactions into a single compressed proof submitted to Ethereum, distributing gas fees across all users and achieving substantial cost savings. For context, leading optimistic rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism have reduced transaction fees by over 90% compared to Layer 1 Ethereum during peak congestion. The move positions Lighter against established general-purpose rollups. The following table contrasts key attributes: Rollup Type Primary Focus EVM Compatibility Lighter EVM Optimistic General-Purpose (from Derivatives) Full Arbitrum One Optimistic General-Purpose Full Optimism Optimistic General-Purpose Full (EVM-Equivalent) zkSync Era ZK-Rollup General-Purpose Full (via zkEVM) Lighter’s unique entry point is its existing user base and liquidity from its perpetuals exchange. The company can potentially bootstrap its rollup ecosystem by integrating its core trading product natively, creating immediate utility and traffic. Strategic Implications for Developers and DeFi The announcement carries profound implications for the developer community. By offering a new EVM-compatible environment, Lighter provides an alternative deployment target that may feature incentivized programs, grants, or lower initial competition. The platform’s stated roadmap to support blue-chip DeFi applications like Uniswap (for decentralized exchange) and Aave (for lending and borrowing) is a strategic necessity. These integrations would provide the essential financial primitives—liquidity and credit—required for a thriving ecosystem. Composability: Future DeFi integrations would allow developers to build complex, interconnected applications that leverage existing liquidity pools and lending markets. Reduced Costs: DeFi interactions, which often involve multiple transactions, stand to benefit enormously from lower rollup fees. User Experience: A seamless bridge from trading perpetuals to providing liquidity or taking a loan within the same ecosystem could enhance user retention. However, success is not guaranteed. The rollup space is increasingly crowded. Therefore, Lighter must execute flawlessly on its technical promises and cultivate a strong developer community. Security audits, transparent governance, and reliable bridge infrastructure will be critical to building trust. Historical data from DeFi Llama shows that new chains often experience rapid TVL growth during incentive programs, but sustained growth depends on organic usage and innovative dApps. Future Roadmap and Ecosystem Vision Looking ahead, Lighter’s evolution from a single-application protocol to a multi-faceted blockchain platform mirrors a broader industry trend. Protocols like dYdX have also pursued application-specific chain strategies. Lighter’s approach with a general-purpose rollup is more expansive. It aims to create a comprehensive financial ecosystem where trading, lending, borrowing, and novel dApps coexist on a scalable, low-cost network. The long-term vision likely involves leveraging the rollup’s efficiency to introduce more complex financial products or improved trading mechanics that are currently cost-prohibitive on Layer 1. Additionally, the native integration of its perpetuals DEX could serve as a flagship application that demonstrates the rollup’s performance advantages. Ultimately, the success of Lighter EVM will be measured by its ability to attract independent developers building unique applications beyond the immediate scope of Lighter’s own team, truly fulfilling its “general-purpose” mandate. Conclusion The launch of the Lighter EVM rollup marks a bold and strategic expansion for the Lighter protocol. By providing a full EVM-compatible, general-purpose scaling solution, Lighter is not just launching a new product but is constructing an entire ecosystem poised to host the next generation of decentralized applications. Its future integration plans for major DeFi protocols like Uniswap and Aave highlight a clear path toward becoming a competitive Layer 2 destination. While challenges remain in a saturated market, this move significantly elevates Lighter’s position within the blockchain infrastructure landscape and provides developers with a powerful new tool for scalable innovation. FAQs Q1: What is Lighter EVM? Lighter EVM is a general-purpose optimistic rollup launched by the Lighter protocol. It is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, allowing developers to deploy any EVM-based smart contract on a faster, lower-cost Layer 2 network. Q2: How is a general-purpose rollup different from an app-specific one? An app-specific rollup (like a dedicated DEX chain) is optimized for a single application. A general-purpose rollup, like Lighter EVM, is designed to support any and all types of decentralized applications, similar to how Ethereum itself functions but with enhanced scalability. Q3: What does EVM support mean for developers? EVM support means developers can use familiar tools (like Solidity, Hardhat, Remix) and can port existing Ethereum smart contracts to Lighter EVM with minimal changes. This drastically reduces development time and leverages the largest pool of Web3 developers. Q4: What are Lighter’s plans for DeFi integrations? Lighter has announced its intention to support major DeFi applications such as Uniswap for decentralized swapping and Aave for lending/borrowing on its rollup in the future. These integrations would provide core financial services to the ecosystem. Q5: How does this benefit users of Lighter’s perpetual futures exchange? Users may eventually experience a more integrated ecosystem. They could potentially manage collateral, trade perpetuals, and engage in other DeFi activities like lending or providing liquidity all within the same low-fee, high-speed rollup environment, improving capital efficiency and user experience.

The U.S. government has entered a partial shutdown, a disruptive event triggered by an unexpected delay in the House of Representatives. This funding lapse occurred despite the Senate’s prior passage of a federal budget bill. Consequently, critical government operations now face suspension as lawmakers remain absent until February 2. Understanding the U.S. Government Partial Shutdown A partial government shutdown commences when Congress fails to enact necessary appropriation bills. These bills fund specific federal agencies before a fiscal deadline. This process differs from a full shutdown, which is far more rare. The current impasse specifically affects agencies without full-year appropriations for fiscal year 2025. Financial news outlet Jin10 first reported the procedural breakdown. The Senate had successfully passed a continuing resolution to extend funding. However, the final House vote faced last-minute postponement. This delay created an immediate funding gap at midnight. Therefore, non-essential functions in unfunded departments must cease. The Legislative Timeline and Breakdown The path to this shutdown involves a clear sequence of events. First, the Senate negotiated and passed a stopgap spending bill earlier this week. This action aimed to avert a lapse in funding. Subsequently, the bill moved to the House for final approval. House leadership, however, encountered unresolved disagreements within their caucus. Key factions demanded concessions on spending levels and policy riders. These internal disputes prevented a timely consensus vote. As a result, the scheduled vote was delayed indefinitely. House members then departed Washington, D.C., with plans to reconvene on February 2. This timeline left a definitive gap in federal appropriations authority. Expert Analysis of Congressional Dynamics Dr. Eleanor Vance, a political scientist at Georgetown University, explains the procedural reality. “The Senate’s action was a necessary but insufficient step,” she states. “The U.S. Constitution mandates that all revenue bills originate in the House. Ultimately, the House holds the final procedural key to releasing funds. Their inability to vote creates an immediate constitutional crisis in budgeting.” Historical data from the Congressional Research Service supports this analysis. Since 1980, the U.S. has experienced over a dozen funding gaps. The average duration spans just three days. However, the 2018-2019 shutdown lasted 35 days, setting a record. This precedent shows how short delays can escalate into prolonged standoffs. Immediate Impacts and Operational Consequences The partial shutdown triggers well-established contingency plans across agencies. Essential personnel related to public safety and national security continue working. However, they may do so without immediate pay. Non-essential employees are furloughed. Importantly, mandatory spending programs like Social Security continue unaffected. National Parks: Many parks may close or offer limited services. Federal Permits: Processing for passports, visas, and loans slows or stops. Research: Government-funded scientific research faces immediate disruption. Contractors: Thousands of federal contractors may face suspended work and pay. Moreover, the economic impact begins almost instantly. The 2018-2019 shutdown reduced quarterly GDP growth by an estimated 0.1% to 0.2%. Small businesses near federal facilities often suffer significant revenue loss. Federal workers, totaling over 2 million nationally, must manage personal financial uncertainty. Broader Context of Budget Negotiations This event does not occur in a vacuum. It reflects ongoing tensions in the federal budget process. The modern era sees frequent use of continuing resolutions (CRs) instead of full-year budgets. CRs simply extend previous funding levels, often delaying substantive policy debates. This kick-the-can approach increases the risk of periodic crises. The table below compares key aspects of recent significant shutdowns: Year Duration Primary Cause Estimated Cost 2013 16 days Affordable Care Act disputes $24 billion 2018-2019 35 days Border wall funding $11 billion 2025 (Current) Ongoing House vote delay on CR TBD Furthermore, the political ramifications are substantial. Public confidence in governmental institutions often declines during these periods. Markets typically react with increased volatility, though major indices often recover post-resolution. The direct impact on federal creditworthiness, however, remains minimal as debt service continues. The Path to Resolution and Reopening Resolution requires a simple majority vote in the House on the pending bill. Leadership must now rally support during the recess. Speaker of the House Maria Chen stated, “We are actively engaging members remotely to secure the votes needed upon our return.” Once the House passes the bill, it proceeds to the President for signature. Agencies can then restore operations typically within one business day. Backpay for furloughed employees has been historically guaranteed by subsequent legislation. Nevertheless, the disruption to government services and public trust is immediate and tangible. Federal agencies will now execute their shutdown plans, notifying employees and the public of suspended activities. Conclusion The U.S. government partial shutdown underscores the fragility of modern budget politics. A delay in a single House vote has halted portions of the federal machinery. This event impacts services, workers, and economic confidence. The resolution now depends on legislative action when the House reconvenes. The nation watches as this preventable disruption unfolds, highlighting the critical need for functional appropriations processes in Washington. FAQs Q1: What is a partial government shutdown? A partial government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass appropriations bills for some, but not all, federal agencies before funding expires. Affected agencies must cease non-essential operations. Q2: Which government services are affected immediately? Services facing immediate impact include national park operations, federal permitting (passports, visas), non-essential IRS functions, and many regulatory agency activities. Essential services like air traffic control and border security continue. Q3: Do federal employees get paid during a shutdown? Essential employees work without pay until funding resumes. Furloughed non-essential employees do not work or receive pay. Historically, Congress has approved backpay for all employees after a shutdown ends. Q4: How does this shutdown end? The shutdown ends when Congress passes, and the President signs, the necessary appropriations legislation. For the current situation, this requires a successful vote in the House of Representatives on the pending bill. Q5: What is the difference between a shutdown and a debt ceiling crisis? A shutdown stems from a failure to approve discretionary spending for agency operations. A debt ceiling crisis involves the government’s statutory borrowing limit to pay existing bills, including debt interest. They are separate fiscal issues.

57608196,660393,1769839247,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57608196.jpeg,Bitcoin Futures Trading Volume Falls to Lowest Monthly Level Since 2024,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-futures-trading-volume-falls-level-2024/,"Bitcoin’s derivatives market is showing clear signs of deceleration. A CryptoQuant analyst highlights that monthly Bitcoin futures trading volume across all exchanges fell to approximately $1.09 trillion in January, marking the lowest level since 2024. This represents a notable slowdown compared to earlier phases of the cycle, when monthly volumes frequently exceeded $2 trillion, reflecting a period of reduced speculative intensity and more cautious positioning among traders. Despite the broad contraction in activity, liquidity has not dispersed evenly across the market. Instead, futures trading remains highly concentrated on a small number of dominant venues. Binance continued to lead the sector, recording roughly $378 billion in futures volume for the month. It was followed by OKX, with approximately $169 billion, and Bybit, which registered close to $156 billion. Together, these platforms accounted for a significant share of total derivatives activity, underscoring their role as primary liquidity hubs even as overall participation declined. This concentration suggests that while fewer market participants are actively trading futures , those that remain are operating within established, deep-liquidity venues. Rather than signaling stress or forced deleveraging, the slowdown appears consistent with a phase of consolidation, where traders reassess risk exposure and reduce turnover without abandoning the derivatives market entirely. Bitcoin Futures Volume Signals Speculative Cooldown The drop to the lowest monthly futures volume since 2024 reflects a clear reduction in trading intensity compared with earlier stages of the cycle, when aggregate monthly volumes regularly exceeded $2 trillion. This shift points to a moderation in short-term speculative behavior and a pullback in aggressive positioning, particularly among traders who rely heavily on leverage to amplify returns. As volatility compresses and directional conviction weakens, these participants tend to reduce activity, contributing to lower overall turnover in the derivatives market. Such phases are not unusual within Bitcoin’s market structure. Historically, periods of declining futures volume often follow extended stretches of heightened volatility, serving as a reset mechanism where traders reassess risk exposure, tighten position sizing, and wait for clearer signals before re-engaging. Rather than reflecting a loss of interest in Bitcoin itself, the slowdown suggests a temporary pause in speculative appetite. Importantly, the contraction in volume appears orderly rather than abrupt. There are no clear signs of widespread stress, panic-driven exits, or forced deleveraging. Instead, the gradual decline indicates a controlled reduction in participation, with large and professional players selectively scaling back exposure. This behavior leads to lower trading activity without destabilizing price action or triggering disorderly liquidations. The current environment is more consistent with consolidation than capitulation. Reduced futures volume highlights a market transitioning into a quieter phase, where leverage is unwound methodically and positioning becomes more conservative, setting the stage for a future expansion once volatility and conviction return. Bitcoin Tests 100-Week Moving Average as Correction Stabilizes Bitcoin’s weekly chart highlights a market that has transitioned from strong trend expansion into a corrective and consolidative phase. After peaking above the $120K region, BTC entered a broad pullback that erased a significant portion of the prior advance, bringing price back toward the low $80K area. This decline unfolded alongside a clear loss of momentum, visible in the series of lower highs and the rejection from the 50-week moving average (blue), which has now turned into dynamic resistance. Currently, Bitcoin is trading near $82,800, sitting just above the 100-week moving average (green). This level is technically important, as it often acts as a medium-term trend filter during late-cycle corrections. So far, price has managed to stabilize around this zone, suggesting that selling pressure is no longer accelerating, but buyers have not yet regained control either. The 200-week moving average (red), still rising near the mid-$50K area, remains far below spot price, indicating that the broader macro trend has not broken down despite the correction. Volume has contracted meaningfully compared to the distribution phase near the highs, reinforcing the idea that this move is corrective rather than panic-driven. Overall, the chart points to a phase of price compression and structural digestion. Bitcoin appears to be searching for acceptance around current levels, with the next decisive move likely dependent on whether the 100-week average holds or fails.

Analysts Warn BTC Crash Could Be Deeper Than Expected",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-to-30000-analysts-warn-btc-crash-could-be-deeper-than-expected/,"After bouncing 2.6% from recent lows, Bitcoin (BTC) has been attempting to turn the $82,000-$83,000 area into support. Some analysts have warned that the cryptocurrency must hold the crucial macro support levels or it will “confirm bearish acceleration.” Related Reading: Ethereum Drops Below $2,800 As Crypto Liquidations Near $1B – Should Investors Worry? Bitcoin To Drop 76% From its Peak On Thursday, Bitcoin crashed alongside the rest of the market, retracing nearly 9% in a day toward the $81,314 area. BTC had been trading between $86,000-$93,500 since early November, closing above the lower boundary of its two-month range in the weekly timeframe despite constant volatility. At the moment, the flagship cryptocurrency has lost this key support in the daily timeframe and risks a deeper correction if the price doesn’t recover the $86,000 level before the end of the week. As the price hovers between levels not seen since the late November correction, a market observer has warned that the leading cryptocurrency has lost its 100-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) as support. Ted Pillows asserted that the last two times Bitcoin had a weekly close below the 100-week EMA, back in 2018 and 2022, it dropped 50% in just 4-6 weeks. Moreover, he highlighted BTC’s historical pattern, noting that the cryptocurrency has repeated a similar performance between the 2017-2018 and 2021-2022 cycles. The chart shows an eight-year ascending trendline that has marked the top of the previous cycles. The trendline began during the late 2017 peak and continued into the next bull market, marking the 2021 cycle top too. Notably, the 2018 bear market correction saw Bitcoin retrace 83.11% from the ascending trendline, while the 2022 pullback had BTC dropping 77.57% from the cycle top. Per the chart, this has formed a rising support line that has marked where BTC’s price bottomed during previous bear markets. Now, Bitcoin has seemingly topped around the trendline once again and could retrace up to 76.88% toward the $30,000 mark in 2026, if history repeats. BTC Retests Macro Triangle Bottom Analyst Rekt Capital also shared his perspective on BTC’s recent pullback now that it has broken down from its weekly price range and is revisiting the $82,500 bottom of its Macro Triangle formation. The analyst explained that Bitcoin has been forming a triangle pattern in the monthly timeframe since mid-2024, similar to its 2021 triangle formation that preceded the previous bear market. Per the analysis, the flagship crypto has shown a nearly identical price action to its 2021-2022 performance, with the price respecting the macro support and descending resistance. A breakdown from the macro triangle bottom “would confirm Bearish Acceleration,” he noted, adding that for bull market continuation, the cryptocurrency would need to break and hold above the macro descending resistance on longer timeframes. “Until then, we have more evidence that maybe we will be following 2021 [performance]. (…) It’s just a little bit more compressed.” He also pointed out that BTC is displaying a similar Bull Market EMAs crossover that occurred during the early stages of the previous bear market. Related Reading: Analysts Say Dogecoin Consolidation Is About To End – Parabolic Run Or Crash Ahead? Rekt Capital highlighted that the imminent crossover does not necessarily predict additional downside, but “is effectively confirming weakness, kind of responding to the weakness that we are already seeing and have seen for a while.” “History is suggesting to us that if we continue to make these macro lower highs, which are a result of weakening demand at historical support regions, then there’s more reason to be bearish rather than bullish,” he concluded.

This substantial deleveraging event was primarily driven by Ethereum (ETH), which accounted for over half of the total value liquidated. The data reveals critical insights into trader sentiment and positioning ahead of key network developments, highlighting the inherent risks of leveraged trading in digital asset markets. Crypto Liquidations Analysis: Ethereum Takes Center Stage Over a intense 24-hour period, liquidation engines at major derivatives exchanges executed orders worth millions. Consequently, Ethereum emerged as the dominant force in this market reset. Specifically, ETH saw $147 million in positions forcibly closed. Furthermore, a detailed breakdown shows that long positions—bets on price increases—comprised a overwhelming 82.95% of these ETH liquidations. This pattern suggests a crowded long trade faced rapid unwinding as prices moved against bullish expectations. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC), the market’s largest asset, followed with $87.71 million in liquidations. Interestingly, the composition for BTC flipped, with short positions accounting for 62.6% of the total. This contrast indicates divergent market dynamics and trader positioning between the two leading cryptocurrencies. The Mechanics of Perpetual Futures Liquidations To understand these events, one must grasp how perpetual futures contracts operate. These derivatives allow traders to use high leverage, amplifying both gains and losses. Exchanges maintain these positions through a funding rate mechanism and a liquidation price. If a position’s maintenance margin falls below a required threshold, the exchange automatically closes it. This process protects the exchange from counterparty risk but creates cascading sell or buy pressure in volatile markets. The recent data clearly shows this mechanism in action across multiple assets. Liquidation Engine: Automated systems trigger closes when collateral is insufficient. Funding Rates: Periodic payments between long and short traders to peg the contract to the spot price. Cascade Risk: Large liquidations can drive prices further, triggering more liquidations. Market Context and Contributing Factors Several concurrent factors likely contributed to this liquidation event. First, broader macroeconomic uncertainty persists, influencing all risk assets. Second, Ethereum’s network is preparing for its next major protocol upgrade, Pectra, scheduled for later in 2025. Upgrades often create volatility as traders speculate on outcomes. Third, on-chain data from analytics firms like Glassnode showed elevated leverage in the system prior to the move. Finally, a noticeable shift in trading volume from spot to derivatives markets over the preceding weeks increased systemic fragility. This environment created a tinderbox that a modest price decline ignited. 24-Hour Liquidation Snapshot (March 21, 2025) Asset Total Liquidated Long % Short % Primary Direction Ethereum (ETH) $147.00M 82.95% 17.05% Long Squeeze Bitcoin (BTC) $87.71M 37.4% 62.6% Short Squeeze XAG (Silver Token) $34.30M 80.26% 19.74% Long Squeeze Market Total $269.01M Data aggregated from Binance, Bybit, OKX, and other major exchanges. Expert Perspective on Market Structure Market analysts emphasize that such events, while dramatic, are not uncommon in maturing but volatile asset classes. “Liquidation clusters are a feature of markets with high leverage availability,” notes a report from CryptoQuant. “They represent a rapid clearing of excessive risk. The key metric is whether this leads to a sustained deleveraging of the system or merely a reset before leverage rebuilds.” Historical analysis shows that similar liquidation events in 2023 and 2024 often preceded periods of consolidation or trend reversal, depending on the underlying fundamental backdrop. The asymmetry between ETH and BTC liquidations is particularly telling, potentially signaling a rotation in capital or differing narratives for each asset. Impact on Traders and Exchange Stability The immediate impact of $269 million in liquidations is a direct loss for the traders whose positions were closed. However, the effects ripple further. For instance, exchanges experience a spike in trading volume and fee revenue during these periods. Moreover, the stability of the derivatives market itself is tested. Notably, no major exchange reported issues with their liquidation engines or insurance funds during this event, a sign of improved infrastructure since earlier market cycles. Nonetheless, the high percentage of long liquidations in ETH and XAG suggests many retail and institutional traders were caught leaning the wrong way in a sudden downturn. Trader Losses: Realized losses for those liquidated. Exchange Fees: Increased revenue from volatile trading. Market Health: A reduction in overall system leverage. Price Discovery: Liquidations can exaggerate short-term price moves. Historical Parallels and Evolution Comparing this event to past cycles reveals an evolution in market maturity. The infamous crash of March 2020 saw single-day liquidations exceeding $1 billion. While the recent figure is smaller in nominal terms, the market’s total capitalization is also larger, indicating a relatively smaller systemic shock. Furthermore, the tools available to traders for risk management—such as stop-loss orders and cross-margin options—have become more sophisticated. However, the psychological drivers of fear and greed, which lead to over-leveraging, remain constant. This event serves as a fresh reminder of the risks inherent in derivative products. Conclusion The $269 million crypto liquidation event, led decisively by Ethereum’s $147 million unwind, underscores the volatile and interconnected nature of digital asset markets. The data provides a clear snapshot of trader positioning, with a majority of ETH traders caught on the wrong side of a long squeeze, while BTC saw more short positions liquidated. These movements occur within a broader context of macroeconomic sensitivity and upcoming network upgrades. For market participants, such events highlight the critical importance of risk management, prudent leverage, and understanding the mechanics of derivative products. As the market digests this deleveraging, attention will turn to whether it marks a healthy correction or the beginning of a broader trend shift. FAQs Q1: What causes a liquidation in crypto futures trading? A liquidation occurs when a trader’s position loses enough value that their remaining collateral (margin) falls below the exchange’s maintenance requirement. The exchange then automatically closes the position to prevent further losses, ensuring the trader can cover their debt. Q2: Why were most Ethereum liquidations long positions? The high percentage of long ETH liquidations (82.95%) indicates that a large number of traders were using leverage to bet on a price increase. When the price fell instead, those leveraged long positions were the first to be wiped out as they hit their liquidation prices. Q3: How does a liquidation event affect the broader spot market price? Liquidations can create cascading sell (or buy) pressure. For example, when long positions are liquidated, the exchange sells the asset to close the position, which can push the spot price down further, potentially triggering more liquidations in a volatile feedback loop. Q4: Is a $269 million liquidation event considered large? While significant, it is not historically unprecedented. In the context of today’s larger total crypto market capitalization, it represents a notable but not catastrophic deleveraging event. Much larger single-day liquidations have occurred during periods of extreme market stress. Q5: What can traders do to avoid being liquidated? Traders can manage this risk by using lower leverage, setting prudent stop-loss orders, maintaining adequate margin above the maintenance level, and actively monitoring their positions, especially during periods of high volatility or major news events.

This crucial metric, which gauges whether market conditions favor alternative cryptocurrencies over Bitcoin, now sits far from the threshold that traditionally indicates a full-blown ‘altcoin season,’ prompting analysts to reassess the current crypto cycle’s trajectory as we move through 2025. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index Plunge CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index serves as a vital barometer for cryptocurrency market sentiment. The index operates on a clear, quantitative framework. Specifically, it analyzes the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, against Bitcoin over a rolling 90-day period. An official ‘altcoin season’ is declared only if 75% of these assets outperform Bitcoin during that timeframe. Consequently, a score closer to 100 indicates strong altcoin dominance, while lower scores suggest Bitcoin is leading the market. The drop from 32 to 25 represents a notable contraction in altcoin strength, a shift that market participants are closely monitoring for its broader implications. The Mechanics Behind the Metric The calculation methodology provides critical context. The index does not merely track prices. Instead, it performs a relative strength analysis. This process involves a daily comparison of each eligible asset’s 90-day performance against Bitcoin’s. For instance, if Bitcoin gained 15% over three months, an altcoin would need to exceed that return to count positively toward the season indicator. The recent score of 25 suggests that only a quarter of the major altcoins are currently outperforming the pioneer cryptocurrency. This data-driven approach offers a more nuanced view than simple price observation, helping to filter out short-term volatility and identify sustained trends. Historical Context and Market Cycles To fully grasp the current index reading’s significance, one must examine historical patterns. Previous crypto market cycles have often followed a recognizable sequence. Typically, Bitcoin leads a bull market’s initial phase, attracting institutional and mainstream capital. Subsequently, as investor confidence grows and capital seeks higher returns, money rotates into altcoins, triggering a broad-based ‘alt season.’ For example, the index surged above 75 in early 2024, coinciding with a period of explosive growth for several major Layer 1 and DeFi tokens. The current retreat from those highs suggests a potential reversion or consolidation phase, a common feature in past cycles where capital flows back to Bitcoin as a perceived safe haven during uncertainty. Market analysts often reference previous cycle data for perspective. During the 2020-2021 cycle, the index spent extended periods above the 75 threshold, correlating with massive altcoin rallies. However, these periods were frequently punctuated by sharp pullbacks where Bitcoin reasserted dominance, much like the current scenario. The speed of the recent decline—seven points in one day—warrants attention, as it may indicate accelerated capital rotation rather than a gradual shift. This behavior often precedes heightened market volatility as traders reposition their portfolios in response to changing macro conditions and liquidity flows. Implications for the 2025 Cryptocurrency Landscape The declining index score carries several immediate implications for different market participants. For retail investors, it may signal a period where broad altcoin portfolios underperform. For institutional players, it could influence asset allocation models, potentially favoring Bitcoin-centric strategies. Furthermore, project developers might face increased scrutiny on fundamentals and tokenomics if easy, market-wide gains become less prevalent. The shift also impacts trading volume dynamics across exchanges, often concentrating liquidity in Bitcoin and a handful of major altcoins during such phases. Expert Analysis on Driving Factors Several interconnected factors likely contributed to the index’s drop. Firstly, macroeconomic conditions in early 2025, including interest rate expectations and geopolitical tensions, often drive capital toward assets perceived as digital gold, like Bitcoin. Secondly, regulatory developments continue to shape the landscape; clearer frameworks for Bitcoin ETFs, contrasted with ongoing uncertainty for many altcoin projects, can create a divergence in investor confidence. Thirdly, on-chain data suggests recent network activity and fee revenue growth for Bitcoin have outpaced many competing Layer 1 blockchains, reinforcing its fundamental strength. Finally, market sentiment indicators and futures market positioning showed excessive altcoin optimism in prior weeks, setting the stage for a corrective rotation. It is crucial to distinguish between a declining index and a bearish market overall. The score of 25 does not inherently predict falling prices for all altcoins. Rather, it indicates their performance relative to Bitcoin. Some altcoins with strong use cases, growing adoption, or upcoming protocol upgrades may still post absolute gains. However, they might not keep pace with Bitcoin’s momentum. This environment often separates projects with robust fundamentals from those riding speculative waves, potentially leading to a healthier, more mature market structure in the long term. Comparative Performance and Sector Analysis A closer look at sector performance reveals nuances behind the aggregate index number. Not all cryptocurrency categories react uniformly. For instance, during the recent shift: Layer 1 Blockchains: Performance varied significantly, with some established networks showing more resilience than newer entrants. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Tokens: Often highly correlated with broader altcoin sentiment, many saw relative strength weaken. Memecoins and Speculative Assets: Typically the most sensitive to shifts in risk appetite, these likely contributed heavily to the index decline. Infrastructure and Scaling Solutions: Projects with clear roadmaps and partnerships sometimes demonstrated relative stability. This differentiation is vital for informed investment decisions. It underscores that the Altcoin Season Index is a broad market indicator, not a substitute for deep, project-specific analysis. Savvy investors use it as one tool among many, combining it with on-chain metrics, development activity, and liquidity analysis to build a complete market picture. Conclusion CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index falling to 25 provides a clear, data-backed signal of shifting market dynamics in 2025. This seven-point drop highlights a rapid move away from the conditions that favor broad altcoin outperformance, suggesting Bitcoin is reasserting its dominance in the current cycle phase. While not predictive of an outright altcoin bear market, the index serves as a critical warning light, indicating that the low-hanging fruit of sector-wide gains may be diminishing. Investors and observers should interpret this movement as a call for increased selectivity and fundamental analysis, recognizing that cryptocurrency market leadership is entering a new, potentially more challenging chapter. The index remains an essential tool for navigating these complex waters. FAQs Q1: What does an Altcoin Season Index score of 25 mean? A score of 25 means that only about 25% of the top altcoins (excluding stablecoins) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. It indicates Bitcoin is currently dominating market performance, and a full ‘altcoin season’ is not in effect. Q2: How often does CoinMarketCap update the Altcoin Season Index? CoinMarketCap typically updates the index daily, reflecting the latest 90-day rolling performance data of the eligible cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin. Q3: Can altcoins still go up if the index is low? Yes, individual altcoins can still appreciate in value. The index measures performance *relative to Bitcoin*. An altcoin could rise 10% in a period, but if Bitcoin rises 20%, it still counts as underperformance for the index calculation. Q4: What is the threshold for an official ‘altcoin season’? An official altcoin season is declared when the index sustains a score above 75. This means more than 75% of the top altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the preceding 90-day window. Q5: Does a low index score predict a market crash? No, a low Altcoin Season Index score does not predict a general market crash. It specifically signals a period of Bitcoin outperformance relative to altcoins. The broader market could be rising, flat, or falling during such a phase.

This development, recorded across Binance, OKX, and Bybit, represents a notable change in market sentiment that professional traders monitor closely for directional clues. The data, collected on April 15, 2025, shows an overall ratio of 49.5% long positions versus 50.5% short positions across the three leading exchanges by open interest. BTC Perpetual Futures Data Shows Market Sentiment Shift Perpetual futures represent one of the most actively traded cryptocurrency derivatives, offering traders continuous contracts without expiration dates. These instruments provide valuable insights into market psychology and positioning trends. The current data reveals remarkably consistent patterns across exchanges, with Binance showing 49.96% long versus 50.04% short, OKX displaying 49.9% long versus 50.1% short, and Bybit reporting 49.92% long versus 50.08% short. This uniformity suggests a broad-based sentiment shift rather than exchange-specific activity. Market analysts typically interpret long/short ratios as contrarian indicators. When retail traders heavily favor one direction, professional traders often take the opposite position. The current slight short bias follows several weeks of predominantly long positioning, potentially signaling a market top or consolidation phase. Historical data shows that similar narrow margins between longs and shorts often precede significant price movements as the market reaches equilibrium before deciding its next direction. Understanding Perpetual Futures Market Dynamics Perpetual futures differ from traditional futures contracts through their funding rate mechanism, which helps maintain price alignment with spot markets. This funding rate adjusts every eight hours based on the difference between perpetual contract prices and spot prices. When longs outnumber shorts significantly, funding rates typically turn positive, requiring long position holders to pay shorts. Conversely, when shorts dominate, funding rates often turn negative. The current near-balanced ratio suggests relatively neutral funding rates, reducing the cost of maintaining positions for both sides. This environment often encourages more aggressive positioning as traders face lower carrying costs. However, the slight short bias indicates that some traders anticipate potential downward pressure or at least believe the market has limited immediate upside potential. BTC Perpetual Futures Long/Short Ratios – April 15, 2025 Exchange Long Percentage Short Percentage Net Bias Overall 49.5% 50.5% -1.0% Short Binance 49.96% 50.04% -0.08% Short OKX 49.9% 50.1% -0.2% Short Bybit 49.92% 50.08% -0.16% Short Several factors contribute to these positioning trends. Macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and Bitcoin’s technical chart patterns all influence trader decisions. Additionally, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, scheduled for 2028 but already influencing long-term planning, creates complex sentiment dynamics. Traders must balance short-term technical signals against longer-term fundamental narratives. Expert Analysis of Market Positioning Data Seasoned derivatives traders emphasize that small percentage differences in long/short ratios can have disproportionate impacts on market dynamics. The current data shows maximum short bias of just 0.2 percentage points on OKX, with other exchanges showing even narrower margins. This suggests cautious positioning rather than strong conviction in either direction. Historical analysis reveals that similar balanced ratios often occur during consolidation periods following significant price movements. Bitcoin recently tested key resistance levels before pulling back slightly, creating uncertainty about immediate direction. The derivatives data reflects this uncertainty through nearly equal long and short positioning. Market makers and institutional participants typically use such balanced environments to accumulate positions with minimal market impact. Funding rate analysis provides additional context. Current rates remain relatively neutral across exchanges, indicating neither longs nor shorts face significant carrying costs. This neutrality often precedes increased volatility as traders become more willing to establish larger positions without funding rate penalties. Monitoring funding rate trends alongside long/short ratios offers a more complete picture of market sentiment and potential pressure points. Implications for Bitcoin Price Action The slight short bias in perpetual futures positioning carries several implications for Bitcoin’s price trajectory. First, it suggests limited immediate bullish conviction despite generally positive long-term fundamentals. Second, it indicates potential resistance to upward moves as short positions could increase selling pressure during rallies. Third, it creates conditions for potential short squeezes if positive catalysts emerge unexpectedly. Technical analysts note that Bitcoin currently trades within a defined range, with derivatives data supporting the range-bound thesis. The nearly equal long/short positioning aligns with technical indicators showing neutral momentum and balanced buying/selling pressure. However, derivatives markets often lead spot price movements, making current positioning data potentially predictive of near-term direction. Several key levels warrant monitoring. Resistance levels where short positions might increase and support levels where long positions could accumulate both represent potential inflection points. The concentration of liquidations above and below current prices provides additional context for potential volatility triggers. Market participants should watch for significant deviations from current ratios as early warning signs of changing sentiment. Comparative Analysis with Traditional Markets Bitcoin derivatives markets exhibit both similarities and differences compared to traditional financial derivatives. Like traditional markets, cryptocurrency derivatives reflect sentiment, provide hedging opportunities, and offer leverage. However, cryptocurrency markets operate continuously, experience higher volatility, and respond to different fundamental drivers. The current long/short ratio analysis reveals several cryptocurrency-specific characteristics. First, the high correlation across exchanges indicates efficient arbitrage and information flow. Second, the slight but consistent short bias suggests some unique cryptocurrency market concerns, possibly related to regulatory developments or technological factors. Third, the overall balance indicates mature market participation with both bullish and bearish perspectives represented. Traditional market analysts increasingly monitor cryptocurrency derivatives data for broader financial market insights. The decentralized nature of cryptocurrency trading often reveals sentiment shifts before they appear in traditional markets. Current balanced positioning in Bitcoin derivatives might indicate broader market uncertainty or anticipation of macroeconomic developments affecting multiple asset classes. Risk Management Considerations for Traders The current derivatives positioning data highlights several important risk management considerations. First, the narrow margin between longs and shorts suggests potential for rapid sentiment shifts. Second, nearly equal positioning can lead to increased volatility if one side capitulates. Third, neutral funding rates reduce carrying costs but don’t eliminate directional risks. Traders should consider implementing specific strategies in this environment: Position sizing: Maintain appropriate position sizes given potential volatility Stop-loss placement: Set logical stop-loss levels based on technical support/resistance Monitoring funding rates: Watch for shifts that could change position economics Cross-market analysis: Consider spot market flows and options market positioning Time horizon alignment: Match trading strategies with appropriate time frames Professional trading firms typically use derivatives data as one input among many, combining it with technical analysis, fundamental research, and macroeconomic assessment. Retail traders should adopt similar comprehensive approaches rather than relying solely on long/short ratios for decision-making. The current data suggests caution and careful risk management rather than strong directional bias. Conclusion The BTC perpetual futures data revealing shorts slightly ahead of longs provides valuable insights into current market sentiment and positioning. This development across major exchanges indicates a subtle shift toward caution among derivatives traders, though the narrow margins suggest uncertainty rather than strong conviction. Market participants should monitor subsequent data releases for confirmation or reversal of this trend, while maintaining appropriate risk management practices. The BTC perpetual futures market continues to offer important signals about trader psychology and potential price direction, making ongoing analysis essential for informed decision-making in dynamic cryptocurrency markets. FAQs Q1: What do long/short ratios in perpetual futures indicate? Long/short ratios show the percentage of traders holding bullish (long) versus bearish (short) positions. They provide insights into market sentiment and potential price direction, though they often serve as contrarian indicators at extremes. Q2: Why is the current ratio significant despite small differences? Even small percentage differences can indicate sentiment shifts, especially when consistent across multiple exchanges. The current slight short bias follows periods of stronger long positioning, potentially signaling changing market dynamics. Q3: How do funding rates relate to long/short ratios? Funding rates help maintain perpetual contract prices near spot prices. When longs significantly outnumber shorts, funding rates typically turn positive (longs pay shorts), and vice versa. Current neutral rates align with balanced positioning. Q4: Should traders use this data for entry/exit decisions? While valuable for context, long/short ratios should complement rather than replace comprehensive analysis including technical indicators, fundamentals, and risk management considerations. Q5: How often do these ratios change significantly? Ratios can change rapidly during volatile periods or major news events. Regular monitoring provides better insights than single data points, with trends often more significant than absolute values.

This analysis provides a comprehensive, evidence-based examination of Arbitrum’s potential price trajectory from 2026 through 2030, specifically addressing the prominent question: Will ARB hit $6 by 2030? We will dissect the technological fundamentals, adoption metrics, and macroeconomic factors that will ultimately determine its path. Arbitrum (ARB) Price Prediction: The Foundation of Analysis Arbitrum operates as a leading Optimistic Rollup on the Ethereum network. Consequently, its value proposition is intrinsically linked to Ethereum’s success and the broader demand for scalable, low-cost smart contract execution. To forecast ARB’s price, we must first analyze its core utility. The ARB token governs the Arbitrum DAO, enabling holders to vote on protocol upgrades, treasury management, and ecosystem grants. This utility creates a direct correlation between network usage and token value. Furthermore, transaction fee revenue can be directed to the DAO treasury, potentially establishing a value-accrual mechanism. Market data from 2023 and 2024 shows Arbitrum consistently maintaining one of the largest Total Value Locked (TVL) figures among Layer 2s. For instance, it has frequently hosted over $2.5 billion in assets. This established dominance provides a strong foundation for future growth. However, competition from other scaling solutions like Optimism, zkSync, and emerging Layer 1 blockchains presents a continuous challenge. The network’s ability to innovate, particularly with its upcoming Nitro stack improvements and potential integration of zero-knowledge proof technology, will be crucial for maintaining its competitive edge. Technical and Fundamental Drivers for 2026-2027 The mid-term outlook for ARB depends heavily on several key technical and adoption milestones. Firstly, the continued development and adoption of Arbitrum’s suite of chains, including Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, will drive demand. Secondly, the success of major ecosystem projects in decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will increase transactional activity. Thirdly, broader Ethereum upgrades, like further improvements to EIP-4844 (proto-danksharding), could significantly reduce data costs for rollups, boosting profitability and efficiency. Expert Perspectives on Adoption and Valuation Industry analysts often emphasize metrics like daily active addresses, transaction count, and developer activity. A report from a major blockchain analytics firm in late 2024 noted that Arbitrum’s developer retention rate was among the highest in the sector. This suggests a healthy, growing ecosystem. Financial modeling for 2026-2027 typically involves scenario analysis. A bull case might assume Ethereum’s mainstream adoption accelerates, funneling immense activity through Arbitrum and pushing ARB’s price toward the upper end of forecasts. A base case would see steady, linear growth in line with the overall crypto market expansion. A bear case would involve regulatory headwinds, technological setbacks, or a prolonged market downturn suppressing prices. The following table outlines a simplified, model-derived price range based on different adoption scenarios for 2026 and 2027. These figures are illustrative projections, not financial advice. Year Conservative Scenario Moderate Scenario Aggressive Scenario Key Driver 2026 $1.80 – $2.50 $2.50 – $3.80 $3.80 – $5.00 Ethereum Dencun Upgrade Effects 2027 $2.20 – $3.00 $3.00 – $4.50 $4.50 – $6.00+ Mass Adoption of On-Chain Gaming & SocialFi The 2030 Horizon: Pathways to the $6 Target Reaching a $6 price point by 2030 represents a significant appreciation from early 2025 levels. This target implies a substantial increase in both network utility and market capitalization. Several convergent factors could create this pathway. Primarily, Ethereum must solidify its position as the dominant settlement layer for global decentralized applications. Subsequently, Arbitrum would need to capture a leading share of that scaled activity. Potential catalysts include: Enterprise Adoption: Large institutions using Arbitrum for asset tokenization or supply chain management. Regulatory Clarity: Clear frameworks that encourage traditional finance to build on compliant DeFi protocols hosted on Layer 2s. Technological Synergy: Seamless integration with Ethereum’s full roadmap, including advanced data sharding. Tokenomics Activation: The DAO successfully implementing mechanisms like fee burns or staking rewards that directly enhance token value. Conversely, major risks could impede progress. These risks include the rise of a superior scaling technology, severe Ethereum congestion being resolved by alternative means, or adverse global regulations targeting decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). The volatility of the broader cryptocurrency market, often tied to Bitcoin’s cycles and macroeconomic interest rate environments, will also be a persistent overlay on ARB’s price action throughout the period. Comparative Analysis with Historical Layer 1 Growth Historical precedent offers context, though not a direct blueprint. Early Layer 1 tokens like Ethereum and Solana saw exponential growth during periods of paradigm-shifting adoption. As a Layer 2, Arbitrum’s growth may be more symbiotic with Ethereum’s. Analysts from firms like CoinShares and ARK Invest have published research suggesting the value captured by the “modular blockchain stack” could eventually rival that of the base layers themselves. If this thesis holds, and Arbitrum remains a top-tier rollup, its valuation has considerable room for expansion over a five-year horizon. Conclusion In summary, the Arbitrum price prediction for 2026-2030 hinges on a complex interplay of technology, adoption, and market dynamics. While a price target of $6 by 2030 is mathematically plausible within aggressive growth scenarios, it is far from guaranteed. It requires the successful execution of Ethereum’s scaling vision and Arbitrum’s continued leadership within that ecosystem. Investors and observers should monitor fundamental metrics—TVL, developer activity, and governance participation—rather than price alone. The journey toward any long-term ARB price prediction will be defined by the protocol’s ability to deliver scalable, secure, and low-cost transactions to a global user base. FAQs Q1: What is the primary use case of the ARB token? The ARB token is primarily a governance token. It allows holders to vote on proposals that govern the Arbitrum DAO, which controls key decisions for the Arbitrum ecosystem, including treasury funds, protocol upgrades, and grant allocations. Q2: How does Arbitrum’s technology differ from other Layer 2 solutions? Arbitrum uses Optimistic Rollup technology, which assumes transactions are valid by default and uses a fraud-proof challenge period. This differs from Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Rollups, which use cryptographic validity proofs. Arbitrum is known for its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, making it easy for developers to port Ethereum applications. Q3: What are the biggest risks to Arbitrum’s growth and ARB’s price? Key risks include intense competition from other Layer 2s and Layer 1 blockchains, potential technological obsolescence, regulatory actions targeting DAOs or DeFi, security vulnerabilities or exploits, and prolonged bear markets in the broader cryptocurrency sector. Q4: Does user activity directly increase the value of the ARB token? Indirectly, yes. Increased user activity generates more transaction fees. While the current design does not directly burn or distribute these fees to token holders, the DAO can vote to change the tokenomics to create a more direct value-accrual mechanism, linking usage to token value more strongly. Q5: Where can I find reliable data to track Arbitrum’s fundamental health? Reliable data can be found on blockchain analytics platforms like Dune Analytics (for custom dashboards), DefiLlama (for TVL and ecosystem tracking), and the official Arbitrum ecosystem portal. These sources provide transparent, on-chain metrics for informed analysis.

This substantial loss highlights the inherent risks when political organizations hold digital assets instead of converting donations to traditional currency, potentially reshaping how future campaigns manage cryptocurrency contributions. Crypto Super PAC Faces $5 Million Valuation Drop The Digital Freedom Fund, launched in August 2024, represents one of the most significant political action committees primarily funded through cryptocurrency assets. According to financial disclosures analyzed by Bloomberg, the Super PAC raised an impressive $22 million during the final five months of 2024. However, organizers chose to maintain these funds in their original cryptocurrency form through December 31, rather than converting them to U.S. dollars immediately. This decision proved costly when Bitcoin’s price experienced a significant correction in early 2025. Consequently, the fund’s holdings decreased in value by approximately 23% from their peak valuation. The $5 million loss represents more than just a paper loss—it directly reduces the purchasing power available for political advertising, voter outreach, and candidate support during the crucial 2025 election cycle. Understanding Super PACs and Cryptocurrency Donations Super Political Action Committees, commonly called Super PACs, emerged following the 2010 Citizens United Supreme Court decision. These organizations can raise unlimited funds from corporations, individuals, and unions while operating independently from political campaigns. Unlike traditional PACs, Super PACs cannot donate directly to candidates but can spend unlimited amounts on political advocacy. The integration of cryptocurrency into this system introduces unique considerations: Volatility Risk: Cryptocurrency values can fluctuate dramatically within short periods Regulatory Uncertainty: The Federal Election Commission continues to develop rules for digital asset donations Transparency Challenges: While blockchain transactions are public, connecting wallet addresses to specific individuals requires additional verification Conversion Timing: The decision of when to convert cryptocurrency to fiat currency significantly impacts available funds Bitcoin Price Volatility Impacts Political Fundraising Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has experienced several significant price corrections throughout its history. The early 2025 decline that affected the Digital Freedom Fund’s holdings followed a pattern observed in previous market cycles. However, this instance marks one of the first times such volatility has directly impacted political fundraising at this scale. Historical data shows that Bitcoin’s price movements often correlate with broader market sentiment, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic factors. The table below illustrates key Bitcoin price movements and their potential impact on political donations: Time Period Bitcoin Price Change Potential Impact on $22M Holding November 2024 (Peak) $85,000 $22,000,000 valuation January 2025 $72,000 $18,600,000 valuation Early March 2025 $65,000 $16,800,000 valuation This volatility presents both opportunities and risks for political organizations. While cryptocurrency donations can appreciate significantly, creating additional resources for political messaging, the reverse scenario—demonstrated by the Digital Freedom Fund’s experience—can substantially reduce available funds right when they’re needed most during election seasons. Winklevoss Brothers’ Political Foray Faces Early Test Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, best known as early Bitcoin investors and founders of the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange, established the Digital Freedom Fund as part of their broader advocacy for cryptocurrency-friendly policies. The brothers have consistently argued for clearer regulatory frameworks and greater mainstream adoption of digital assets. Their Super PAC specifically aims to support political candidates who advocate for innovation-friendly cryptocurrency regulations and digital privacy protections. The fund’s substantial fundraising success in late 2024 demonstrated significant interest in cryptocurrency-focused political advocacy. However, the recent valuation drop raises practical questions about asset management strategies for politically focused cryptocurrency funds. Financial experts note that most traditional Super PACs convert donations to cash immediately to ensure budget certainty. The Digital Freedom Fund’s different approach reflects both philosophical commitment to cryptocurrency and potentially strategic considerations about Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation. Nevertheless, the immediate financial impact cannot be ignored, especially with important elections approaching. Regulatory Landscape for Cryptocurrency Political Donations The Federal Election Commission has gradually developed guidelines for cryptocurrency donations since first addressing the issue in 2014. Current regulations require political committees to convert cryptocurrency contributions to U.S. dollars immediately upon receipt, recording the value at the time of conversion. However, these rules primarily address contributions to candidate committees rather than Super PACs. This regulatory gap allows Super PACs more flexibility in holding cryptocurrency assets, though they must still disclose valuations at regular intervals. The Digital Freedom Fund’s experience may prompt renewed regulatory scrutiny and potentially new guidelines specifically addressing how Super PACs should manage cryptocurrency holdings to protect against volatility risks. Broader Implications for Political Fundraising Strategies The Digital Freedom Fund’s $5 million loss carries significance beyond this specific organization. Political strategists across the spectrum are now closely examining how cryptocurrency volatility might impact future fundraising approaches. Several key considerations have emerged from this situation: Risk Management Protocols: Political organizations may develop formal policies for converting cryptocurrency donations Donor Communication: Transparency about how digital asset donations are managed becomes increasingly important Timing Strategies: The election calendar may influence when cryptocurrency conversions occur Diversification Approaches: Some funds might consider holding multiple cryptocurrencies to spread risk Hedging Mechanisms: Advanced financial instruments could potentially mitigate volatility impacts Furthermore, this event may influence donor behavior. Some cryptocurrency advocates might prefer donating stablecoins—cryptocurrencies pegged to traditional assets like the U.S. dollar—to avoid valuation fluctuations between donation and expenditure. Others may see volatility as an acceptable risk in pursuit of broader policy goals. Historical Context of Cryptocurrency in Politics Cryptocurrency’s role in political fundraising has evolved significantly since the first Bitcoin political donation in 2013. Early adopters viewed digital currency donations as both a practical tool and a philosophical statement about financial independence and technological innovation. Over time, cryptocurrency donations have grown from novelty contributions to substantial funding sources for certain candidates and causes. The 2024 election cycle marked a turning point, with multiple presidential candidates accepting cryptocurrency donations and several cryptocurrency-focused Super PACs emerging. The Digital Freedom Fund represented one of the most ambitious efforts in this space, aiming to leverage cryptocurrency wealth to influence policy discussions around digital assets, privacy, and financial innovation. This recent valuation drop serves as a reality check for the cryptocurrency political movement. While digital assets offer new fundraising avenues and engage technologically savvy donors, they also introduce financial management challenges unfamiliar to most political operatives. How organizations adapt to these challenges will likely shape cryptocurrency’s political role for years to come. Conclusion The Crypto Super PAC Digital Freedom Fund’s $5 million loss amid Bitcoin price volatility provides a compelling case study in the intersection of digital assets and political fundraising. This event demonstrates both the potential and pitfalls of cryptocurrency donations, highlighting volatility risks that traditional political financing rarely encounters. As cryptocurrency continues gaining prominence in political fundraising, both regulators and practitioners must develop frameworks that balance innovation with financial stability. The Winklevoss brothers’ foray into political advocacy through their crypto-focused Super PAC has undoubtedly advanced important conversations about digital assets in politics, even as it confronts the practical realities of cryptocurrency market fluctuations. FAQs Q1: What is a Crypto Super PAC? A Crypto Super PAC is a political action committee that primarily raises funds through cryptocurrency donations and advocates for cryptocurrency-friendly policies. Unlike traditional PACs, Super PACs can raise unlimited funds but cannot donate directly to candidates. Q2: How much did the Digital Freedom Fund lose? The Digital Freedom Fund’s holdings decreased by approximately $5 million in value due to Bitcoin price declines in early 2025. The fund had raised $22 million in the latter half of 2024 but maintained these funds in cryptocurrency rather than converting to cash immediately. Q3: Who founded the Digital Freedom Fund? Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, co-founders of the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange and early Bitcoin investors, established the Digital Freedom Fund in August 2024 to support political candidates favoring innovation-friendly cryptocurrency regulations. Q4: Why didn’t the Super PAC convert donations to cash immediately? The fund’s organizers chose to maintain cryptocurrency holdings, possibly reflecting philosophical commitment to digital assets, expectations of Bitcoin appreciation, or different interpretations of regulations governing Super PAC asset management compared to traditional political committees. Q5: What does this mean for future cryptocurrency political donations? This event highlights volatility risks in cryptocurrency political fundraising, potentially leading to more conservative asset management strategies, increased regulatory scrutiny, greater donor interest in stablecoins, and more sophisticated risk mitigation approaches for politically focused cryptocurrency funds.

Once defined by small LAN tournaments and online ladders, esports now commands stadium crowds, multimillion-dollar prize pools, and viewership numbers that rival traditional sports broadcasts. Publishers, sponsors, and broadcasters are investing heavily, betting that competitive gaming will continue to reshape how younger audiences engage with sport, media, and technology. From grassroots scenes to global stages The modern esports ecosystem is built on a foundation of grassroots competition. Many professional players still emerge from ranked online play, community tournaments, and semi-professional leagues before being signed by top organisations. This open pathway has helped esports maintain a sense of accessibility, with fans often believing they could one day compete on the same stage as their heroes. At the top end, elite tournaments now resemble major sporting events, complete with production crews, analysts, commentators, and packed live audiences. Events for popular competitive titles regularly sell out arenas, while millions more tune in via streaming platforms to watch matches unfold in real time. A new generation of professional athletes Today’s top esports players train with a level of discipline that would have been unthinkable a decade ago. Teams employ coaches, analysts, psychologists, and fitness specialists to help players maintain performance during long seasons. Practice schedules can stretch for eight to ten hours a day, combining mechanical drills, strategic review, and opponent analysis. Mental resilience has become just as important as reaction speed, particularly in high-pressure matches where a single mistake can decide a championship. As prize money and salaries have increased, so too has scrutiny, with fans, sponsors, and organisations expecting consistency and professionalism. Streaming and the rise of the spectator economy Streaming platforms have played a central role in competitive gaming’s growth. Unlike traditional sports, esports developed alongside interactive live broadcasts, allowing fans to chat, donate, and engage directly with players and commentators. This constant interaction has helped build tight-knit communities around teams and personalities, blurring the line between competitor and content creator. For many professionals, streaming now represents a significant income stream alongside tournament earnings. It also serves as a training ground for aspiring players, who can learn strategies, decision-making, and even mindset by watching the best compete live. Sponsorship, betting, and crossover appeal As audiences have grown, so has commercial interest. Sponsors from technology, apparel, energy drinks, and financial services have all entered the esports space, eager to connect with digitally native fans. The competitive nature of esports also lends itself to analytical discussion, predictions, and performance tracking, mirroring trends seen in traditional sports coverage. Some fans engage with competitive gaming through fantasy leagues or statistics-based discussions, while others explore related gaming experiences during downtime, whether that’s following speedrunning communities or even taking a break to try out your baccarat skills between tournament matches. This crossover highlights how esports sits within a broader digital entertainment ecosystem rather than existing in isolation. Challenges facing the industry Despite its growth, competitive gaming still faces structural challenges. Player burnout remains a concern, with long seasons, frequent travel, and constant public exposure taking a toll on mental health. There is also ongoing debate around sustainability, particularly for smaller organisations struggling to balance rising costs with uncertain revenue streams. Publishers retain significant control over competitive titles, meaning rule changes, league formats, or even the discontinuation of a game can dramatically reshape the landscape overnight. Regulation and governance continue to evolve as esports matures, especially in areas such as player contracts, competitive integrity, and fair play, according to GamblingNews.uk . What the future holds Looking ahead, competitive gaming appears set for further expansion rather than slowdown. Mobile esports is gaining traction in emerging markets, while advancements in broadcast technology are making events more immersive for viewers. Traditional sports organisations are increasingly collaborating with esports teams, recognising shared audiences and commercial opportunities. At the same time, the next generation of players is growing up with competitive gaming as a normalised career aspiration rather than a fringe pursuit. As infrastructure improves and professional standards rise, esports is likely to become even more embedded in the global entertainment mainstream. Competitive gaming may still be evolving, but its trajectory is clear. What began as informal competition between enthusiasts has transformed into a global industry, driven by skill, strategy, and a deeply engaged fanbase that shows no sign of logging off anytime soon.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TECHNOLOGY|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2026-01-31 06:54:40
57609000,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=267361,1769842511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Kevin Warsh Epstein Files: The Shocking Link Between Trump’s Fed Pick and Jeffrey Epstein’s Network,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/kevin-warsh-epstein-files-trump-fed/,"BitcoinWorld Kevin Warsh Epstein Files: The Shocking Link Between Trump’s Fed Pick and Jeffrey Epstein’s Network WASHINGTON, D.C. – January 15, 2025 – A newly surfaced document from the vast Jeffrey Epstein archive has thrust Kevin Warsh, a former Federal Reserve governor and once a leading contender to chair the central bank under President Donald Trump, back into a harsh spotlight. This revelation, first reported by Yahoo Finance, centers on an invitation list for a 2010 Christmas event on the island of St. Barts, connecting a pivotal figure in modern economic policy to the periphery of Epstein’s notorious orbit. Consequently, this discovery re-ignites complex questions about the intersections of power, finance, and accountability within elite circles. Kevin Warsh Epstein File Details Emerge The core of the current report hinges on a single document: a guest list for a holiday gathering. Specifically, Kevin Warsh’s name appears on an invitation for a Christmas event in St. Barts in December 2010. At that time, Warsh served as a Governor on the Federal Reserve Board, a role he held from 2006 to 2011. Importantly, the document does not confirm his attendance, only his inclusion on a preliminary list. However, its existence within the Epstein files provides a tangible link, however circumstantial, between a key architect of the Fed’s response to the 2008 financial crisis and the social network of a convicted sex offender. This St. Barts list forms part of a much larger cache of materials. The U.S. Department of Justice has previously released hundreds of thousands of pages related to the Epstein case. These documents have fueled intense public scrutiny and legal proceedings. They often detail the financier’s extensive connections with politicians, academics, royalty, and business leaders. Therefore, each new name that surfaces undergoes immediate and rigorous examination for context and implication. The Political and Nominations Timeline Context To understand the significance, one must revisit the political timeline. In 2017, President Donald Trump seriously considered Kevin Warsh for the role of Federal Reserve Chair. Ultimately, Trump nominated Jerome Powell, but Warsh remained a influential voice in conservative economic circles. The Fed chair position is arguably the world’s most powerful economic appointment, responsible for setting U.S. monetary policy that impacts global markets. A nominee’s background, associations, and judgment undergo extreme vetting. The emergence of a connection to Epstein files, even a decade-old social invitation, would have presented a monumental complication for any high-level confirmation process. It would have guaranteed intense Senate scrutiny. Furthermore, it would have dominated media cycles. Historical precedent shows that even tangential links to scandals can derail nominations. For instance, past judicial or cabinet nominees have faced rejection over lesser association controversies. Expert Analysis on Vetting and Perception Dr. Eleanor Vance, a political historian at Georgetown University, provides critical context. “The vetting process for positions like Fed Chair is exhaustive,” Vance notes. “It scrutinizes every professional and personal association. A name appearing in the Epstein files, regardless of the context, creates an immediate perception problem. It forces the nominee to explain a connection to a network synonymous with grave criminal activity, which can overshadow policy expertise.” This analysis underscores the potential career impact of such document releases, even years after the fact. Broader Implications from the Epstein Documents The same trove of documents that mentions Warsh contains other startling financial intersections. Notably, files reportedly indicate that former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and Tether co-founder Brock Pierce held discussions about Bitcoin at Epstein’s Manhattan mansion. This detail reveals how Epstein’s residences served as unconventional hubs for high-stakes financial dialogue. The inclusion of cryptocurrency pioneers like Pierce alongside established figures like Summers illustrates the eclectic and powerful nature of Epstein’s network. Larry Summers: Former Treasury Secretary, Harvard President, and influential economist. Brock Pierce: Entrepreneur, former child actor, and a founding board member of the Bitcoin Foundation. Context: Their alleged meeting occurred during Bitcoin’s early, volatile years, highlighting Epstein’s reach into emerging digital asset circles. These revelations collectively paint a picture of a network that bridged traditional Wall Street power, academic prestige, and the frontier of digital currency. The documents do not suggest illegal activity by Summers or Pierce regarding these discussions. However, they firmly place significant financial conversations within the physical setting of Epstein’s world. Legal Releases and Ongoing Investigations The public knowledge of these connections stems from a protracted legal process. Following Epstein’s death in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019, a civil case in New York federal court compelled the gradual release of documents. These include depositions, flight logs, and personal records. Judge Loretta A. Preska has overseen the unsealing of thousands of pages, with releases continuing into 2024 and 2025. Each release triggers a media cycle of analysis as journalists and researchers parse the names and events detailed within. The Department of Justice and the FBI continue their investigative work into Epstein’s co-conspirators. Ghislaine Maxwell’s conviction in 2021 demonstrated the ongoing legal pursuit of accountability. New document dumps can provide fresh leads or context for investigators. They also sustain public demand for transparency regarding the full scope of Epstein’s operations and associations. The Impact on Public Trust in Institutions The recurring theme of elite names in these files erodes public confidence. When figures connected to paramount institutions like the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, or top universities appear, it fuels narratives of a detached ruling class. Professor David Chen, a sociologist at MIT who studies institutional trust, explains the effect: “Each new data point, even if innocuous in isolation, accumulates into a larger public perception of systemic entanglement. It becomes less about individual guilt and more about a culture of access and impunity that the public finds deeply corrosive.” This erosion of trust presents a long-term challenge for the legitimacy of financial and governmental bodies. Conclusion The appearance of Kevin Warsh’s name in the Jeffrey Epstein files serves as a potent reminder of how past associations can resurface with profound consequences. While the 2010 St. Barts invitation list denotes a social, not criminal, link, its existence within this infamous archive inevitably colors the legacy of a major economic policymaker. Furthermore, the parallel revelation of Bitcoin discussions involving Larry Summers and Brock Pierce at Epstein’s home underscores the bizarre confluence of high finance, digital innovation, and criminal scandal. Ultimately, the ongoing dissection of the Epstein documents continues to challenge the narratives around power, privacy, and accountability in the 21st century, ensuring that the Kevin Warsh Epstein story remains a subject of public and historical scrutiny. FAQs Q1: What is the specific document linking Kevin Warsh to Jeffrey Epstein? The link is an invitation list for a Christmas event on St. Barts in 2010. Kevin Warsh’s name appears as a potential guest. The document is part of the vast collection of records released by courts related to Epstein’s activities. Q2: Was Kevin Warsh ever charged with any crime related to Epstein? No. There is no public evidence or allegation that Kevin Warsh was involved in any criminal activity related to Jeffrey Epstein. The connection reported is solely his name on a social event guest list. Q3: How did this information come to light in 2025? The documents are being unsealed on a rolling basis by order of a federal judge. A new batch of records, containing this guest list, was processed and reviewed by media outlets like Yahoo Finance, leading to the 2025 report. Q4: What was Kevin Warsh’s role in the Federal Reserve? Kevin Warsh served as a Governor on the Board of the Federal Reserve System from 2006 to 2011. He was a key advisor during the 2008 financial crisis and was later seriously considered by President Trump for Fed Chair in 2017. Q5: What do the files say about Bitcoin and Epstein’s mansion? Reportedly, the files indicate that former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and Tether co-founder Brock Pierce discussed Bitcoin during a meeting at Epstein’s Manhattan home. This highlights the range of financial topics debated within Epstein’s network.

Amid this, BTC has fallen 34% over the past four months, a slide that has fueled growing debate over whether the market has entered a new bear phase. Against that backdrop of heightened uncertainty, Binance said it intends to take concrete steps to support the broader crypto ecosystem rather than retreat during market stress. Binance Overhauls SAFU Fund In an open letter released to the community on Friday, Binance reiterated its view that Bitcoin remains the foundational asset of the crypto market and a store of long‑term value, regardless of short‑term price swings. Based on that conviction, the company announced plans to overhaul the composition of its Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU). Binance said it will convert the SAFU fund’s existing $1 billion reserves, currently held in stablecoins, into Bitcoin. The conversion is expected to be completed within 30 days of the announcement. Going forward, the exchange plans to actively rebalance the fund by monitoring its market value. If fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price cause the SAFU fund to fall below $800 million, Binance said it will step in to replenish the balance and restore the fund’s value to $1 billion. According to the exchange, the decision forms part of a broader, long‑term strategy to continue investing resources into the crypto industry through both favorable and challenging market conditions. 2025 Protection Metrics In the same letter, Binance highlighted a series of initiatives it carried out in 2025 to support users, strengthen compliance, and contribute to ecosystem development . The company said it assisted users in recovering funds from nearly 38,648 cases of incorrect deposits during the year, returning a total of $48 million. Cumulatively, Binance noted that it has helped users recover more than $1.09 billion to date. On the risk management front, the exchange reported that it helped 5.4 million users identify potential threats in 2025, preventing an estimated $6.69 billion in losses tied to scams. Binance also pointed to its cooperation with global law enforcement agencies, which it said resulted in the seizure of approximately $131 million in illegally obtained funds. On transparency, Binance said that by the end of 2025, its proof‑of‑reserves showed user assets totaling about $162.8 billion, fully backed across 45 different crypto assets. In closing, the exchange said it plans to continue addressing market concerns through tangible actions, maintaining a focus on openness, transparency, and long‑term participation in industry development. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $83,336, marking an 8% decline over the past week. Similarly, Binance Coin (BNB), the exchange’s native token, has dropped 5% during the same period and is currently hovering at around $848 per token.

While Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and most major tokens have struggled amid a market‑wide pullback, Hyperliquid has continued to post notable gains, setting it apart during what many consider the early stages of a bear market. What’s Driving Hyperliquid Higher Market data from CoinGecko shows that HYPE surged roughly 31% over the past week, pushing the token toward the $34 level earlier in the week, and marking its highest price in more than a month. Over the past 14 days, HYPE is up around 17%, while gains of 13% and 8% were recorded over the 30‑day and year‑over‑year periods, respectively. By comparison, Bitcoin has fallen 12% over two weeks, slipped 4% over the past month, and is down roughly 21% year‑over‑year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Loss Begins To Rise, Raising Early Bear Market Concerns Experts have pointed to fundamental and structural developments as key drivers behind HYPE’s performance. Crypto analyst Elite Crypto highlighted the impact of Hyperliquid’s HIP‑3 upgrade, which introduced permissionless perpetual contracts tied to real‑world assets (RWAs) such as gold, silver, and other commodities. According to the analyst, trading activity in these products has expanded rapidly, with silver‑based perpetuals alone exceeding $1 billion in daily volume on many occasions. Elite Crypto also pointed to signs of institutional accumulation, noting that decentralized autonomous traders, including strategies operating directly on Hyperliquid, have been steadily increasing their exposure. In addition, research firm Citrini has published bullish commentary on the platform, and speculation around a potential HYPE exchange‑traded fund (ETF) has added to market interest. HYPE Faces Crucial Technical Test From a technical perspective, analysts see important levels coming into focus. DeFi Guru noted that HYPE is currently testing its primary descending resistance, describing recent price action as impulsive and confidence‑driven, suggesting a shift in momentum. The analyst identified $30 as a key level to reclaim decisively. A clean move above that area could open the door to the next major target near $35, which aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slides Toward $85,000 Despite Progress On US Crypto Market Structure Bill Another analyst, Efloud, offered a more cautious view and outlined potential support and resistance zones for Hyperliquid. He identified a key support region near the $23.7 level, which is crucial in determining whether the cryptocurrency will continue its rally. Efloud noted that price has already reached an intermediate resistance area and suggested that short‑side setups would only be considered if bearish market structure appears on lower time frames, either at current levels or closer to the $38–$39 range. Despite the broader bullish narrative, Hyperliquid has not been immune to short‑term volatility. Over the past 24 hours, HYPE has pulled back by roughly 10%, falling toward around $29. Analyst Ox Kaize described the recent dip as a normal market reaction, particularly given recent developments affecting both gold and Bitcoin. He asserts that a recovery in those markets could provide additional upside momentum for Hyperliquid, potentially pushing the token toward the $50 level. Additional catalysts remain on the horizon. A second Hyperliquid airdrop is expected in the near future, and Kaize believes the timing could be deliberate, as distributing tokens while prices remain below peak levels may support longer‑term ecosystem growth.

Nevertheless, House Speaker Mike Johnson noted that the chamber is expected to pass the Senate-approved funding deal on Monday as the POTUS outlined his support for it. Perhaps that’s the reason why BTC remained relatively calm following the Thursday storm. With a 71-29 vote, the Senate greenlighted a package of five bills, plus a two-week stopgap measure that provides lawmakers with more time to work out disputes over funding for the Department of Homeland Security. The House of Representatives will vote to approve the final version of the deal on Monday, so the federal government has shut down for the second time during Trump’s current presidency. However, this one is expected to be significantly shorter, unlike the record 43-day period in 2025. US Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought advised federal agency heads that their employees “should report to work for their next regularly scheduled tour of duty to undertake orderly shutdown activities.” “The Administration will cotinue working with the Congress to address recently raised concerns to complete appropriations for Fiscal Year 2026. It is our hope that this lapse will be short,” he added . In the light of this new sort of uncertainty in the world’s largest economy, bitcoin’s price has remained relatively stable. The asset tumbled hard on Thursday to a multi-month low of $81,000 but managed to recover some ground on Friday and Saturday morning and now sits close to $84,000. BTCUSD Jan 31.

This figure represents a critical 14% year-over-year increase, a development that unfolded even as the total number of individual deals contracted from 85 to just 60. Consequently, this divergence between capital volume and deal count paints a nuanced picture of a maturing market where institutional capital is concentrating on established, infrastructure-focused winners. The month’s activity was decisively anchored by three colossal funding rounds that collectively commanded over 40% of the total capital deployed. Crypto VC Investment Reveals a Strategic Shift in January 2025 The $1.4 billion crypto VC investment total for January 2025 immediately signals a reignition of institutional confidence following a period of market consolidation. However, the simultaneous drop in deal count from 85 to 60 is equally telling. This pattern strongly suggests a strategic pivot by investors toward later-stage, more mature companies with proven business models and clearer regulatory pathways. Analysts interpret this not as a retreat from the sector, but as a refinement of risk appetite. Venture firms are now demonstrably prioritizing quality over quantity, funneling larger checks into fewer entities that form the essential plumbing of the digital asset ecosystem. This trend mirrors broader maturation phases in technology sectors, from cloud computing to mobile apps. Furthermore, the 14% increase compared to January 2024 provides a crucial year-on-year benchmark, indicating that the recovery from the 2022-2023 downturn is gaining tangible, financial momentum. The capital influx is no longer speculative seed funding for novel concepts. Instead, it represents growth equity for scalable solutions solving real-world problems in payments, custody, and market structure. Deconstructing the Monumental January Funding Rounds The headline $1.4 billion crypto VC investment figure was overwhelmingly driven by a trio of mega-deals, each targeting a foundational layer of the blockchain economy. These rounds provide a clear map of where sophisticated investors see the most immediate value and least regulatory friction. Rain ($250 Million): This stablecoin payment infrastructure firm’s raise underscores the explosive demand for efficient, borderless digital dollar transactions. Rain’s technology enables merchants and enterprises to seamlessly accept and settle payments in stablecoins, bridging traditional finance and crypto. This massive investment highlights the VC bet on stablecoins becoming a default tool for global commerce. BitGo ($213 Million): As a premier cryptocurrency custody company, BitGo’s funding round is a direct response to escalating institutional demand for secure, insured digital asset storage. Following the wave of spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, the need for qualified, regulated custodians has skyrocketed. This investment reinforces security and compliance as non-negotiable, bank-grade requirements for further institutional adoption. LMAX ($150 Million): The UK-based fintech firm, known for its institutional foreign exchange and cryptocurrency trading platform, secured significant capital to expand its digital asset offerings. This round signals confidence in regulated, high-throughput trading venues that serve professional traders and funds, emphasizing market structure over retail speculation. January 2025 Top Crypto VC Investment Rounds Company Sector Focus Amount Raised Core Value Proposition Rain Stablecoin Payments $250 Million Enterprise payment infrastructure BitGo Digital Asset Custody $213 Million Institutional-grade security & compliance LMAX Institutional Trading $150 Million Regulated, high-performance exchange Contextualizing the Surge Within Broader Market Trends The January 2025 crypto VC investment data cannot be viewed in isolation. It arrives amidst a confluence of positive macro and regulatory developments for digital assets. Firstly, the successful launch and substantial asset accumulation by multiple U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs has created a powerful feedback loop. These ETFs require secure custody and create legitimacy, which in turn attracts more institutional capital into venture bets on supporting services. Secondly, regulatory clarity, though incremental, is advancing in key jurisdictions like the EU with MiCA and through targeted U.S. legislation, reducing perceived policy risk for infrastructure investors. Thirdly, the broader venture capital landscape has shown cautious optimism, with dry powder seeking growth sectors. Blockchain infrastructure, particularly areas interfacing with traditional finance (TradFi), presents a compelling narrative of digitization and efficiency gains. Therefore, the capital concentration in payments, custody, and trading reflects a “picks and shovels” strategy. Investors are funding the companies that enable the next wave of adoption, rather than betting directly on volatile consumer-facing applications or novel tokens. Expert Analysis on Capital Concentration and Future Trajectories Market analysts specializing in blockchain financing point to the deal size increase as a definitive health signal. “A decline in deal count paired with a rise in total capital is classic market maturation,” notes a lead partner at a fintech-focused venture firm. “It tells us due diligence is deeper, business models are more robust, and the path to profitability is shorter. The capital is chasing revenue, not just user growth.” This sentiment is echoed by data from previous tech cycles, where similar consolidation phases often preceded periods of massive, sustainable scale for the surviving leaders. The geographic distribution of these major rounds is also instructive. While not exclusive, significant funding flowed to firms with strong operational presences in regulatory-forward regions like the UK and Singapore. This underscores a global flight to quality and regulatory alignment. The investment thesis appears to prioritize companies that can navigate complex financial regulations while deploying blockchain’s advantages. Looking ahead, this trend suggests continued strong funding for sectors like regulatory technology (RegTech) for crypto, institutional-grade DeFi protocols, and enterprise blockchain solutions for supply chain and asset tokenization. Conclusion The $1.4 billion crypto VC investment total for January 2025 delivers a resounding message of strategic, concentrated confidence. While fewer companies secured funding, the ones that did received monumental sums aimed at scaling critical infrastructure for payments, custody, and trading. This capital allocation pattern highlights a pivotal shift from speculative bets to foundational investments, directly fueled by institutional adoption via ETFs and evolving regulatory frameworks. The crypto venture landscape is not merely recovering; it is maturing decisively, with capital acting as a powerful signal of the sector’s prioritized roadmap toward integration with the global financial system. FAQs Q1: What does the drop in deal count alongside rising total investment mean? This typically indicates market maturation. Venture capitalists are making larger, more concentrated bets on fewer, later-stage companies with proven business models and clearer paths to scale, moving away from spreading smaller amounts across many early-stage, riskier startups. Q2: Why are sectors like custody and payments receiving so much funding? These are “picks and shovels” infrastructure sectors. They provide essential services (security, compliance, transaction rails) required for broader institutional and corporate adoption of crypto, especially after events like Bitcoin ETF approvals which increased demand for regulated custody and efficient settlement. Q3: How does January 2025 compare to the peak of the last crypto bull market? While significant, the $1.4 billion figure remains below the monthly peaks seen during the 2021-2022 frenzy. However, the quality and focus of the capital are considered healthier. Today’s funding targets sustainable revenue models and regulatory compliance, unlike the previous cycle’s emphasis on speculative consumer apps and token launches. Q4: Does this investment surge guarantee a new bull market for crypto prices? Not directly. Venture capital investment is a leading indicator of builder and institutional confidence in the underlying technology and business ecosystem. While generally positive for long-term health, it does not have a immediate, direct correlation with short-term token price movements, which are influenced by a wider array of macroeconomic factors. Q5: What regions are attracting the most crypto VC investment now? The major deals show a continued strong focus on companies with operations in jurisdictions providing regulatory clarity, such as the United Kingdom, Singapore, and parts of the European Union. There is a clear trend of capital flowing towards projects that proactively engage with financial regulators rather than operate in ambiguous environments.

By 2029, $TRUMP could reach a maximum price of $14.89. In 2032, $TRUMP will range between $18.45 to $24.20. The Official Trump coin ($TRUMP) was launched on January 17, 2025, just three days before the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Following President Trump’s “newfound” crypto inclination, the $TRUMP meme coin was birthed. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1880446012168249386 The coin has a total supply of 1 Billion tokens, with an initial 200 million tokens unlocked at launch. Subsequent unlocks are scheduled over the next three (3) years. $Trump token unlock roadmap Trump’s “advocacy” for digital assets reforms boosted interest in $TRUMP in the first few days, driving it to an all-time high (ATH) of $75.35. Several other meme tokens, like the Official MELANIA coin, also rode the momentum. Despite the initial surge, Official Trump’s value has plunged to lower levels amidst shifting market sentiment and uproar around the legitimacy of a “President-owned Meme coin.” The price performance of Official Trump is down over 85% from its all-time high, raising questions among investors, such as: How much will Trump coin be worth? Can Trump coin reach $100? This piece explores the Official Trump price predictions for 2026-2032. Overview Cryptocurrency Official Trump Token $TRUMP Price $4.50 Market Capitalization $922.02M Trading Volume $212.66M Circulating Supply 205.26M TRUMP All-time High $73.43 (January 19, 2025) All-time Low $4.29 (January 18, 2025) 24-h High $4.58 24-h Low $4.43 Official Trump technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 6.11% (High) 14-Day RSI 32.68 (Neutral) 50-Day SMA $5.21 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 16 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $7.27 Official Trump Coin ($TRUMP) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown OP is still in a strong downtrend with momentum firmly bearish. The RSI is near oversold, hinting at short bounces, but no reversal confirmation yet. A drop below $0.254 risks further downside, and a move above $0.30 is required for trend relief. Official Trump coin 1-day price analysis OP is trading today, January 31, around $0.2605, down 0.88% on the session, continuing a clear sequence of lower highs and lower lows. The coin’s price is firmly below the Bollinger mid-band near $0.310, while riding the lower band around $0.254, signaling sustained bearish momentum rather than a volatility squeeze. TRUMP/USDT 1-day price chart by TradingView From the recent swing high near $0.32, OP has already shed roughly 18–19%, with no meaningful bullish reaction so far. The RSI sits near 34, hovering just above oversold territory, which suggests sellers are still in control despite some short-term exhaustion risk. The MACD remains deeply negative with expanding red histograms, confirming that downside momentum is still accelerating rather than stabilizing. Official Trump 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour timeframe, OP trades around $0.2605, down 0.53%, consolidating after a sharp impulsive drop from the $0.30–0.305 zone, a decline of roughly 14%. The Alligator indicator is fully open to the downside, with price pinned below all moving averages, reinforcing a bearish trend. TRUMP/USDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The MACD remains below zero with no bullish crossover attempts, while OBV continues to grind lower, highlighting ongoing distribution and a lack of dip-buying conviction. Minor candles around $0.258–0.262 look more like pause candles than reversal signals, keeping the risk tilted toward another leg lower if support fails. $TRUMP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $5.02 SELL SMA 5 $4.83 SELL SMA 10 $4.79 SELL SMA 21 $5.09 SELL SMA 50 $5.21 SELL SMA 100 $5.99 SELL SMA 200 $7.27 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $5.12 SELL EMA 5 $5.19 SELL EMA 10 $5.19 SELL EMA 21 $5.21 SELL EMA 50 $5.58 SELL EMA 100 $6.29 SELL EMA 200 $7.59 SELL What to expect from $TRUMP price analysis As long as OP remains below $0.278–0.28, rallies are corrective, not trend-changing. A clean break below $0.254 would expose $0.24 quickly, while bulls would need a daily reclaim of $0.30 to even begin neutralizing the bearish structure. Is Official Trump a good investment? Meme coins like $TRUMP are volatile and driven by hype, not fundamentals. While they can offer big rewards, they come with high risk and uncertainty. If you’re making an investment decision on TRUMP coin, do your own research carefully and prepare for price swings. Why is $TRUMP down? $TRUMP plunged hard post‑launch, now rattling in a tight $4–6 consolidation over the past month as traders wait for new hype or a breakdown. With most tokens controlled by insiders, sentiment remains weak, and only fresh utility or momentum could revitalize it. Official Trump coin price history by Coingecko Will Official Trump reach $50 soon? $TRUMP coin already saw this price point in January; increased investor interest could result in a quick resurgence. Will Official Trump reach $100? Having touched a peak price of $75.35 and a market cap of $15 billion in its first few weeks, the $100 milestone might not be much of a hurdle to scale, provided $TRUMP can recapture the momentum it had in its earlier days. Will $TRUMP reach $1000? For $TRUMP to hit $1,000, its market cap would need to rise over 100× into the hundreds of billions, or even trillions if locked supply is released. With dilution risks, weak fundamentals, regulation, and competition, the chance of this happening in the next few years is very low.” Does Official Trump have a good long-term future? The long-term future of the Official Trump Coin is uncertain. While it has gained attention, peaked at $75, and generated significant revenue, its success will depend on crypto market trends, investor confidence, and how it navigates regulatory challenges. Recent news/opinion on $TRUMP Melania ‘meme coin’ value bottoms out as Trump brands collapse: WSJ Wall Street Journal reports that the market has “soured” on Trump brands. Reporter Jack Pitcher wrote, “Digital ‘meme coins’ named for Trump and first lady Melania Trump are down 86% and 99% since inauguration day, respectively.

Official TRUMP historic price sentiment Official Trump coin price history by Coingecko Official Trump coin was launched on January 17, 2025, just a few days before the US presidential inauguration. Briefly after launch, the euphoria of DJT’s inauguration drove the $TRUMP coin to an all-time high of $75.35. As expected, market players took profit, and the Official Trump coin lost momentum, hitting a low of $18.75 by February 1, a massive 75% drop in price. Further price declines followed, but $TRUMP showed some resilience, reaching a high of $24 by mid-February, albeit short-lived. The bears recaptured the market in the following months, and the Official Trump coin settled at lower prices – about $7 to $11 between March and April. $TRUMP hit a high of $16.28 by April end, but has since maintained an average price of about $10.5. Official Trump coin traded between $8.07 and $10.13 in August. In September, TRUMP maintained a trading range of $7.37-$9.46, and in October, it traded between $7.65-$8.02. In December 2025, TRUMP maintained a trading range of $4.43 and $6.16. At the start of January 2026, the coin opened trading at around $4.9, and at the time of writing, January 31, TRUMP is trading between $4.43 and $4.58.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|ZRX|BNB|OP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-31 07:24:00

Figures verified in a report prepared by accounting firm BDO showed the stablecoin issuer generated more than $10 billion in net profit during the year, down from the $13 billion it recorded in 2024. Treasury allocation reflects focus on safety and liquidity Direct exposure to U.S. Treasuries surpassed $122 billion, a level the company described as evidence of an ongoing shift toward highly liquid, low-risk assets within its reserve management strategy. Total assets on the balance sheet increased by $49.17 billion year on year, reflecting expanding issuance and continued accumulation of reserves as the stablecoin ecosystem grew across international markets. USDt issuance rises as demand for digital dollars accelerates Over the past twelve months, the company issued approximately $50 billion worth of new USDt tokens as demand for digital dollars increased in regions where traditional banking systems remain slow or fragmented. Tether chief executive Paolo Ardoino said the stablecoin’s adoption has expanded because of “global demand” for U.S. dollars increasingly moving outside conventional financial infrastructure. “Particularly in regions where financial systems are slow, fragmented, or inaccessible,” he said, claiming that the stablecoin has “become the most widely adopted monetary social network in the history of humanity.” Market attention remains fixed on Tether’s reserves Market participants continue to monitor Tether’s disclosures closely because USDt represents a substantial share of liquidity used across exchanges, trading desks, and decentralised finance platforms worldwide. USDt ranks as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation behind Bitcoin and Ether, making its reported reserves an important indicator of confidence across the broader stablecoin market. Traders frequently rely on USDt as a digital dollar substitute for collateral, settlement, and margin purposes, increasing the importance of reserve composition and overall profitability figures. Gold exposure strengthens alongside dollar-backed reserves Alongside Treasuries, Tether has steadily increased its exposure to gold, reporting approximately $12 billion in gold-related reserves as of September 2025. The company holds 520,089 troy ounces of gold specifically backing its XAUt tokens, equivalent to roughly 16.2 metric tons, which are kept separate from its broader bullion holdings. “Tether maintains approximately 130 metric tons of physical gold, and the gold backing every XAUT token is held separately, making it eligible for physical delivery redemption,” a spokesperson for Tether recently told Cointelegraph. Broader physical gold reserves amount to about 130 metric tons, valued at nearly $22 billion at current market prices, adding another layer of perceived stability to its overall reserve structure.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|USDT|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2026-01-31 07:32:08

Here’s How Gold and Silver Dumped by Double Digits in 1 Day,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-too-volatile-heres-how-gold-and-silver-dumped-by-double-digits-in-1-day/,"Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry are often blamed for being too volatile and immature for legacy investors, a claim that proved true once again at the end of the business week. At the same time, safe haven assets like gold and silver are praised for their stability, especially in times of uncertainty. That’s not what happened on Thursday and Friday, though. Double-Digit Precious Metal Crashes 2025 became the year of the precious metals, and the beginning of 2026 only solidified this claim. Let’s take gold, for example. It entered the new year at $4,300/oz, but the growing geopolitical tension, as well as the declining value of the greenback, pushed it to consecutive all-time highs, the latest coming on Thursday at $5,600. This meant a whopping 30% increase in just a month. Silver’s performance was even more impressive within the same timeframe – a 70% surge from a 2026 entry price of $72 to $122 peak on January 29. What happened in the following 24 hours, though, was quite the opposite and brutal. These overly praised (and perhaps overbought) precious metals slumped by double digits. Gold went down to $4,700, meaning a 16% decline in a day, while silver essentially erased all yearly gains in a 40% drop to $73. Although both rebounded to $4,900 and $85, respectively, they still ended the trading day deep in the red, showing untypical volatility. The reasons behind this calamity are still debated, with some arguing about a long-overdue profit-taking, while others blame Trump’s nominee for the next Fed Chair, Kevin Warsh. Nevertheless, the reality is that the two largest assets by market cap erased roughly $7 billion from their market caps in just a day, an amount that is more than two times larger than the entire crypto industry. Gold and Silver erased $6.7 Trillion from their market cap in 30 hours. #Bitcoin MCap is $1.64 Trillion. “We are so early” is an understatement. pic.twitter.com/ZQhxlwEH0F — Davinci Jeremie (@Davincij15) January 30, 2026 Not Just BTC, Huh? For years, crypto critics have accused the industry and its market leader in particular of being too volatile and unstable for legacy investors. We are not saying that they are entirely wrong, as BTC just dumped from over $90,000 to $81,000 in about 24 hours as well. However, such fluctuations are more typical for an asset class that has existed for less than 20 years, unlike the centuries-old precious metals. The crypto community quickly picked up the moves by gold and silver. CZ tried to reassure some BTC doubters, indicating that bitcoin is a “17-year-old technology, heavily suppressed in most of its existence.” He added that “we are still early.” Santiment praised BTC’s resilience on Friday in times when silver and gold were plunging hard, and outlined the debate over whether precious metal investors will eventually rotate into crypto.

57609921,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=267329,1769846016,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,US Government Shutdown 2026: How Is the Stalemate Impacting the Crypto Market?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-government-shutdown-2026-how-is-the-stalemate-impacting-the-crypto-market/,"BitcoinWorld US Government Shutdown 2026: How Is the Stalemate Impacting the Crypto Market? The United States officially entered a partial government shutdown at 12:01 a.m. on January 31, 2026 , following the House of Representatives’ failure to pass a Senate-approved spending package. This political deadlock has triggered immediate consequences for the digital asset sector, creating a “data vacuum” for traders and freezing critical regulatory progress at the SEC and CFTC . As investors react to the uncertainty, the crypto market is experiencing heightened volatility, significant ETF outflows , and a pause on major legislative bills like the CLARITY Act . How Is the Shutdown Affecting Bitcoin Prices and Market Liquidity? The news of the shutdown has shifted market sentiment into a state of “ Extreme Fear ,” driving capital away from risk-on assets like cryptocurrency and toward traditional safe havens such as gold. Bitcoin Price Correction: Leading into the shutdown, Bitcoin (BTC) prices fell roughly 7% , testing the critical support range of $81,000–$83,000 as traders de-risked their portfolios. Massive Liquidations: The volatility resulted in a massive leverage flush. On January 30 alone, over $1.68 billion in total crypto liquidations occurred, with long positions accounting for 93% of the wipeout. ETF Outflows: Institutional caution is evident in the spot market. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded net outflows totaling approximately $818 million in a single day as large-scale investors moved to the sidelines to await political clarity. Why Does the Shutdown Freeze Crypto Regulations and Economic Data? A prolonged shutdown halts the “administrative machinery” of the U.S. government, which has a direct downstream effect on crypto regulation and economic forecasting. SEC & CFTC Freeze: Both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have transitioned to “emergency-only” staffing. This effectively pauses the review of at least 16 spot crypto ETF applications —including highly anticipated filings for Solana and Litecoin —and halts the issuance of new “no-action” letters. Legislative Delays: The Digital Asset Market Structure Bill (also known as the CLARITY Act ), which was poised for a breakthrough in Q1 2026 , is now stalled. Congressional focus has pivoted entirely to resolving the budget deadlock, delaying vital industry legislation. The “Data Vacuum”: The suspension of federal agencies means the release of critical economic reports—such as CPI inflation data and Non-Farm Payrolls —will be delayed. Without these macro signals, crypto traders lack the guidance needed to predict Federal Reserve interest rate moves, leading to “choppy” and unpredictable price action. Frequently Asked Questions Will the government shutdown crash Bitcoin prices further? While short-term volatility is high, the impact depends on the duration of the shutdown. Currently, the market is pricing in “Extreme Fear,” pushing Bitcoin down to the $81,000 range. However, if the shutdown resolves quickly—with a House vote expected as early as February 2, 2026 —prices may stabilize. Conversely, a long-term stalemate could test the thesis of Bitcoin as a “non-correlated” asset. How does the shutdown affect pending Crypto ETF approvals? The shutdown effectively pauses the approval clock. With the SEC operating with minimal staff, the review process for new products, including Solana and Litecoin ETFs , is halted. No new approvals or regulatory guidance will be issued until full government funding is restored and agencies return to normal capacity. Is Bitcoin considered a safe haven during a government shutdown? Historically, this is debated. While some investors view Bitcoin as “Digital Gold” that should rise when the fiat system looks dysfunctional, the current market reaction shows a correlation with risk assets. In the immediate term, liquidity concerns are driving investors toward cash and physical gold rather than crypto, though this could shift if the shutdown extends for weeks. Conclusion The January 2026 government shutdown serves as a significant stress test for the mature crypto market. With over $1.68 billion in liquidations and a freeze on SEC regulatory progress, the event highlights the sector’s continued sensitivity to U.S. fiscal dysfunction. Traders should remain cautious of the “data vacuum” and monitor the upcoming House vote on February 2 , as the restoration of government operations is the primary catalyst needed to bring stability back to digital asset prices and resume the industry’s legislative momentum.

What begins as profit-taking quickly turns into a full-scale market rout, sending gold, silver, platinum, and palladium sharply into the red. Investors who once rush into metals as a safe haven now scramble for exits, as prices collapse at a speed rarely seen before. Market analysts describe the move as historic, not just for its size, but for how quickly confidence unravels across the sector. Gold Suffers Its Biggest Single-Day Collapse Ever Gold, long viewed as the ultimate store of value, now leads the meltdown. In a shocking reversal, spot gold plunges from a recent peak of $5,600 to just $4,682 per ounce within 24 to 48 hours, marking the largest single-day drop in gold’s history. The decline erases nearly $5 trillion in market value, sending shockwaves across global trading desks. Traders point to a sudden shift in risk appetite combined with heavy profit-booking after months of relentless gains. Many institutional players who ride gold’s historic rally now lock in profits aggressively, triggering cascading sell orders. Market observers highlight how quickly sentiment flips, with bullish momentum evaporating almost overnight. What once looks like a breakout now becomes a brutal correction. THE LARGEST CRASH IN DECADES. Over $7 TRILLION has been erased from the precious metals in just 36 hours. Silver is down 30% and has dropped below $85, wiping out $1.96 trillion. Gold is down 13.6% and has dropped below $4,900, wiping out $5 trillion. Platinum is down 27.25%… pic.twitter.com/qMcrCPp8gq — Bull Theory (@BullTheoryio) January 30, 2026 Silver Sees Historic Intraday Crash Yet Closes The Month Green While gold dominates headlines, silver delivers some of the wildest price action traders have ever witnessed. During intraday trading, silver plunges as much as 35%, marking its largest intraday drawdown in history. Prices briefly fall below $70 per ounce, wiping out approximately $1.96 trillion in market value. In another stunning statistic, spot silver records its biggest daily decline in 46 years, briefly slipping under $75 per ounce before stabilizing. Yet despite the chaos, silver pulls off a remarkable twist. By month’s end, silver still closes in the green, up 19%, extending its rally to nine straight months of gains, an extraordinary run rarely seen in commodity markets. The contrast highlights just how extreme volatility has become: a historic crash occurring inside a broader bullish trend. This is absolutely insane: Silver fell as much as -35% during intraday trade today, it's largest intraday drawdown in history. Yet, silver prices still closed the month GREEN, rising +19%. This means silver has now risen for 9-STRAIGHT months. History is an understatement. pic.twitter.com/0rNi2GK6ru — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) January 30, 2026 Platinum And Palladium Join The Bloodbath The sell-off does not stop with gold and silver. Platinum prices collapse by 27.25%, falling below $2,100 per ounce and erasing roughly $215 billion in value. Meanwhile, palladium plunges 21.5%, dropping under $1,700 per ounce and wiping out another $85 billion. Both metals had enjoyed strong speculative inflows in recent months as investors bet on industrial demand and supply shortages. But as broader markets turn risk-off, traders dump positions across the entire metals complex. Analysts describe the move as a synchronized liquidation event, when margin calls, algorithmic trading, and fear accelerate selling far beyond normal corrections. Once momentum turns negative, bids vanish rapidly. Kevin Warsh Fed News Sparks Shift In Market Sentiment One of the major catalysts behind the sudden crash comes from Washington. News breaks that Kevin Warsh, widely viewed as pro-Bitcoin and market-friendly, becomes the new Federal Reserve Chair, triggering a massive shift in investor positioning. Markets interpret the move as a potential pivot toward looser monetary conditions, innovation-friendly policies, and alternative assets gaining favor over traditional safe havens like gold. As expectations shift, capital begins flowing out of precious metals and toward risk assets, especially crypto and equities. At the same time, months of accumulated profits in metals create the perfect environment for a sharp correction. Heavy selling meets thin liquidity, and prices cascade lower. GOLD CRASH: THE BIGGEST EXPLOSION IN 40 YEARS! Gold has seen the biggest single-day drop in history over the last 24-48 hours, where spot gold crashed from a peak of $5,600 to $4,682/oz.

Veteran traders compare the event to major financial crashes, noting how quickly leverage unwinds when confidence breaks. The speed of the decline underscores how modern markets, driven by high-frequency trading and massive institutional flows, can move far faster than in previous decades. What This Means For Investors Going Forward Despite the devastation, analysts urge caution against panic selling. Historically, massive liquidation events often mark turning points rather than long-term collapses. Strong long-term fundamentals, inflation hedging, central bank demand, and industrial usage, still support precious metals over time. Silver’s ability to finish the month higher despite a historic crash already signals underlying strength. However, volatility is likely to remain extreme in the near term. Markets now react not just to economic data, but to political shifts, sentiment swings, and algorithm-driven flows at unprecedented speed. For investors, the message is clear: precious metals are no longer the slow-moving safe havens of the past, they now trade with the intensity of high-risk assets. Bottom line: The precious metals market has just experienced its most violent crash in decades. Over $7 trillion vanishes in less than two days. Gold records its worst drop in history. Silver sees its biggest intraday collapse ever, yet still closes the month higher. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

57609944,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=267368,1769846111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,US Treasury Sanctions Crypto Exchanges in Unprecedented Crackdown on Iran’s Digital Finance Network,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-treasury-sanctions-iran-crypto-exchanges/,"BitcoinWorld US Treasury Sanctions Crypto Exchanges in Unprecedented Crackdown on Iran’s Digital Finance Network WASHINGTON, D.C. – In a landmark enforcement action, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has imposed sanctions on two cryptocurrency exchanges, directly targeting Iran’s ability to utilize digital assets for finance. Consequently, this historic move against UK-registered platforms Zedcex and Zedxion signals a major escalation in the global regulatory scrutiny of crypto. Specifically, authorities allege these exchanges facilitated financial transactions for Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). US Treasury Sanctions Crypto Exchanges in Historic First The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced the sanctions on March 15, 2025. This action represents the first time OFAC has formally sanctioned cryptocurrency exchanges specifically for connections to Iran. Previously, the agency targeted individual wallets or mixing services. Therefore, this shift indicates a strategic focus on the infrastructure enabling illicit finance. OFAC’s investigation alleges that Zedcex and Zedxion processed millions of dollars in digital currency. These funds allegedly originated from ransomware attacks and other illicit schemes. Subsequently, the exchanges converted these funds into traditional currency. The Treasury Department provided detailed evidence in its public listing. For instance, blockchain analysis reportedly shows clear transaction patterns linking the exchanges to known IRGC-Quds Force wallets. The sanctions immediately block all property and interests belonging to the exchanges within U.S. jurisdiction. Furthermore, they prohibit any U.S. persons from conducting transactions with them. This creates significant compliance challenges for global crypto businesses. Understanding the Sanctioned Cryptocurrency Exchanges Zedcex and Zedxion operated as centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. They were both registered in the United Kingdom but maintained minimal physical presence. Their services included spot trading, over-the-counter (OTC) desks, and wallet services. Public records and web archives show they marketed themselves as privacy-focused platforms. However, compliance experts note their know-your-customer (KYC) procedures appeared deliberately weak. A comparative analysis of the two entities reveals operational similarities: Exchange Reported Launch Date Primary Services Alleged Primary Fiat On-Ramp Zedcex 2022 Spot Trading, OTC Desk UAE Dirham (AED) Zedxion 2023 Derivatives, Custody Turkish Lira (TRY) Investigators state the exchanges used complex layering techniques. These techniques involved swapping between multiple cryptocurrencies across different blockchains. Ultimately, the goal was to obscure the original source of funds before conversion to fiat currency. The Broader Context of Iran and Cryptocurrency Iran has increasingly turned to cryptocurrency to circumvent traditional financial sanctions. The country formally legalized crypto mining in 2019, albeit with strict licensing. However, analysts note a significant portion of mining activity operates unofficially. This activity generates digital assets that can be sold internationally. The Iranian government has also explored launching a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The IRGC, a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO), has been particularly adept at exploiting financial loopholes. Its cyber wing is known for sophisticated ransomware operations. Cryptocurrency provides an ideal settlement layer for these activities. The 2025 Treasury action directly responds to this evolving threat. It follows years of monitoring and several unpublicized warnings to the crypto industry. Immediate and Long-Term Impacts of the Sanctions The immediate impact froze the exchanges’ access to the U.S. financial system. Major global cryptocurrency liquidity providers and custodians quickly severed ties. This caused a liquidity crisis for the platforms. Users reported an inability to withdraw funds within hours of the announcement. The ripple effects extended to other exchanges that had facilitated transfers to Zedcex or Zedxion. Long-term consequences are potentially more significant for the entire crypto sector: Enhanced Compliance Scrutiny: Exchanges worldwide will face pressure to strengthen due diligence on customers and transactions linked to high-risk jurisdictions. De-banking Risk: Traditional banks may further restrict services to crypto businesses perceived as having weak compliance frameworks. Regulatory Momentum: This case provides a powerful precedent for other nations to take similar action against crypto entities facilitating sanctions evasion. Market Volatility: The news triggered brief sell-offs in privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, though major assets like Bitcoin showed resilience. Legal experts emphasize that the sanctions create secondary liability. Any entity, anywhere, that continues to do business with Zedcex or Zedxion risks being cut off from the U.S. dollar system. The Legal and Regulatory Framework Behind the Action OFAC acted under authority granted by several executive orders and statutes. Primarily, these include Executive Order 13224, which targets terrorist financing, and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The legal threshold for designation requires “reasonable cause” to believe an entity is materially assisting a sanctioned party. The Treasury’s published evidence aims to meet this standard. The action aligns with the 2023 National Risk Assessments on Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing. Those reports explicitly highlighted the growing misuse of convertible virtual currency (CVC) by state actors. Furthermore, it follows increased collaboration between OFAC and blockchain analytics firms like Chainalysis and Elliptic. These firms provide the forensic tools to trace illicit flows across public ledgers. This enforcement is not an isolated event. It is part of a coordinated strategy with the Department of Justice and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). In recent months, these agencies have issued joint advisories to virtual asset service providers (VASPs). The advisories specifically warn about typologies related to Iranian sanctions evasion. Expert Analysis on Enforcement Strategy “This is a watershed moment,” stated Dr. Elena Vargas, a former OFAC official and current fellow at the Center for a New American Security. “By sanctioning the exchanges themselves, rather than just wallets, Treasury is attacking the choke point. It’s a more efficient enforcement strategy that forces the entire ecosystem to comply. Exchanges are the on- and off-ramps; without them, crypto is much harder to monetize.” Industry compliance officers note the action sets a clear expectation. “The message is unambiguous,” said Michael Chen, Chief Compliance Officer at a major U.S. exchange. “Geographic-agnosticism is no longer viable. Every VASP must now implement robust geographic blocking and conduct enhanced due diligence on transactions touching jurisdictions under comprehensive sanctions, like Iran, North Korea, and Syria.” Conclusion The U.S. Treasury sanctions against cryptocurrency exchanges Zedcex and Zedxion mark a pivotal evolution in digital asset regulation. This unprecedented action directly links crypto platforms to Iranian sanctions evasion, demonstrating a sophisticated and determined enforcement approach. Consequently, the global cryptocurrency industry must now navigate heightened compliance demands and increased scrutiny of cross-border transactions. Ultimately, this case establishes a powerful precedent, signaling that crypto’s borderless nature will not shield bad actors from the reach of international financial law. FAQs Q1: What does it mean for a cryptocurrency exchange to be sanctioned by OFAC? Sanctioning by OFAC means the exchange and its property are blocked within U.S. jurisdiction. U.S. persons are prohibited from transacting with it. Non-U.S. entities that engage with it risk secondary sanctions, potentially losing access to the U.S. financial system. Q2: Can users of Zedcex or Zedxion recover their funds? Recovery is highly unlikely for U.S. users and complicated for international users. The sanctions freeze the exchanges’ assets. Any attempt to withdraw may violate sanctions law. Users should consult legal counsel but should not expect to access funds held on the platforms. Q3: How does this affect other cryptocurrency exchanges? Other exchanges will conduct urgent reviews of any past transactions with Zedcex or Zedxion. They will also enhance screening for customers and transactions connected to sanctioned jurisdictions. Compliance costs across the industry are expected to rise significantly. Q4: Why is this the first time OFAC has sanctioned crypto exchanges over Iran? Previous actions targeted specific wallets or mixing services. This action reflects growing confidence in blockchain forensic tools to prove a direct “material support” link between an exchange’s core operations and a sanctioned entity like the IRGC. Q5: What should cryptocurrency investors do in response to this news? Investors should ensure they use reputable, fully compliant exchanges with strong KYC/AML programs. They should be aware of increased regulatory risk in the sector. This event underscores the importance of regulatory compliance for the long-term health of the crypto ecosystem.

Key Takeaways: JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon confronted Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong at Davos over claims banks are undermining a US crypto bill. The clash centers on stablecoin rewards, with banks opposing yield while crypto firms argue bans favor traditional finance. The market structure bill has stalled in the Senate amid growing political and industry resistance. According to a report from The Wall Street Journal , the exchange took place during a coffee meeting between Armstrong and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair. Dimon reportedly interrupted the discussion and told Armstrong he was “full of s—,” objecting to public comments in which the Coinbase CEO suggested banks were working behind the scenes to undermine the legislation. Stablecoin Rewards Spark Clash Between Banks and Crypto Firms The dispute centers on provisions related to stablecoins, particularly whether issuers should be allowed to offer yield or rewards. Banking industry representatives have opposed such measures, arguing they could blur the line between banks and non-bank financial firms. Crypto executives, including Armstrong, have countered that banning stablecoin rewards would tilt the playing field in favor of traditional banks and restrict competition. The Journal reported that Armstrong’s stance has left him increasingly isolated among banking leaders. Brian Moynihan, chief executive of Bank of America, allegedly told Armstrong that if Coinbase wants to operate like a bank, it should become one.

The clash comes as the US market structure bill faces mounting political and industry resistance. The legislation passed the House of Representatives in July but has stalled in the Senate, where Democratic lawmakers have raised concerns over ethics rules and the bill’s broader impact on the financial system. Lobbyists from both the banking and crypto sectors have also warned that certain provisions could reshape competitive dynamics in unintended ways. Coinbase Plays Down Bank Rift as Crypto Bill Stalls in Senate Coinbase has sought to downplay the rift. Chief policy officer Faryar Shirzad told the Journal that the disagreement over stablecoin rewards is an outlier in what he described as an otherwise cooperative relationship with banks, pointing to existing partnerships between the exchange and traditional financial institutions. A Coinbase spokesperson later said the company had nothing further to add beyond those comments. Meanwhile, progress on the bill remains uneven. The Senate Banking Committee indefinitely postponed a planned markup after Armstrong said Coinbase could not support the legislation in its current form. In contrast, the Senate Agriculture Committee advanced its own version along party lines , setting the stage for negotiations to merge the two proposals before any full Senate vote.

57610038,660389,1769846400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57610038.jpeg,"Pundit Explains Why Ripple’s RLUSD Isn’t Like Other Stablecoins, What’s The Difference?",https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-rlusd-other-stablecoins/,"Ripple’s RLUSD stands out from most stablecoins by the way it is designed to operate inside financial markets. Rather than focusing on broad retail usage, its structure and early integrations point toward a role anchored in trading infrastructure, collateral frameworks, and regulated settlement flows. That distinction becomes clearer through recent updates shared on X by Ripple executive Jack McDonald and further expanded on by market commentator Richard, who examined how RLUSD functions as a cash instrument within real market systems. Why RLUSD Stands Apart From Typical Stablecoins Many stablecoins focus on expanding circulation and boosting market capitalization, often with retail users as the primary audience. RLUSD follows a different structure. As McDonald highlighted, its priority is institutional readiness . A key part of this is monthly independent attestation, which involves third-party verification that RLUSD’s reserves fully back the supply in circulation. For institutions, this is essential. Banks, brokers, and trading firms operate under strict compliance and risk rules. Without frequent, independent verification, a stablecoin cannot be treated as usable cash on a balance sheet. Attestations allow RLUSD to be held, transferred, and settled without triggering regulatory or accounting concerns. This foundation explains why RLUSD has been accepted as core collateral on LMAX’s global trading marketplace . Collateral is what traders post to open and maintain positions. To qualify, an asset must reliably hold value throughout the trading day, move quickly between margin and settlement accounts, and remain dependable during volatile conditions. It must also support rehypothecation, meaning it can be reused across multiple transactions. RLUSD meets these standards. The same logic applies to decentralized finance. McDonald noted that real-world asset deposits on Aave increased by roughly $400 million over a recent quarter, with RLUSD driving most of that growth . In this context, RLUSD acts as the stable cash component that allows tokenized assets to function smoothly. Institutions need a unit of account that regulators accept and internal systems can recognize, and RLUSD is designed to serve that role. What RLUSD’s Velocity And Market Access Reveal RLUSD’s availability on Binance, Ethereum trading pairs, and OSL reflects a focus on broad access rather than volume chasing. The objective is to ensure RLUSD can appear wherever liquidity already exists. Upcoming XRPL support on Binance further expands that flexibility. Richard also pointed to RLUSD’s high transaction velocity, meaning the same units are moving frequently rather than sitting idle. Velocity is an early signal of real use, especially for settlement and collateral movement. Market capitalization often follows once these functions scale. This framing clarifies RLUSD’s true target. It is aimed at replacing inefficient structures such as prefunded accounts, trapped collateral, and cross-border balances. Within this model, XRP serves as the bridge asset , compliance leads strategy, and collateral acceptance comes before visibility. In essence, RLUSD’s purpose is to quietly improve how capital moves and settles across markets. That functional focus is what makes it fundamentally different.",Ripple|ripple|ripple news|RLUSD|RLUSD News|RLUSD Price|RLUSD Stablecoin|XRP|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-31 08:00:00

The Digital Asset Market CLARITY Act of 2025 (H.R. 3633) is a comprehensive piece of legislation aiming to end the era of “regulation by enforcement” in the United States. While the bill successfully passed the House of Representatives in July 2025 with a promise to categorize digital assets clearly, it has hit a significant roadblock in the Senate as of January 2026 . Intense debates over new amendments—ranging from stablecoin yield bans to stricter DeFi oversight—have caused major industry players like Coinbase to withdraw their support, leaving the bill’s future in limbo. What Was Proposed in the Original House Version? The initial version of the Act was celebrated by the industry for creating a clear regulatory framework that split oversight duties between the SEC and CFTC using a “three-bucket” classification system. Digital Commodities (CFTC): Assets tied to decentralized blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum , would fall under the “exclusive jurisdiction” of the CFTC , which would regulate their spot markets. Investment Contract Assets (SEC): Tokens sold during fundraising (ICOs) would initially be treated as securities. Crucially, the law clarified that the token itself is not a security during secondary market trades, solving a major pain point for exchanges. Permitted Payment Stablecoins: Fiat-pegged assets used for payments were carved out of securities laws and placed under banking regulators. Maturity Certification: The bill introduced a pathway for issuers to certify to the SEC that their blockchain had become “mature” (sufficiently decentralized), allowing the asset to graduate from SEC to CFTC oversight. Why Did the Bill Stall in the Senate in January 2026? As the bill moved to the Senate Banking Committee in late 2025, several controversial “deal-breaker” provisions were added. These changes led to a breakdown in consensus and the postponement of the Senate markup in mid-January 2026 . Stablecoin Yield & Reward Bans: The Senate draft prohibits stablecoin issuers from paying interest or yield to holders. Industry leaders argue this provision is anti-competitive, designed to protect traditional bank deposit models from crypto innovation. Tokenized Equity Restrictions: Reports indicate a de facto ban on tokenized equities (stocks on the blockchain), stifling a major growth area for crypto-financial firms. Expanded DeFi Oversight: New language broadens the definition of “DeFi intermediaries,” potentially forcing software developers and code providers to register as brokers, a requirement many view as technically impossible. Regulatory Power Shift: Critics argue the amendments tilt power back toward the SEC , particularly in how “ancillary assets” are defined, undoing the balance achieved in the House version. Staking Restrictions: Unlike earlier drafts, the Senate version imposes strict “opt-in” requirements for staking services, limiting how exchanges can offer passive income products to users. Current Status: Stalled Negotiations vs. The GENIUS Act As of late January 2026 , the CLARITY Act is effectively stalled. The Senate markup has been postponed to allow for urgent negotiations between the White House , banking lobbyists, and crypto firms. This delay stands in stark contrast to the recently signed GENIUS Act , which successfully passed into law to regulate stablecoins separately, leaving the broader market structure issues of the CLARITY Act unresolved. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Coinbase withdraw support for the CLARITY Act in 2026? Coinbase withdrew its support on January 15, 2026 , due to the “deal-breaker” amendments added in the Senate version. The exchange specifically cited the new restrictions on DeFi , the ban on tokenized equities , and the shift of power back to the SEC as reasons why the bill no longer served the industry’s goal of fostering innovation. What is the difference between the CLARITY Act and the GENIUS Act? The CLARITY Act is a broad market structure bill attempting to define the roles of the SEC and CFTC for all digital assets. In contrast, the GENIUS Act is a specific piece of legislation that was recently signed into law, focusing exclusively on the regulation and issuance of stablecoins , separating them from the broader securities/commodities debate. How does the CLARITY Act determine if a crypto is a security or commodity? The Act uses a “Maturity Certification” process. Initially, assets raised via ICOs are treated as Investment Contract Assets (securities). However, once a network proves it is “mature” and decentralized—meaning no single entity controls it—the asset transitions to being a Digital Commodity under CFTC oversight. Conclusion The fate of the Digital Asset Market CLARITY Act of 2025 hangs in the balance as 2026 begins. What started as a bipartisan effort to provide legal certainty has transformed into a battleground over the future of DeFi and stablecoin yields . With the GENIUS Act already law, the pressure is now on Congress to resolve the broader market structure debate. Investors and developers are watching closely, knowing that the final version of this bill will determine whether the U.S. remains a hub for crypto innovation or drives the industry offshore through restrictive oversight.

This decisive action followed Yakovenko’s public sharing of a post that placed blame on Binance for a significant market downturn. The incident, first reported by PA News, provides a stark window into the complex interpersonal and competitive dynamics shaping the digital asset industry. Furthermore, it underscores how social media interactions between industry titans can signal deeper market sentiments and rivalries. Changpeng Zhao Takes Action on X The catalyst for this digital severance was a specific post shared by Anatoly Yakovenko. On October 10, 2025, the cryptocurrency market experienced a sharp, rapid decline—a phenomenon traders describe as a flash crash. Subsequently, OKX founder Xu Mingxing published an analysis on X attributing primary responsibility for the crash to trading activities and liquidity issues related to Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume. Yakovenko’s decision to share Xu’s critical post placed him publicly in alignment with its contentious viewpoint. Consequently, CZ’s response was swift and unambiguous: he removed Yakovenko from his list of followed accounts. This sequence of events highlights the immediate and visible consequences of public criticism in the tightly-knit crypto leadership circle. Anatomy of the October 2025 Flash Crash To understand the context, one must examine the market conditions preceding the social media fallout. The flash crash on October 10, 2025, saw the aggregate market capitalization of digital assets drop by approximately 12% within a 90-minute window. Major assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) led the decline. However, Solana (SOL) and several other altcoins experienced even steeper losses. Market data from that period shows a cascade of liquidations on leveraged derivative products. Notably, these liquidations exceeded $800 million across major exchanges. Analysts from firms like CoinMetrics and CryptoQuant later identified a large sell order on a BTC perpetual futures pair as a potential trigger. While the order originated on an undisclosed platform, its effects propagated instantly across all connected liquidity pools. Key Metric Data Point (Oct 10, 2025) Total Market Cap Drop ~12% Duration of Core Decline 90 minutes Total Liquidations $800M+ Bitcoin Price Decline ~9.5% Solana Price Decline ~15.2% Industry experts quickly debated the root cause. Some pointed to macroeconomic pressures, while others, like Xu Mingxing, focused on exchange-specific order book dynamics. This divergence in analysis set the stage for the ensuing public disagreement. Expert Analysis of Exchange Dynamics Market structure specialists emphasize that no single entity typically causes a broad flash crash. Dr. Laila Chen, a former CFTC analyst and current head of research at Blockchain Transparency Institute, explains the mechanics. “High-frequency trading bots and cross-exchange arbitrage algorithms create a deeply interconnected system,” Chen states. “A large sell order on any major venue can create a temporary liquidity vacuum. Subsequently, automated systems amplify the move as they race to hedge positions. Therefore, attributing blame to one exchange often oversimplifies a complex electronic event.” This expert perspective suggests that while Binance’s vast liquidity pool is a central market node, it operates within a global network of automated traders. The History of CZ and Anatoly Yakovenko’s Relationship The unfollowing event gains deeper significance when viewed against the historical relationship between the two founders. Previously, CZ and Yakovenko maintained a publicly cordial and mutually supportive professional relationship. For instance, Binance was an early supporter of the Solana ecosystem, listing SOL token in 2020 and featuring it in various initiatives. Moreover, both leaders have participated in joint interviews and panels, discussing blockchain scalability and adoption. Their interaction symbolized a degree of collaboration between the centralized exchange (CEX) and decentralized platform (Solana) sectors. However, underlying tensions have existed for years, primarily revolving around market share, technological philosophy, and regulatory positioning. The flash crash and the shared criticism acted as a catalyst, bringing these subdued tensions to the surface in a very public manner. 2019-2021: Period of collaboration; Binance lists SOL and promotes its ecosystem. 2022: Solana’s network outages draw quiet criticism from exchange executives about reliability. 2024: Binance launches its own dedicated blockchain, BNB Chain, becoming a more direct competitor in the smart contract platform space. 2025: Regulatory pressures increase, forcing exchanges and protocols to sometimes adopt opposing lobbying stances. Implications for the Cryptocurrency Industry This incident extends beyond personal drama. It reflects several critical trends within the digital asset industry as of late 2025. First, it demonstrates the immense power of social media as a real-time communication and signaling channel for industry leaders. A simple ‘unfollow’ can generate more headlines and analysis than a formal press release. Second, it highlights the fragile nature of alliances in a hyper-competitive and fast-evolving market. Partnerships formed during bull markets can strain under the pressure of market downturns and blame attribution. Finally, the event underscores the ongoing centralization of discourse. A small group of founders and CEOs wield significant influence over market narratives, especially during periods of volatility. Their public disagreements can therefore exacerbate uncertainty among retail investors and traders. The Role of X in Crypto Governance Platforms like X have evolved into de facto boardrooms for the crypto industry. Policy announcements, technical debates, and corporate disagreements frequently play out in the open. This transparency has benefits, such as community engagement. However, it also carries risks of misinterpretation and escalation. The CZ-Yakovenko incident is a prime example of a nuanced professional disagreement being amplified into a public spectacle. Consequently, it may encourage other leaders to handle sensitive discussions through more private channels in the future. Conclusion The decision by Changpeng Zhao to unfollow Anatoly Yakovenko on X is a multifaceted event rooted in a specific market crisis. It connects the technical reality of a cryptocurrency flash crash to the human dynamics of industry leadership. While ostensibly a minor social media action, it symbolizes shifting alliances and heightened tensions within the competitive digital asset landscape. The episode serves as a reminder that in the world of cryptocurrency, market movements and personal networks are deeply intertwined. As the industry matures, the communication strategies of its most prominent figures will continue to be a critical area for observation and analysis. FAQs Q1: What specifically did Anatoly Yakovenko share that caused CZ to unfollow him? Anatoly Yakovenko shared a post by OKX founder Xu Mingxing that attributed primary responsibility for the October 10, 2025, cryptocurrency flash crash to Binance’s trading activities and liquidity management. Q2: Was Binance definitively the cause of the October 2025 flash crash? Market analysts state that flash crashes are complex events rarely caused by a single entity. While a large sell order may have triggered the downturn, automated trading systems across the global network of exchanges likely amplified the move. Direct, sole attribution to Binance is contested by many experts. Q3: Have Binance and Solana worked together in the past? Yes, historically, Binance and Solana had a collaborative relationship. Binance listed the SOL token early and supported its ecosystem development. However, the launch of Binance’s own BNB Chain and increasing market competition have changed the dynamic over time. Q4: Does an ‘unfollow’ on X have any real business impact? While not a formal business action, it serves as a powerful public signal within the industry. It can influence community perception, indicate cooling relations between organizations, and affect market sentiment regarding the involved projects. Q5: How common are public disagreements like this among crypto founders? Public disagreements and debates are relatively common, given the industry’s culture of open discourse on social media. However, a direct and personal action like a public unfollow following criticism from a former ally is a notable and less frequent escalation.

Fintech giant Revolut launched full banking operations in Mexico. In Venezuela, Interpol carried out a major crackdown on a cross-border cryptocurrency scam linked to Generation Zoe. Meanwhile, El Salvador strengthened its Bitcoin strategy by introducing new tax incentives for foreign investors. El Salvador doubles down on its Bitcoin bet By eliminating capital gains taxes on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, El Salvador is reinforcing its position as a Bitcoin-friendly country. Aimed at attracting foreign investment and digital asset innovation, the legislation targets overseas investors and offers tax incentives to foreigners who bring more than three Bitcoins into the country. The move builds on Bitcoin’s adoption as legal tender in 2021 and reinforces President Nayib Bukele’s long-term cryptocurrency strategy. The government is repositioning El Salvador as a global hub for cryptocurrency investment through bold fiscal incentives, even as domestic use of cryptocurrency for remittances has declined. Interpol arrest in Venezuela signals a major break in the Generation Zoe crypto scam Rosa María González Rincón, a key figure in the international cryptocurrency pyramid fraud known as Generación Zoe, was apprehended by Interpol agents in San Cristóbal, Tõira. The arrest, enabled by international cooperation and intelligence efforts, marks a significant development in one of the largest cryptocurrency fraud cases in Latin America. The scheme used bots and fake trading tools to promise unrealistic returns. A central operational link in the network, González Rincón was promoted as an expert in cryptocurrency trading and logistics within the fraudulent operation, which targeted thousands of investors in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Spain, Mexico, and other countries, with estimated losses ranging from $100 million to $300 million. Her detention follows earlier convictions in Argentina, including a 12-year prison sentence for founder Leonardo Cositorto on charges of fraud and illegal association. Revolut launches full banking operations in Mexico Revolut, a UK-founded fintech company, has completed its testing phase and opened its first bank outside Europe by formally launching full banking operations in Mexico. With a population of 130 million and an expensive, bureaucratic legacy banking system, Mexico offers an ideal environment for Revolut’s fully digital business model, which focuses on low costs and app-based services. By entering the market with a full banking licence, more than $100 million in capital, and notably strong capital ratios, Revolut signalled stability in a fintech-wary environment.

Notably, it all started in September of last year, when Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company accused OpenAI of stealing trade secrets with the assistance of workers it hired away. The xAI lawsuit alleged that three former employees, two engineers and a senior executive, disclosed source code and other company secrets after joining OpenAI. It also claimed that there was a “strategic campaign” to undermine xAI. In response, OpenAI accused Musk of running a “campaign to harass a competitor with unfounded legal claims” because xAI was unable to keep up with ChatGPT. Despite claims that several former xAI workers grabbed source code before departing, Lin stated in a four-page filing summarizing her opinions that Musk’s business did not convincingly assert that OpenAI acquired or facilitated the theft of trade secrets. Judge Lin signals potential dismissal of xAI lawsuit U.S. District Judge stated that her “tentative view” is to allow OpenAI’s move to dismiss xAI’s complaint after hearing oral arguments on February 3. Additionally, she hinted that if she rejected xAI’s case, it could change its allegations. Lin also stated that it was implausible to conclude from xAI’s lawsuit that either OpenAI utilized xAI’s trade secrets or that former xAI workers exploited them while working for OpenAI. The judge may also dismiss an unfair competition claim because xAI’s claims of poaching “all focus on poaching in service of acquiring xAI’s trade secrets and do not identify any other reason why the hiring of those employees was anticompetitive.” Against this backdrop, Lin requested that OpenAI and xAI respond to her provisional reasoning during the hearing. Musk sues OpenAI over for-profit conversion, $134 billion The ruling comes amid a larger legal dispute between Musk and OpenAI, which he co-founded. In a separate lawsuit, Elon Musk sued OpenAI CEO Sam Altman for turning ChatGPT into a for-profit business. On January 7, a U.S. district judge, Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, in Oakland, California, ruled that the lawsuit against OpenAI will go to trial starting on April 27. The judge stated during the hearing that there was ample evidence indicating that OpenAI’s executives had promised to uphold the company’s initial nonprofit framework. She said that there were enough contested facts to allow a jury to weigh the claims rather than make the final decision at a trial in March. Following the hearing, Rogers promised to issue a written order addressing OpenAI’s bid to have the lawsuit dismissed. The legal battle is part of a larger struggle for market domination in generative AI. OpenAI and other tech companies are competing with Musk’s xAI and its chatbot, Grok. A Cryptopolitan report found that Musk demanded approximately $134.5 billion in compensation for what he called OpenAI’s “ill-gotten gains.” In a statement after the hearing, OpenAI said: “Mr Musk’s lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial.” However, Steven Molo, the lead trial lawyer representing Musk and xAI, said after the hearing that they were eager to show the jury proof of what he called the defendants’ misconduct. Musk claimed he gave approximately $38 million (£28 million), or roughly 60% of the company’s initial investment, along with strategic direction and credibility, in exchange for promises that OpenAI would remain a nonprofit organization devoted to the public good. However, Musk went on to claim that OpenAI co-founders Altman and Greg Brockman breached that objective by restructuring the company, establishing for-profit affiliates, and striking multibillion-dollar transactions. Following Musk’s claims, OpenAI, Altman, and Brockman refuted the claims and characterized Musk as “a frustrated commercial competitor seeking to slow down a mission-driven market leader.” Microsoft, another defendant, asked Rogers to dismiss Musk’s lawsuit. There was no proof, according to a Microsoft attorney, that the corporation “aided and abetted” OpenAI. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

This New Crypto Protocol Surges 300% and Raises More Than $20M,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/from-0-01-to-1-this-new-crypto-protocol-surges-300-and-raises-more-than-20m/,"The DeFi market moves in cycles. Early on, narratives are often driven by hype, but sustainable growth only begins once a project crosses the invisible line between concept and a working product. Historically, the largest price expansions have followed the completion of core infrastructure. Top cryptocurrency value is not built on promises, but on whether a system is fully operational and capable of handling real transactions. One new crypto protocol has now reached this critical stage. Its foundational layer is complete, and participation is growing rapidly. This is the moment when technical readiness begins to translate into market recognition. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Has already in Place One project that has taken the past year to simply concentrate on this build-out is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . It is a new cheap crypto that is developing a lending and borrowing protocol. The team has been able to come up with a dual lending model to support various categories of users. The former is a Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system. This involves the utilization of common liquidity pools to give immediate loans and yield. The second one is a Peer-to-peer (P2P) market. This enables the users to negotiate custom loan terms on more niche assets. These two markets make the platform able to scale. It offers an adjustable platform of both stable assets and riskier tokens on a single interface. Progress in the Participation The development of this infrastructure can be easily traced in the metrics of the project. As of late January 2026, officially, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has current funding of more than $20.1 million. On the other hand the growth in the community has broken through 19,900 individual holders. These figures have been on the upwards trend as the team met their technical milestones. Investors have been in support of a protocol that has passed through its major development stages. Another area where infrastructure readiness is important is in the token supply. The total supply of Mutuum Finance is 4 billion tokens. In the ongoing presale, 45.5% (1.82 billion tokens) was distributed. It is reported that it has sold more than 840 million tokens. This translates to close to half the supply that was available in the early supply being lost. In crypto, supply tends to decline when the infrastructure is just about to be accessible to the general population. In the approach towards the launching of the protocol, the number of tokens that are being claimed is increasing compared to the earlier stages. This is a supply-and-demand dynamic that gives advantages to the people who were able to realize the technical progress of the project early. The Last Layer of Infrastructure Security The last box that should be marked is security, and institutional-grade users are permitted to enter a protocol. Mutuum Finance has not been an exception as security has been a core building block and not an afterthought. This project has gone through the full independent audit conducted by Halborn Security . The safety of the lending logic and liquidation triggers was confirmed in this review. Moreover, the project has a high 90/100 score by CertiK and has an active $50,000 bug bounty. Such protection layers assure resilience of the code against attacks. To the hardcore operators, such a security framework is the best indication that the infrastructure is prepared to receive real-world capital. The Reason Why Attention is Catching Up Now It is now transition time as the V1 protocol is currently operational on the Sepolia testnet. The users are now able to interact with the mtToken mechanism and the automated loaning tools. This functional milestone marks the shift from a technical concept to a live environment where investors can verify the core logic of the lending engine. To ensure the entire system remains solvent and secure, Mutuum Finance utilizes an over-collateralization model governed by two primary risk metrics: the Stability Factor and the Health Factor. The Stability Factor defines the safe thresholds and asset-specific parameters, such as the maximum Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, for each collateral type. The Health Factor acts as a real-time indicator of a loan’s safety by measuring the ratio between the weighted value of your collateral and the value of your borrowed debt. A Health Factor above 1.0 indicates a secure position, but if market volatility causes the collateral value to drop and the factor dips below 1.0, an automated Liquidator Bot steps in to manage the debt and protect the protocol’s liquidity. This real-time testing stage is attracting huge interest into the project. To maintain the energy level, the platform has a live leaderboard which is a bonus of $500 offered to the best participants of the day. It also has the option of direct card payments, which makes it easy for anybody to easily enter the final stages. Having completed the technical base and accelerated Phase 7 price of $0.04, the market starts to understand that Mutuum is no longer a new crypto. It is a working DeFi infrastructure that is all set to launch at $0.06 and even more.

This move confirms the circulating rumors after the former Fed governor reportedly met with Trump at the White House on Thursday, January 29. Trump Pushes Warsh To Senate For Fed Chair Position On Friday, January 30, Trump, via his social media platform Truth Social, announced his nomination of ex-Fed official Kevin Warsh as the successor of Jerome Powell as the Federal Reserve chairman. Prior to this announcement, prediction platforms had heavily tipped Warsh as Trump’s likely pick. Related Reading: Why Litecoin Price Going To $2,000 Is Not A Fantasy, But Market Cap Math Warsh previously served on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors from 2006 to 2011 and held senior roles at the White House National Economic Council during former President George Bush’s administration. The former Morgan Stanley banker was considered for the Fed chair job in 2017 before Powell was eventually appointed. Trump said in his announcement: I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best. On top of everything else, he is “central casting,” and he will never let you down. Congratulations Kevin! Warsh has been a vocal critic of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy long before Powell became chair. Unsurprisingly, his recent stance appears to align with Trump’s agenda of lowering interest rates. In fact, the former Wall Street executive said in an interview last July that President Trump was right to push the Fed to cut rates. Trump’s nomination of Warsh as the Fed chair still needs to be confirmed by the US Senate, with many commentators expecting a battle between the executive and legislative arms. While Trump seeks a Fed chair that listens to the White House, a homage that Powell has refused to pay, the Senate believes the Federal Reserve should function independently. What Does Warsh’s Selection Mean For Crypto? Warsh and Powell seem to be on opposite sides of the divide when it comes to the cryptocurrency industry and Bitcoin. While the current Federal Reserve chair has consistently played down BTC’s relevance in the greater US economy, Warsh has been fairly positive about the world’s largest cryptocurrency. In a recent conversation hosted by the Hoover Institution, Warsh said that Bitcoin is an important asset that doesn’t trouble him, and he doesn’t view the coin as a substitute for the dollar. “Bitcoin can help inform policymakers when they are doing things right or wrong,’ the former Morgan Stanley banker said.

The House’s delay has exposed pitfalls in the prediction markets, with uncertainty looming over specific Kalshi and Polymarket contracts. The U.S. government is on the brink of a partial shutdown on Saturday morning as the House of Representatives remains out of session until Monday morning. The House is unable to vote on a funding package intended to keep the government running, which the Senate passed on Friday evening. The House needs to pass the funding package as well to allow the government to resume operations fully. The shutdown is temporary and should not significantly affect U.S. citizens. U.S. partial government shutdown sparks activity on Polymarket and Kalshi The partial government shutdown differs significantly from previous government shutdowns. The most recent shutdown was the longest in U.S. history, stretching for 43 days, according to a previous Cryptopolitan publication . The shutdown saw federal workers go unpaid for over a month. The imminent partial shutdown prompted activity on prediction platforms Polymarket and Kalshi. The prediction sites published contracts that allowed users to bet on whether the government would shut down this weekend. The contracts had different variations, some of which traders said were confusing in how they defined a government shutdown. The traders highlighted the lack of specificity in these contracts. Source: Polymarket U.S. government shutdown Saturday? At the time of this publication, a contract “US government shutdown Saturday?” is live on Polymarket with a 99% chance. However, the rules highlighted for the contract read “This market will resolve to ‘”Yes'” if the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) announces another federal government shutdown due to a lapse in appropriations by January 31, 2026, 11:59 PM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”. The terms of this contract identify the partial shutdown as a shutdown. However, the contract relies on OPM announcing the shutdown, not on the actual shutdown happening at all. A contract on Kalshi named “Government shutdown today?” has 99% of the total votes cast in agreement. The contract’s rules state that the market will resolve to yes only if the U.S. Office of Personnel Management’s website contains a notice that the government at least partially shut down on January 31, 2026, at 11:00 AM ET due to a lapse in appropriations. Government shutdown bets on prediction platforms lack specificity While many remain confused about the two contracts, other contracts offered a more specific contract. One Polymarket contract allowed users to bet on how long the government might remain closed, offering options of 1+, 2+, or 3+ days, all with scores above 99%. However, the comment section still debated whether Monday would count as a third day if Trump signed the bill on that day. Others argue that three full days equals 72 hours, which would disqualify day 3 if Trump signs the bill before the end of the day. Another Kalshi contract reading “How many days will the federal government be shut down before March?” showed that “more than two days” has over 98% odds. The news comes after Cryptopolitan reported that prediction markets smashed a daily record, surpassing $700 million on January 12. Kalshi dominated the market, accounting for a record-breaking $466 million, or more than 66% of total trading volume on prediction markets. The report highlighted that Kalshi had its best trading month in December, processing bets valued at $6.38 billion, with the majority of those bets coming from sports betting. The last week of December accounted for a total trading volume of $1.7 billion. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

57610859,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=905583,1769849116,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57610859.jpeg,Investor argues Fed nominee Kevin Warsh won’t remain a policy hawk,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/fed-nominee-warsh-isnt-a-permanent-hawk/,"Stanley Druckenmiller, a billionaire investor and longtime mentor of Donald Trump’s Federal Reserve chair nominee, pushed back on Kevin Warsh’s reputation as a hardliner on interest rates, noting he isn’t always hawkish on monetary policy. He dismissed the idea that Warsh is rigid on rates, saying, “I’ve seen him go both ways,” after President Trump nominated Warsh to succeed Jerome Powell. Warsh’s years at the Fed shaped his hawkish profile, particularly after transcripts revealed that he had emphasized inflation risks just days before Lehman Brothers went under in 2008. Druckenmiller said that Warsh is flexible about Greenspan’s methods President Trump has been outspoken about demands for rate cuts, frequently criticizing Chair Jerome Powell for his refusal to cut borrowing rates. However, there remains skepticism in financial circles about Warsh getting Powell’s job, as they believe his views on cutting the Fed’s balance sheet may drive long-term rates higher. But unlike many investors, Druckenmiller backs Trump’s appointment of Warsh. He argued that the former Fed governor, a partner at his family office since 2011, supported rate cuts during the financial crisis and favored easing policy at the outset of the pandemic. The duo even warned the Fed in a 2018 commentary against raising rates too soon, a recommendation the central bank later walked back amid market turmoil. Druckenmiller also asserted that Warsh is open-minded about Greenspan’s methods, which shaped Fed policy during a decade of strong productivity growth. He added that Warsh’s Stanford role and proximity to Silicon Valley make him exceptionally equipped to weigh tech risks and benefits, with a network few can match. “I could not think of a single other individual on the planet better equipped,” stated Druckenmiller. He further contended, “I’m really excited about the partnership between him and Bessent. Having an accord between the Treasury secretary and Fed chair is ideal.” The Treasury Secretary concurs with Warsh that a spike in AI productivity could allow the Fed to lower rates without triggering inflation. According to the Financial Times, Bessent and Warsh have already been acquainted through their shared relationship with Druckenmiller. Analysts say Warsh’s selection was an odd choice Some on Wall Street view Trump’s selection of Kevin Warsh as Fed chair as highly unusual. Warsh, if confirmed, will need to reconcile his previous support for higher interest rates with a president eager to reduce rates and willing to pressure Fed members to do so. Warsh secured Trump’s spotlighted contest by promising Fed “regime change,” pledging to shrink the balance sheet, and arguing that AI-driven growth will curb inflation. His stance was seen by some as something that would ease the ‘Sell America’ frenzy.” David Robin, an interest-rate strategist at TJM Institutional Services, stated, “Warsh is a data-dependent, Fed-credibility choice, so Fed watchers can breathe a bit of a sigh of relief. Conversely, I’m hard-pressed to think Trump would appoint anyone who didn’t commit to lower rates over time starting in June.” However, Jonathan Levin noted in Bloomberg Opinion that Trump turning the Fed chair hunt into a spectacle and picking Warsh are likely to both roil markets and leave most people unsatisfied, including himself. He also claimed that Warsh’s hawkish profile would make it even more difficult for him to build credibility.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC currently trades at $82,988.01 on the Binance USDT market. This development represents a notable shift in the digital asset’s recent performance trajectory. Market analysts immediately began examining the underlying factors driving this price movement. Consequently, investors worldwide are reassessing their positions in the volatile cryptocurrency space. Bitcoin Price Movement Analysis The descent below $83,000 marks a crucial psychological barrier for Bitcoin traders. Historically, round-number thresholds often serve as significant support and resistance levels. Market data reveals this represents a 4.2% decline from Bitcoin’s weekly high of $86,500. Trading volume simultaneously increased by approximately 18% across major exchanges. This correlation suggests heightened market activity during the downward movement. Technical indicators show the 50-day moving average currently sits at $81,200. Therefore, traders are watching this level closely for potential support. Several factors typically influence Bitcoin’s price volatility. These include macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and institutional investment flows. Recent Federal Reserve statements about interest rate policies have affected all risk assets. Additionally, cryptocurrency-specific news about exchange-traded fund flows contributes to price action. Market sentiment indicators show a shift toward caution among retail investors. However, institutional accumulation patterns remain relatively stable according to on-chain data. Historical Context and Market Patterns Bitcoin has experienced similar price corrections throughout its history. For instance, the 2021 bull market included multiple 20-30% pullbacks. The current decline appears relatively modest within historical volatility parameters. Previous cycles demonstrate that healthy markets often consolidate gains periodically. This consolidation allows for stronger foundation building before subsequent advances. The table below illustrates recent Bitcoin price milestones: Date Price Level Market Context Feb 28, 2025 $85,400 Post-ETF approval rally peak Mar 5, 2025 $86,500 Weekly high before correction Mar 13, 2025 $82,988 Current trading price Market analysts compare current conditions to previous cycles. The 2017 bull market featured thirteen separate corrections exceeding 10%. Similarly, the 2020-2021 cycle experienced eight major pullbacks. This historical perspective helps investors maintain balanced expectations. Seasoned traders recognize volatility as inherent to cryptocurrency markets. Consequently, they implement risk management strategies accordingly. Expert Perspectives on Market Dynamics Financial analysts emphasize several key considerations during price corrections. First, they examine on-chain metrics like exchange flows and holder behavior. Second, they assess macroeconomic factors affecting all risk assets. Third, they evaluate technical indicators for support and resistance levels. According to cryptocurrency researchers, several patterns emerge during corrections. Long-term holders typically demonstrate resilience during moderate declines. Meanwhile, short-term traders often react more dramatically to price movements. Market structure analysis reveals important insights. The Bitcoin derivatives market shows reduced leverage compared to previous cycles. This development suggests potentially healthier market conditions. Funding rates across perpetual swap markets have normalized recently. Therefore, the risk of cascading liquidations appears diminished. Exchange reserves continue their multi-year downward trend. This pattern indicates accumulation rather than distribution among long-term investors. Broader Cryptocurrency Market Impact Bitcoin’s price movement inevitably affects the wider digital asset ecosystem. Altcoins typically demonstrate higher volatility during market shifts. Major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum often correlate strongly with Bitcoin’s price action. However, some assets occasionally decouple during specific market conditions. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization currently stands at approximately $3.2 trillion. This represents a 5% decline from recent highs above $3.36 trillion. Several factors differentiate current market conditions from previous cycles: Institutional participation has increased substantially through regulated products Regulatory frameworks continue developing in major jurisdictions Traditional finance integration has created new market dynamics Technological developments like layer-2 solutions improve network utility Macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from previous cycles These developments create a more complex market environment. Consequently, price analysis requires consideration of additional variables. Traditional financial indicators now influence cryptocurrency markets more directly. This integration represents both opportunity and complexity for market participants. Technical Analysis and Key Levels Technical analysts identify several important price levels for Bitcoin. The $80,000-$81,000 range represents a crucial support zone. This area aligns with the 50-day moving average and previous consolidation. A breach below this level could signal further correction potential. Conversely, resistance appears around $85,000 based on recent price action. The $86,500 level represents the immediate ceiling for bullish momentum. Market participants monitor several technical indicators simultaneously. Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings currently suggest neutral conditions. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows weakening momentum. Trading volume patterns indicate genuine price discovery rather than manipulation. These technical factors combine with fundamental developments. Together they create the current market landscape that traders must navigate. Fundamental Factors Influencing Price Beyond technical analysis, fundamental developments continue shaping Bitcoin’s value proposition. Network security remains at all-time highs with increasing hash rates. Adoption metrics show steady growth in active addresses and transaction volumes. Institutional custody solutions continue attracting traditional capital. Regulatory clarity improves in several important jurisdictions. These fundamental strengths provide underlying support during price volatility. The macroeconomic environment presents both challenges and opportunities. Inflation concerns persist in many developed economies. Currency debasement fears continue driving some investors toward hard assets. Geopolitical uncertainties create demand for censorship-resistant money. Technological innovation expands Bitcoin’s potential use cases. These factors collectively influence long-term valuation models. Investor Considerations and Risk Management Price volatility necessitates careful risk management strategies. Diversification remains a fundamental principle for cryptocurrency investors. Position sizing should reflect individual risk tolerance levels. Dollar-cost averaging can mitigate timing risks during volatile periods. Security practices must protect assets regardless of market conditions. Education about market mechanics helps investors make informed decisions. Several common investor behaviors often prove counterproductive during volatility. Emotional trading frequently leads to buying high and selling low. Chasing momentum without understanding fundamentals increases risk. Over-leveraging amplifies losses during unexpected movements. Neglecting security measures jeopardizes assets regardless of portfolio performance. Successful investors typically develop disciplined approaches to these challenges. Conclusion Bitcoin’s price movement below $83,000 represents normal market behavior within a volatile asset class. Historical context reveals similar corrections occurred during previous bull markets. Fundamental strengths continue supporting Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Technical analysis identifies key support and resistance levels for monitoring. Investors should maintain perspective during inevitable market fluctuations. The Bitcoin price decline provides opportunities for education about market dynamics. Ultimately, cryptocurrency markets continue maturing through cycles of expansion and consolidation.

Multiple factors typically contribute to price movements, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, market sentiment shifts, and technical trading patterns. No single cause explains complex market behavior completely. Q2: How does this decline compare to previous Bitcoin corrections? Historical data shows Bitcoin frequently experiences 20-30% corrections during bull markets. The current decline appears relatively modest within this historical context, though each market cycle has unique characteristics. Q3: Should investors be concerned about this price movement? Price volatility represents normal market behavior for cryptocurrencies. Investors should focus on their long-term strategy, risk tolerance, and fundamental research rather than short-term price fluctuations. Q4: What price levels are analysts watching now? Technical analysts typically monitor the $80,000-$81,000 support zone and the $85,000 resistance level. The 50-day moving average around $81,200 also represents an important technical indicator. Q5: How does Bitcoin’s performance affect other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin often influences broader cryptocurrency market sentiment. Many digital assets demonstrate correlation with Bitcoin’s price movements, though some may decouple based on specific developments or use cases.

This unexpected situation prompted certain stakeholders who supported the US-based semiconductor company to raise questions about the deal. This deal was initially announced at Nvidia’s headquarters in Santa Clara, California, last September . The agreement included a memorandum of understanding in which the graphics processing giant pledged to provide OpenAI with at least 10 gigawatts of computing power. Another promise was to make a significant investment of up to $100 billion to help fund the firm. In return, the large language model developer agreed to lease Nvidia’s chips. With the deal terms clear, OpenAI expects the negotiations to conclude soon. Nonetheless, these discussions have not proceeded from the initial stages. Nvidia’s CEO expressed concerns about the OpenAI deal Analysts admitted that the Nvidia-OpenAI deal is massive. They decide to consult someone close to the firm to learn about its current process. While maintaining anonymity because the talks were private, the individual revealed that the recent discussion concerned a potential equity investment valued at tens of billions, which is a crucial element of OpenAI’s investment strategy. Meanwhile, industry associates alleged that Nvidia’s CEO, Jensen Huang, recently informed them in private that the original $100 billion agreement was not yet legally binding and required finalization. Huang also raised concerns about what he perceives as a lack of discipline in the ChatGPT creator’s business strategy, hence expressing fears about rivals such as Google and Anthropic. In response to the CEO’s remarks, a spokesperson from OpenAI mentioned that, “Our teams are currently working through the specifics of our partnership. Nvidia technology has been crucial to our successes from the beginning, powers our systems today, and will continue to be essential as we expand in the future.” On the other hand, a representative from Nvidia noted that the tech giant has been the US-based AI lab’s long-standing preferred partner. Afterwards, the spokesperson expressed their excitement about continuing to partner with the firm. This discussion took place at a time when OpenAI was preparing to secure an IPO by the end of this year. To demonstrate its commitment to going public, the tech company has spent most of the last year seeking to acquire substantial computing resources to support its overall growth and products. Analysts warned Sam Altman’s habit of loudly announcing deals Following the current situation surrounding the OpenAI-NVIDIA deal, sources noted that the halt is a setback for OpenAI’s plan to go public. They also argued that the company’s CEO, Sam Altman, has a habit of loudly announcing deals, which sometimes leads to negative consequences when the agreement’s details are not yet finalized. In the meantime, Huang described this deal as the largest computing initiative ever. He made this statement during a joint announcement after introducing the agreement with Altman and Greg Brockman, a co-founder and the President of OpenAI. While this announcement hit headlines, Nvidia’s stock surged by almost 4%, raising the firm’s market value to around $4.5 trillion. As part of the deal, the world’s leading AI chip supplier discussed potentially supporting some of OpenAI’s loans to finance the construction of its own data centers, according to information from sources close to the situation.

SEC-CFTC Joint Efforts For Project Crypto On Thursday, CFTC Chairman Michael Selig revealed that the regulatory agency is partnering with the SEC on its Project Crypto initiative to bring “coordination, coherence, and a unified approach to the federal oversight of crypto asset markets.” At a joint event on regulatory harmonization, Selig and SEC Chairman Paul Atkins outlined their plan to advance a clear crypto asset taxonomy, clarify jurisdictional lines, remove duplicative compliance requirements, and reduce regulatory fragmentation through their partnership. The SEC-CFTC harmonization agenda will focus on the fundamentals, as the chairmen detailed, including aligned definitions, coordinated oversight, and seamless, secure data sharing between agencies. “Harmonization strengthens standards through coherence, predictability, and economic rationality.” The agencies aim to ensure that “innovation takes root on American soil, under American law, and in service of American investors, customers, and businesses,” Selig affirmed during his opening remarks. He added that he had directed the CFTC staff to work with the SEC to study “joint codification” of the common-sense crypto asset taxonomy recently laid by Atkins, “as an interim measure while Congress finalizes legislation.” In a joint statement shared by the CFTC, the pro-industry chairmen explained that Project Crypto was designed to ensure that the US is ready to reinforce its global financial leadership when Congress acts: At its core, Project Crypto and our broader harmonization efforts reflect a shared philosophy: financial regulation must be precise, not punitive. Rules must be narrowly tailored to address material risks, nimble enough to adapt to technological change and remain anchored in our agencies’ statutory authorities. Innovation Exemption Timeline Pushed Back During the panel, Chair Atkins discussed the timeline for the Commission’s long-awaited innovation exemption for the crypto industry, which was initially expected to come before the end of January. As reported by Bitcoinist, the SEC chair said in December that the regulatory agency could issue innovation exemption rules for crypto firms in early 2026. Notably, the Commission has been studying a rule exemption since July 2025. The measure would allow crypto firms to quickly launch products by complying with “certain principles-based conditions designed to achieve the core policy aims of the federal securities laws” instead of “burdensome prescriptive regulatory requirements that hinder productive economic activity.” Atkins affirmed that the agency is still working on the innovation exemption, arguing that they “need to measure twice and cut once.” As he outlined, the agency wants to deliver a rule change that is “fit for purpose that will allow enough people to be able to develop their products, you know, within a predictable ambit of maneuver and then with an end date, an off-ramp, that sort of thing.” In addition, he noted that last year’s government shutdown delayed progress on crypto regulation, adding that the potential new shutdown could further delay the highly anticipated measure. Atkins denied that the SEC is waiting on the market structure bill to put out the innovation exemption, arguing that it is within the agency’s authority. However, he emphasized that they are taking the upcoming regulation into account because “there are a lot of moving parts to the situation.” “I just want to make sure that we keep the train going forward at full speed and for all parties’ sake,” he asserted, but did not offer a new potential timeline for the innovation exemption rollout. Meanwhile, Chair Selig also shared his plan to explore “ways in which the agency can encourage innovation in software development and support builders as they work toward product market fit.” This includes assessing whether an innovation exemption “may be appropriate in certain circumstances.”",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|CFTC|CFTC chair Michael Selig|Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)|crypto Innovation exemption|crypto market structure bill|crypto regulation|SEC|SEC Chair Paul Atkins|Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)|US Congress,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-31 09:00:36

According to the agency, both exchanges have been aiding the country by processing its crypto transactions. The detailed report from the OFAC revealed that the exchanges, Zedcex Exchange Ltd. and Zedxion Exchange Ltd., have also been providing several financial services to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ). The action marks the first time that OFAC has specifically designated crypto exchanges for operating in the financial sector of Iran. According to the agency, the platforms have carried out significant volumes of transactions for the IRGC. OFAC designates exchanges linked to Iran’s financial operations In the report shared by Chainalysis, Zedcex Exchange was registered in August 2022, and the exchange has reportedly processed more than $94 billion in transactions since it was established. On the other hand, Zedxion Exchange, which was registered in May 2021, initially had Iranian businessman Babak Morteza Zanjani listed as one of its directors. Both exchanges appear to be part of a network helping the country evade sanctions. In addition, the network has also been fingered as the main avenue where funds are laundered for Iranian state interests, especially the IRGC. The connection between the exchanges and Babak Morteza Zanjani also provides another interesting angle to the OFAC action. In 2013, he was designated by the OFAC for acting as a financial facilitator for the IRGC, but was delisted under Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)-related designation removals in 2016. In 2016, Zanjani was sentenced to death in Iran for embezzling billions of dollars from Iran’s National Oil Company. However, his sentence was reduced in 2024, and by the following year, he was back as a financial backer of one of Iran’s largest railway investments. OFAC describes him as an “Iranian businessman and sanctions evader.” They claimed he was active in multiple sectors, including hospitality, transportation, technology, financial services, and oil exports. OFAC also claimed that his connection to the designated crypto exchanges establishes a pattern of a network of operations attempting to use digital assets to evade sanctions. Speaking about the update, Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent noted the Iranian regime’s use of digital assets to evade sanctions. “Like rats on a sinking ship, the regime is frantically wiring funds stolen from Iranian families to banks and financial institutions around the world,” he added. Who and what were designated by OFAC? In its designation of Zedcex Exchange, OFAC included seven Tron addresses, which interestingly overlapped with wallets identified by Israel’s NBCTF in September 2025 as controlled by the IRGC. The OFAC action is a move against a growing pattern of Iranian state actors and their affiliates using digital assets to evade sanctions and carry out illicit activities. In the past few years, OFAC has designated several individuals linked with the country involved in crypto-related sanctions evasion. The designation of the exchanges is part of a broader action targeting Iranian officials responsible for human rights abuses. OFAC also designated six Iranian officials associated with the IRGC and Law Enforcement Forces (LEF) for their roles in the violent suppression of protesters. These individuals include Minister of Interior Eskandar Momeni Kalagari, who is in charge of the LEF and multiple IRGC commanders responsible for provinces where security officials killed protesters, including children. The action from OFAC introduces new compliance considerations for crypto businesses globally. The designation of exchanges registered in the UK with ties to Iran shows the importance of proper know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, improved transaction monitoring, especially when dealing with exchanges with exposure to illicit wallets.

Key Takeaways: Tether’s 2025 profit fell about 23% to just over $10 billion, even as total assets rose by more than $49 billion. The stablecoin issuer’s US Treasury holdings hit a record $122 billion, making Treasuries the largest backing for USDt. Strong demand pushed about $50 billion in new USDt issuance, reinforcing its role as a core liquidity asset in crypto markets. According to its latest Financial Figures and Reserves Report , prepared by accounting firm BDO, Tether posted net profits of just over $10 billion in 2025, down around 23% from the roughly $13 billion it reported a year earlier. Despite the decline, the company said its balance sheet expanded significantly, with total assets rising by more than $49 billion year-on-year. Tether’s US Treasury Holdings Hit Record $122B in 2025 The standout figure in the report was Tether’s exposure to US Treasuries. Direct holdings of Treasury bills climbed above $122 billion by the end of 2025, the highest level the company has ever disclosed. Short-dated US government debt now makes up the largest single component of the reserves backing USDt, alongside reverse repurchase agreements and smaller allocations to corporate bonds and other investments. Tether said the growing Treasury position reflects a deliberate move toward highly liquid, low-risk assets as demand for its dollar-pegged token continues to grow. Over the past 12 months, the company issued about $50 billion in new USDt, pushing the stablecoin’s circulating supply to new highs. Chief executive Paolo Ardoino said demand for USDt has been fueled by users seeking access to US dollars outside traditional banking channels, particularly in regions where financial systems are slow or difficult to access. Tether Delivers $10B+ Profits in 2025, $6.3B in Excess Reserves, and Record $141 billion Exposure in U.S. Treasury Holdings Learn more: https://t.co/XG3vgSoVeV — Tether (@tether) January 30, 2026 He described the stablecoin as increasingly embedded in global payments, trading, and savings activity. USDt remains a cornerstone of the crypto market. With a market capitalization of roughly $185.5 billion, it ranks as the third-largest cryptocurrency, behind Bitcoin and Ether, according to CoinMarketCap data. Traders and exchanges closely monitor Tether’s profits and reserves because USDt is widely used as a dollar substitute for liquidity, collateral, and settlement. Tether’s Gold Reserves Grow to $12B as XAUt Backing Expands Beyond Treasuries, the report shows Tether continues to diversify its reserves. The company holds exposure to precious metals, including gold backing its XAUt stablecoin. As of September 2025, Tether reported around $12 billion in gold exposure, with more than 520,000 troy ounces held specifically for XAUt. Separately, it maintains a broader gold reserve estimated at about 130 metric tons, valued at roughly $22 billion at current prices. While profits fell from last year’s peak, Tether ended 2025 with assets exceeding liabilities by more than $6.3 billion, according to the BDO assurance report. As reported, Tether has officially launched USAT , a federally regulated, dollar-backed stablecoin built specifically for the US market under the new GENIUS Act framework. The token, issued by Anchorage Digital Bank, marks Tether’s formal entry into America’s emerging federal stablecoin regime and shows a major shift in how digital dollars may operate inside the United States’ regulated financial system.

The platform will enable developers to create general-purpose apps that use Lighter’s advantages and detect market liquidity with ZK-verified security. According to Lighter, the system will function as the current Lighter custom circuit system without any changes, enabling the platform to add additional customizable capabilities while retaining its high-performance trade verification. Axiom, on the other hand, revealed that OpenVM 2.0, which offers real-time performance and proven soundness, will be used to verify the Lighter EVM and help consumers achieve lower costs without sacrificing security. The verification will enable the Lighter EVM to offer real-time performance and provable soundness, enabling users to pay low costs without compromising security. Lighter EVM enables fast, composable DeFi trading ecosystem https://t.co/QuvFKuTrG2 — Lighter (@Lighter_xyz) January 30, 2026 Axiom explained that the Lighter EVM provides a smart contract environment compatible with the optimized Lighter system. Recursive aggregation of Lighter proofs will be enabled via custom OpenVM additions tailored to the Plonky2 proof system, allowing combined zero-knowledge verification of Lighter EVM and Lighter state transitions. According to Axiom, the system would provide real-time verification on the Ethereum mainnet by utilizing the high-performance SWIRL proof method. Axiom further claimed that this strategy aims to give customers native composability with perps and spot trading on the Lighter platform while offering low-cost, high-throughput EVM execution. However, these verification and execution features will enable interoperability between Lighter EVM and the core Lighter markets. Lighter outlined that the system will enable fast interoperability with its markets by jointly settling with Lighter on the Ethereum mainnet. Users will be able to transfer assets, place orders, and manage Lighter positions from Lighter EVM. Crucially, users can switch between execution environments in a matter of seconds without waiting for L1 finality. At launch, Lighter stated that the system will offer rapid async reads of tasks such as staking, order placement, and asset transfers. “We are actively researching methods to reduce write latency and potentially offer a synchronous option,” the company wrote on X. The company also said that the system will enable an ecosystem of Lighter-colocated EVM applications that may leverage the power of the Ethereum DeFi community. According to the trading platform, Lighter EVM would provide stablecoins created natively on the platform, quick deposit bridges, and collateral sharing between lending on the system and perps on Lighter . The system would also enable new applications, such as tokenization. Axiom expands fiat-to-crypto access through strategic partnerships Axiom and Lighter collaboration to launch Lighter EVM follows a string of recent initiatives from Axiom, including a partnership with Onramper to simplify crypto on- and off-ramps for DeFi users worldwide. On December 4 of last year, Onramper announced a partnership with Axiom to provide one of DeFi’s quickest and smoothest trading experiences. Under the partnership, Axiom customers would gain instant top-ups in BNB and SOL using over 130 payment methods, including debit and credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Venmo, and localized options in 190 countries. “Our job is to simplify the way users move from fiat into crypto. By offering a wide range of trusted, localized payment options, we ensure that users can onboard quickly and compliantly. We’re thrilled to support Axiom as they scale the next generation of DeFi on Solana.” -Thijs Maas, CEO of Onramper. Axiom’s CEO and co-founder, Henry Zhang, also commented regarding the partnership. He stated that the company is providing a quick, international, and user-friendly on-chain trading experience. He also noted that integrating Onramper gives users a reliable option to convert fiat to crypto and access on-chain liquidity. Alongside its work with Onramper, Axiom has continued expanding fiat-to-crypto access through partnerships, including its integration with MoonPay. On October 8, 2025, MoonPay, a financial technology company, announced its integration with Axio to provide Axiom users a seamless way to buy crypto instantly using familiar payment methods, creating a frictionless bridge between fiat and DeFi.

The plaintiffs allege that the tech giant collected their data and used it for profit despite them having switched off a key privacy setting. Google has managed to convince a federal Judge in San Francisco to deny the plaintiffs’ compensation for the tech giant’s alleged advertisement malpractice. Consumers are suing Google for collecting data from their devices and using it to serve personalized ads, despite consumers having switched on a key privacy setting that legally prohibited Google from doing so. U.S. District Judge dismisses plaintiffs’ $2.36B claim against Google Chief U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg denied the plaintiffs’ request to recover $2.36 billion in alleged profits and to halt certain ad-related practices. The accusers sought a permanent injunction against Google, a claim Seeborg vehemently denied during the proceedings. A jury had found the tech conglomerate guilty of invasion of privacy back in September for secretly collecting app activity data from millions of users who had disabled a tracking feature. Google pleaded with the judge on Friday not to add the penalty to the September verdict, which ordered the tech giant to pay about $425 million in damages to the plaintiffs who had filed the class-action lawsuit. The settlement is far below the $31 billion the plaintiffs sought in damages and other compensation. Court documents reveal that the plaintiffs returned to court, arguing that the compensation was insufficient. The plaintiffs said that the $2.36 billion is still a conservative estimate of the profits Google realized from the tracking feature at the time of the misconduct. The accusers said they were entitled to Google’s allegedly ill-gotten profits from its data tracking and privacy invasion techniques. Consumers also said Google has not changed its privacy disclosures or data collection practices, despite the September verdict finding the company guilty. Google has pushed back instead, saying it will appeal the September verdict. The tech company also noted that prohibiting it from collecting users’ account-related data would negatively impact an analytics service that developers depend on. Judge Richard Seeborg said that the victims failed to establish prospective irreparable harm, making a permanent injunction inappropriate for the case. The judge also said that the plaintiffs “failed to show entitlement to disgorgement, both because their legal remedy is adequate and because their estimate of Google’s profits is insufficiently supported.” Google faces increased class-action lawsuits over the invasion of consumer privacy for profit The news comes amid a rise in lawsuits against Google. On January 28, Cryptopolitan reported that the tech company agreed to settle a lawsuit for $135 million to avoid a formal trial after Android users claimed the tech company used their cellular data without their consent. According to the report, the plaintiffs argued that Google programmed its mobile operating system to collect and transmit data even when phones were idle or settings were turned off. Another report noted that the global search company agreed to pay $68 million to settle a lawsuit involving its Google voice assistant AI agent. The report dated January 26 highlighted that the company broke the law by recording and sharing their private conversations using Google Assistant. Plaintiffs argued that the AI assistant secretly recorded conversations and that Google then served them personalized ads despite the recordings being illegal and non-consensual. Google denied the allegations but agreed to settle the matter out of court to avoid legal costs. The report noted that the settlement will cover anyone who owned Google devices or experienced these false activities going back to May 18, 2016. In 2025 alone, Google settled various privacy-related lawsuits totaling more than $2.8 billion. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

The full-year breakdown was confirmed in its Q4 2025 attestation, reviewed by BDO, one of the five largest accounting firms in the world. The attestation showed that Tether had total assets of $192.87 billion against $186.54 billion in liabilities. Out of those liabilities, $186.45 billion were tied to issued digital tokens. This left the company with $6.3 billion in excess reserves, giving it a cushion even after the profit hit. The decline in earnings reportedly didn’t stop the company from having the largest pile of cash in the stablecoin industry, as per usual. USD₮ issuance climbs as users seek dollar liquidity In 2025, Tether issued almost $50 billion in new USD₮, the second-highest amount in its history. About $30 billion of that came in the second half of the year alone. That pushed total USD₮ in circulation past $186 billion, the highest the company has ever reported. Circulation jumped as traders, emerging market users, and payment providers needed fast access to digital dollars. Many were operating in places where banks are either broken or way too slow. By the end of the year, the number of USD₮ users hit 530 million globally. Reserves also jumped. Total reserve assets ended the year at nearly $193 billion, keeping liabilities fully covered. The company kept its reserves clean. Only liquid assets were counted. The more experimental stuff was left out of the official backing pool. CEO Paolo Ardoino said, “What matters about 2025 is not just the scale of growth, but the structure behind it. USD₮ expanded because global demand for dollars is increasingly moving outside traditional banking rails, particularly in regions where financial systems are slow, fragmented, or inaccessible.” Paolo added that:- “USD₮, with its network effect and parabolic growth, has become the most widely adopted monetary social network in the history of humanity.” Tether becomes major US debt holder while expanding side bets Tether’s exposure to U.S. Treasuries hit a new peak in 2025. Direct Treasury holdings passed $122 billion, the most the company has ever held. When you add indirect holdings, including overnight reverse repo deals, the number grows to over $141 billion. This puts Tether near the top of the list of non-government holders of U.S. debt. The reserves that back USD₮ stay separate from the company’s riskier investments. Management made it clear that things like AI, energy, media, fintech, precious metals, agriculture, land, and peer-to-peer communication platforms (funded through the Tether Global Investment Fund SICAF S.A.) are not included in the reserve count. That investment arm now manages more than $20 billion worth of bets, but none of it touches the official USD₮ backing. Ardoino said, “This has been made possible by the trust accrued by our strong risk management setup, unprecedented in the financial sector, and the decisions we make around asset quality, allocation, and liquidity are designed to ensure USD₮ remains reliable and usable at a global scale, even during periods of extreme demand.” Right now, Tether holds one of the biggest reserve war chests in the world, has more than half a billion users, and controls over $140 billion in U.S. government debt. The profit drop may raise eyebrows, but the numbers show a firm still sitting on a mountain of capital. That makes it hard to ignore. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Speaking during a live ask‑me‑anything session hosted on Binance’s own social platform, Zhao described those accusations as “far‑fetched,” arguing that they oversimplify what was one of the most turbulent days in crypto market history. CZ Rejects Blame For $19 Billion Crypto Liquidations During the session, Zhao rejected the idea that Binance was the primary force behind the record wave of liquidations seen on October 10, when traders across the industry were hit by sudden price swings, technical disruptions, and liquidity issues. That day, an estimated $19 billion worth of leveraged crypto positions were wiped out, marking the largest single‑day liquidation event in the roughly 16‑year history of the crypto market. While Binance did experience system glitches and pricing discrepancies during the turmoil, Zhao emphasized that the cryptocurrency exchange was not the cause of the broader market collapse. CZ said: There are a larger group who claim the October 10th crash was caused by Binance and wants Binance to compensate everything. If you are living in those world in your head, you are unlikely to be successful in the future. He added that Binance had already compensated users and businesses affected by platform‑specific issues, ultimately paying out around $600 million following the crash. According to Zhao, customers who lost funds due to Binance’s technical problems were fully reimbursed. Binance Under Global Regulatory Watch Zhao also addressed regulatory oversight, noting that Binance operates as a regulated entity in Abu Dhabi, where local authorities have full access to the company’s operational data. The former executive further pointed out that the cryptocurrency exchange remains under the supervision of a US government monitorship , reinforcing his argument that the platform’s activities are subject to significant scrutiny. Although Zhao no longer runs the company, he clarified that his comments were made in his capacity as a Binance shareholder and user. He stepped down as CEO in November 2023 as part of a resolution with US authorities. Yet, Zhao’s legal situation took another turn in October 2025, when he received a presidential pardon from Donald Trump. The move reignited public debate and political criticism, particularly from Democratic lawmakers, who questioned both the decision itself and Binance’s alleged political and business connections. Addressing those concerns in a separate interview with CNBC, Zhao denied having any business relationship with the Trump family. “There’s no business relationship whatsoever,” he said, adding that the broader narrative surrounding the pardon and the exchange’s supposed ties to Trump had been “misconstrued.” As of this writing, Binance Coin (BNB), the exchange’s native token, is trading at $847. It has declined by 5% over the past week alone, mirroring the broader digital asset market drop. This puts the token 38% below its record high of $1,369, which was reached last year.

57612126,https://finbold.com/?p=261563,1769854569,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,Ripple to unlock 1 billion XRP tomorrow,https://finbold.com/ripple-to-unlock-1-billion-xrp-tomorrow/,"Ripple is preparing to unlock 1 billion XRP from its escrow wallets on February 1, 2026, marking another month in its long-standing schedule of token releases. The escrow system releases up to 1 billion XRP at the start of each month, but only a small portion typically enters circulation, as Ripple often re-locks about 70–80% of the tokens shortly after release. This limits the net increase in supply, with the remaining XRP mainly used for liquidity services, partnerships, or institutional activity. Throughout 2025, these large but predictable unlocks attracted attention, yet their impact on XRP prices was largely muted as the token traded in tandem with the broader cryptocurrency market . Because the releases were expected and mostly priced in, prices often saw little immediate downside and, in some cases, even rose alongside broader market strength. The subdued reaction reflects the regularity of the unlock schedule and the fact that most tokens are re-escrowed, keeping the effective supply increase far smaller than the headline 1 billion XRP figure. Notably, the upcoming unlock will test how the market absorbs scheduled supply increases, with attention centered on the net addition to circulation and short-term price action rather than the headline figure. If past patterns persist, the release may pass without sharp moves, highlighting how the escrow system’s predictability has softened its impact on XRP prices over time. XRP price analysis Indeed, this comes at a critical moment for the token as it continues to face renewed capital outflows amid a broader cryptocurrency market sell-off. By press time, XRP was trading at $1.70, having plunged over 2% in the past 24 hours, while on the weekly timeline, the token is down over 11%. XRP seven-day price chart.

This confirms a firmly bearish trend and signals that recent rebounds lack broader trend support. Until XRP reclaims at least the 50-day SMA, upside moves are likely to face strong selling interest. Meanwhile, the 14-day RSI at 34 sits near the lower end of neutral, indicating weak momentum without being deeply oversold. This suggests selling pressure is easing slightly, but not enough to signal a decisive reversal.

The kind of debut people screenshot, refresh, and talk about hours later. The bold predictions were not just talk this time. They played out in real numbers. The price of $XYZ, initially offered at just $0.0001 during the earliest presale stage, surged dramatically after listing. Within hours, it briefly touched the $0.2 level, a moment many early supporters had talked about long before trading went live. In the first hours of trading alone, $XYZ jumped from $0.025 to a peak of $0.21, leaving no doubt that demand showed up fast and aggressively. XYZVerse Launch in Numbers: Launch price: $0.025 All-time high: $0.21 Growth: Over 8.4x in hours This was not a slow grind upward. It was a statement. And the community felt it. Social channels lit up. Holders described $XYZ as one of the strongest launches they have seen in recent months. Many are already looking ahead, expecting that additional exchange listings could push the project even further. What Fuels $XYZ Explosive Listing XYZVerse did not arrive on MEXC empty-handed. Long before the listing, the project had already raised over $16 million in its presale. That kind of capital does not come from impulse alone. It comes from sustained belief, stage after stage, backed by a growing audience. Then there is the community. XYZVerse does not feel like a typical token crowd. It feels closer to an esports fanbase. Competitive, vocal, and deeply engaged. Sports fans, gamers, and crypto users overlap here in a way that feels natural, not forced. Scarcity played its role too. Ahead of the listing, the team confirmed that twice as many tokens would be burned as originally planned. That decision reduced circulating supply right as trading began. Not later. Not eventually. Right at the moment it mattered most. A Live Product, Not a Promise What truly separates XYZVerse from countless other launches is this simple fact: the product is already live. XYZVerse is running the first on-chain Counter-Strike 2 League , and it is not a small experiment. The league features a combined prize pool of 500,000 USDT and 5,000,000 $XYZ, with 10 teams competing in structured matches. Fans are not just watching. They are participating. Through Access Passes, users can vote on maps, predict outcomes, and collect digital moments tied directly to live competition. All match data, votes, and rewards are recorded on-chain, making the experience transparent and verifiable. The expected reach exceeds one million viewers across streaming platforms. That is real visibility, real engagement, and real usage happening before and during the listing, not after. Here’s an expanded, high-energy yet readable continuation that fits naturally into the article and deepens the focus on utility and long-term plans without losing the emotional tone. What Comes Next: Utility That Feeds the Ecosystem The real story does not stop at the chart. It starts with how $XYZ is used once the excitement settles. The XYZ token sits at the center of the platform. Players use it to join matches. Fans use it to support teams, unlock in-game items, and access exclusive perks tied to live events. Every click, vote, and interaction flows through the system. More engagement means more transactions moving through the Revenue Router. Instead of hype-driven demand, $XYZ demand is created by gameplay itself. The more people play, watch, and participate, the more the token gets used. This is demand driven by behavior, not speculation. After the TGE, XYZVerse rolls out its Sustainability Initiative, a mechanism designed to support the ecosystem long after the launch excitement fades. Every few months, 10 percent of net profits generated by partner projects are allocated to buying back $XYZ directly from the open market. Don't miss out on the action—XYZVerse is just getting started. These buybacks help absorb selling pressure, reduce circulating supply over time, and create a stabilizing force in the market. Combined with ongoing token burns, the structure actively works to reward long-term holders who stay engaged with the ecosystem. XYZVerse is betting that when utility, transparency, and competitive energy come together, the ecosystem can grow without relying on constant hype. The launch proved the market was ready. The next phase is about proving it can last. Disclaimer: This content is intended solely for informational purposes.

While many established projects are moving sideways, fresh capital is flowing into infrastructure-heavy protocols. Analysts are increasingly pointing to decentralized lending as one of the most promising areas of opportunity. One project, in particular, is showing clear signs of a potential breakout as its technical foundation becomes fully operational. As the market searches for real utility, investors are placing greater emphasis on platforms with working products, often before they reach broader public awareness. This shift from ideas to executable code is creating a rare growth window. On-chain analysts are also noting a declining risk profile alongside rising upside potential. What is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Creating Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a lending & borrowing hub on Ethereum that is decentralized. The protocol will enable the users to unlock the liquidity of their digital assets without selling them. It applies the dual-market model, which involves the combination of pooled liquidity to be quick and direct peer-to-peer markets to be tailored with desired terms. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already attained phenomenal momentum through its presale distribution phases. It has raised a total funding of more than $20.2 million and has exceeded 19,000 individual investors. Such support is not common to a project in the pre-launch period. Presale started in early 2025 at a low price of only $0.01 and has gone up by 300% to its present price of $0.04 per MUTM. V1 Launch Milestone and Security Standards The launch of the V1 protocol on the Sepolia testnet is the most urgent update for Mutuum Finance in 2026. This action demonstrates that the logic for lending and liquidity pools is operating at full throttle. This milestone allows users to interact with a working version of the decentralized application to test core financial flows. Participants can now explore initial markets for established assets like ETH, USDT, LINK, and WBTC. The available features include the ability to supply assets to test yield and use those deposits as collateral to borrow liquidity. Lenders receive mtTokens, which are yield-bearing receipts that grow in value as interest accumulates, while borrowers receive debt tokens to track their obligations. Users can also monitor the health factor of their loans and see the automated liquidator bot in action, which ensures protocol stability by managing risky positions. This hands-on experience provides a realistic preview before the full mainnet debut. In order to achieve maximum safety the team underwent a complete independent audit performed by Halborn Security . According to the predictions of many experts, the token may gain value of up to $0.25 to $0.30 as long as mainnet successfully follows the V1 activation. This would be a huge 625% to 750%growth over the present levels. Mechanisms of Rewards Mutuum Finance issues mtTokens to reflect the position of depositors on its pools. These tokens are increased with time as repayment of interest by the borrowers is received. This produces the natural compounding effect on the lenders. A buy-and-distribute model is also developing in the protocol. Some of the platform fees are spent to purchase MUTM at the open market and redistributed to the stakers. The 2026 roadmap has the introduction of an over-collateralized stablecoin and transition to Layer-2 networks. All these updates will ensure that the protocol is faster and much cheaper to all users. Oracle Chainlink will supply the correct price feeds required to make safe liquidations. With these features planned a number of experts believe a long-term price forecast of 1.25$ to 2.00$ is realistic. This would translate to 5,000% rise. Phase 7 of the presale is advancing and it is selling more quickly than any other phase. Big players have been observed to spend huge sums of money with allocations with more than $100,000. This is a huge activity whose significance is that the most experienced investors are confident in the technical delivery of the project. The current entry implies a 50% discount. With the remaining tokens being taken, the window of getting in before the next crypto price increase is closing.

57612687,https://invezz.com/?p=3053467,1769855400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"What Kevin Warsh’s Fed nomination could mean for stocks, crypto, and risk assets",https://invezz.com/news/2026/01/31/what-kevin-warshs-fed-nomination-could-mean-for-stocks-crypto-and-risk-assets/,"The financial world shifted on its axis this Friday as President Donald Trump officially nominated Kevin Warsh to succeed Jerome Powell as Chair of the Federal Reserve. This appointment is far from a mere administrative baton-pass; it represents a fundamental pivot in the world’s most powerful economic engine. Warsh, a former Fed governor and Wall Street veteran, enters the fray at a time when the central bank’s independence and its approach to liquidity are under intense scrutiny. For financial markets, the “Warsh Era” signals a departure from the status quo, promising a cocktail of aggressive rate-cut advocacy mixed with a disciplined, “tough love” approach to the Fed’s balance sheet that could fundamentally reshape the performance of risk assets in 2026. Kevin Warsh – a double-edged sword for risk assets The immediate market reaction to the Warsh news was a sharp “risk-off” move, with stock prices declining and Bitcoin facing selling pressure as well. This stems from Warsh’s reputation as a “reformed hawk”. While he’s aligned with Trump’s demand for lower interest rates to spur growth – a move that typically benefits stocks and cryptocurrencies – he simultaneously advocates for a significantly smaller Fed balance sheet. This creates a paradox for risk assets: while lower nominal rates are a tailwind, a reduction in global dollar liquidity is a massive headwind. As Stephen Brown of Capital Economics noted, Warsh is a “relatively safe choice,” but his conviction that “the Fed should operate with a much smaller balance sheet” could put persistent upward pressure on long-term bond yields, making non-yielding assets like stocks and crypto less attractive. Valuation over liquidity: the death of the “Fed Put” For years, equity markets have leaned on the “Fed Put” – the belief that the central bank would reliably inject liquidity at the first sign of trouble. Warsh, however, is a vocal critic of the Fed’s tendency to “pamper” markets. His “valuation-over-liquidity” framework means risk assets like high-growth tech and Bitcoin can no longer rely on central bank largesse to mask weak fundamentals. In a recent interview, Warsh argued that the Fed’s “bloated balance sheet” should be reduced to “support households and small businesses” rather than just the largest financial firms. This shift forces a Darwinian transition: companies with real earnings will thrive under lower rates, but “zombie” stocks and speculative bubbles that survived solely on excess market liquidity may face a harsh reckoning as the Fed’s safety net is pulled away. How to play risk assets amidst the new economic climate Ultimately, Kevin Warsh views the Fed not as a “pampered prince” of the economy, but as a disciplined steward of the currency. His belief that artificial intelligence will act as a “significant disinflationary force” suggests he may feel emboldened to cut rates without fearing an immediate inflationary spike, a scenario that could ignite a massive rally in small-cap stocks. However, the cost of this growth will be the removal of the experimental stimulus measures that defined the last decade. As we move toward May 2026, the transition from Powell’s “cautious guidance” to Warsh’s “structural reform” means the era of easy, liquidity-driven gains is likely over. In this new landscape, the winners will be those who prioritize real productivity over the temporary highs of central bank cash injections.

The project regarded the token burn as the final step in the remediation process that began in response to the security incident from December 27 and was executed by the Community Governance Council. Flow commits to moving on from December hack An official post from the Flow Foundation confirmed the permanent destruction of the counterfeit $FLOW tokens. The burning of the counterfeit tokens completely removes all seized counterfeits from circulation and completes the final mechanical step of Flow’s isolated recovery plan as outlined in the December technical post-mortem . Network operations returned to normal after validators deployed a security patch within 24 hours of the incident, complete with extra security safeguards implemented across the protocol to prevent a repeat of such in the future. As for exchange and infrastructure services, those continue to be restored through active coordination with partners. The post claims Kraken, Gate, and Coinbase have already fully resumed $FLOW deposits and withdrawals, while additional exchange services are completing reconciliation processes and are expected to resume imminently. The network is also back to full operational health, with ongoing ecosystem activity back to over 3 million transactions in a single week. Its core DeFi protocols too are fully operational, and developer activity as well as protocol deployments have returned to pre-incident levels. Now that the security remediation is complete, Flow turns its attention to continued ecosystem growth and product development. The network’s recent protocol upgrades introduce ongoing deflationary pressures via transaction fee mechanisms, aligning tokenomics with long-term network sustainability. Flow takes steps to avoid repeat exploit The Flow network experienced an exploit in December 2025 when a hacker capitalized on a type confusion vulnerability in the Cadence runtime. This allowed them to create counterfeit tokens without minting new ones or draining user wallets. No legitimate user balances were compromised as a result, but the hacker was able to bridge out and realize about $3.9M in value using venues like Celer and deBridge, before validators halted the network. The hacker would have gotten away with far more; the total duplicated supply was around 88B FLOW, with over a billion tokens moved to centralized exchanges. Thanks to the prompt response from cooperative exchanges, the larger volumes of counterfeit tokens were contained. The remaining were isolated onchain via restrictions and the Isolated Recovery Plan. The plan was chosen over a full chain rollback, which faced significant pushback as it would not preserve history or minimize disruption to bridges/exchanges, as reported by Cryptopolitan. The Foundation has committed to several guarantees to strengthen network security and resilience to prevent a repeat in the future. These guarantees have seen runtime type validation boundaries hardened and covered by regression tests, while supply anomaly detection and execution-layer monitoring were expanded to surface similar conditions earlier. Elevated recovery permissions for the Community Governance Council introduced during remediation will reportedly be revoked following completion of all recovery phases. There has also been a review of the bug-bounty program, which led to an increase in rewards to align more closely with the increased TVL. The Foundation has also decided to enhance the security procedure to provide timely and accurate communication with all partners and establish feedback channels early on. Lastly, the Foundation will ensure that future incident responses clearly distinguish between proposals under consideration and finalized decisions. A process to align with all stakeholders and converge on a decision. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the politically-backed DeFi platform, charts a cautious long-term course amid regulatory uncertainty, while XYZVerse ($XYZ) just delivered one of the most explosive exchange listings seen in recent months. Here's what investors need to know about both projects as they shape the year ahead. World Liberty Financial: Navigating the Political DeFi Experiment World Liberty Financial has emerged as perhaps the most controversial project in DeFi, not because of its technology, but because of its backers. The platform's association with high-profile political figures positions it uniquely in a space where regulatory clarity remains the industry's biggest challenge. According to comprehensive analysis from Cryptona, WLFI's 2026 trajectory will largely depend on how quickly the platform can convert political capital into actual user adoption and regulatory advantages. WLFI's 2026 Price Outlook: Three Scenarios The token, which launched at a presale price of $0.015, faces three distinct paths through the remainder of 2026: Conservative Case ($0.012-$0.025): This scenario assumes disappointing platform adoption, regulatory headwinds, and early investor profit-taking dominating price action. The downside risk from presale price ranges from -20% to modest gains of +67%. Base Case ($0.025-$0.045): Steady growth with demonstrated protocol functionality and moderate DeFi sector performance could push WLFI to the $0.025-$0.045 range, representing +67% to +200% returns for presale participants. Bullish Case ($0.045-$0.075): Strong adoption metrics, favorable regulatory developments, and successful conversion of political connections into market share could drive WLFI toward the upper range of $0.045-$0.075, delivering +200% to +400% gains. The Tokenomics Challenge WLFI's token distribution reveals significant centralization that investors cannot ignore. Of the 100 billion total token supply, only 20% was made available through public sale. The remaining 80% sits with team members, advisors, and insiders—with 17.5% allocated specifically to team and advisors. This heavily insider-weighted structure creates both risks and potential stability mechanisms. On one hand, concentrated holdings could lead to significant selling pressure when vesting schedules unlock. On the other, insider interests align with long-term project success rather than quick exits. Competitive Position: The DeFi Giants Loom Large World Liberty Financial enters a market dominated by battle-tested protocols. Aave commands $8-15 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL). Compound, MakerDAO, and Uniswap have years of proven security and user trust. WLFI's path to relevance requires carving a distinct niche—likely focusing on regulatory-compliant DeFi services or bridging traditional finance users into crypto markets. The platform's key differentiators include unprecedented political backing for regulatory navigation, simplified interfaces targeting crypto newcomers, and integrated services offering lending, borrowing, and trading in one platform. Whether these advantages translate to market share remains 2026's defining question for WLFI. Critical Catalysts to Watch Several developments will determine whether WLFI achieves its upper-range price predictions: Positive triggers: Major exchange listings on Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken; growing TVL metrics demonstrating real adoption; strategic partnerships with traditional financial institutions; favorable regulatory clarity; and strong quarterly growth reports. Negative risks: Securities classification challenges; platform security breaches; failure to achieve user adoption targets; competitive pressure from established platforms; broader crypto market corrections; and political controversies affecting brand perception. As Cryptona's analysis notes, ""The ultimate outcome will depend on factors both within and beyond the project team's control."" XYZVerse Delivers on Bold Predictions with Explosive MEXC Debut While World Liberty Financial charts its measured course, XYZVerse just proved that when utility meets hype, the market responds decisively. On January 29, XYZVerse launched on MEXC, and it was explosive. The kind of debut people screenshot, refresh, and talk about hours later. The bold predictions were not just talk this time.

Social channels lit up. Holders described $XYZ as one of the strongest launches they have seen in recent months. Many are already looking ahead, expecting that additional exchange listings could push the project even further. What Fuels $XYZ's Explosive Listing XYZVerse did not arrive on MEXC empty-handed. Long before the listing, the project had already raised over $16 million in its presale. That kind of capital does not come from impulse alone. It comes from sustained belief, stage after stage, backed by a growing audience. Then there is the community. XYZVerse does not feel like a typical token crowd. It feels closer to an esports fanbase. Competitive, vocal, and deeply engaged. Sports fans, gamers, and crypto users overlap here in a way that feels natural, not forced. Scarcity played its role too.

Key Takeaways: CZ dismissed claims that Binance triggered the $19 billion Oct. 10 crypto liquidation. He said he spoke as a shareholder, not as a Binance executive. A brief USDe depeg on Binance was later blamed on an internal oracle issue. Zhao addressed the claims during a question-and-answer session on Binance’s social media channels, pushing back on suggestions that the exchange was responsible for the sharp sell-off on Oct. 10 . According to Bloomberg , Zhao described the accusations as “far-fetched” and said some market participants were wrongly blaming Binance for losses suffered during the crash. CZ Rejects Claims Binance Caused October 10 Crypto Crash “There are a larger group who claim the October 10th crash was caused by Binance and wants Binance to compensate everything,” Zhao said, dismissing the idea that the exchange had triggered the liquidation cascade. He stressed that he was speaking as a shareholder and user of the platform, not in an executive capacity. Zhao stepped down as Binance’s chief executive in November 2023 after pleading guilty to US federal charges tied to anti-money laundering violations. He later served a prison sentence but was pardoned by US President Donald Trump in October last year. While no longer running the exchange, Zhao remains a prominent figure in the industry and now oversees YZi Labs, an investment firm that evolved from Binance’s former venture arm and manages about $10 billion in assets. . @cz_binance to those who think Binance deliberately caused the 10/10 market crash: “if you are living in those world in your head, you are unlikely to be successful in the future.” https://t.co/FRmNS7TlA7 — Muyao (@MuyaoShen) January 30, 2026 Binance came under particular scrutiny during the October turmoil after Ethena’s USDe stablecoin briefly lost its dollar peg on the exchange. During the sell-off, USDe dropped as low as $0.65 on Binance before recovering. The incident was later linked to a platform-specific oracle issue rather than a broader problem with the stablecoin. Ethena founder Guy Young said at the time that the price dislocation was confined to a single trading venue that relied on its own order book rather than deeper liquidity pools. He added that temporary deposit and withdrawal issues prevented arbitrage traders from correcting the imbalance. Binance subsequently compensated affected users about $283 million. $1T Crypto Wipeout Rekindles Debate Over Leverage and Risk More than three months on, the market is still feeling the aftershocks. Bitcoin, which traded above $126,000 in early October, slid below $80,000 weeks later, dragging the wider market down with it. The correction wiped out over $1 trillion in total crypto market value, fueling ongoing debate over leverage, risk management, and the role of major exchanges during periods of extreme volatility. According to XS.com analyst Samer Hasn, a Federal Reserve stance that remains neutral to hawkish, combined with tensions in the Middle East, has reduced demand for speculative investments across crypto markets.

The asset has experienced a 4–4.5% decline over the past 24 hours and is down roughly 9% over the last week, continuing a broader downward trend that has seen PI shed over 94% from its 2025 all-time high near $3. This persistent weakness stems primarily from a massive token unlock event in January 2026, which released around 134–142 million PI tokens into circulation—the largest monthly unlock of the year so far. The influx has significantly increased supply amid relatively subdued demand, pushing the price toward recent lows and testing key support levels around $0.16–$0.158. Short-Term Outlook: Pi Network Price Next Week (February 5–8, 2026) Price forecasts for PI are speculative, shaped by token release schedules, mainnet developments, community engagement, and overall crypto sentiment. Drawing from algorithmic models like CoinCodex and aggregated analyst views: Bearish Scenario (Prevailing Near-Term Consensus): Continued absorption of unlocked supply, combined with bearish technical indicators and a ""Fear"" reading on sentiment gauges, points to further downside risk. CoinCodex models project a potential dip to as low as $0.131–$0.135 by early February, representing a 20–25% drop from current levels if selling momentum persists. Other sources warn of tests near $0.13 or even lower if broader crypto sentiment weakens, with some extreme AI-driven hypotheticals floating sub-$0.10 in prolonged risk-off conditions. Neutral/Consolidation Case: If PI holds above critical supports and benefits from any stabilization in the wider market (e.g., Bitcoin maintaining strength above key levels), the token could consolidate in the $0.15–$0.18 range. This scenario assumes no major new catalysts but also no intensified panic selling, allowing the ecosystem to gradually digest recent unlocks. Binance and similar platforms show modest weekly stability around $0.17, supporting a sideways grind. Bullish Rebound Potential (Lower Probability Short-Term): A recovery toward $0.19–$0.22 would require positive triggers, such as accelerated mainnet utility growth, new app ecosystem milestones, or renewed exchange listings/hype. While some 2026 forecasts eye averages in the $0.20–$0.40 band mid-year (with optimistic targets up to $0.85+ in adoption-driven scenarios), near-term technicals and unlock overhang make a sharp bounce less likely without fresh momentum. Overall sentiment tilts bearish to neutral for the short term, driven by supply dynamics and cautious market conditions. Trading volume has remained moderate (around $13–14 million daily), reflecting limited conviction on either side. Additional unlocks are scheduled for February (around 98–130 million PI, depending on sources), which could extend pressure unless offset by rising real-world usage or demand.

In its statement, the betting platform said it will roll out a new feature that will allow all users in the US to use digital assets converted to cash to fund their online betting accounts. The statement was corroborated at a Massachusetts Gaming Commission (GMC) meeting this week. The meeting was headed by the Chief of the Division of Sports Wagering, Carrie Torrisi, who mentioned that DraftKings has been given the all clear to introduce the new deposit source in the four states over the coming weeks. Chair Jordan Maynard noted that the states involved would include Illinois, Kentucky, New Hampshire, and Vermont. DraftKings to enable new deposit feature in four states According to Torrisi, the state of Massachusetts, where DraftKings operates out of, would have been part of the new deposit rollout had the MGC not changed the rules to ban crypto converted to cash as a permissible funding source for sports betting accounts. The new rule took effect on December 19, 2025, after a review and staff recommendation. The restriction is the same as its credit card restrictions, banning crypto converted to cash and deposited in accounts in other jurisdictions. Although digital assets are not widely used in license, state-regulated sports betting in the United States, some states allow it. For instance, Wyoming permitted crypto as a wagering funding method in 2021, becoming an early adopter and one of the first to approve the funding source. In addition, Colorado and Virginia’s gaming regulators began allowing crypto conversions for deposits in 2022. DraftKings has yet to release any additional statement in this regard. Speaking about the new development, Kentucky Horse Racing & Gaming Corporation Director of Sports Wagering Hannah Simms mentioned that Kentucky’s sports wagering regulations have considered the use of digital assets. She added that sports wagers can be made using the different forms of payment approved by the commission, including cash equivalents converted to cash, which covers assets like digital, crypto, and virtual currencies. She added that KHRG staff worked with DraftKings to evaluate their proposal, which included product testing, review of vendors involved, and confirmation that it had undergone and passed the appropriate testing. Following that process, KHRG approved the method for use in Kentucky, noting that it satisfies the regulatory requirements of the state. The sentiment was echoed by Hannah Chauvin, the Director of Communications and Legal Affairs of the Vermont Department of Liquor and Lottery. States move to outlaw credit cards as a funding source In contrast, the Massachusetts regulators approved the request to grant DraftKings a temporary waiver to implement the technology and test the feature, which includes a method of separating crypto-source funds, but commissioners were still concerned at a December meeting. “We believe, basically, crypto is not ready for primetime,” said Caitlin Monahan, director of the MGC’s Investigations and Enforcement Bureau (IEB). Monahan mentioned that at this time, the commission does not think it is a funding source that is ready to be incorporated. She also cited concerns over the lack of regulations around the use of digital assets, as well as fears of money laundering. While she mentioned that no licensed sportsbook in the state accepted converted crypto to cash as a funding method, DraftKings Director Pete Harrington mentioned that it was only exploring converted crypto and not the assets directly. DraftKings is choosing to open up deposits to crypto conversion months after banning credit cards for sports wagering deposits. Several states have banned the use of credit cards for online sports betting, citing concerns over gambling issues and financial harms. They include Iowa, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Tennessee. The Illinois Gaming Board also recently approved a regulation to outlaw the use of credit cards for sports wagering funding.

Status",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2026/01/xyzverse-xyz-successfully-launches-on-mexc-confirming-its-goat-status,"On January 29, XYZVerse launched on MEXC, and it was explosive. The kind of debut people screenshot, refresh, and talk about hours later. The bold predictions were not just talk this time. They played out in real numbers. The price of $XYZ, initially offered at just $0.0001 during the earliest presale stage, surged dramatically after listing. Within hours, it briefly touched the $0.2 level, a moment many early supporters had talked about long before trading went live. In the first hours of trading alone, $XYZ jumped from $0.025 to a peak of $0.21, leaving no doubt that demand showed up fast and aggressively. XYZVerse Launch in Numbers: Launch price: $0.025 All-time high: $0.21 Growth: Over 8.4x in hours This was not a slow grind upward. It was a statement. And the community felt it. Social channels lit up. Holders described $XYZ as one of the strongest launches they have seen in recent months. Many are already looking ahead, expecting that additional exchange listings could push the project even further. What Fuels $XYZ Explosive Listing XYZVerse did not arrive on MEXC empty-handed. Long before the listing, the project had already raised over $16 million in its presale. That kind of capital does not come from impulse alone. It comes from sustained belief, stage after stage, backed by a growing audience. Then there is the community. XYZVerse does not feel like a typical token crowd. It feels closer to an esports fanbase. Competitive, vocal, and deeply engaged. Sports fans, gamers, and crypto users overlap here in a way that feels natural, not forced. Scarcity played its role too. Ahead of the listing, the team confirmed that twice as many tokens would be burned as originally planned. That decision reduced circulating supply right as trading began. Not later. Not eventually. Right at the moment it mattered most. A Live Product, Not a Promise What truly separates XYZVerse from countless other launches is this simple fact: the product is already live. XYZVerse is running the first on-chain Counter-Strike 2 League , and it is not a small experiment. The league features a combined prize pool of 500,000 USDT and 5,000,000 $XYZ, with 10 teams competing in structured matches. Fans are not just watching. They are participating. Through Access Passes, users can vote on maps, predict outcomes, and collect digital moments tied directly to live competition. All match data, votes, and rewards are recorded on-chain, making the experience transparent and verifiable. The expected reach exceeds one million viewers across streaming platforms. That is real visibility, real engagement, and real usage happening before and during the listing, not after. Here’s an expanded, high-energy yet readable continuation that fits naturally into the article and deepens the focus on utility and long-term plans without losing the emotional tone. What Comes Next: Utility That Feeds the Ecosystem The real story does not stop at the chart. It starts with how $XYZ is used once the excitement settles. The XYZ token sits at the center of the platform. Players use it to join matches. Fans use it to support teams, unlock in-game items, and access exclusive perks tied to live events. Every click, vote, and interaction flows through the system. More engagement means more transactions moving through the Revenue Router. Instead of hype-driven demand, $XYZ demand is created by gameplay itself. The more people play, watch, and participate, the more the token gets used. This is demand driven by behavior, not speculation. After the TGE, XYZVerse rolls out its Sustainability Initiative, a mechanism designed to support the ecosystem long after the launch excitement fades. Every few months, 10 percent of net profits generated by partner projects are allocated to buying back $XYZ directly from the open market. Don't miss out on the action—XYZVerse is just getting started. These buybacks help absorb selling pressure, reduce circulating supply over time, and create a stabilizing force in the market. Combined with ongoing token burns, the structure actively works to reward long-term holders who stay engaged with the ecosystem. XYZVerse is betting that when utility, transparency, and competitive energy come together, the ecosystem can grow without relying on constant hype. The launch proved the market was ready. The next phase is about proving it can last. Disclaimer: This content is intended solely for informational purposes.

New traffic data from Outset PR shows that more than 95% of all visits within the US crypto media ecosystem are now captured by Tier-1 publishers, leaving the remainder of the market competing for a sharply diminishing share of attention. This concentration intensified in the fourth quarter of 2025, as overall interest in crypto declined alongside falling asset prices. Yet the more revealing development is not the contraction itself, but how unevenly it played out — and what that says about where growth is now coming from. Contraction exposed structural strength, not weakness Total traffic to US crypto-native outlets fell by roughly a third quarter-on-quarter. Such swings are not unusual in a market where reader attention closely tracks price volatility. What was notable this time was the role of direct traffic, which accounted for about 44% of all visits despite the downturn. Publishers with a habitual readership — users who return intentionally rather than via search engines or social platforms — proved far more resilient. Those reliant on algorithmic discovery or social amplification saw traffic fall away rapidly once speculative momentum faded. The implication is that US crypto media has become brand-led rather than discovery-led. Distribution still matters, but loyalty now determines who absorbs shocks and who does not. Tier-1 dominance hardens Outset PR divided 82 US crypto-native publishers into traffic tiers. The result follows a classic power-law distribution: 53 Tier-1 outlets, each with more than 400,000 monthly visits, account for over 95% of total traffic. The remaining publishers — including what was once a viable middle tier — collectively command less than 5%. Measured using a Gini coefficient, attention within the sector is more concentrated than household income in the US economy. This reflects the compounding nature of algorithmic authority: scale reinforces visibility, which in turn reinforces scale. For most publishers, this has closed off realistic paths to upward mobility. The “middle class” of crypto media has largely disappeared, leaving a binary outcome: incumbents with entrenched reach, or smaller outlets that survive through specialization rather than breadth. Growth no longer comes from scale One of the more striking findings is the absence of legacy leaders from the growth rankings. Large, established brands continue to dominate absolute reach, but their size makes percentage growth difficult. Growth has instead shifted to smaller publishers pursuing structurally different models. CryptoDaily is a case in point. It ranked among the top growth performers in the quarter, despite operating at a far smaller scale than Tier-1 incumbents. Its performance was supported by a relatively balanced mix of direct and organic traffic, high engagement metrics, and early alignment with AI-mediated discovery. This does not imply a redistribution of influence. Scale still matters for agenda-setting and broad retail awareness. But it does suggest that relevance and reach are diverging metrics, and that momentum is increasingly captured outside the largest platforms. AI reshapes discovery, not readership Perhaps the most significant shift lies in how users arrive at content. AI-driven referrals now account for around a quarter of all referral traffic across US crypto media, with some outlets far more exposed than others. Publishers that invested in structured data, clear entity definition and machine-readable formatting have seen disproportionate gains. Others remain largely absent from AI interfaces. However, AI traffic behaves differently from traditional audiences. It is high-intent but low-commitment. Users arrive seeking specific answers and rarely stay long enough to form habits. AI expands visibility, but it does not build loyalty. For publishers, this creates a trade-off between discoverability and audience ownership. For crypto projects seeking coverage, it separates factual presence from narrative influence — two outcomes that increasingly travel through different channels. Social discovery remains concentrated Social traffic remains heavily skewed. X accounts for more than 70% of social referrals across US crypto media, reinforcing its role as the market’s real-time distribution layer. News breaks there first; attention follows. Other platforms play more specialised roles. Reddit supports deliberation and credibility, while YouTube favours longer-form analysis and education. These channels generate less volume but stronger engagement. Dependence on a single platform, however, concentrates risk. Algorithm changes or enforcement actions can quickly erase reach, a vulnerability that has become more visible as markets cool. Implications for publishers and founders The US crypto media market entering 2026 is more concentrated and more polarised than before. Scale, growth and influence no longer align. Publishers face a choice between defending entrenched reach or pursuing specialised relevance. Generic positioning is increasingly untenable. For Web3 founders and communications teams, the lesson is practical. Media outlets are no longer interchangeable distribution pipes. Tier-1 coverage remains essential for visibility, while smaller, fast-growing outlets serve more targeted functions tied to engagement or AI discovery. The underlying economics are becoming clearer. Attention is scarce, loyalty is harder to earn, and influence remains concentrated. Strategies built for a flatter media landscape risk misallocating effort in one that no longer exists.

57612759,https://cryptonews.com/?p=481479,1769857006,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/57612759.jpeg,Coinbase Insider Trading Lawsuit Advances Despite $2.9B Stock Sale Defense,https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-insider-trading-lawsuit-advances-despite-2-9b-stock-sale-defense/,"A Delaware judge ruled Friday that a shareholder lawsuit alleging insider trading by Coinbase directors can proceed, rejecting a special committee’s recommendation to dismiss the case despite its 10-month investigation clearing the defendants. The decision affects several high-profile directors, including venture capitalist Marc Andreessen and CEO Brian Armstrong, who collectively sold over $2.9 billion in stock during the company’s April 2021 direct listing. According to Bloomberg Law , Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick allowed the case to proceed due to conflicts involving one committee member, though she acknowledged the internal investigation “ paints a compelling narrative ” in support of the directors’ defense. The lawsuit , filed in 2023 by shareholder Adam Grabski, claims directors used confidential valuation information to avoid more than $1 billion in losses by selling shares when Coinbase went public without traditional lockup restrictions. Source: Court Filing Independence Concerns Undermine Internal Review The special litigation committee comprised two Coinbase board members: Kelly Kramer, former chief financial officer of Cisco Systems, and Gokul Rajaram, a Silicon Valley angel investor. Neither was named as a defendant nor sold shares in the direct listing. However, McCormick identified substantial business ties between Rajaram and Andreessen Horowitz as disqualifying conflicts of interest. According to court filings, interactions included a 2007 investment by Andreessen in a startup co-founded by Rajaram, and at least 50 financing rounds in which Rajaram or his venture firm participated alongside Andreessen Horowitz since 2019. “ No one—not plaintiff and thus not the court—questions Rajaram’s good faith, ” McCormick wrote. “ But the thick ties between him and the subject of the SLC’s investigation are sufficient to raise material disputes regarding his independence. “ Attorneys for the committee argued that the business interactions were “ immaterial ,” given the 700 total investments, and noted that there was no evidence of coordination in financing rounds. “ These are not close personal ties. These are professional ones, ” said Brad Sorrels, representing the committee, during an October hearing. Direct Listing Structure Enabled Immediate Sales The shareholder complaint centers on Coinbase’s unconventional path to public markets through a direct listing rather than a traditional IPO. Source: Court Filing This structure allowed existing shareholders to sell immediately without the lockup periods typically imposed by underwriters to prevent insider trading on material nonpublic information. Armstrong sold $291.8 million in shares, according to the complaint, while Andreessen Horowitz divested $118.7 million through the direct listing. Other defendants included Chief Operating Officer Emilie Choi, who sold $224 million, and co-founder Fred Ehrsam, who sold $219.5 million. The lawsuit alleges that directors knew the shares were overvalued, based on an internal Andersen Tax valuation that was substantially below market expectations when trading began at $381 per share. Within five weeks of the April 14, 2021 listing, Coinbase shares declined by more than 37% as the company disclosed fee compression affecting retail revenues and announced a dilutive convertible note offering. By May 18, 2021, the stock had wiped out just over $37 billion in value, according to the complaint. Company Disputes Claims Amid Delaware Criticism “ We are disappointed by the court’s decision and remain committed to fighting these meritless claims in court, ” Coinbase said in a statement. The committee’s report concluded that the defendants didn’t rely on confidential information, noting that Coinbase stock is “ highly correlated ” with Bitcoin prices, making it impossible to prove insider trading allegations. The committee argued directors “ reluctantly ” sold stock to provide sufficient supply for the direct listing, divesting only small portions of their holdings. “ The evidence roundly showed that defendants, including the two biggest stockholders, didn’t want to sell because they were bullish about the company, ” Sorrels said during the October hearing. Armstrong and Andreessen Horowitz “ ultimately agreed to sell just over 1% of their respective shares only after the company and its banker pleaded with them to provide supply necessary for the direct listing to launch, ” according to committee filings. Andreessen Horowitz has publicly criticized Delaware’s business courts, announcing plans last July to reincorporate portfolio companies elsewhere due to perceived bias “ against founders and their boards. “ Coinbase has announced plans to leave Delaware and reincorporate in Texas, a move Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal described as a strategic decision to align with the company’s long-term vision for new product development and regulatory efficiency.“Toda… https://t.co/aELNKkSwDu — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 12, 2025 Coinbase announced its own reincorporation plans on November 12 , following similar moves by other major companies seeking to exit Delaware’s jurisdiction. Beyond civil litigation, Coinbase faced a similar, but criminal insider trading case in 2023, when former product manager Ishan Wahi received a two-year prison sentence for sharing confidential listing information with family members who profited from the advanced knowledge.

World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the politically-backed DeFi platform, charts a cautious long-term course amid regulatory uncertainty, while XYZVerse ($XYZ) just delivered one of the most explosive exchange listings seen in recent months. Here's what investors need to know about both projects as they shape the year ahead. World Liberty Financial: Navigating the Political DeFi Experiment World Liberty Financial has emerged as perhaps the most controversial project in DeFi, not because of its technology, but because of its backers. The platform's association with high-profile political figures positions it uniquely in a space where regulatory clarity remains the industry's biggest challenge. According to comprehensive analysis from Cryptona, WLFI's 2026 trajectory will largely depend on how quickly the platform can convert political capital into actual user adoption and regulatory advantages. WLFI's 2026 Price Outlook: Three Scenarios The token, which launched at a presale price of $0.015, faces three distinct paths through the remainder of 2026: Conservative Case ($0.012-$0.025): This scenario assumes disappointing platform adoption, regulatory headwinds, and early investor profit-taking dominating price action. The downside risk from presale price ranges from -20% to modest gains of +67%. Base Case ($0.025-$0.045): Steady growth with demonstrated protocol functionality and moderate DeFi sector performance could push WLFI to the $0.025-$0.045 range, representing +67% to +200% returns for presale participants. Bullish Case ($0.045-$0.075): Strong adoption metrics, favorable regulatory developments, and successful conversion of political connections into market share could drive WLFI toward the upper range of $0.045-$0.075, delivering +200% to +400% gains. The Tokenomics Challenge WLFI's token distribution reveals significant centralization that investors cannot ignore. Of the 100 billion total token supply, only 20% was made available through public sale. The remaining 80% sits with team members, advisors, and insiders—with 17.5% allocated specifically to team and advisors. This heavily insider-weighted structure creates both risks and potential stability mechanisms. On one hand, concentrated holdings could lead to significant selling pressure when vesting schedules unlock. On the other, insider interests align with long-term project success rather than quick exits. Competitive Position: The DeFi Giants Loom Large World Liberty Financial enters a market dominated by battle-tested protocols. Aave commands $8-15 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL). Compound, MakerDAO, and Uniswap have years of proven security and user trust. WLFI's path to relevance requires carving a distinct niche—likely focusing on regulatory-compliant DeFi services or bridging traditional finance users into crypto markets. The platform's key differentiators include unprecedented political backing for regulatory navigation, simplified interfaces targeting crypto newcomers, and integrated services offering lending, borrowing, and trading in one platform. Whether these advantages translate to market share remains 2026's defining question for WLFI. Critical Catalysts to Watch Several developments will determine whether WLFI achieves its upper-range price predictions: Positive triggers: Major exchange listings on Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken; growing TVL metrics demonstrating real adoption; strategic partnerships with traditional financial institutions; favorable regulatory clarity; and strong quarterly growth reports. Negative risks: Securities classification challenges; platform security breaches; failure to achieve user adoption targets; competitive pressure from established platforms; broader crypto market corrections; and political controversies affecting brand perception. As Cryptona's analysis notes, ""The ultimate outcome will depend on factors both within and beyond the project team's control."" XYZVerse Delivers on Bold Predictions with Explosive MEXC Debut While World Liberty Financial charts its measured course, XYZVerse just proved that when utility meets hype, the market responds decisively. On January 29, XYZVerse launched on MEXC, and it was explosive. The kind of debut people screenshot, refresh, and talk about hours later. The bold predictions were not just talk this time. They played out in real numbers. The price of $XYZ, initially offered at just $0.0001 during the earliest presale stage, surged dramatically after listing. Within hours, it briefly touched the $0.2 level, a moment many early supporters had talked about long before trading went live. In the first hours of trading alone, $XYZ jumped from $0.025 to a peak of $0.21, leaving no doubt that demand showed up fast and aggressively. XYZVerse Launch in Numbers: Launch price: $0.025 All-time high: $0.21 Growth: Over 8.4x in hours This was not a slow grind upward. It was a statement. And the community felt it. Social channels lit up. Holders described $XYZ as one of the strongest launches they have seen in recent months. Many are already looking ahead, expecting that additional exchange listings could push the project even further. What Fuels $XYZ's Explosive Listing XYZVerse did not arrive on MEXC empty-handed. Long before the listing, the project had already raised over $16 million in its presale. That kind of capital does not come from impulse alone. It comes from sustained belief, stage after stage, backed by a growing audience. Then there is the community. XYZVerse does not feel like a typical token crowd. It feels closer to an esports fanbase. Competitive, vocal, and deeply engaged. Sports fans, gamers, and crypto users overlap here in a way that feels natural, not forced. Scarcity played its role too. Ahead of the listing, the team confirmed that twice as many tokens would be burned as originally planned. That decision reduced circulating supply right as trading began. Not later. Not eventually. Right at the moment it mattered most. A Live Product, Not a Promise What truly separates XYZVerse from countless other launches is this simple fact: the product is already live. XYZVerse is running the first on-chain Counter-Strike 2 League , and it is not a small experiment. The league features a combined prize pool of 500,000 USDT and 5,000,000 $XYZ, with 10 teams competing in structured matches. Fans are not just watching. They are participating. Through Access Passes, users can vote on maps, predict outcomes, and collect digital moments tied directly to live competition. All match data, votes, and rewards are recorded on-chain, making the experience transparent and verifiable. The expected reach exceeds one million viewers across streaming platforms. That is real visibility, real engagement, and real usage happening before and during the listing, not after. What Comes Next: Utility That Feeds the Ecosystem The real story does not stop at the chart. It starts with how $XYZ is used once the excitement settles. The XYZ token sits at the center of the platform. Players use it to join matches. Fans use it to support teams, unlock in-game items, and access exclusive perks tied to live events. Every click, vote, and interaction flows through the system. More engagement means more transactions moving through the Revenue Router. Instead of hype-driven demand, $XYZ demand is created by gameplay itself. The more people play, watch, and participate, the more the token gets used. This is demand driven by behavior, not speculation. After the TGE, XYZVerse rolls out its Sustainability Initiative, a mechanism designed to support the ecosystem long after the launch excitement fades. Every few months, 10 percent of net profits generated by partner projects are allocated to buying back $XYZ directly from the open market. Don't miss out on the action—XYZVerse is just getting started. These buybacks help absorb selling pressure, reduce circulating supply over time, and create a stabilizing force in the market. Combined with ongoing token burns, the structure actively works to reward long-term holders who stay engaged with the ecosystem. XYZVerse is betting that when utility, transparency, and competitive energy come together, the ecosystem can grow without relying on constant hype. The launch proved the market was ready. The next phase is about proving it can last. Disclaimer: This content is intended solely for informational purposes and should not be considered financial, investment, legal, or tax advice.

57612818,660437,1769857239,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57612818.jpeg,Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio Currently Falling Faster Than Price — What’s Happening?,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sharpe-ratio-currently-falling-than-price/,"If there has been any doubt about the arrival of the bear market, the latest drop in the Bitcoin price to around $81,000 somewhat made it more believable. While different triggers, including geopolitical tensions, Microsoft’s earnings miss, and liquidation cascades, have been credited for this drop , the premier cryptocurrency seems to be struggling catch any break at the moment. Interestingly, the latest decline not only shattered the remains of the Bitcoin price bullish structure but also tilted the on-chain framework towards an even more bearish outlook. With both technical and on-chain data looking less optimistic, the bears appear to be winning the battle for dominance in the BTC market. This Metric Changes First, BTC Price Reacts Later: Crypto Founder In a January 30 post on the X platform, Alphractal’s founder and CEO, Joao Wedson, revealed that the Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio is declining at a rate faster than the BTC price. The relevant indicator here is the Sharpe Ratio, which assesses the risk-adjusted returns of a particular cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, in this case). This on-chain metric basically tracks the amount of profit an investment offers per unit of risk (considering risk is measured by volatility), with a high value signaling a higher risk-adjusted performance. Meanwhile, a negative Sharpe Ratio indicates that the returns being realized on an investment are not commensurate with the risk being taken. Wedson wrote in his post on X: Simply put: the market is taking more risk for less return. Indeed, the Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio slipped into the negative territory a few days into the new year. However, BTC’s price action still enjoyed an incredible run of form — running to as high as $97,000 — after this shift, placing less significance on the on-chain observation. What’s more interesting is that the Sharpe Ratio is falling and weakening at a pace faster than the Bitcoin price. Historically, this rate of decline has often coincided with extended periods of momentum loss and sideways price movement. In fact, Wedson concluded that the risk-adjusted metrics need to change before price can react positively. Bitcoin Price Could Fall To $65,500 If This Happens In a case where the premier cryptocurrency continues its downward spiral, Wedson has projected a target for the BTC price. In an older post on X, the Alphractal founder had revealed that the Bitcoin price cannot lose the $81,000 level under any circumstances. The on-chain expert stated that a capitulation phase similar to the one seen in 2022 could unfold if the market leader breaks below the $81,000 level. Based on the Fibonacci-Adjusted Market Mean Price, Wedson identified $65,500 as the next major support level. The $81,000 came under focus as the Bitcoin price approached this level during its decline on Thursday, January 29. As of this writing, though, BTC has recovered above the $83,000 mark, with the price still down by nearly 8% on the weekly timeframe.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-31 11:00:39

The lawsuit accuses Coinbase directors, among them Brian Armstrong, of using nonpublic information to sell $2.9 billion in stock at the 2021 debut , sp aring themselves over $1 billion in losses. It was initially filed in 2023. The complaint says Armstrong, Coinbase’s chief since its launch in 2012, unloaded $291.8 million in stock. This ruling by the judge comes despite an internal review clearing the executives. The plaintiffs say Andreessen sold $118.7 million in shares Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick permitted the lawsuit to proceed on Friday due to conflicts involving one of the committee members. But she also suggested the Coinbase directors might end up coming out ahead, citing the special committee’s report, which offers a compelling narrative in their favor. The lawsuit focuses on Coinbase’s decision to pursue a direct listing, rather than a conventional IPO , and names Armstrong, Andreessen, and several other executives. The company’s direct listing meant no new shares were issued, holdings weren’t diluted, and early investors weren’t barred from trading their stock. According to the complaint, Andreessen — a Coinbase board member since 2020 — sold $118.7 million in shares through his venture firm, Andreessen Horowitz, in connection with the direct listing. The shareholder’s legal team argues the directors relied on insider information to sell their holdings ahead of a downturn. Nonetheless, lawyers representing the directors argued that no insider trading occurred and that the plaintiff failed to link the sales to confidential information. On the judge’s Friday decision, Coinbase noted, “We are disappointed by the court’s decision and remain committed to fighting these meritless claims in court.” Judge McCormick had rejected a motion earlier made by Coinbase’s directors to toss out the case, ruling the plaintiff’s claims were plausible. The case was temporarily suspended while Coinbase’s special litigation committee investigated the claims. Kelly Kramer, Cisco’s former CFO, and Gokul Rajaram, a Silicon Valley angel investor, joined the committee; neither was involved in the case nor sold shares in the direct listing. After 10 months, the committee asked McCormick to dismiss the case, calling the accusations “deficient” and harmful to the company and its shareholders. The committee found that defendants hadn’t used inside information to sell shares, refuting the claims in the lawsuit. The close correlation between Coinbase stock and Bitcoin means the trades can’t be attributed to insider knowledge, the report said. Brad Sorrels, an attorney for the special litigation committee, “The evidence roundly showed that defendants, including the two biggest stockholders, didn’t want to sell because they were bullish about the company. There was really a push and struggle to get the stockholders to participate.” Andreessen’s firm wants to reincorporate outside Delaware Andreessen’s firm has openly criticized Delaware’s corporate courts, arguing that judges tend to side with management and against founders and their boards. In July, the firm’s legal team published a blog post outlining its intention to reincorporate outside Delaware and encouraging its portfolio companies to do the same. The decision mirrors Musk’s Tesla move from Texas, prompted by McCormick’s blocking of his record compensation package, which was later reinstated by the state supreme court in December. Earlier last year, Delaware lawmakers enacted corporate law reforms that made it more difficult for minority shareholders to sue leaders, in an effort to prevent businesses from fleeing the state.

The Russian-made EV has been under development and testing for quite a while, and the first preorders were accepted some three years ago. Atom sales to begin in April, maker Kama says Official sales of the Russian electric vehicle (EV) Atom will formally begin in April, according to a representative of the company that builds it. Speaking to reporters and quoted by TASS, the Commercial Director of Kama, Alexander Kostylev, announced: “We plan to open the sales season, officially in April.” Purchases for individual buyers will be exclusively completed online, and the ordered cars will be delivered to their homes, the executive added. Test drives and service maintenance will be provided by the manufacturer’s partners in major cities across the vast country. The network will be expanded over time, Kostylev pointed out. The first deliveries will be made to customers who placed preorders in the distant 2023, Kostylev emphasized. Car sharing platforms, taxi companies, and regional authorities will also be supplied to conduct pilot tests. Russia’s attempt at “a Tesla,” but cheaper than Chinese models The locally produced Atom will be selling cheaper than Chinese offerings in Russia, unveiled the brand’s Director of Government Relations, Anatoly Kiyashko. Speaking to local media, he elaborated: “We will announce the price to the public in February. For now, we can say that our car is cheaper than Chinese counterparts, but in its price range, it is certainly one of the mass-market luxury cars.” According to Atom’s website , the Russian EV can be pre-ordered for 3.9 million rubles, or a little over $51,000 at current exchange rates. However, when the government-provided discount is applied, the price should drop to 3 million rubles (less than $40,000), as previously reported. Kama to start Atom sales in April. Source: Atom Atom completes 800 km autonomous test drive The development of the Russian EV commenced in 2021, the news agency noted in its report, with the establishment of the company behind it in August of that year. Atom’s first functional prototype was presented in Moscow in May of 2023, almost three years before the launch of its sales planned for this spring. On Friday, Kiyashko also revealed that the electric car had made a test run between the capital city and Kazan, mostly in autonomous mode: “We had a test drive from Moscow to Kazan, and Atom completed 95% of the journey autonomously, meaning with the help of its driving assistants.” The main city of the Russian Republic of Tatarstan is the hometown of the Kama startup, where Atom is being developed and assembled. The upcoming market launch of the Russian EV was first announced by Russian Minister of Industry and Trade Anton Alikhanov earlier this month. Atom’s commercial premiere and successful trial followed in mid-January, when Russian President Vladimir Putin urged faster development of autonomous transportation. Russia is lagging behind leaders in this niche, the head of state admitted, despite stating he was impressed by some of the driverless prototypes demonstrated ahead of a meeting on the matter. The Russian Federation should rapidly transition from testing to large-scale introduction of autonomous systems, the master of the Kremlin insisted in his address to participants in the discussion. Russia has until now made fewer than 100 self-driving trucks but intends to bump output to almost 1,000 units by the end of 2028, as reported by Cryptopolitan. Putin made it clear he is convinced his nation will find its place in the global market for this type of vehicle, once it scales up production and exports.

In 2026, USDT and USDC are no longer just tools for trading or parking capital. They are widely used as interest-bearing assets that generate predictable returns. The challenge is not finding yield, but understanding where it actually comes from, which platforms are sustainable, and how much flexibility users give up in the process. This article explains how stablecoin passive income works today and highlights the most practical options, with a focus on transparent, flexible savings models like Clapp. Why Stablecoins Are Well-Suited for Passive Income Unlike BTC or ETH, stablecoins are in constant demand. They are used for trading, hedging, liquidity provision, and settlement across both centralized and decentralized markets. This demand creates a natural lending market, which is why stablecoin yields are consistently higher than yields on volatile assets. Stablecoin savings behave more like traditional interest accounts. Returns are steadier, drawdowns are less dramatic, and yields are easier to forecast. In 2026, this makes USDT and USDC the preferred assets for predictable passive income. How Stablecoin Interest Is Generated Stablecoin yield typically comes from one of three sources. Centralized platforms lend USDT and USDC to traders or institutional counterparties. DeFi protocols use them in overcollateralized lending or liquidity pools. Some platforms combine multiple conservative strategies to smooth returns over time. The key distinction is structure. Some products require lockups, tiered balances, or exposure to volatile strategies. Others prioritize liquidity and simplicity, offering lower but more predictable yields. Understanding this difference matters more than chasing headline APYs. Clapp Flexible Savings: Stablecoin Yield With Full Liquidity Clapp Flexible Savings account is designed around the idea that passive income should not limit access to funds. Users can earn interest on USDT and USDC with daily compounding, instant access, and no lockups. The APY is fixed and clearly displayed in the app. Clapp offers 5.2% APY on stablecoins , without tiers, loyalty requirements, or “up to” language. Interest begins accruing immediately after deposit and is credited daily, making growth easy to track. Liquidity is central to the product. Funds remain available at all times. Users can withdraw, convert, or move stablecoins without losing accrued interest or triggering penalties. This makes Clapp suitable not only for long-term savers, but also for users who actively manage liquidity between crypto and fiat. From an infrastructure standpoint, Clapp Finance operates as a registered VASP in the Czech Republic, under EU AML and compliance standards. Digital assets are secured via Fireblocks’ institutional-grade custody, addressing one of the main concerns users have when earning yield on stablecoins. Centralized Exchange Earn Programs Most major exchanges offer stablecoin earn products. These usually come in flexible and fixed-term variants. Flexible products allow withdrawals at any time, but rates fluctuate. Fixed-term deposits offer higher APYs, but funds are locked for a defined period. These programs are easy to access and integrated into trading accounts, but they often rely on variable rates and promotional incentives. For users who value clarity and consistency, this can make long-term planning difficult. DeFi Lending and Liquidity Protocols DeFi platforms such as Aave, Compound, and similar protocols allow users to lend USDT or USDC directly on-chain. Yields adjust dynamically based on utilization and demand. While this approach offers transparency and self-custody, it requires wallet management, gas fees, and acceptance of smart contract risk. Returns can be attractive, but they are less predictable and require more active oversight than centralized savings products. Choosing the Right Stablecoin Income Strategy In 2026, the main trade-off is no longer yield versus safety, but yield versus flexibility. Platforms that promise the highest returns usually restrict access, add complexity, or increase exposure to risk. More conservative products offer lower rates, but provide clarity, daily accrual, and constant liquidity. Clapp sits firmly in the latter category. It does not attempt to maximize yield at all costs. Instead, it offers a stable, understandable return that behaves like a true savings account, rather than a speculative instrument. Key Risks to Keep in Mind Even with stablecoins, passive income is not risk-free. Custodial risk exists on centralized platforms. Smart contract risk exists in DeFi. Stablecoins themselves carry issuer and peg risk. Reducing these risks comes down to transparency, regulation, and simplicity. Products that clearly explain how yield is generated and avoid unnecessary conditions are easier to evaluate and manage over time. FAQ: Earning Passive Income on USDT and USDC How do USDT and USDC generate interest?Interest is generated by lending stablecoins to borrowers, using them in collateralized strategies, or allocating them to liquidity markets. Platforms earn yield from this activity and share it with users. Why are stablecoin yields higher than BTC or ETH yields?Stablecoins are heavily used for trading, hedging, and settlement, which creates constant borrowing demand. BTC and ETH are more often held long term, resulting in lower lending demand and lower yields. Is stablecoin passive income risk-free?No. While stablecoins reduce price volatility, risks still exist. These include custodial risk on centralized platforms, smart contract risk in DeFi, and issuer or peg risk related to the stablecoin itself. What is the difference between flexible and fixed stablecoin savings?Flexible savings allow withdrawals at any time while continuing to earn interest. Fixed savings require locking funds for a set period in exchange for higher rates but reduced liquidity. Can I withdraw stablecoins without losing interest?With true flexible savings accounts like Clapp, yes. Withdrawals do not affect accrued interest, and there are no penalties or rate reductions for accessing your funds. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The decision was widely expected, with prediction markets assigning more than 99% odds to a pause. As a result, the immediate market reaction was muted. With the outcome already priced in, crypto assets saw limited volatility in the hours following the announcement. Still, by removing near-term uncertainty around monetary policy, the decision provided a more stable backdrop for risk assets. Bitcoin stabilizes as uncertainty fades Bitcoin, which had been consolidating ahead of the meeting, found support after the Fed’s announcement. The asset stabilized near $89,000, reclaiming its point of control (POC) — the price level with the highest recent trading volume — while holding above the lower boundary of its trading channel. This technical response suggests buyers were willing to step in once macro uncertainty eased, even in the absence of fresh liquidity support from a rate cut. Sentiment improves modestly, remains cautious Despite Bitcoin’s stabilization, broader sentiment indicators point to caution rather than a full risk-on shift. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index remained low at 37, reflecting subdued confidence among market participants. Total crypto market capitalization rose roughly 1% to $3.03 trillion, indicating modest inflows rather than aggressive positioning. The mixed reaction highlights the balance markets are currently navigating: unchanged rates remove downside risk from tighter policy, but do not provide the stimulus typically associated with easing. Attention, timing, and market narratives Macro decisions like Fed meetings often influence markets not only through policy outcomes, but through how narratives around risk and liquidity take shape in the hours that follow. Outset PR , a crypto communications agency, applies a data-driven methodology that tracks media trendlines, traffic distribution, and real-time market engagement to assess when narratives are most likely to gain relevance. Using its proprietary Outset Data Pulse system, Outset PR analyzes how macro signals are absorbed across digital channels, helping identify when sentiment is stabilizing and when participants are prepared to re-engage. A key component of this workflow is the firm’s Syndication Map, which identifies publications that drive the strongest downstream visibility across major crypto aggregators such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square. In periods like the current one — where policy clarity replaces uncertainty — this alignment between timing, narrative, and market structure can shape short-term price behavior. Short-term relief, not a trend shift From a macro perspective, the Fed’s January decision offers short-term relief for crypto markets. While it does not inject new liquidity, the absence of a hawkish surprise reduces pressure on risk assets and allows Bitcoin to stabilize after consolidation. Whether this develops into a sustained move higher will depend on upcoming inflation data, economic indicators, and future Fed guidance. For now, crypto markets have gained clarity — but not yet a decisive catalyst. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The attacker generated a poison address with the same first and last 4 characters as Galaxy Digital's deposit address… pic.twitter.com/oXI3exESzE — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 31, 2026 This repeated behavior appears to have been exploited by an attacker who generated a malicious address designed to closely resemble Galaxy Digital’s legitimate deposit address, matching the same opening and closing characters. Transaction history indicates the attacker repeatedly sent small-value transfers to the victim’s wallet over time. To this end, the dust transactions caused the poisoned address to appear alongside legitimate destinations in the wallet’s recent activity, increasing the likelihood of confusion during future transfers. Approximately 11 hours before the loss was detected, the trader initiated another Ethereum transfer intended for Galaxy Digital. Failure to verify address Instead of manually verifying the destination, the address was copied directly from the transaction history. As a result, 4,556 ETH, valued at around $12.4 million at the time of the transaction, was sent to the attacker-controlled wallet. Notably, the transfer was executed in a single outbound transaction, with the funds leaving the victim’s wallet immediately and no subsequent corrective transactions recorded. The poisoned address successfully received the Ethereum, and there has been no indication of recovery efforts or fund reversal, consistent with the irreversible nature of blockchain settlements. Overall, the incident highlights the growing prevalence of address-poisoning attacks, where malicious actors exploit visual similarities in wallet addresses rather than vulnerabilities in smart contracts or protocols. Such attacks rely on user error rather than technical exploits, making even experienced traders vulnerable when handling high-value transfers.

This comprehensive analysis examines the fundamental factors driving MYX Finance’s development, market positioning, and long-term viability within the rapidly expanding DeFi derivatives sector. MYX Finance Price Prediction: Understanding the Protocol Fundamentals MYX Finance represents a decentralized perpetual futures protocol operating on multiple blockchain networks. The platform utilizes an innovative zero-slippage trading mechanism called MPMM (Market Maker Profit Mode), which fundamentally differs from traditional AMM models. This technical architecture enables traders to execute positions with minimal price impact, particularly beneficial for larger orders that typically face significant slippage on conventional decentralized exchanges. Furthermore, the protocol incorporates a unique risk management system that segregates trader positions from liquidity provider funds. This structural separation potentially enhances platform stability during volatile market conditions. The MYX token serves multiple functions within this ecosystem, including governance rights, fee discounts, and staking rewards for liquidity providers. These utility aspects directly influence token valuation models and long-term price projections. Decentralized Futures Market Context and Competitive Landscape The decentralized perpetual futures market has experienced exponential growth since 2023, with total value locked across leading protocols surpassing $15 billion by early 2025 according to DeFiLlama data. This expansion reflects increasing institutional and retail adoption of decentralized derivatives as viable alternatives to centralized exchanges. Within this competitive landscape, MYX Finance positions itself through several distinctive features. Firstly, the protocol’s cross-chain compatibility enables access to liquidity across multiple blockchain ecosystems. Secondly, its fee structure typically ranges between 0.02% to 0.05% for makers and takers, representing competitive pricing within the sector. Thirdly, the platform supports leverage up to 100x on certain trading pairs, though this varies based on asset volatility and liquidity conditions. These competitive elements directly influence adoption metrics, which subsequently impact price prediction models for the MYX token through 2030. Technical Analysis and Historical Performance Patterns Since its mainnet launch in late 2023, MYX Finance has demonstrated specific technical patterns that inform future price projections. The token initially experienced typical volatility associated with new protocol launches, followed by stabilization periods correlated with platform development milestones. Historical data reveals that MYX price movements frequently correlate with broader DeFi sector performance, though with amplified sensitivity to derivatives-specific developments. Technical indicators suggest that MYX maintains stronger correlation with trading volume metrics than with general cryptocurrency market movements. This relationship indicates that protocol-specific adoption fundamentally drives valuation more than broader market sentiment alone. Analysis of on-chain data reveals that active address growth, transaction volume, and liquidity pool expansion serve as more reliable price predictors than traditional technical analysis patterns for this particular asset class. Market Adoption Metrics and Growth Projections Quantitative analysis of MYX Finance adoption reveals several key metrics influencing price predictions. The protocol’s total value locked has demonstrated consistent quarterly growth averaging 35% since inception, though from a relatively modest base compared to established competitors. Daily trading volume patterns show increasing institutional participation, with average trade size growing approximately 200% between 2024 and early 2025. Geographic distribution data indicates strongest adoption in Asian markets, particularly South Korea and Singapore, where regulatory clarity around decentralized derivatives has improved significantly. European and North American adoption remains more gradual but shows accelerating institutional interest. These regional adoption patterns influence liquidity distribution and consequently impact price discovery mechanisms across different trading venues and time zones. Regulatory Environment and Compliance Considerations The regulatory landscape for decentralized derivatives continues evolving through 2025, with significant implications for MYX Finance’s growth trajectory. Recent guidance from international regulatory bodies suggests increasing focus on decentralized protocol governance, particularly regarding risk disclosure and investor protection mechanisms. MYX Finance’s compliance architecture incorporates several forward-looking features. These include transparent risk parameter disclosures, circuit breaker mechanisms during extreme volatility, and graduated position limits based on account verification levels. The protocol’s decentralized governance model enables rapid adaptation to regulatory developments through community voting mechanisms. These compliance considerations directly influence institutional adoption rates, which substantially impact long-term price projections through 2030. Economic Model Analysis and Token Utility Evolution MYX Finance employs a sophisticated token economic model that balances multiple stakeholder interests. The MYX token serves three primary functions: governance participation, fee reduction mechanisms, and staking rewards. Governance rights enable token holders to vote on protocol parameters including fee structures, supported assets, and risk management settings. Fee reduction mechanisms provide active traders with discounted trading fees proportional to their MYX holdings and staking duration. Staking rewards distribute a portion of protocol fees to liquidity providers who stake MYX tokens in designated pools. This economic model creates multiple demand vectors for the token, each influencing price through different mechanisms and time horizons. Institutional Integration and Partnership Developments Through 2024 and early 2025, MYX Finance has established several strategic partnerships that enhance its ecosystem viability. Integration with major blockchain infrastructure providers improves cross-chain interoperability and reduces transaction costs. Collaboration with institutional custody solutions enables larger participants to engage with the protocol while maintaining security standards. Additionally, partnerships with data analytics platforms improve transparency and risk assessment capabilities for all participants. These institutional developments typically precede increased adoption and liquidity, which historically correlate with price appreciation periods for protocol tokens in the DeFi derivatives sector. Risk Assessment and Volatility Considerations Comprehensive price prediction analysis must incorporate multiple risk factors specific to MYX Finance and the broader decentralized derivatives sector. Smart contract risk remains a primary concern, though the protocol has undergone multiple independent audits since inception. Liquidity fragmentation across multiple blockchain networks presents operational challenges that could impact user experience during periods of network congestion. Competitive pressure from both established decentralized protocols and emerging centralized alternatives with decentralized features creates continuous innovation requirements. Regulatory uncertainty in key markets represents an ongoing consideration for growth projections. These risk factors necessitate conservative assumptions in long-term price modeling, particularly for projections extending through 2030. Technological Roadmap and Development Trajectory MYX Finance’s published development roadmap through 2026 includes several technological enhancements with potential price implications. Planned integration with additional blockchain networks aims to expand accessible liquidity pools and user bases. Proposed upgrades to the MPMM mechanism seek to improve capital efficiency for liquidity providers while maintaining competitive trading conditions. Development of institutional-grade risk management tools and reporting interfaces targets increased professional adoption. Implementation of cross-margin capabilities and portfolio margin systems would represent significant competitive advantages if successfully deployed. These technological developments typically influence price through adoption metrics rather than direct token mechanics. Comparative Analysis with Competing Protocols Positioning MYX Finance within the competitive decentralized derivatives landscape provides context for its growth potential. Compared to established protocols like dYdX and GMX, MYX differentiates through its unique market maker mechanism and cross-chain architecture. However, these competitors benefit from significantly larger liquidity pools and established user communities. Emerging protocols with similar technical approaches present both competitive pressure and validation of the underlying market maker model. Market share analysis suggests that the decentralized derivatives sector remains sufficiently underpenetrated relative to centralized alternatives to support multiple successful protocols through 2030, provided they maintain distinctive value propositions and execution excellence. Conclusion MYX Finance represents a technically sophisticated entry in the rapidly evolving decentralized perpetual futures market. Price predictions through 2026-2030 must account for multiple interrelated factors including protocol adoption rates, competitive developments, regulatory evolution, and broader cryptocurrency market conditions. While the protocol demonstrates innovative approaches to decentralized derivatives trading, its long-term success depends on continued technological execution, ecosystem expansion, and adaptive response to market dynamics. The MYX Finance price prediction landscape reflects both the significant opportunities in decentralized derivatives and the substantial risks inherent in emerging DeFi protocols navigating complex technological and regulatory environments. FAQs Q1: What fundamental factors most influence MYX Finance price predictions? The primary factors include protocol adoption metrics, trading volume growth, liquidity pool expansion, competitive positioning, regulatory developments, and broader DeFi sector performance. Technological execution and partnership developments also significantly impact long-term projections. Q2: How does MYX Finance differ from other decentralized perpetual futures protocols? MYX Finance utilizes a unique Market Maker Profit Mode mechanism that aims to eliminate slippage for traders. The protocol also emphasizes cross-chain compatibility and implements a segregated risk management system that separates trader positions from liquidity provider funds. Q3: What are the main utility functions of the MYX token? The MYX token provides governance rights for protocol parameter decisions, enables fee discounts for active traders, and generates staking rewards for liquidity providers who participate in designated pools within the ecosystem. Q4: What regulatory considerations affect MYX Finance’s growth potential? Key regulatory factors include evolving guidelines for decentralized derivatives, compliance requirements across different jurisdictions, investor protection standards, and the protocol’s ability to adapt governance and risk management systems to meet regulatory expectations. Q5: How do institutional adoption patterns influence MYX price projections? Institutional adoption typically increases liquidity, reduces volatility, and enhances protocol credibility. These factors generally support more stable price appreciation over longer time horizons, though institutional participation also introduces different risk management requirements and compliance considerations.

The RAMP platform serves as a hacking forum and caters to several groups involved in Ransomware-as-a-Service and other cybercriminals. While the FBI has yet to issue an official statement to that effect, the domains used by the forum now display banners that read “The Federal Bureau of Investigation has seized RAMP.” The banners noted that the action was carried out by the FBI in coordination with the US Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of Florida and the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section of the Department of Justice. FBI takes down underground hacking forum RAMP, which originally stood for Russian Anonymous Marketplace, was a popular dark web forum that primarily served Russian-speaking clients engaged in cybercrime. They include RaaS gangs and initial access brokers. The takedown was also confirmed by a user named “Stallman”, who appears to be one of the owners of RAMP, the XSS hacking forum post translated from Russian and shared on the blogging platform X. “With regret, I inform you that law enforcement agencies have gained control over the Ramp forum. This event destroyed years of my work to create the freest forum in the world, and although I hoped this day would never come, deep down I always understood that it was possible. This is the risk we all take,” the post reads. He also added that even though he will no longer be controlling Ramp, he doesn’t intend to create another platform from scratch. Stallman also added that he will continue his business of purchasing access, noting that his core business remains unchanged. “If you have something you can offer me, the terms are listed in my signature. Message me in private messages, and we will exchange via Jabber/Tox,” he added. In addition to offering a forum for ransomware activities, the place was a platform for notorious groups like LockBit, Qilin, RansomHub, ALPHV/BlackCat, and DragonForce to promote their services. The website also included several discussion groups where users posted tutorials on cyberattacks. Speaking about the takedown, Ben Clarke, SOC manager at CybaVerse, said the platform’s success stemmed from providing hackers with the entire attacker chain. This means users can access services ranging from purchasing stolen credentials to promoting malware and selling and purchasing other services. How effective are these takedowns? Clarke mentioned that while the takedown will affect criminal activity for a while, the long-term impact could be minimal. “Anything to disrupt this activity is a positive step for defenders. But we would be naive to believe it will have a tangible impact on cybercrime,” he said. “New marketplaces will be formed to take RAMP’s place, while threat actors will navigate to other platforms to buy and sell services.” Over the last few years, law enforcement has registered mixed results in takedowns. While the takedowns do happen, these platforms are often revived, as in the case of the Emotet botnet takedown in 2022. The platform returned with a vengeance. However, this doesn’t mean that these operations do not work, according to Daniel Wilcock, threat analyst at Talion, noting that takedowns are still the best tactic for law enforcement to stifle cybercriminal activities and gain vital information. “While this doesn’t signal the end of ransomware, law enforcement will be able to gain valuable information from the seizure around the threat actors using the services, such as their emails and IP addresses, plus access to the financial transactions that took place on the market,” he said. “This could support further law enforcement action against the threat actors that used the site, but given that RAMP was heavily used by Russian criminals, it’s highly unlikely we will see many actual arrests.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",News|FBI|RAMP,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-31 11:16:03

Traditional banks offer safety and familiarity, but interest rates often lag inflation and come with restrictions, delays, or complex conditions. In 2026, this gap has become more visible than ever. A new generation of savings products now offers an alternative: euro-denominated accounts with competitive yields, daily compounding, and full liquidity. One of the clearest examples of this model is Clapp EUR Flexible Savings , which provides a fixed 5.2% APY on EUR with instant access and no lockups. This article explains how EUR savings accounts work today, why flexibility matters, and how Clapp delivers a more functional approach to earning interest on euros. How Modern EUR Savings Accounts Work Modern EUR savings accounts are designed to behave more like flexible financial tools than fixed-term deposits. Instead of locking funds away, they allow users to earn interest continuously while keeping their balance fully accessible. Interest is calculated daily and compounds automatically. Funds can be deposited or withdrawn at any time, and the rate is clearly defined rather than tied to temporary promotions or account tiers. The goal is simple: predictable yield without sacrificing access. This model mirrors what users already expect from modern crypto savings products, but applied to a familiar fiat currency. Clapp EUR Flexible Savings: Fixed APY Without Lockups Clapp offers a EUR savings account built around transparency and flexibility. With Clapp EUR Flexible Savings, users earn a fixed 5.2% APY on their euro balance. Interest is calculated and credited daily, allowing returns to compound smoothly over time. There are no lockups. Funds remain fully liquid, and users can withdraw or move their EUR at any moment without penalties or loss of accrued interest. The APY displayed in the app is the actual rate earned, with no tiers, caps, or conditional bonuses. Deposits are straightforward. EUR can be added via SEPA Instant, meaning funds begin earning interest almost immediately. This removes much of the friction typically associated with moving money between traditional bank accounts and higher-yield savings options. Security and Regulatory Context Clapp Finance operates as a registered Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) in the Czech Republic and follows EU AML and compliance standards. While the product is designed for ease of use, infrastructure and custody are treated with institutional-level seriousness. For users evaluating alternatives to traditional banks, regulatory clarity and operational transparency are essential. EUR savings products only make sense if access and security are treated as first-order priorities. Who Clapp’s EUR Savings Is Designed For Clapp’s EUR Flexible Savings suits users who want to earn a competitive return on euros without giving up access or navigating complex financial products. It is particularly relevant for individuals who move between fiat and digital assets, but it also works as a standalone euro savings solution. Rather than chasing short-term promotions or locking funds into fixed-term deposits, users get a stable rate, daily compounding , and full control over their balance. Final Thoughts EUR savers in 2026 no longer have to choose between low yields and restricted access. Flexible savings accounts now offer a middle ground: predictable returns with full liquidity. Clapp’s EUR Flexible Savings demonstrates how this model can work in practice. A fixed 5.2% APY, compound growth, instant access via SEPA Instant, and no lockups create a savings experience that feels modern, transparent, and practical. For anyone looking to earn more on euro deposits without sacrificing control, this approach sets a new standard for EUR savings accounts.

The latest session brought a small gain of about 0.3%, but the overall trend is still weak. Price action remains stuck in a downward channel that has been in place since November, so the short-term outlook is still negative. Right now, Bitcoin’s market cap is about $1.65 trillion, and 24-hour trading volume is around $50 billion, which is much lower than recent peaks, dropping nearly 40%. This drop in activity shows that traders are being careful instead of rushing to buy the dip, which is important as Bitcoin tests key technical levels. Sellers Control Rallies Below Key Moving Averages Looking at the charts, sellers still have the upper hand. Every recent bounce has stopped below the 50-day and 100-day EMAs, which are both moving lower. These averages now act as resistance and help keep prices inside the downward channel. Candlestick behavior adds to this picture. The market has printed a series of long red candles, followed by smaller-bodied sessions with lower closes. This pattern points to distribution, not capitulation. Buyers are present, but they are hesitant, stepping in only after declines rather than driving impulsive rebounds. Momentum indicators also show weak confidence. The RSI is in the low 40s, near oversold levels but without signs of a bullish reversal. This usually means demand is weak, not that sellers are finished, so prices could still move lower. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Analysis: $80.5K or $76.4K Next? Bitcoin price prediction seems bearish as BTC has already dropped below the $86,400 support area, which was important during December’s consolidation. Now, the focus is on $80,500, which lines up with earlier lows and the lower part of the downward channel. Bitcoin Price Chart Source: Tradingview If $80,500 does not hold by the end of the day, the channel suggests prices could fall further to $76,400. Based on typical price projections, Bitcoin could slowly move down to this area as leverage drops and volatility stays low. Still, this area also represents a potential base-building zone. As long as BTC stabilizes within the $80,000–$76,000 range, the risk of forced liquidations diminishes, setting the stage for a more constructive reset later in the cycle. Levels traders are watching closely: Resistance: $86,400 → $90,400 (trend shift trigger) Support: $80,500 → $76,400 (channel target) What Would Signal a Trend Shift? For now, patience remains the dominant strategy. A sustained recovery would require more than a short squeeze. The first meaningful signal would be a daily close above $90,400, reclaiming broken structure and flipping short-term momentum. That could open a recovery path toward $98,000, followed by $102,000 if volume expands. Until then, Bitcoin is still in a correction. The main fundamentals like scarcity, network security, and long-term institutional interest are still strong, but recent price moves show the market is dealing with bigger economic pressures and reducing excess leverage. In summary, Bitcoin’s drop to $83,000K has not changed the long-term outlook, but the upward channel suggests the correction could continue. What happens around $80,500wills likelydecidne the nextbig move. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the BTC ecosystem.

On Thursday, January 29, the flagship cryptocurrency fell to a multi-month low of around $81,500, with the general market sentiment worsening over the past few weeks. Going into the weekend, the price of Bitcoin has somewhat cooled off, recovering above the $93,000 level on Friday, January 30. Interestingly, the latest on-chain data suggests that the market leader is only on the verge of another violent price movement. BTC Setting Up For A Violent Liquidation Cascade In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, CryptoOnchain shared insights into the current on-chain condition of the Bitcoin price. According to the market quant, the Bitcoin Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR) witnessed a notable upswing on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, while price was undergoing its most recent correction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Needs Deeper Liquidity Before A Real Recovery Takes Shape: Analysts For context, the Estimated Leverage Ratio is an on-chain metric that tracks the ratio between open interest and the reserve of an exchange (Binance, in this case). This metric measures the average amount of leverage used by the traders in a particular market or exchange. A higher ELR signals a higher market risk, suggesting that small price movements could lead to significant liquidations. According to data from CryptoQuant, CryptoOnchain highlighted that the Bitcoin Estimated Leverage Ratio recently spiked to a critical level of 0.188 when the price fell to around $81,500, indicating that the Open Interest is exceptionally high relative to the exchange’s reserves. Furthermore, CryptoOnchain shared that the divergence between rising leverage and falling prices is a classic “bearish divergence” signal in the derivative market. “It indicates that despite the price weakness, traders are aggressively increasing their leverage positions,” the on-chain expert added. What’s more, CryptoOnchain revealed that when the market becomes heavily over-leveraged during a price correction, it implies that the traders are either “buying the dip” with high leverage or increasingly taking short positions. The market quant said this setup usually precedes a “violent liquidation cascade.” Overall, CryptoOnchain concluded that the market is currently in a high-tension zone, with the combination of peak leverage and low prices suggesting that a “squeeze” is imminent. The analyst, however, clarified that the direction of the next violent movement depends on the dominant side (bulls or bears) of the market. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $84,200, reflecting a nearly 1% jump in the past 24 hours.

His comments, made public on April 15, 2025, follow a historic precious metals sell-off that erased an estimated $15 trillion in global market value. Consequently, this perspective challenges conventional narratives about asset maturity and volatility. Changpeng Zhao Contextualizes Crypto’s Early Stage Changpeng Zhao, commonly known as CZ, founded Binance in 2017. Subsequently, he built it into one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Therefore, his views carry significant weight in financial technology circles. Recently, he addressed a sharp decline in traditional safe-haven assets. Specifically, gold prices fell approximately 15% from their peak. Meanwhile, silver experienced a more severe drop of up to 38%. Zhao argued that such volatility in ancient stores of value underscores a critical point. Essentially, emerging technologies like Bitcoin should expect similar or greater price fluctuations. “Bitcoin is a 17-year-old technology,” Zhao noted. “For most of its existence, it operated in a suppressed regulatory environment. Conversely, gold and silver have millennia of history. Their recent decline shows that even established assets face volatility.” This comparison provides a crucial framework for investors. It suggests that market cycles for digital assets may normalize over decades, not years. Analyzing the Precious Metals Market Downturn The backdrop for Zhao’s statement involves a significant macroeconomic shift. In early 2025, several central banks announced coordinated reductions in their gold reserves. Simultaneously, industrial demand for silver slowed. These factors triggered a rapid repricing. The table below summarizes the key data from the sell-off: Asset Peak Price (2024) Low Point (2025) Approximate Decline Market Cap Impact Gold $2,450/oz $2,080/oz ~15% ~$3 Trillion Silver $38/oz $23.50/oz ~38% ~$12 Trillion Combined ~$15 Trillion This event delivered a powerful reminder. All markets, regardless of their age, can experience severe corrections. Moreover, it highlights three core principles of asset valuation: Liquidity Shocks: Large-scale selling can overwhelm even the deepest markets. Sentiment Shifts: Investor perception can change rapidly based on new data. Macroeconomic Dependence: No asset class exists in a vacuum. The Historical Timeline of Store-of-Value Assets Placing Zhao’s comments in a broader timeline reveals a compelling narrative. Gold’s use as money dates back over 5,000 years. The first silver coins appeared around 600 BCE. Fiat currency systems, by comparison, became dominant only in the 20th century. Bitcoin’s genesis block mined in 2009 represents a mere blip on this historical scale. Financial historian Dr. Elena Marquez, author of “The Evolution of Value,” corroborates this view. “We assess technological adoption in generations, not business quarters,” Marquez stated in a 2024 journal article. “The internet required 25 years to reach 50% global penetration. Distributed ledger technology is on a similar, if not faster, trajectory.” Understanding Volatility in Emerging Asset Classes Volatility often decreases as an asset class matures. This process involves several developmental phases. First, infrastructure like regulated exchanges and custodial services must solidify. Second, clear legal and tax frameworks need establishment. Finally, broad institutional adoption must occur. Cryptocurrency, according to analysts, remains in the infrastructure-building phase. A 2024 report from the Global Digital Finance Initiative outlined key maturity metrics. Currently, the sector scores high on innovation but lower on stability and integration. Zhao’s analogy serves an educational purpose. It encourages investors to adopt a long-term perspective. Frequent, high-magnitude price swings are typical for nascent technologies. For instance, the Nasdaq Composite experienced extreme volatility during the dot-com era. It then stabilized as the tech sector matured. Bitcoin and other digital assets may follow a similar path. Their underlying blockchain technology continues to develop rapidly. However, market pricing mechanisms are still catching up. Regulatory Evolution and Market Suppression Zhao referenced a “suppressed environment” for Bitcoin’s early years. Indeed, regulatory uncertainty characterized much of the past decade. Many governments initially banned or restricted cryptocurrency trading. Others issued stern warnings to investors. This regulatory friction arguably limited mainstream participation. It also concentrated early ownership among risk-tolerant individuals. The landscape is now shifting. Major economies are implementing comprehensive crypto frameworks. For example, the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation took full effect in 2024. Such developments reduce suppression and could lead to more stable growth. Conclusion Changpeng Zhao’s comparison between precious metals and cryptocurrency provides a vital long-view lens. The recent $15 trillion downturn in gold and silver demonstrates that no asset is immune to volatility. Bitcoin, at just 17 years old, operates within a market still defining its parameters. Consequently, the entire digital asset industry remains in its early stage. Investors and observers should therefore evaluate progress across technological, regulatory, and adoption timelines. The journey toward maturity is a marathon, not a sprint. FAQs Q1: What did Changpeng Zhao say about gold, silver, and crypto? Changpeng Zhao commented that the sharp decline in gold and silver prices shows that even ancient, physical assets experience high volatility. He used this to argue that Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, being much younger technologies, are still in their early stages of development and market maturation. Q2: How much did gold and silver prices fall in the 2025 sell-off? According to market data referenced in Zhao’s remarks, gold fell approximately 15% from its all-time high, while silver experienced a more severe decline of up to 38%. This combined downturn wiped out an estimated $15 trillion in global market capitalization. Q3: Why does Zhao believe the crypto industry is still early? Zhao bases this belief on Bitcoin’s age as a 17-year-old technology that faced a suppressed regulatory environment for most of its existence. He contrasts this with gold and silver, which have thousands of years of history as stores of value, yet still exhibit significant price volatility. Q4: What is the significance of comparing crypto to precious metals? The comparison helps normalize the volatility seen in cryptocurrency markets. It suggests that price swings are a common feature of all asset classes during their development and that crypto’s youth means its market cycles are still evolving toward greater stability. Q5: How does regulatory history affect cryptocurrency’s development? Zhao noted that Bitcoin developed under a “suppressed environment” with significant regulatory uncertainty and restrictions. This historical context limited early adoption and contributed to its volatile price discovery. Current global regulatory frameworks are now being built, which is a sign of the industry progressing beyond its earliest phase.

Jupiter, a Solana-based decentralized crypto exchange aggregator, has shocked the community by raising security concerns about wallet seed phrases. The DEX launched its ASR rewards for Q4 stakers, requiring users to export their seed phrases into the Jupiter wallet to claim rewards on mobile and desktop. The requirement has sparked widespread concern as community members push back against the rule, citing serious safety issues with submitting seed phrases. Jupiter Exchange raises safety wallet concerns for Web3 users 🚨New: Community backlash has emerged after @JupiterExchange launched its ASR rewards for Q4 stakers, requiring users to import their seed phrase into the Jupiter wallet to claim via mobile or desktop. Some users said forcing seed phrase exports for small rewards is unsafe,… pic.twitter.com/owxTFG2xOm — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) January 31, 2026 Jupiter defended the requirement, stating that the measure is necessary to ensure fair distribution of rewards and prevent manipulation. However, discussions centered on the potential for exploits and the burden on users and long-term holders, who are likely to lose everything if malicious actors gain access to their accounts. According to Solana Floor, the decentralized exchange responded to the criticism, saying it will roll out an alternative method in the coming few weeks that will allow users to claim their ASR rewards from other wallets. Jupiter has hosted an annual airdrop event, Jupuary, every January since 2024, as part of its in-house efforts to attract new users and retain existing ones. In 2024, the decentralized exchange distributed 1 billion JUP tokens, worth over $1 billion, to over 1 million crypto wallets. In 2025, the exchange hosted its second airdrop event, distributing 700 million tokens to loyal users and stakers. This year, the ecosystem planned an initial distribution of 200 million JUP tokens, with 170 million allocated to fee-paying users and 30 million to stakers. The DEX had also announced it would set aside 200 million JUP tokens as a bonus pool for holding and staking the airdrop throughout 2026. The move was intended to incentivize more community members to hold as many tokens as possible and to discourage selling pressure that typically follows an airdrop event. The exchange had also announced it had set aside 300 million JUP tokens for Jupnet incentives. The total token distribution event for the January 2026 ASR rewards amounted to 700 million tokens. The exchange had also announced that JUP stakers will be rewarded based on their time-weighted stake and emphasized that the eligibility window for fee-paying customers ended in January 2026. Jupiter revises the token airdrop supply from 700M to 200M tokens However, in November 2025, Cryptopolitan reported that Jupiter revised its Jupuary airdrop downwards, citing dilution concerns. The decision was reached through a vote by community members after what happened during the previous Jupuary event in 2025. The January 2025 event saw the ecosystem distribute JUP tokens to everyone, including new community members who had no intentions of being part of the community and its ecosystem in the long run. As a result, many of these new participants sold the token, causing JUP’s price to crash significantly. The new revision reserved 200 million tokens out of the planned 700 million for the January 2026 Jupuary event. The publication also noted that the airdrop’s eligibility will change in accordance with the project’s DAO. The new revision will allocate 25 million JUP tokens to staking participants, with the remaining 175 million reserved for users performing fee-paying activities in the Jupiter ecosystem. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Jupiter’s native crypto asset JUP ranks 74th among the largest cryptocurrencies, with a market capitalization of $648 million and a 24-hour trading volume of $57.22 million. The crypto asset is trading at $0.1994, down 90.24% since its all-time high of $2.04 achieved 2 years ago. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

The authors said that data centers are controversial and essential to the artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that support the digital economy. They claimed that the digital revolution can stop in the absence of a large number of data centers, limiting people’s, communities’, governments’, and corporations’ access to the advantages of digital technologies. Local opposition to data centers fuels growing AI techlash Experts noted that despite data centers’ vital role in the developing economy, financial, economic, and environmental issues have sparked demonstrations around the nation. In Ohio, Georgia, Virginia, Arizona, and Indiana, plans to construct data centers have been delayed due to concerns about rising electricity costs, light and noise pollution, and potential risks associated with AI. In 2024, U.S. data centers used around 183 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, which is roughly equal to Pakistan’s total yearly energy use, according to a Pew Research Center analysis published in October. According to the Brookings report, the data center expansion coincides with a growing “techlash” against the AI industry, which has sparked organized opposition and protests nationwide over concerns about automation’s potential to displace jobs, energy consumption, and environmental impacts. The report also revealed that voter concerns roiled recent elections in New Jersey, Virginia, and Georgia, where opposition to data centers was part of campaign promises. Against this backdrop, the experts warned that if these community concerns are not addressed, data center construction may slow. They also warned that AI growth may be delayed and AI revenue streams may be curtailed, all of which would limit the benefits of AI that tech companies and government leaders have promised. To avoid weakening AI growth and revenue streams, the experts urged AI companies to establish viable community benefit agreements (CBAs) to address public concerns. They suggested that these agreements should be developed cooperatively with host communities and be legally binding, showing reciprocity between data centre developers and the communities where they are located. In particular, the experts said communities must be aware of the cost of data centres, understand who is responsible for paying, assess local advantages and hazards, and have backup plans for the long-term development of AI. The Brookings report also revealed that communities across the U.S have begun to establish various types of community benefits agreements. For example, the report cited that Cleveland has employed CBAs for several economic development initiatives since 2013. The report noted it distinguishes between “standard” agreements, which cover corporate investments under $20 million, and “expanded” agreements, which cover more costly initiatives. Private data center expansion grows amid rising community resistance The Brookings report comes as the Trump administration supports expanding AI data centers nationwide and increasing demand for processing capacity. Trump launched Stargate, a $500 billion AI infrastructure project funded by OpenAI and Oracle, in January 2025. He also advocated for long-term protections to prevent communities from being left with data centers that provide no advantages. An aggressive expansion from the private sector is matching that federal push. Data from the tracking site Data Center Map revealed that major tech companies like Amazon and Nvidia have announced multibillion-dollar investments to build data centers and AI infrastructure. These will add to a global network of about 10,700 data centers, with about 4,000 in the U.S. However, some developers are already moving cautiously in response to community backlash. On January 23, The Register reported that Applied Digital, formerly known as Applied Blockchain, announced it had begun construction of a 430 MW plant in the Southern United States. However, it has not yet disclosed the site. The CEO claimed that this is being done to safeguard the little community where it is situated, particularly because he believes they are not prepared for “national media attention.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The cryptocurrency lost key market structure levels during the pullback, including the point of control and value area low. Price has now reached the $0.11 swing low, where early signs of demand are emerging. The current price action suggests a potential swing failure pattern may be developing. This technical setup occurs when the price briefly breaks below a key support level but fails to maintain acceptance. Instead of continuing lower, the asset reclaims the broken level on a closing basis. Such patterns often indicate that sell-side liquidity has been absorbed rather than marking the start of a sustained downtrend. Wicks below the $0.11 level show that stop losses were triggered. However, the lack of follow-through selling pressure indicates larger market participants may be accumulating positions. Dogecoin has closed above this swing low multiple times, preventing a breakdown in market structure. Technical Breakdown and Volume Analysis The rejection from $0.12 marked a clear shift in short-term momentum. Traders who entered positions at higher levels were forced to exit as support zones failed. This accelerated the decline toward $0.11, where historical demand has previously emerged. Volume patterns during the decline show typical characteristics of a liquidation move. Sellers dominated as the price broke through intermediate support levels. The current consolidation at $0.11 shows reduced selling pressure compared to the initial breakdown. For the swing failure pattern to be confirmed, Dogecoin needs to demonstrate sustained acceptance above $0.11. Expanding bullish volume would strengthen the case for a relief bounce. Without this confirmation, the pattern remains speculative rather than actionable. Resistance Levels and Structural Concerns Even if Dogecoin bounces from its current levels, the path higher faces significant obstacles. The $0.12 resistance zone remains the primary target for any recovery. This level has capped multiple upside attempts and represents a concentration of supply. A sustained break above $0.12 would improve the technical outlook materially. Until that occurs, rallies should be treated as corrective moves within a broader trading range. The cryptocurrency has not established higher highs or reclaimed value area levels that would suggest improving market structure. The point of control, which Dogecoin lost during the recent decline, sits between the current price and the $0.12 resistance. At the time of writing, Dogecoin trades at around $0.1143, down 0.27% in the last 24 hours.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-31 12:04:56

Amazon told the Federal Communications Commission on Friday that it needs an extension to deploy approximately 1,600 satellites by a July 2026 cutoff date. The company wants regulators to push that deadline back two years to July 2028. Rocket shortage and manufacturing problems blamed The request is made as Amazon prepares to introduce its newly renamed satellite internet service, Amazon Leo. The network is intended to provide web connections from space, and the corporation has allocated at least $10 billion for its construction. The complaint claims that Amazon’s progress has been hampered by uncontrollable challenges. The corporation alluded to a dearth of usable rockets in the foreseeable future, combined with challenges at manufacturing facilities, failure launches of new vehicles, and restricted space at launch sites. Amazon told regulators it can build satellites much faster than launch providers can send them into orbit. The company originally planned to deploy 3,236 satellites in low Earth orbit. Federal rules require Amazon to get roughly half of them up by the original deadline. Amazon first announced its satellite constellation in 2019. The network is designed to provide fast internet with minimal delays to homes, businesses, and government agencies through square-shaped receiving devices. To get its satellites into space , Amazon has reserved more than 100 launches. Recent purchases include 10 additional flights with SpaceX, the company run by Elon Musk, plus 12 more launches with Blue Origin, the space venture started by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. While its launch partners have hit important milestones with their rockets over the past year, Amazon said development schedules for these newer vehicles have taken longer than expected, causing deployment setbacks. Progress made as competition intensifies Since April, Amazon has sent more than 150 satellites into orbit . The company projects it will have about 700 satellites in space by July 30, which would make it the second-largest satellite network in operation. Another 32 satellites are scheduled to launc h Fe bruary 12 aboard a rocket from Arianespace, a French launch company. Amazon Leo will compete primarily with SpaceX’s Starlink , which currently operates more than 9,000 satellites and serves roughly 9 million customers. Another competitor, OneWeb, is run by France’s Eutelsat and has more than 600 satellites in orbit. Last November, Amazon opened a limited trial version of Leo for selected business customers before a full public launch. In its filing, Amazon warned that rejecting the extension would work against the FCC’s own objectives of expanding spectrum use and encouraging quick deployment of new services. The company noted regulators have approved similar deadline extensions for other operators in the past. Amazon told the FCC it is actively deploying satellites and ready to offer Americans a new competitive service option. Granting extra time would allow this work to continue, while enforcing the current deadline strictly could slow or stop the rollout entirely. Ultimately, the commission’s decision will determine how quickly Amazon can officially challenge Starlink’s current market dominance. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

According to data from the analytics platform Onchainlens, the newly created wallet address 0x9D2… executed the sale for $41.27 million, a significant markdown from its $44.99 million acquisition cost just days prior. This rapid, high-value transaction immediately raises critical questions about market sentiment, whale strategy, and the underlying stability of specific crypto assets. Anatomy of the HYPE Whale’s $3.72M Loss The transaction details reveal a clear and decisive sequence of events. First, the whale wallet received a massive influx of HYPE tokens, valued at approximately $44.99 million. Subsequently, the holder waited only 72 hours before liquidating the entire holding. Consequently, the sale generated $41.27 million in proceeds, resulting in the multimillion-dollar deficit. This pattern suggests a strategic exit, not a gradual profit-taking exercise. Market analysts often scrutinize such large, rapid sales for clues about investor confidence. Furthermore, the use of a fresh wallet address adds a layer of opacity, a common tactic for large players seeking to mask their full portfolio movements. Understanding Whale Behavior and Market Impact Whale movements frequently serve as leading indicators for retail traders. A sudden, substantial sell-off can trigger fear and prompt wider selling pressure. However, context remains paramount. For instance, the sale could represent portfolio rebalancing, a response to negative project news, or simply a risk management decision unrelated to the token’s fundamentals. On-chain data provides the ‘what,’ but expert interpretation seeks the ‘why.’ Seasoned analysts compare this activity against historical whale patterns, trading volume spikes, and liquidity pool changes to gauge true market impact. Contextualizing the HYPE Token and Volatility The HYPE token exists within the broader, notoriously volatile cryptocurrency ecosystem. While Bitcoin and Ethereum exhibit relative stability, smaller-cap altcoins like HYPE can experience extreme price swings. These swings often result from concentrated ownership, where a few large holders wield disproportionate influence. The table below illustrates common factors behind rapid whale exits: Potential Catalyst Description Profit/Loss Realization Cutting losses or securing gains based on price targets. Liquidity Needs Requiring capital for other investments or obligations. Strategic Reallocation Moving funds into perceived higher-potential assets. Reaction to News Responding to project updates, regulatory shifts, or market rumors. Technical Indicators Acting on sell signals from trading algorithms or chart analysis. Therefore, isolating a single cause for this HYPE sale proves difficult without further information. Nevertheless, the event underscores the high-risk, high-reward nature of altcoin investing. Retail investors monitoring such activity should prioritize understanding project fundamentals over reacting to isolated transactions. The Critical Role of On-Chain Analysis Tools Platforms like Onchainlens, which reported this transaction, have become indispensable for modern crypto journalism and investment research. These tools parse public blockchain data, offering transparency into the movements of large holders. Key metrics they track include: Wallet Inflows/Outflows: Tracking the movement of assets into and out of addresses. Holder Concentration: Measuring the percentage of supply held by top wallets. Exchange Flows: Monitoring deposits to and withdrawals from trading platforms, indicating intent to sell or hold. By leveraging this data, analysts can construct a more nuanced narrative than price charts alone provide. The report on wallet 0x9D2… exemplifies this, transforming a simple transaction into a significant market event worthy of analysis and discussion. Expert Perspective on High-Frequency Whale Trading Financial experts specializing in blockchain analytics often caution against over-interpreting single events. A rapid in-and-out trade might reflect a sophisticated, high-frequency trading strategy gone awry, rather than a fundamental indictment of the asset. Alternatively, it could be a ‘wash trade’ or a coordinated move across multiple wallets, though these require deeper investigation to prove. The definitive takeaway is the demonstration of immense capital mobility and risk present in decentralized markets. This environment demands rigorous due diligence from all participants. Conclusion The HYPE whale’s decision to sell their entire position at a $3.72 million loss within three days provides a stark, real-time case study in cryptocurrency market dynamics. This event highlights the powerful influence of major holders, the critical importance of on-chain analytics, and the inherent volatility of digital assets. While the precise motivation remains unclear, the transaction reinforces essential lessons for the market: large moves require context, transparency tools are vital, and risk management is paramount. As the crypto ecosystem evolves, such high-profile activities will continue to offer valuable, if costly, insights into the behavior of its largest players. FAQs Q1: What is a ‘whale’ in cryptocurrency? A whale is an individual or entity that holds a sufficiently large amount of a specific cryptocurrency that their buying or selling activity can significantly influence its market price. Q2: Why would a whale sell at a loss? Reasons can include cutting losses to prevent further declines, needing immediate liquidity, reallocating capital to other opportunities, or reacting to negative news or technical indicators. Q3: How reliable is on-chain data from tools like Onchainlens? On-chain data is highly reliable as it is sourced directly from the immutable public blockchain. The interpretation of that data, however, requires context and analytical expertise. Q4: Does a whale selling always mean the token’s price will drop? Not always. While large sell-offs can create downward pressure, the overall market buy demand, broader market trends, and the specific token’s liquidity ultimately determine the price impact. Q5: What should a retail investor do when they see major whale activity? Use it as a data point for further research, not a sole signal to act. Investigate the project’s fundamentals, check for related news, and assess overall market conditions before making any investment decision.

57614117,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=27966,1769861639,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/99/default.png,"AI, Repricing Risk and the Outlook for Bitcoin in 2026",https://blog.bitfinex.com/education/ai-repricing-risk-and-the-outlook-for-bitcoin-in-2026/,"Artificial intelligence has become the dominant narrative in global markets over the past 18 months. What began as a major technological breakthrough has evolved into a once-in-a-generation capital-allocation story, with investment now running into the hundreds of billions across data centres, advanced semiconductors and the power infrastructure required to support them. That scale naturally raises a familiar question for markets: is this a sustainable investment cycle, or have expectations around AI moved ahead of what near-term outcomes can realistically deliver? The answer matters for Bitcoin, not because AI fundamentally changes Bitcoin itself, but because dominant narratives shape how investors price risk, allocate capital and rebalance portfolios. Whether AI optimism ultimately unwinds or holds will have important implications for how Bitcoin and crypto markets behave throughout the rest of the year. Bitcoin and the Repricing of Risk Despite its distinct monetary properties, Bitcoin continues to be treated as part of the same risk-rebalancing assessments that dictate flows across global equity markets. When investors reassess exposure to growth-heavy, capital-intensive themes, Bitcoin often moves in the same direction — not as a judgement on Bitcoin itself, but as part of broader portfolio rebalancing driven by liquidity and risk management. Recent market action provides a clear reference of this dynamic, with Bitcoin moving alongside broader risk assets as investors adjusted exposure elsewhere. Paolo Ardoino, Bitfinex CTO and CEO of Tether, addressed this tendency in a recent episode of Bitcoin Capital, noting that a sharp reversal in AI sentiment this year could spill into US equities and pull Bitcoin down in the near term. At the same time, he argued that Bitcoin’s market structure today is meaningfully different from prior cycles, with deeper institutional participation beginning to provide a more durable base of demand. What “Repricing Risk” Actually Looks Like Markets do not require technologies to fail for prices to reset, just that the gap between expectations and outcomes grows excessively over time. Periods of exuberance around new technological innovations tend to follow a familiar pattern. Capital concentrates, tolerance for uncertainty rises and investors become more open to holding multiple high-volatility exposures at the same time. When confidence wanes, that tolerance contracts quickly. Liquidity thins, leverage is reduced and correlations rise. The dot-com unwind remains the clearest recent example. The internet ultimately reshaped the global economy, yet between 2000 and 2002 the entire Nasdaq fell by nearly 80% . The long-term thesis was correct. The near-term pricing was not. There are echoes of that dynamic today with AI. Despite enormous and growing investment in AI infrastructure, evidence of near-term monetisation remains uneven. A recent Bain & Company report suggests that supporting the implied AI infrastructure build-out would require roughly $2 trillion in annual revenue by the end of the decade. Even under generous assumptions, Bain estimates revenues may fall around $800 billion short. That gap between investment and realised returns does not invalidate the technology’s long-term prospects, but it has left markets increasingly sensitive to delays, margin pressure or revised guidance. Why Bitcoin Leads During Risk Repricing Bitcoin’s response during periods of risk repricing is primarily a function of liquidity. Bitcoin trades continuously in deep, global markets. Over time, that liquidity is a strength. In moments of stress, it also makes Bitcoin a quick and efficient source of risk reduction. Unlike gold, Bitcoin does not yet benefit from universal recognition as a safe-haven asset. Instead, it remains widely held within discretionary portfolios that are actively rebalanced as conditions change. Even gold, however, experienced sharp downward moves during the most recent market volatility, reinforcing the idea that the repricing was driven by liquidity and portfolio rebalancing rather than anything inherently related to Bitcoin. That helps explain why Bitcoin moved alongside equities this week despite the absence of any Bitcoin-specific catalyst. This latest move is a reflection of how Bitcoin is currently used, not a reassessment of its underlying properties. That context sets the stage for how Bitcoin would likely behave if AI optimism were to experience a major reversal. If AI is a Bubble: Implications for Bitcoin into 2026 If AI investment proves to be meaningfully ahead of sustainable returns, the immediate impact would unlikely be confined to technology stocks alone. A broader repricing of growth expectations would tighten liquidity, reduce leverage and pressure risk assets across the board. In that environment, Bitcoin would likely remain volatile in the short term. As one of the most liquid global risk assets, it would continue to be used as a source of risk reduction during periods of stress. Further drawdowns in such a scenario would not reflect a failure of Bitcoin’s fundamentals, but its role within portfolio construction. Where this cycle differs is what happens after the initial repricing. Institutional ownership, regulated investment vehicles such as spot ETFs and longer-duration allocations now anchor a growing share of Bitcoin supply. Capital rotates rather than disappears when a dominant narrative unwinds. As confidence in long-duration, infrastructure-heavy stories weakens, attention historically shifts toward assets that are liquid, globally accessible and seen as undervalued. Into 2026, this dynamic suggests a Bitcoin market characterised less by prolonged capitulation and more by volatility followed by consolidation and recovery. As Paolo notes, drawdowns would remain possible, but the extreme, multi-year 70–80% declines that defined earlier cycles appear less structurally embedded than before. If AI is Not a Bubble: Where We Are in the Cycle If AI ultimately delivers on its long-term promise, the current phase still matters. Today’s market reflects an infrastructure-heavy build-out stage, where capital expenditure is front-loaded and monetisation lags deployment. Here, volatility in AI-linked equities would be less about collapse and more about timing. Returns would simply take longer to materialise than markets had assumed. A strong and durable AI narrative could also crowd out other high-volatility investments, including Bitcoin, not through collapse but by offering a more visible path for investors to enjoy returns. In such an environment, Bitcoin may trade sideways or grind higher rather than experience sharp repricing in either direction. That outcome would be consistent with Bitcoin continuing its transition toward a more macro-oriented allocation, absorbing capital incrementally and responding primarily to changes in liquidity rather than to any single dominant narrative. Correlations with risk assets would persist, but against a backdrop of improving market depth, ownership and more stable capital. What This Means for Bitcoin into 2026 Whether AI optimism ultimately unwinds or endures in 2026, Bitcoin enters the year with a different market structure than in previous cycles. While it remains sensitive to shifts in investor confidence, it now does so against a backdrop of deeper liquidity, broader ownership and more established institutional infrastructure than in prior periods. In that sense, the significance of any repricing event, including a large-scale reversal in AI sentiment, lies less in any immediate price action. What will be more important is what such moments reveal about Bitcoin’s ongoing transition from a high-volatility outlier toward an increasingly familiar, if still imperfect, component of the global financial system.

57614074,https://cryptonews.com/?p=481502,1769861759,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/57614074.jpeg,XRP Price Prediction: $70M Liquidated as XRP Tests $1.70 – Is $1.60 Next?,https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-price-prediction-70m-liquidated-as-xrp-tests-1-70-is-1-60-next/,"XRP is facing more selling, now trading close to $1.70 after another round of declines. The token has dropped about 2.5% in the last day and is having trouble stabilizing after its recent fall. The quick return of downward momentum is especially notable. This shows the market is still fragile. Buyers are staying away, and each small rally is quickly met with more selling. Right now, XRP looks like it is still correcting instead of getting ready for a strong recovery. $70 Million in Liquidations Hit Bullish Traders The latest pullback triggered more than $70 million in XRP futures liquidations, with the majority coming from long positions. In simple terms, many traders were positioned for a rebound, and when price slipped below key levels, forced selling kicked in. As XRP dropped under nearby support zones, margin calls accelerated the decline. This type of liquidation cascade often creates exaggerated moves, where selling feeds on itself rather than reflecting a sudden change in fundamentals. It also explains why the price struggled to stabilize quickly after the initial dip. Here are the main points from the liquidation data: Most liquidations came from long positions, which shows traders were still optimistic. Forced selling made the market more volatile, instead of traders taking profits naturally. Leverage is coming down, but it hasn’t been completely cleared from the market yet. Weak Bitcoin Keeps Risk Appetite Low XRP’s weakness is part of a bigger trend. Bitcoin’s slow price movement has made the whole crypto market more cautious. When Bitcoin isn’t moving up, traders usually cut back on altcoins, especially those already under pressure. At the same time, there’s little evidence of aggressive dip-buying. Spot demand appears thin, suggesting many investors are waiting for clearer confirmation before stepping back in. Until overall market confidence improves, XRP is likely to remain sensitive to downside moves. XRP Technical Picture Points Toward $1.60 On the 4-hour chart, XRP price prediciton is strongly bearish as XRP keeps making lower highs and lower lows, following a clear downward trendline that has limited recoveries since mid-January. The price has dropped below the 1.618 Fibonacci extension near $1.73, drawing focus to lower support levels. XRP Price Chart – Source: Tradingview XRP is now just above $1.64, which matches the 2.272 Fibonacci extension. This area might provide a brief pause, but it usually doesn’t hold as a bottom during a strong downtrend. If the price falls below $1.64, it could move toward $1.60 to $1.59, where the 2.618 extension and previous liquidity are found. Momentum continues to support a bearish outlook. The RSI is still below 40 and moving closer to oversold territory, with no sign of bullish divergence. This points to ongoing weakness instead of a sign that the decline is ending. For sentiment to improve, XRP needs to move back above $1.75 to $1.78, and then above $1.86. Until that happens, the technical outlook suggests caution, with $1.60 as the next important level to watch on the downside. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the BTC ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult , the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $31.4 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013665 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems. If Bitcoin built the foundation, Bitcoin Hyper could make it fast, flexible, and fun again.

Donald Trump’s pick to run the Federal Reserve is facing a possible conflict. On one side, there’s Warsh’s known preference for cutting the central bank’s massive bond portfolio. On the other, the president’s repeated demands for lower long-term interest rates. Treasury markets moved on Friday following Kevin Warsh’s appointment. The difference between 30-year and two-year rates grew to 1.35 percentage points as investors drove higher yields on longer-term government paper. The fact that the spread is almost at its biggest point since 2021 demonstrates how Wall Street has responded to Warsh’s remarks in recent years. Markets react to balance sheet concerns The market response points to an early reading of Warsh’s past statements. He’s criticized the Fed for buying too many bonds during the 2008 financial crisis, when he worked as a Fed governor, and then again during the 2020 pandemic response. Greg Peters works as co-chief investment officer at PGIM fixed income. He explained what’s got the market worried. “You have an anti-balance sheet expansion guy against a backdrop of wanting lower interest rates. It’s a tension point. That’s what the market is focused on. That’s why the curve is steepening out,” Peters said. Warsh spent five years at the Fed from 2006 to 2011. Since leaving, he’s spoken out against some of the central bank’s major policy moves. The rounds of bond buying that left the Fed holding close to $9tn in Treasury bonds and other securities at the highest point? He takes particular issue with those. His argument is that keeping such a large balance sheet warps the prices of investments and might lock in higher inflation over time. But at the same time, he’s said the economy faces risks that support cutting the Fed’s main interest rate. Warsh addressed the Fed’s role in debt markets during an April speech that drew wide attention. “The Fed has been the most important buyer of US Treasury debt, and other liabilities backed by the US government, since 2008,” he said. He added that “it’s a proxy for the Fed’s growing imprimatur on the economy. ” Stanley Druckenmiller, a billionaire investor who’s advised Warsh for years, told the Financial Times on Friday that his protégé does not stick to one position. “I’ve seen him go both ways” on monetary policy, Druckenmiller said. Warsh is not permanently hawkish on rates, the investor suggested. Some market watchers think Warsh might push to cut short-term rates. “ Their reasoning is based on expectations that artificial intelligence will boost productivity. Under this view, the economy could expand quickly without creating much inflation. Challenges of balancing competing priorities The Fed lowered rates by 0.75 percentage points last year. But earlier this week, officials signale d th ey plan to pause cuts for now. They pointed to solid economic growth and a job market that appears steadier after showing some weakness. Markets still expect two quarter-point cuts starting this summer after Warsh’s nomination. This show s tr aders have not changed their near-term Fed outlook. Bill Campbell manages portfolios at DoubleLine. He pointed out the challenge if Warsh wants both lower short-term rates and a smaller balance sheet while government debt grows and inflation stays elevated. “Until you get fiscal under control and inflation under control, you are not going to be able to aggressively reduce interest rates and shrink the [Fed’s] balance sheet,” Campbell said. He added that “I believe Kevin Warsh fully understands this.” The Fed stopped its program to shrink its balance sheet late last year. Officials worried about drying up cash in overnight lending markets. This decision eased some concerns about who will buy all the government debt, especially as analysts predicte d th e central bank might start expanding its bond holdings again. Mark Dowding runs active fixed income at RBC BlueBay Asset Management. He described the problem with using balance sheet cuts to justify rate reductions. “The issue is if you justify rate cuts by cutting the balance sheet, this does nothing to help lower long-term rates and improve mortgage affordability, which is what Trump wants,” Dowding said. The competing priorities create uncertainty about how Warsh would balance the administration’s political goals with his stated policy preferences if confirmed to lead the central bank.

Cardano (ADA) is among the worst-affected, with its price plunging 10% weekly to around $0.32. The question now is whether a further pullback is coming and how low the valuation can go in February. To gain a better perspective, we consulted four of the most popular AI-powered chatbots on the matter. The Bears Will Remain in Charge Next Month? According to ChatGPT, ADA’s correction could continue next month, but it’s likely closer to the later stages than the beginning. It assumed that this appears to be a temporary shakeout rather than the start of a deep bear market. “It looks like a shakeout where weak hands exit, and stronger players accumulate. These phases often drag longer than people expect, then end abruptly,” it added. The chatbot claimed that the lowest price ADA can reach in the next 30 days is $0.28, while the most likely scenario is to range between $0.31 and $0.36. Grok, which is integrated into the social media platform X, argued that sellers might remain dominant in the next few weeks, estimating a 40% chance of a dip to around $0.28. “February has a well-documented negative median return for ADA, often erasing January gains. With momentum already fading, this seasonal pattern could compound the technical breakdown,” it stated. The Worst-Case Scenario Perplexity claimed that ADA could realistically drop to $0.28-$0.30 in February if support fails, but a rebound is also a plausible option given the recent accumulation from whales. Recall that large investors scooped up over 450 million tokens in the past two months, which is often interpreted as a bullish sign. Google’s Gemini argued that predicting an exact floor for ADA next month is like “trying to catch a falling knife.” Based on current market signals, though, it suggested that the worst-case scenario is a plunge to $0.27. On the other hand, if ADA manages to reclaim the $0.34 level, it may soar to $0.40. Meanwhile, “a clean break” above $0.40 might identify that the bulls are back, Gemini concluded.

The bank is the first U.S. financial institution to fail this year. The department appointed the Federal Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as the bank’s receiver. The FDIC also initiated a Purchase and Assumption Agreement with the First Independence Bank on Friday. FDIC assumes all Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust deposits Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust, Chicago, IL was closed today by @IDFPR , which appointed the FDIC as receiver.

The First Independence Bank, Detroit, MI, will assume all deposit accounts except those from Cede & Co. The Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust is expected to reopen its main office as a branch of First Independence Bank during Monday’s normal business hours. Depositors at the Chicago-based bank will automatically become depositors of First Independence Bank starting next week. The FDIC also confirmed that it will continue to insure all deposits assumed by the bank. The agency added that Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust customers will still have immediate access to their deposits after the change. “We want to be clear that no depositor will lose any money as a result of this action. Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust was closed today due to unsafe and unsound conditions and an impaired capital position. First Independence Bank is well-positioned to continue essential banking services for Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust customers.” – Susan Soriano , Acting Director of IDFPR’s Division of Banking. Mario Treto, Jr., Secretary of IDFPR, acknowledged that the department’s mission is to safeguard the soundness of Illinois’ state-chartered financial institutions. He also revealed that protecting depositors and maintaining a safe and sound banking system remains the department’s priority. Customers will retain the same routing and account numbers until they are notified in writing by First Independence Bank. Customers will also have access to their safe deposit boxes during normal business hours. The FDIC revealed that customers of the failed bank in Illinois can still access their deposits by writing checks or using ATM or debit cards. The Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust will also continue processing paychecks and social security benefits. The FDIC urged loan customers to continue making their payments as usual, including escrow payments, despite the bank’s closure. The terms of the customers’ loans will also not change. Customers who have a loan in process or have had a line of credit are urged to contact their loan officer. Customers who make escrow payments and receive notification that any portion of their taxes or insurance was not paid are also encouraged to visit the FDIC Information and Support Center for help. The government agency disclosed that customers with queries can contact the FDIC toll-free at 1-866-314-1744 or visit the agency’s website. The FDIC said the phone number will be operational from Monday, 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. CT. First Independence Bank purchases $251M of Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust’s assets The initiative comes as the Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust reported on September 30 that its total assets reached $261.1 million and total deposits of $212.1 million. The First Independence Bank agreed to purchase approximately $251 million in assets from the failed bank. The FDIC revealed that it will retain the remaining assets for later disposition. The agency also estimates that Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust’s failure will cost the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) approximately $19.7 million, a figure expected to change over time as retained assets are sold. The FDIC disclosed that customers can file a claim against Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust if they have not been paid for services rendered on or before January 30, 2026. First Independence Bank will also be responsible for mailing customers 1099 tax information, while the FDIC does its 1098 reporting. Metropolitan Capital Bank & Trust confirmed that its shares are owned by its holding company, Metropolitan Capital Bankcorp, Inc., Chicago, IL.

This is more than a change in price levels, it represents a reallocation of capital and a shift in the direction of the next crypto phase of decentralization. As a result, a new altcoin generation of platforms is stepping into the spotlight, while the giants of the past decade confront growing structural challenges Ripple (XRP) Ripple XRP is trading at a point of about $1.75 which is a significant 10.5% decrease in the last seven days. Being a large-cap giant with a market cap of approximately 107 billion dollars, XRP is still a giant but the size is starting to become more and more of a burden to the ability to grow exponentially. This early successful year of 2025 has been driven by a friendly settlement with the SEC, and the authorization of spot ETFs in the U.S., which propelled the token to a multi-year peak. Nonetheless, the momentum has been thrown into a stalemate with institutional outflows taking its effect. The future prognosis of XRP is getting more bearish over the next two years. Analysts note that charts show a so-called death cross of the company, which indicates that the price would fall to at least $1.25 at the end of 2026. Since it is already a huge base, even the doubling of the price needs billions of dollars of new liquidity. It is this low upside potential that explains why most analysts are forecasting that Ripple will perform poorly compared to the market in general in 2027. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Unlike the hardships of big crypto assets, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already trending massively. The project is at Phase 7 of the process of presale and the price of the MUTM is $0.04. This is a 300% increase on its original Phase 1 price of $0.01. To date the project has collected over $20.1 million and has drawn in excess of 19,900 holders. Mutuum Finance is a non-custodial finance hub based on Ethereum that is being constructed. It will enable the users to receive an income or get liquidity without having to sell their crypto assets at all. As of now Mutuum Finance is developing P2C and P2P markets to offer flexible choices for all users around the world. The Reason Investors are Rotating The most recent decline in XRP can be mostly attributed to a general macro panic and a risk-off stance of traders. The greatest weakness of XRP is that its expansion is coupled with institutional banking associates, which are slow. MUTM is designed to support the rapid evolution of decentralized finance by offering a high-performance credit ecosystem. The project is gaining significant momentum as investors rotate into the protocol following the successful launch of the V1 protocol on the Sepolia testnet. This prototype version of the application allows users to engage with real-time liquidity pools and the original mtToken system, which issues yield-bearing receipts to those who provide capital. Unlike traditional assets like XRP that are currently struggling to retain their price levels, MUTM is successfully transitioning from a theoretical concept into a functional financial instrument. The testnet environment specifically allows for the live simulation of liquidity pools using assets such as ETH, USDT, and LINK. By integrating an automated liquidator bot and a real-time health factor monitoring system, the protocol ensures that the logic governing its stability is battle-tested and secure. This technical readiness, combined with a completed Halborn security audit , provides a transparent look at how the mainnet will operate as it prepares to exit its final presale stages. A Contrast in Price Expectation The two cheap cryptocurrencies differ in price prediction in a very remarkable way. As XRP struggles to get past the $3.00 mark, analysts reckon that MUTM might get to $0.30 to $0.50 within a short period after its formal release at $0.06. This would translate into around 10x MUTM growth as long as the roadmap unfolds as planned. The community is also engaged in the project through the 24-hour leaderboard giving out a $500 bonus to the best-ranked contributor of the day. It is this combination of professional security and high interaction that is causing money to flow towards this new protocol with the old top cryptocurrencies drying up.

They claimed that the suspects involved used the models to generate their explicit images and profit from them. The lawsuit filed at the Maricopa County Superior Court in Arizona targets an Instagram account that has posted multiple videos of women, advertising them as AI models to make money. The plaintiffs, whose names are being withheld for privacy reasons, noted that some of the AI-generated images were created using their social media photos without prior consent. One of the victims mentioned that she is now being looked at in a way that does not sit well with her, simply because of the circulating images. Arizona women initiate lawsuit over AI-generated content The lawsuit names three defendants from Maricopa County in Arizona, including Beau Schultz, the owner of the Instagram account. The lawsuit also names 50 other John Does and several companies that were allegedly created or used to run the business. The plaintiffs are being represented by Nick Brand of Donlon Group and Cristina Perez Hesano from Pere Law Group. According to Brand, the defendants, who are likely from Arizona, created blueprints to teach other men and boys how to make these so-called AI influencers that are then nudified from fully clothed images. He added that the defendants use these generated deepfakes to set up a subscription-based pornographic website where they share erotic messages back and forth with customers. Brand noted that the issue looks wider than he had imagined before he was assigned the case. In the Arizona lawsuit, the defendants instructed their customers to avoid using popular or well-known influencers and instead use micro-influencers to reduce the risk of legal troubles. “I can’t believe how naive I was to what women are suffering through as technology advances,” Brand said . According to one of the victims, only strict legislation can be used to prevent these ills and prevent more women from being targeted in similar schemes. Payment platform denies wrongdoing Another victim mentioned that the public should not be able to use artificial intelligence to wreak this much havoc, noting that those who use it are targeting someone’s sister, mother, friend, and co-worker. Meanwhile, one of the companies listed in the lawsuit, Phyziro, a payment processing platform, said the accusations are materially false. The company claimed that it is an Interactive Computer Service provider under § 47 U.S.C. 230. “The company shall not be treated as the publisher, speaker, or author of any content or transaction generated by third-party users or autonomous agents. We further maintain no duty to monitor the specific downstream intent or illicit activities of users or users-of-users. The Member and Manager are immune from liability for ‘Asymmetric Knowledge’ events where AI agents, users, or users-of-users act outside of the Manager’s direct visibility or programming.” The company mentioned that it only serves as a provider of neutral tools and infrastructure, highlighting that its liability is strictly limited to the technical operability of the stack. In its statement, the company notes that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act clears it of any wrongdoing. However, there is currently a bipartisan effort in Congress to revoke the law, which would force platforms to be accountable for content posted on or connected to their websites. This development from Arizona also comes at a time when the chatbot Grok has been under heavy criticism by the global population. Governments across the country accused the platform of not keeping guardrails in place to check the activities of the chatbot, leading it to create AI-generated deepfakes of explicit images of women and children. While some countries have issued warnings to the platform, others have temporarily halted its access until work is done to correct the issue.

Over the past two years, those narratives have begun to change. As major assets mature and volatility compresses, retail attention is increasingly splitting between established networks and earlier-stage infrastructure models where mechanics, participation rules, and deployment phases remain visible. Meme Cycles and the Retail Attention Economy Retail crypto narratives during prior cycles were dominated by meme-driven assets, where price action was closely tied to social momentum, virality, and platform amplification. Entry points were often dictated by sentiment waves instead of underlying network mechanics, and participation rarely required technical understanding of how a system functioned. As liquidity deepened and meme assets reached high market capitalization levels, retail behavior began to fragment. Short-term speculation remained present, but sustained participation increasingly depended on whether narratives could evolve beyond social signaling into functional relevance or long-term holding rationale. This environment has pushed a segment of retail capital to reassess exposure strategies. Instead of rotating solely between trending tokens, attention has expanded toward earlier-stage models where network structure, participation mechanics, and growth phases are still unfolding in real time. Infrastructure Awareness Among Retail Participants A notable change in retail behavior has been increased engagement with infrastructure concepts. Topics such as transaction throughput, confirmation latency, fee predictability, and node participation have become more common in retail-facing discussions, reflecting a broader understanding of how networks operate beneath surface narratives. This shift does not signal universal technical fluency, but it does indicate growing awareness that network design influences long-term behavior. Projects that present clearly bounded roles and measurable participation criteria are increasingly part of retail evaluation alongside traditional narrative drivers. Bitcoin Everlight and Early-Stage Network Framing Bitcoin Everlight operates as a lightweight transaction-routing layer that interfaces with Bitcoin without modifying Bitcoin’s protocol or consensus. It does not function as a sidechain, does not introduce block production, and does not alter Bitcoin’s settlement rules. Its scope is limited to routing high-frequency transactions off-chain, with optional anchoring back to Bitcoin for settlement reference. Transactions routed through Everlight are confirmed within seconds through quorum-based validation among participating nodes. Fees follow a predictable micro-fee structure tied to routing activity. This narrow mandate positions Everlight within an infrastructure-first category that aligns with shifting retail interest toward early-stage mechanics over narrative breadth. Node Participation and Measurable Contribution Everlight nodes do not validate Bitcoin blocks. They operate the routing layer by relaying transactions, performing lightweight verification, and maintaining network availability. Participation requires staking BTCL tokens with a defined 14-day lock period, supporting predictable routing behavior. Routing priority is determined by measurable metrics including uptime consistency, latency, throughput capacity, and historical reliability. Transactions achieve confirmation through quorum-based approval, enabling settlement within seconds. Compensation is derived from routing micro-fees and base network incentives, structured within a 4–8% annualized range depending on participation and network activity. Tiered roles — Light, Core, and Prime — assign routing priority based on operational performance, with underperforming nodes receiving reduced exposure until metrics recover. A third-party walkthrough of Everlight’s mechanics and participation model is available on Crypto Nitro’s YouTube channel . Security Review and Deployment Transparency Security review and identity verification are integrated into Bitcoin Everlight’s deployment process. Smart contracts and related infrastructure have undergone independent third-party assessment through the SpyWolf Audit and the SolidProof Audit . These assessments examine contract logic, permission structures, and potential vulnerability surfaces within the routing framework. Team identity verification has been completed through the SpyWolf KYC Verification and the Vital Block KYC Validation . These disclosures support accountability during early deployment without implying absolute security. Token Structure and Retail Repositioning Bitcoin Everlight has a fixed total supply of 21,000,000,000 BTCL. Allocation includes 45% for the public presale, 20% for node-related incentives, 15% for liquidity provisioning, 10% for team allocations under vesting conditions, and 10% reserved for ecosystem development and treasury use. The presale spans 20 stages, beginning at $0.0008 and progressing to $0.0110 in the final stage. Presale allocations release with 20% available at the token generation event, followed by linear distribution over six to nine months. Team allocations follow a 12-month cliff and a 24-month vesting schedule. BTCL utility includes transaction routing fees, node participation, performance incentives, and anchoring operations. As retail narratives continue to shift from meme-driven cycles toward market maturity, earlier-stage infrastructure models are receiving renewed attention. Bitcoin Everlight is being evaluated within that context as a narrowly scoped routing layer operating alongside Bitcoin during its early deployment phase.

However, the altcoin could not continue on this trajectory, as it nosedived on Wednesday and continues on that downward trajectory. While XRP’s future appears to tilt towards the bearish side, a technical indicator has recently revealed that the token may be setting up for a short-term rebound. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miner Fees Remain Near Cycle Lows: What Does This Signal? TD Sequential Signals Potential Trend Exhaustion In an X post on January 30, technical analyst Ali Martinez postulates that the XRP price could soon see a rebound, provided that certain conditions are met. The central indicator for this revelation is the TD Sequential, a technical analytics tool that is used in identifying whether an uptrend or a downtrend is likely to pause, or even reverse. Simply put, the indicator tracks points of trend exhaustion, although in the short-term. The TD Sequential has two phases, i.e., the Setup Phase (1–9 count), and the Countdown phase (up to count 13), which have their respective interpretations. When a “9” count is completed, it is typically a sign of dwindling selling pressure. On the other hand, a full “13” count is a telltale sign of an imminent reversal. From the chart shared by the analyst, we see a completed “9” count to the downside. From this, it is apparent that the momentum driving XRP’s recent fall is nearing a point of exhaustion. Interestingly, this signal’s appearance coincides with the imminence of a key price support. Martinez explains that if the $1.70 support’s integrity is maintained, XRP stands a chance at seeing a price rebound. In the case where the $1.70 support sponsors a price rebound, the $1.80–$1.85 range stands as the resistance level that may test XRP’s momentum. If momentum builds and price overcomes the aforementioned price barrier, $1.90 could be another battleground. Related Reading: XRP To $100? Ex-Ripple CTO David Schwartz Weighs In On The Hype XRP ETFs Record $69M In Net Outflows Following Thursday Purge According to data from ETF tracking site SoSoValue, US XRP Spot ETFs are currently running at a cumulative outflow of more than $69 million. The first three days of the week produced combined positive netflows valued at 23.87 million. However, a cumulative outflow of $92.92 million on Thursday quickly flipped a positive week red. Interestingly, this negative figure is in congruence with last week’s net outflow of $40.64 million. Typically, a negative netflow signals that institutional demand might be tapering, as it directly reports that more capital was withdrawn from the XRP ETFs than deposited. In this context, where the XRP price took on a sharp downtrend, it becomes apparent that institutional investors may have played a significant role in the price downturn of the Ripple token recently seen. Nonetheless, negative ETF netflows do not necessarily tell a broader story of bearishness, but are reflections of profit-taking or de-risking events. As of this writing, XRP trades at a $1.74. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the altcoin has lost about 3.26% of its value since the past day.

Their strategy centers on backing moderate, business-oriented lawmakers while countering organized labor’s long-standing power in Sacramento. The initiative is under the Grow California banner and is sponsored by Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen and venture capitalist Tim Draper. Both are longtime political donors with a record of holding progressive opinions on economic policy. The New York Times reported that the group focuses its expenditure on individual legislative contests, as opposed to statewide ones. The initiative comes at a time when donors in Silicon Valley are increasingly worried about policy proposals they perceive as unfavorable to capital formation and innovation. Although Grow California was formed earlier than a potential state wealth tax became a subject of political discourse, the proposal has since become a rallying cry among most of its supporters. Wealth tax fears mobilize Silicon Valley donors Tension between technology leaders and labor groups has grown after a proposal endorsed by a healthcare union that would tax the assets of California’s wealthiest residents, if passed by voters. Supporters argue that the plan would fund public services and address inequality. “Whoever designed that wealth tax in the unions — wow, they woke up the sleeping giant like I have never seen, that’s maybe the blessing of this whole thing. Business has got to stop being apologetic for being business. It’s just so lame,” Larsen stated. Larsen has publicly expressed the importance of unions but said uncontrolled influence threatens to destroy California’s economic competitiveness. Millions deployed to shape legislative races Campaign finance filings show that Larsen and Draper each gave $5 million to seed Grow California in September. The organization now claims to have raised some $40 million in commitments through a network of independent expenditure committees and affiliated nonprofit entities. Larsen has also stated that he will invest up to $30 million of his own money over several election cycles. Rather than spreading the resources thinly, Grow California plans to focus on a few competitive state legislative races. The group has said it will not participate in the 2026 governorship race and will avoid costly ballot initiatives. Larsen cited Fairshake, a crypto-backed super PAC that has been active in recent federal elections, as proof of persistence. The California push comes as federal crypto regulation is growing. Recently, the U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee promoted a bill to create an international digital asset system. The bill would give the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission jurisdiction over spot crypto markets and establish rules for exchanges, brokers, and dealers. The bill, however, passed in a party-line vote, implying little bipartisan support. A similar bill in the Senate Banking Committee, meanwhile, is stuck amid intensive lobbying over stablecoin rules.

Source: Bloomberg The selloff was triggered by President Donald Trump’s nomination of Kevin Warsh as Federal Reserve chair , which sent the dollar soaring and sparked massive profit-taking across commodities markets. The crash wiped out more than $15 trillion from the gold and silver markets in 24 hours, an amount equal to half the size of the entire U.S. economy. Despite the brutal correction, both metals still finished January with gains (gold up 12% and silver up 16%), while Bitcoin tumbled to a nine-month low of $82,000, raising questions about whether the digital asset will follow precious metals’ trajectory or chart its own path. Historic Selloff Driven by Warsh Nomination and Technical Factors Spot gold prices crashed more than 12% at one point, hitting a low of $4,682 per ounce in its biggest single-day decline since the early 1980s, closing down 9.25% at $4,880. Silver experienced an even more dramatic collapse, plummeting 36% intraday to $74.28 per ounce before settling 26.42% lower at $85.259, marking its worst day since March 1980. Gold and silver have lost a combined $6.52 trillion over the last 48 hours. That is equivalent to Bitcoin's entire market cap nearly 4 times over.

So, there has been some leverage built up in silver. With the huge decline today, the margin calls went out. “ Bloomberg also noted that technical factors amplified the crash as a gamma squeeze forced dealers to sell futures contracts as prices fell through key options levels at $5,300, $5,200, and $5,100 for gold. Gold’s relative-strength index had recently hit 90, the highest in decades, signaling that the precious metal was severely overbought and due for a correction.

Copper also retreated 3.4% from Thursday’s record high above $14,000 per ton, while silver ETFs saw their worst days on record, with the iShares Silver Trust losing 31%. Bitcoin Faces ‘Two-Path’ Dilemma as Markets Reassess Fed Policy Bitcoin dropped to $82,000 following Warsh’s nomination , with spot Bitcoin ETF outflows accelerating to roughly $1 billion this month and total liquidations approaching $800 million to $1 billion, according to Bitfinex analysts. The digital asset is now trading at a nine-month low as investors reassess monetary policy trajectories. Jeff Park, CIO at Bitwise, outlined a critical framework for understanding Bitcoin’s divergent path from precious metals in his “ Two Bitcoin Thesis. ” “ Metals are telling you spot debasement is happening; Bitcoin will tell you when the yield curve itself breaks, ” Park explained, distinguishing between “ negative rho Bitcoin ” that performs better when rates fall and “ positive rho Bitcoin ” that thrives when financial system assumptions collapse. Park argued the current environment represents the worst scenario for Bitcoin’s “negative rho” thesis. “ We’re currently experiencing good deflation in technology sectors while avoiding bad deflation in credit markets, ” he wrote. “ This is the worst possible environment for Bitcoin: productive enough to keep growth assets attractive, stable enough to keep Treasuries credible, but not catastrophic enough to break the system. “ https://t.co/9aCcpwV6YO pic.twitter.com/XeWgnP55H0 — Jeff Park (@dgt10011) January 31, 2026 Speaking with Cryptonews, Aurélie Barthere, Principal Research Analyst at Nansen, identified multiple negative catalysts driving Bitcoin lower: “ Fed Chair Powell guiding for no Fed cut in its remaining mandate till June 2026, President Trump seemingly choosing the more hawkish candidate as the new Fed Chair, Kevin Warsh, and a BTC correlation with US equities turning positive again. “ Flow data shows “ slow capitulation in ETFs, options, and miner activity, ” she noted. Eric Jackson, incoming CEO of EMJX-SRX Health, offered a contrarian view on Warsh’s nomination. “ The nomination of Kevin Warsh for Federal Reserve Chairman appears constructively neutral-to-positive for crypto over the medium term, even if the initial market reaction is cautious, ” Jackson told Cryptonews. “ His emphasis on balance sheet discipline and clearer boundaries between Treasury and the Fed points to less reflexive quantitative easing and greater transparency around liquidity conditions. “ those who still dont understand why warsh won simply dont understand the unspoken truth that the fed-treasury relationship is the most powerful lever to affect the kind of generational change that this system now requires it was always warsh and bessent incredibly optimistic — Jeff Park (@dgt10011) January 30, 2026 Park’s analysis suggests the Warsh appointment could ultimately prove bullish for Bitcoin’s “ positive rho ” scenario by accelerating a systemic reckoning. “ If you believe the debt trajectory is unsustainable, if you believe fiscal dominance will eventually override monetary orthodoxy, if you believe the risk-free rate will eventually be revealed as a fiction, then you want Warsh, ” he wrote. He concluded that while he cannot confirm if “ $82k was indeed the bottom, ” historically, “ bottoms are almost always noted by a radical shift in market regime that fundamentally resets investor behavior. “ The post Silver Plunges Record 36% as Precious Metals Suffer Historic Collapse – Bitcoin About to Rally? appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Gold|silver,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2026-01-31 13:06:23

This remarkable XRP withdrawal activity, reported by The Crypto Basic and confirmed by data from CryptoQuant, represents a dramatic shift from the subdued figures observed just months prior and may signal a pivotal change in investor behavior for the digital asset. Analyzing the XRP Withdrawal Phenomenon at Upbit Data analytics firm CryptoQuant provided the critical figures that highlight this surge. During the fourth quarter of 2025, daily XRP withdrawal addresses from Upbit fluctuated between a mere one and 53. Consequently, the jump to 3,200 addresses is not just an increase; it is a seismic shift in network activity. Furthermore, this new peak decisively surpasses previous notable surges recorded on December 15 and December 17, which reached 2,750 and 3,051 addresses respectively. This consistent breach of previous ceilings suggests a sustained and intensifying trend rather than an isolated event. The implications of such a mass migration of assets off a centralized exchange are multifaceted. Primarily, it indicates a reduction in the immediate sell-side liquidity available on the Upbit order books. When investors move tokens to private wallets, they effectively remove them from the readily tradable supply on that platform. This action can create a supply shock on the exchange, potentially leading to increased volatility or price stability depending on subsequent market orders. Expert Interpretation and Market Context Market analyst CryptoMāshī offered a compelling interpretation of the data. The analyst suggested this trend likely points to large-scale investors, often referred to as “whales,” accumulating significant amounts of XRP in cold storage or offline wallets. Historically, such accumulation phases have preceded notable price movements, as large holders typically move assets off exchanges when planning for long-term holds rather than short-term trades. Potential Motivations Behind the Withdrawals CryptoMāshī outlined several plausible reasons for the wave of withdrawals, emphasizing that the exact motive can vary per investor. A primary reason could be a strategic shift toward long-term investment horizons, where holders secure their assets in private custody. Alternatively, investors might be engaging in arbitrage opportunities, moving XRP to other exchanges or decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols offering higher yields or better prices. Staking or participating in network governance on other platforms is another potential driver. Regardless of the individual reasons, the aggregate effect remains consistent: a substantial decrease in XRP supply on one of its key trading venues. This reduction in readily available tokens eases immediate selling pressure, which can help stabilize or bolster the asset’s market price. The table below contrasts the recent activity with historical data: Time Period Daily XRP Withdrawal Addresses (Upbit) Context Q4 2025 (Baseline) 1 – 53 Typical low-activity range Dec 15, 2024 Surge 2,750 Previous high watermark Dec 17, 2024 Surge 3,051 Near-record activity January 2025 Record 3,200 New All-Time High This data must be viewed within the broader context of the South Korean cryptocurrency landscape. Upbit is a dominant exchange in the region, known for its high retail and institutional participation. Movements on its platform often reflect sentiment across the Asian market. Therefore, a record-setting XRP withdrawal event is a significant on-chain metric that analysts and traders globally monitor closely. The Mechanics of Exchange Supply and Price Impact To understand the potential impact, one must grasp the relationship between exchange reserves and market dynamics. Centralized exchanges act as liquidity pools. A high supply of an asset on an exchange typically indicates higher potential selling pressure, as tokens are sitting in order books ready to be traded. Conversely, when tokens are withdrawn to private wallets, they exit the immediate trading ecosystem. Reduced Sell Pressure: With fewer XRP tokens available on Upbit’s order books, large sell orders become harder to fill without moving the price upward. Accumulation Signal: Large withdrawals often correlate with accumulation phases, where informed investors build positions away from public view. Market Sentiment Indicator: Such aggressive withdrawal can reflect bullish long-term sentiment, as investors opt for custody over trading. However, it is crucial to maintain a neutral and factual perspective. While the data suggests accumulation, it does not guarantee a specific price outcome. Market prices are influenced by a complex array of factors including global macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, overall cryptocurrency market trends, and developments within the XRP Ledger ecosystem itself. The withdrawal trend is one strong signal among many. Conclusion The record-breaking XRP withdrawal activity from the Upbit exchange, reaching 3,200 addresses, presents a compelling on-chain narrative for the digital asset. This data, significantly elevated from its late-2025 baseline, points toward possible large-scale accumulation and a strategic reduction of immediately tradable supply on a major market. While analyst interpretations suggest this could precede significant price movements, the event fundamentally underscores a shift in holder behavior toward secure, long-term custody. Market participants will now closely watch whether this XRP withdrawal trend sustains and how it interacts with other fundamental and technical factors in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape of 2025. FAQs Q1: What does an increase in XRP withdrawal addresses mean? An increase typically means more unique users or entities are moving XRP off an exchange. This often signals accumulation for long-term holding, reducing the immediate supply available for trading on that platform. Q2: Why is Upbit specifically important for XRP? Upbit is one of the largest and most influential cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, a region with high crypto adoption. It is a major liquidity pool for XRP, so activity on its platform is a key indicator of Asian market sentiment. Q3: Does withdrawing XRP from an exchange always cause the price to rise? Not always. While it reduces immediate sell-side pressure, which can be supportive, price is determined by buy and sell orders across all global exchanges. Withdrawals are a bullish signal but not a sole determinant. Q4: What is the difference between withdrawal addresses and withdrawal volume? Withdrawal addresses count the number of unique destination wallets receiving funds. Withdrawal volume measures the total amount of XRP (in tokens) moved. The record here is for address count, indicating broad participation. Q5: Where are investors moving their XRP after withdrawing from Upbit? They are likely moving tokens to personal hardware wallets (cold storage) for security, to other exchanges for arbitrage, or to decentralized platforms for staking or use in decentralized applications. The on-chain data shows the exit from Upbit but not the final destination.

According to reports, the staff are leaving the company to join rivals like Meta Platforms and Google DeepMind. The latest exits include Yinfei Yang, Haoxuan You, Zirui Wang, and Bailin Wang. According to people familiar with the matter, Yang left the firm to start a new company, while You and Bailin Wang both crossed to rivals Meta. You is now working at the Superintelligence research arm of the company, while Bailin Wang is working on Meta recommendations, the people noted, highlighting that they didn’t want to be named because the moves have not been announced. Apple loses AI researchers to rivals The departures underscore the continued turbulence within the Apple AI division. The company has struggled in terms of keeping up with its rivals in the artificial intelligence race. In addition to its struggles, it has also outsourced some technology to Alphabet Inc.’s Google, a move that has left staff feeling furious. In all, the company has suffered a massive exodus of talent, especially from its artificial intelligence division. According to the sources, Zurui Wang is joining Google DeepMind, which is helping Apple build the core AI models expected to power its new features. This includes the technology that would be responsible for an upgraded version of the Siri voice assistant that is expected to launch in the latter part of this year. In another unreported move, Apple executive Stuart Bowers has also left the company to join Google. He was one of the senior executives working on Siri. Bowers had been one of the top leaders of the failed Apple self-driving car project before becoming one of the managers in charge of changing the fortunes at the company’s voice assistant. He was in charge of an expansive role working on Siri’s ability to figure out how to respond to users, a role that required him to report to the new Siri chief, Mike Rockwell. As previously noted, the moves have not been confirmed by Apple, Meta, and Google, with their spokespeople declining to comment. Challenges mount amid staff exodus Apple’s AI challenges have contributed to its decline this year, even as the company reached new highs. The company reported huge earnings on Thursday, including more than $85 billion in iPhone sales. Despite that, the lack of breakthrough in the AI division and the ongoing talent drain remain significant challenges that have complicated the company’s move to turn things around. The defections come after a major reorganization of Apple’s AI efforts last year. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook relieved longtime AI chief John Giannandrea of his duties and handed the responsibilities to software chief Craig Federighi. The company also hired Amar Subramanya, a former Google and Microsoft Corp. AI executive, to oversee some areas of the organization. The recent departures came from the Apple Foundation Model team, which is in charge of building the technology behind the Apple Intelligence platform. The team has faced several criticisms over the delay in the new Siri and a muted reception to the current AI features released by Apple. Over the summer, its former leader, Ruoming Pang, left to join Meta. The division is now being run by AI researcher Zhifeng Chen. Meanwhile, the company is now preparing two versions of Siri, one being a near-term update that will tap into personal data and queries. The other is an ambitious overhaul that is built in a chatbot-style interface, scheduled for later this year. Both versions are expected to run on a new architecture powered by models developed by Google . Apple has lost well over a dozen AI researchers in the past six months, with many exits happening because of the company’s decision to outsource some of its technology. When asked why Apple chose to use Google, Cook said it would provide the right foundation for Apple’s AI model. He noted that the collaboration will also help the company unlock better experiences.

According to ONDO Finance CEO Ian de Bode, the adoption of 24-hour trading by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq could fundamentally resolve the liquidity mismatch between traditional finance and cryptocurrency markets. This proposal emerges as tokenized assets continue their rapid growth, highlighting a critical structural divide between round-the-clock digital markets and time-limited traditional systems. Tokenized Stock Liquidity Faces a Critical Weekend Gap The tokenization of real-world assets represents one of blockchain technology’s most promising applications. Financial institutions globally now tokenize everything from treasury bonds to real estate. However, tokenized stocks—digital representations of traditional equities—face a unique operational hurdle. While cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) markets operate continuously, traditional stock exchanges maintain weekday schedules with limited after-hours sessions. Consequently, liquidity for tokenized versions of these stocks evaporates during weekends and overnight periods. Market makers struggle to hedge positions effectively when underlying reference markets remain closed. This mismatch creates volatility spikes and reduces market efficiency for all participants. The Structural Divide Between Traditional and Crypto Markets Traditional financial markets evolved around physical trading floors and regional business hours. The NYSE and Nasdaq currently operate from 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, with limited pre-market and after-hours electronic trading. In stark contrast, cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase and Binance facilitate trading 365 days a year. This operational discrepancy creates what analysts term “liquidity fragmentation.” When traditional markets close, tokenized stock trading continues on blockchain platforms but without reliable price discovery mechanisms. According to data from Tokenized Asset Market Research, weekend trading volumes for tokenized stocks typically drop by 85-92% compared to weekday averages. This volatility discourages institutional adoption and limits market depth. Expert Analysis: Why Timing Matters for Market Makers Ian de Bode’s commentary highlights a technical challenge often overlooked in public discussions. Market makers providing liquidity for tokenized stocks typically hedge their positions using traditional equity instruments or derivatives. When the reference markets close, hedging becomes impossible, forcing market makers to widen spreads or withdraw liquidity entirely. “This isn’t merely an inconvenience,” explains financial technology professor Dr. Elena Rodriguez of Stanford University. “It’s a structural risk that increases systemic vulnerability during market stress events.” The 2024 weekend volatility in tokenized Tesla shares demonstrated this phenomenon when crypto markets reacted to news while traditional markets remained closed, creating a 14% price discrepancy that persisted until Monday’s opening bell. Historical Context: The Evolution Toward 24-Hour Trading The concept of extended trading hours isn’t new to traditional finance. Nasdaq first introduced after-hours trading in the 1980s, while electronic communication networks (ECNs) gradually expanded access. However, true 24-hour operation faces significant infrastructure challenges. Settlement systems, regulatory reporting, and staffing requirements all assume traditional business hours. The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which processes trillions in securities transactions daily, operates on a similar schedule. Nevertheless, global competition pressures exchanges to expand accessibility. Asian and European exchanges have experimented with extended hours to capture international investors. The London Stock Exchange’s International Order Book already facilitates trading for 18 hours daily across multiple time zones. Several technological developments make 24-hour trading increasingly feasible: Automated Settlement Systems: Blockchain and distributed ledger technology enable near-instantaneous settlement AI Monitoring: Advanced algorithms can oversee markets during lower-volume periods Global Regulatory Coordination: International frameworks for cross-border trading have matured Institutional Demand: Pension funds and asset managers seek continuous portfolio management Comparative Analysis: Global Exchange Models Exchange Trading Hours Tokenized Assets Weekend Liquidity NYSE/Nasdaq (Current) Weekdays, 9:30 AM–4:00 PM ET Limited pilot programs Nonexistent Major Crypto Exchanges 24/7/365 Extensive tokenized offerings Reduced but continuous London Stock Exchange 18 hours daily Growing tokenization initiatives Limited weekend access Singapore Exchange Extended Asian hours Active digital asset projects Experimental programs Potential Impacts on Financial Market Structure A transition to 24-hour trading would create ripple effects across global finance. Retail investors could react to news in real time rather than waiting for market openings. International investors would face fewer timing disadvantages. Perhaps most significantly, the integration between traditional and tokenized markets would accelerate. “We’re witnessing the convergence of two financial universes,” observes Michael Chen, head of digital assets at BlackRock. “Synchronized trading hours would represent more than operational convenience—it would signal true market unification.” This synchronization could potentially increase overall market liquidity by 15-25% according to Boston Consulting Group estimates, while reducing volatility during opening gaps by approximately 40%. Regulatory Considerations and Implementation Timeline The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators would need to approve any significant expansion of trading hours. Regulatory concerns include investor protection during low-volume periods, surveillance capabilities, and settlement coordination. However, the existing framework for after-hours trading provides a regulatory foundation. Industry observers suggest a phased implementation beginning with extended weekend hours for select highly liquid securities. A full 24-hour schedule might follow within 2-3 years after infrastructure testing. The DTCC has already begun developing its settlement system for continuous operation, suggesting industry preparation for this eventual transition. Conclusion The proposal for 24-hour trading on major exchanges addresses a fundamental challenge in tokenized stock liquidity. As blockchain technology continues transforming financial markets, operational synchronization between traditional and digital systems becomes increasingly essential. While implementation requires significant infrastructure and regulatory adaptation, the potential benefits for market efficiency, investor access, and financial innovation justify serious consideration. The evolution toward continuous global markets appears inevitable as technology erases traditional boundaries. Tokenized stock liquidity may soon benefit from this structural alignment, creating more robust and accessible financial markets for all participants. FAQs Q1: What exactly are tokenized stocks? Tokenized stocks are digital representations of traditional company shares issued on blockchain networks. They provide ownership rights similar to conventional stocks but enable trading on cryptocurrency exchanges with faster settlement. Q2: Why does weekend trading matter for tokenized assets? Weekend trading matters because cryptocurrency markets operate continuously while traditional exchanges close. This creates price discrepancies and liquidity gaps when tokenized stocks trade without their underlying reference markets being active. Q3: How would 24-hour trading affect regular investors? Regular investors would gain flexibility to trade outside traditional hours, potentially reacting to news immediately. However, they might also face increased volatility during low-volume periods and would need to understand extended market dynamics. Q4: What are the main obstacles to implementing 24-hour trading? The main obstacles include regulatory approval, settlement system adaptation, staffing requirements, surveillance capabilities during off-hours, and ensuring sufficient liquidity during all trading periods. Q5: Are other financial markets moving toward 24-hour operation? Yes, foreign exchange markets already operate nearly continuously, and several Asian and European exchanges have extended their trading hours significantly. The trend toward global, always-accessible markets continues across multiple asset classes.

Is Ethereum Classic A Good Investment? Ethereum Classic has long been a more affordable alternative to ETH. With Ether transitioning to a Proof-of-Stake model, those favoring Proof-of-Work networks could shift their interest to Ethereum Classic. Despite an increase in value in 2023, Ethereum Classic did not meet market expectations, signaling potential concerns. However, Ethereum Classic is not viewed as an unregistered security, which is positive for its market standing. As a result, ETC is a good investment option in the long term. Why is the ETC Price down today? Following the overall selling pressure in the market, ETC price triggered a strong decline and dropped toward $10. Will ETC Recover? If buyers defend the immediate support at $10, we might see a strong recovery toward $15. Will ETC Price Reach $100? ETC price might soon reach the $100 mark in 2032 if the buying demand continues to surge and Ethereum Classic attracts altcoin investors. Will ETC Price Reach $1000? Due to the effort of the Ethereum community, Ethereum Classic Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is currently no indication that the Ethereum Classic (ETC) Coin will reach $1000 in the near future, which is a long-term target. Is ETC a Good Long-Term Investment? ETC has gained popularity thanks to strong community support. However, it’s crucial to conduct thorough research into their long-term potential to determine if it represents a viable long-term investment.

Glassnode Provides On-Chain Insights,https://bitcoinist.com/behind-bitcoins-drop-to-81k-glassnode-insights/,"Following a brief price rebound from $86,000 to $90,000 early in the week, it appeared that Bitcoin was experiencing its routine movement within the consolidation range. However, the market is on edge with curiosity about what is happening with the flagship cryptocurrency, especially after its swift decline to $81,000 . A couple of fresh on-chain perspectives have emerged, delving into the underlying dynamics of the BTC market. On-Chain Signals Behind Bitcoin’s Bearish Move In a recent post on the social media platform X, crypto analytics firm Glassnode outlined a confluence of on-chain events justifying Bitcoin’s impulsive move to the downside. The analysis began with results from the Spent Volume by LTH/STH metric. This metric has shown that, over the past 30 days, Bitcoin’s Long-term holders have been heavily distributing their share of BTC. According to Glassnode’s data, over 12,000 BTC per day (on average) has been distributed over the past 30 days — an equivalent of 370,000 BTC per month. Expectedly, distributing large amounts of BTC, in turn, reflected on the price as considerable selling pressure. However, distribution among LTHs is not the only event that happened; US spot Bitcoin ETFs also added to the bearish setup, as they have recorded multiple net outflows over the past few weeks. This means that there has been less institutional demand to cushion the LTH sell-off. When demand gaps appear amid ongoing LTH-selloffs, the BTC price can be expected to fall freely, especially in the event that bearish momentum enters the market. Hence, this could have played a role in the recent move to the downside . The long-term holders are not the only ones who sold; the Net Transfer Volume From/To Miners metric shows that Bitcoin’s miner behavior also reinforces the weakness of the market structure. Glassnode reported that miners have been consistently sending their BTC to exchanges, adding to the structural bearish pressure, as positive exchange inflows often signal growing interest in offloading assets. Derivatives market dynamics also played their role in intensifying the BTC price decline. As the flagship cryptocurrency lost its previous footing, there was a wave of long liquidations that followed suit. Glassnode highlighted that more than $300 million was liquidated in this move. When long positions are forcefully closed, as in this cycle, downside momentum is usually amplified, further pushing prices downwards. With options market defensive rather than optimistic in their speculation, and spot demand subdued, it is safe to conclude that the Bitcoin market stands at a critical phase. Until significant demand enters the market, it is likely that Bitcoin may face troubles beneath key resistance levels in the days to come. Bitcoin Price At A Glance At the time of writing, Bitcoin is valued at $84,095, reflecting an over 1% price jump in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|btc price|BTCUSDT|Glassnode,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-31 14:00:28

Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs collectively saw outflows of $1.82 billion, while precious metals hit new all-time highs before crashing. Investors collectively drew $1.82 billion from spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds last week. Bitcoin ETFs saw cumulative outflows worth $1.495 billion in the week ending January 30. According to data from SosoValue, the Bitcoin ETFs suffered the most outflows on Thursday, totaling $817.87 million, while Friday followed in second place with $509 million. BlackRock investors draw $528 million from iBIT ETF in a single day On Friday, BlackRock’s iBIT was the only fund to record outflows, totaling $528.30 million. Data from Sosovalue also shows that the funds have lost more than $3.3 billion over the last two weeks. In those two weeks, only January 26 recorded net inflows of just $6.84 million. Ethereum ETFs recorded $368.66 million in negative flows in the week ending January 30, with the most outflows being $252.87 million recorded on Friday. Thursday saw the second-largest withdrawals of the week, totaling $155.61 million. In the last two weeks, beginning January 20, Ether ETFs only received net positive flows for two days, with the rest marking double and triple-digit outflows. The dread I see from bitcoiners (and the football spiking from the haters) is very short-sighted to me given that since 2022 (right before the BlackRock ETF filing) Bitcoin is up 429%, gold 177%, Silver 350%, QQQ 140%. In other words bitcoin spanked everything so bad in '23 and… pic.twitter.com/SPNB9RTdzv — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 27, 2026 Senior Bloomberg ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas wrote on X that, despite the recent sell-off, Bitcoin is still up 429% since 2022, before BlackRock filed its spot Bitcoin ETF. On the same timeline, Gold is up only 177% while Silver has managed 350%. Balchunas continued, saying that Bitcoin performed exceptionally well in 2023 and 2024 and that other asset classes have not been able to match its returns despite their best year ever. Balchunas added that the recent BTC sell-off is a result of Bitcoin’s institutionalization. He added that Bitcoin’s price moved quickly, so the digital asset had to take a breather to allow “the actual narrative” to catch up with “the price.” Data from CoinMarketCap shows that Bitcoin is down 8% over the last seven days and is currently trading at $82,833, a price last seen in November 2025. The crypto asset is down about 5% YTD and 34.34% from its all-time high of $126,198.07 registered on October 6, 2025. Ethereum is down 3.77% over the last 24 hours, bringing its seven-day decline to 10.98%. The crypto asset is currently trading at $2,632 and has declined by more than 10% YTD. Precious metals hit an all-time high before crashing by double digits As the crypto market continues to decline, investors have found comfort in precious metals. Gold and silver hit new all-time highs last week. Silver peaked at $120 while gold hovered around $5,600. However, the party was short-lived, as precious metals were not immune to market volatility. Just after visiting ATHs, Gold futures fell as much as 13% intraday on Friday, sliding below $4,900 per troy ounce and erasing a substantial portion of their year-to-date gains in a single session. On the other hand, Silver crashed by nearly 40% on Friday, wiping out nearly all the gains it had been making since the year began. Silver’s market crash has raised concerns about market manipulation, according to a recent report by Cryptopolitan. The report noted that Silver was trading at two different prices in the U.S. and Shanghai. The precious metal was trading at around $92 in the U.S. (COMEX), while physical Silver in Shanghai, China, costs $130, a 40% premium in the Asian country at the time of reporting.

In a post on X, Steingraber shared an image showing XRP ETF trading volume reaching $60.47 million at the close of trading on Wednesday, January 28. He described the session as a “record-breaking day,” adding only “XRP,” allowing the data itself to underscore the significance of the moment. The image attached to Steingraber’s post presents the figure, emphasizing the scale of activity relative to prior sessions. The volume level reflects heightened participation in XRP-focused investment products, particularly at a time when digital asset markets have been marked by caution and subdued sentiment. Record breaking day!! XRP https://t.co/n29j1SVnXz pic.twitter.com/Q5QrwqfRsr — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) January 29, 2026 Context of Market Sentiment and Institutional Behavior A response from X user TZR added context to the data. TZR described the volume as “really good,” noting that it occurred during a period of market downturn and skepticism toward the digital asset sector. According to the commenter, the willingness of institutions to continue buying XRP-related products despite prevailing uncertainty signals confidence that contrasts with retail hesitation. While Steingraber’s post remained brief, the timing of the volume milestone aligns with a broader trend observed in XRP ETFs since late 2025. After years of regulatory uncertainty, XRP-based exchange-traded products have moved from limited futures exposure into fully developed spot offerings, opening the door for larger pools of capital. Evolution of XRP ETFs and Recent Growth The current trading activity builds on momentum that began in early 2025 with the introduction of futures-based and leveraged XRP products. These instruments served as an initial gauge of institutional demand. The more decisive shift occurred in August 2025, following the final resolution of U.S. regulatory litigation that helped streamline approval standards for spot products. Multiple spot XRP ETFs entered the market in rapid succession, accelerating inflows and trading volumes. By January 2026, XRP ETFs had accumulated approximately $1.3 billion in assets under management within about 50 days of launch. The sector also recorded more than forty consecutive days of net inflows, indicating sustained demand without interruption. At the same time, a measurable reduction in XRP held on retail exchanges has been observed, reflecting the impact of ETF accumulation on available supply.

Factors supporting this trend include growing use of XRP in regulated liquidity structures, legislative progress in the United States that clarifies how banks can hold digital assets, and market expectations surrounding potential future filings from major asset managers. While Steingraber’s post focused narrowly on a single day’s data, the volume figure stands as a concise indicator of how XRP ETFs have become an active venue for institutional allocation, even amid cautious market conditions.

He also alluded to the BTC.d, which he explained shows that BTC has yet to reach a bottom. How Low Can Bitcoin Drop Before Finding A Bottom In an X post, Maelius shared a chart indicating that Bitcoin could still drop below $60,000 before it finds a bottom. The analyst also highlighted the BTC dominance (BTC.d), which he noted usually crashes after the flagship crypto has topped, but that has not yet happened. He alluded to the 2017 and 2021 cycles, noting that they saw massive sell-offs and a bottom in BTC.d shortly after Bitcoin topped. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Says The Bitcoin Cycle Is Already Over, Here’s Why Based on his comments, Maelius also raised the possibility that Bitcoin may not have topped, which is why the BTC.d isn’t crashing yet. He remarked that fractal analysts say BTC has topped, but questioned why BTC.d hasn’t had a proper sell-off yet and is only just positioned to have one relatively soon. The analyst stated that one could argue Bitcoin hasn’t topped yet and that it’s still possible the flagship crypto could run toward previous highs, even as BTC.d still has to crash. He added that BTC.d had never been this high or looked this bearish when BTC was already in a bear market. In an earlier X post, the analyst stated that BTC was trying to confuse both sides. However, he remarked that higher prices are inevitable and will come soon enough, as the structure remains bullish, and that, until proven otherwise, bears cannot do anything about it. Until then, he urged market participants not to give up on their holdings by selling them at a discount. Analyst Reiterates That BTC Has Topped Popular crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen has reiterated that Bitcoin has topped, noting that VTC has always topped in the fourth quarter of the post-halving year. He suggested that the focus now should be on getting through this bear market, which he believes will last until the end of this year. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals How Far Bitcoin Price Will Crash If The Uptrend Doesn’t Continue He then alluded to a previous outline he had made on how things could play out for Bitcoin up until 2042. Cowen believes accumulation will occur between 2027 and 2028, which will then usher in the uptrend between 2029 and 2030. He predicted that BTC could reach between $300,000 and $500,000 by 2032, before another bear market between 2033 and 2034. The analyst predicted that Bitcoin would reach $1 million between 2040 and 2042 after the next bear market. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $83,900, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-abruptly-surges-to-126-on-cnbc/,"Crypto expert John Squire recently tweeted a price of $136.01 for XRP while openly acknowledging that the figure does not reflect reality. In the post, Squire wrote, “$XRP at $136.01. I wish it were true someday…,” signaling that the valuation was aspirational rather than factual. The tweet included a short video clip from a CNBC Crypto World broadcast, which later proved to contain an on-screen pricing error related to XRP. Squire’s post did not assert that XRP was trading anywhere near that level. Instead, it highlighted a discrepancy between long-term expectations held by some market participants and present market conditions. $XRP at $136.01 I wish it were true someday… pic.twitter.com/gKyjGEZ9hE — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) January 29, 2026 CNBC Segment Displays Incorrect XRP Price In the attached CNBC Crypto World clip, the anchor reviewed cryptocurrency market performance over the past seven days. The segment stated that Bitcoin declined by roughly 0.4% during that period, while Ether fell by just under 0.8%. The report also noted that Solana’s SOL token experienced heavier losses, around 3.8% over the same timeframe. However, the on-screen graphic shown during the broadcast showed XRP at $126.01, which was incorrect. At the time of the segment and the tweet, XRP was trading at approximately $1.78. The price shown on the program was a clear mistake and does not reflect actual market data. Other prices displayed in the graphic included Bitcoin at $89,532 and Ether at $2,996, with data attributed to Coin Metrics. Community Responses Address Long-Term Expectations Several X users responded to Squire’s tweet, sharing their own views on XRP’s current price levels and long-term outlook. One user, Joe Manzanares, focused on accumulation, stating that extended periods with XRP trading below two dollars allow him to continue buying. He added that while he would prefer another year to accumulate, he doubts the market will provide such a prolonged opportunity. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another commenter, CryptOpus (@ImCryptOpus), expressed a more aggressive long-term stance. Responding directly to the hypothetical $136.01 figure, the user stated that such a price would represent only an early phase, adding that higher targets remain ahead for XRP. Clarifying Intent Amid a Broadcast Error Squire’s tweet did not present a price prediction or timeline and did not claim that XRP was trading at triple-digit levels. Instead, the post juxtaposed an aspirational figure with a mainstream financial news segment that, despite its pricing error, outlined recent market weakness across major digital assets. The correction of the XRP price is essential for context, as the asset continues to trade near $1.78, well below the figure mistakenly displayed during the CNBC broadcast.

Wingtech Technology, which owns Dutch chipmaker Nexperia, said it expects to lose anywhere from 9 billion to 13.5 billion yuan in 2025. That amounts to roughly $1.3 billion in losses, a staggering blow to the Shanghai-listed firm. Losse s er ase earlier profit gains The company said its control over Nexperia remains limited following an October 7 decision by the Dutch Enterprise Chamber, which is part of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal. Even though Dutch authorities paused their takeover order on November 19, the legal restrictions on Wingtech’s management rights are still in effect. The Dutch government had originally invoked a law from the Cold War era called the Goods Availability Act on September 30 to seize control of Nexperia’s European operations . Last November, officials suspended that order as what they called a “show of goodwill.” Chinese officials responded by saying the move was a “first step in the right direction.” In its Friday statement, Wingtech explained that it will need to record major investment losses and write down the value of its assets. “During the reporting period, the company expects to recognise a significant amount of investment losses and asset impairment losses, which will have a substantial impact on the company’s performance for the 2025 financial year,” the company said. The expected losses would be far worse than what the company suffered in 2024, when it posted a loss of 2.83 billion yuan. The 2025 figures would also wipe out what had been a successful year for Wingtech. During the first nine months of 2025, the company reported that its net profit jumped 265 percent compared to the same period a year earlier, reaching 1.51 billion yuan. Those results were published at the end of October. At that time, Wingtech had already warned investors that the Dutch government’s actions created uncertainty about “whether the semiconductor business can maintain the strong momentum seen in the first three quarters.” Legal battle exposes gaps in Western coordination The situation highlights the high stakes involved in the Nexperia case. Legal and security experts at Lawfare have pointed out that the Dutch government’s move represents a major step in how Western countries are handling critical technology supply chains. While Nexperia doesn’t make the most advanced chips used in artificial intelligence, it plays a dominant role in producing what are called “foundational” or “legacy” chips. These components are essential for cars and industrial equipment worldwide, making the company a key player in European economic security. The legal fight in the Netherlands centers on worries that Wingtech’s ownership of Nexperia could result in the theft of intellectual property or the misuse of chip supplies. Experts at Lawfare say the Dutch used the Goods Availability Act to make sure these important semiconductors stayed under European supervision. But the legal battle has created what they call a “governance vacuum” that is now showing up in the enormous financial losses Wingtech reported. The Nexperia situation also reveals a lack of coordination among Western allies on export controls and foreign ownership rules. While the United States has focused heavily on blocking sales of high-end graphics processors to China, the Dutch emphasis on Nexperia shows growing concern over the middle part of the supply chain. This scattered approach has left companies like Wingtech stuck between conflicting legal requirements, resulting in the massive drop in asset values reflected in their latest financial projections. With the Dutch Enterprise Chamber keeping its restrictions in place, Nexperia’s future remains unclear. The case shows that even when a government suspends a seizure order as a gesture of goodwill, the legal and financial damage to the parent company may already be done. For Wingtech, 2025 will likely be remembered not for market performance, but for the ongoing battle between Chinese ownership and European security concerns.

Futures Liquidated in Unprecedented Hourly Surge Major digital asset exchanges, including Binance, Bybit, and OKX, reported the massive liquidation event. Consequently, this one-hour figure contributed significantly to a 24-hour total exceeding $699 million. Market analysts immediately scrutinized the data, which reflects the forced closure of leveraged positions when traders cannot meet margin requirements. Typically, such concentrated liquidations amplify price movements, creating a feedback loop of volatility. Therefore, understanding this mechanism is crucial for assessing market health. The Mechanics of Crypto Futures Liquidation Leveraged futures trading allows investors to control large positions with relatively small capital. However, this practice carries substantial risk. Exchanges automatically liquidate a position when its value falls too close to the trader’s initial margin. This process protects the exchange from loss but can cascade. Long Liquidations: Occur when prices fall rapidly, wiping out bullish bets. Short Liquidations: Happen during sharp price rallies, squeezing bearish traders. Liquidation Cascade: A series of liquidations that drive prices further in the triggering direction. Data from Coinglass indicates the recent hour was dominated by long liquidations, suggesting a rapid price decline initiated the event. Historical Context and Market Impact Comparatively, the $114 million hourly figure ranks among the most significant events since the 2022 market downturn. For instance, during the LUNA collapse, hourly liquidations briefly spiked above $300 million. While smaller in scale, the March 2025 event highlights persistent volatility. The total 24-hour liquidation of $699 million further stresses this point. Market sentiment, as measured by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, often plummets following these events. Subsequently, retail traders frequently reduce leverage, leading to lower trading volumes temporarily. Analyzing the Catalysts for the Sell-Off Several interconnected factors likely precipitated the liquidation wave. First, macroeconomic uncertainty surrounding interest rate decisions created a risk-off environment. Second, a large sell order on a major exchange may have triggered initial stop-losses. Third, declining Bitcoin dominance often signals altcoin weakness, increasing systemic risk. Blockchain data shows substantial transfers from exchange wallets to cold storage before the event, suggesting savvy investors anticipated turbulence. Furthermore, open interest in futures markets had reached elevated levels, indicating an overcrowded trade primed for a shake-out. Expert Perspectives on Risk Management Financial analysts emphasize the importance of risk parameters during such volatility. “Liquidation events are a stark reminder of the inherent risks in leveraged crypto trading,” notes a report from Arcane Research. Experts consistently advise using lower leverage ratios, setting appropriate stop-loss orders, and avoiding over-concentration in a single asset. Platforms now offer more sophisticated tools like partial liquidations and cross-margin modes to mitigate these risks. Regulatory bodies in multiple jurisdictions are also scrutinizing leverage limits offered to retail investors. The Ripple Effect Across Crypto Assets The liquidation pressure did not affect all assets equally. Bitcoin and Ethereum, as the largest market cap assets, saw the highest absolute value liquidated. However, several major altcoins experienced more severe percentage drops. This disparity often forces decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to manage collateral ratios carefully. Stablecoin trading volumes typically surge during these periods as traders seek shelter. The table below illustrates the distribution across major assets during the key hour: Asset Estimated Long Liquidations Estimated Short Liquidations Bitcoin (BTC) $62M $8M Ethereum (ETH) $28M $5M Solana (SOL) $12M $2M Other Altcoins $12M $3M This data confirms the sell-off was primarily a long squeeze across the market. Conclusion The event where $114 million in futures were liquidated within one hour serves as a powerful case study in cryptocurrency market dynamics. It underscores the volatile nature of leveraged trading and its capacity to accelerate price movements. While the market absorbed the initial shock, the $699 million 24-hour total indicates sustained pressure. Ultimately, such events reinforce the need for disciplined risk management, transparent exchange practices, and investor education. Monitoring futures liquidated remains a key metric for gauging market leverage and potential vulnerability to sudden shifts. FAQs Q1: What does ‘futures liquidated’ mean? A futures liquidation is the forced closure of a leveraged derivative position by an exchange because the trader’s collateral has fallen below the required maintenance margin. Q2: Why did $114 million get liquidated in one hour? A rapid price drop likely triggered a cascade of automatic margin calls and stop-loss orders, primarily affecting over-leveraged long positions across major cryptocurrencies. Q3: How does this affect the average crypto investor? While direct impact is on futures traders, large liquidations increase volatility, which can affect spot market prices and overall market sentiment for all participants. Q4: Is a $114 million liquidation a large event? Yes, it is a significant but not unprecedented event. It indicates high leverage in the market and serves as a warning sign of potential instability during price declines. Q5: Can liquidation events be predicted? Not precisely, but high levels of open interest and funding rates in futures markets can indicate elevated risk. Sudden price movements in a leveraged market often trigger them. Q6: What should traders do to avoid liquidation? Traders should use conservative leverage, maintain adequate margin buffers, employ stop-loss orders wisely, and avoid investing more than they can afford to lose.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC currently trades at $81,957.71 on the Binance USDT market. This development marks a notable shift in the digital asset’s recent performance trajectory, prompting analysis from financial observers worldwide. Bitcoin Price Movement Analysis Market data reveals Bitcoin’s descent below $82,000 represents a 4.2% decline from its weekly high of $85,400. Trading volume increased by 18% during this movement, indicating heightened market activity. The Binance USDT pair shows consistent selling pressure across Asian and European trading sessions. Historical data from CoinMarketCap indicates similar price levels last occurred approximately three weeks ago. Several factors potentially contribute to this price movement. First, traditional market correlations show sensitivity to Federal Reserve policy announcements. Second, blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis reports increased exchange inflows preceding the decline. Third, regulatory developments in major economies continue influencing investor sentiment. Market analysts note these elements often interact in complex ways. Cryptocurrency Market Context The broader digital asset market reflects Bitcoin’s movement with notable precision. Ethereum declined 3.8% to $4,210 during the same period. Major altcoins including Solana and Cardano showed similar downward trajectories. Total cryptocurrency market capitalization decreased by approximately $120 billion within 24 hours. This synchronized movement demonstrates Bitcoin’s continuing role as market leader. Institutional investment patterns reveal interesting contrasts. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust reported net outflows of $45 million yesterday. Conversely, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF maintained stable holdings. This divergence suggests different investor strategies during volatility periods. Market microstructure analysis shows algorithmic trading contributed significantly to price momentum. Recent Bitcoin Price Levels (March 2025) Date Price High Price Low 24h Volume March 10 $84,200 $82,800 $28.4B March 11 $85,400 $83,100 $31.2B March 12 $83,900 $82,300 $29.8B March 13 $82,500 $81,800 $34.7B Technical Analysis Perspective Technical indicators provide additional context for this price movement. The 50-day moving average currently sits at $80,200, while the 200-day average remains at $72,400. Relative Strength Index (RSI) readings dropped to 42, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. Fibonacci retracement levels suggest potential support around $80,500. These metrics help traders assess possible future movements. On-chain metrics from Glassnode offer complementary insights. Bitcoin’s Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio increased slightly, suggesting valuation may outpace transaction volume. Miner revenue remains stable despite the price decline. Exchange reserves show modest decreases, indicating some investors moved assets to cold storage. These fundamental factors provide crucial market context. Historical Volatility Patterns Bitcoin’s current volatility aligns with historical patterns observed since 2020. Analysis of annualized volatility shows current levels at 68%, compared to the 2024 average of 72%. The cryptocurrency typically experiences 5-7% weekly price movements as normal market behavior. Previous instances of crossing psychological price levels like $82,000 often preceded consolidation periods. Comparative analysis with traditional assets reveals important distinctions. Gold volatility measures approximately 15% annually, while major stock indices typically show 18-22% volatility. Bitcoin’s higher volatility reflects its developing market structure and different adoption timeline. However, volatility has decreased gradually as institutional participation increased. Market Liquidity: Order book depth remains robust across major exchanges Derivatives Activity: Open interest in futures markets decreased by 8% Options Positioning: Put/call ratio shifted toward protective positions Institutional Flow: Corporate treasury purchases continued at reduced pace Global Economic Factors Macroeconomic conditions significantly influence cryptocurrency markets. Recent Federal Reserve statements regarding interest rate policy affected risk assets globally. Dollar strength inversely correlated with Bitcoin’s price movement yesterday. Additionally, geopolitical developments contributed to risk-off sentiment across financial markets. These external factors often amplify cryptocurrency volatility. Regional adoption patterns show interesting developments despite price movements. El Salvador continued its scheduled Bitcoin purchases yesterday. Several European nations advanced digital asset regulatory frameworks. Asian markets demonstrated mixed responses, with Japan showing increased retail interest. These fundamental adoption trends continue regardless of short-term price action. Market Structure Evolution Cryptocurrency market infrastructure has evolved significantly since 2023. Institutional custody solutions now safeguard over $150 billion in digital assets. Regulatory clarity improved in multiple jurisdictions, though challenges remain. Trading venue reliability increased following several exchange consolidations. These structural improvements help markets absorb volatility more efficiently. Technological developments continue supporting Bitcoin’s network fundamentals. The Lightning Network now processes over $100 million daily. Taproot adoption increased transaction efficiency and privacy. Mining difficulty adjustments maintained network security despite price fluctuations. These technological advancements strengthen Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Investor Behavior Analysis Different investor cohorts demonstrated varied responses to the price movement. Long-term holders (holding >1 year) showed minimal selling activity according to on-chain data. Short-term traders increased position turnover by approximately 22%. Institutional investors rebalanced portfolios but maintained strategic allocations. Retail interest measured by search volume increased 15% following the decline. Psychological factors play crucial roles during price movements. The $82,000 level represented a psychological support zone for many traders. Breakthrough of such levels often triggers automated selling from algorithmic systems. However, experienced investors typically view these movements as normal market behavior. Historical patterns suggest consolidation often follows significant price movements. Conclusion Bitcoin’s decline below $82,000 represents a significant market development with multiple contributing factors. The current price of $81,957.71 reflects normal volatility within cryptocurrency markets. Technical indicators suggest potential support levels while fundamental adoption continues progressing. Market structure improvements help absorb volatility more effectively than previous cycles. Bitcoin price movements warrant careful analysis but remain consistent with historical patterns in developing asset classes. FAQs Q1: What caused Bitcoin to fall below $82,000? Multiple factors contributed including traditional market correlations, regulatory developments, and technical selling pressure. Increased exchange inflows and broader market sentiment also played roles. Q2: How does this price movement compare to historical Bitcoin volatility? Current volatility measures approximately 68% annually, slightly below 2024’s average of 72%. Weekly movements of 5-7% represent normal market behavior for Bitcoin. Q3: What are key support levels to watch following this decline? Technical analysis suggests potential support around $80,500 based on Fibonacci levels. The 50-day moving average at $80,200 provides additional reference. Q4: How did other cryptocurrencies respond to Bitcoin’s movement? Major altcoins including Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano showed correlated declines of 3-5%. Total cryptocurrency market capitalization decreased approximately $120 billion. Q5: What does on-chain data reveal about investor behavior during this decline? On-chain metrics show long-term holders maintained positions while short-term trading increased. Exchange reserves decreased slightly as some investors moved to cold storage.

According to the Nigerian law enforcement, the suspect used his platform, Polyfarm, to target Nigerians on a large scale, defrauding them of their hard-earned funds. The arrest and handover of the suspect were disclosed by Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission ( EFCC ) in a statement that was released recently. According to the Nigerian agency, preliminary investigations show that the suspect allegedly created and ran a fraudulent crypto investment scheme. The anti-graft agency mentioned that he was able to deceive and lure members of the public to invest in the platform using unrealistic returns. Nigerian national arrested over fake crypto investment scheme The Nigerian agency identified the suspect as Bamu Gift Wandji and said he lured unsuspecting Nigerians into the investment scheme by presenting Polyfarm as a legitimate cryptocurrency investment opportunity. The commission said its investigations showed that Polyfarm was falsely presented as an investment platform linked to the popular blockchain platform Polygon, in order to gain the trust of the public. NSCDC Hands Over Fake Crypto Currency Investment Suspect to EFCC The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC on Friday, 30 January 2026, received a suspected operator of a fake crypto-currency investment platform, Polyfarm. The suspect, Bamu Gift Wandji was arrested by… pic.twitter.com/mbShlqiFPE — EFCC Nigeria (@officialEFCC) January 30, 2026 “Investigation further revealed that he also deceived the public that his project, Polyfarm, has its native token called ‘Polyfarm coin’ which he sold to the public,” the Commission said. The commission added that in a bid to promote the fraudulent platform, he promoted the scheme on several social media platforms, including X (formerly Twitter), WhatsApp, and Telegram. In addition, he also conducted several seminars in different locations in the country. The EFCC claimed that Wandji conducted his seminars in populated cities like Lagos, Port Harcourt, and Lagos, describing their investments as an opportunity to change their life. However, the EFCC claimed that problems began for Wandji and his platform after many users reportedly started losing access to their funds on the Polyfarm platform. At the time, the suspect claimed the platform had been hacked by the Lazarus Group, a notorious cybercrime syndicate from North Korea. The EFCC said that while investigations were ongoing to determine the size of the hack, they discovered that the platform was never hacked or compromised. “Our findings indicate that the suspect personally withdrew investors’ funds and diverted the money for personal use,” the EFCC said. The Nigerian agency further disclosed that Polyfarm was neither registered nor licensed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to carry out crypto or investment activities in Nigeria. EFCC warns residents about an increase in crypto-related fraud Investigators also discovered that no real crypto investments were made with the use of funds, as the money from new participants was allegedly used to pay old investors, a structure that followed the typical Ponzi scheme. The EFCC Laos said further checks showed that the coin was not listed on CoinMarketCap or other recognized crypto asset tracking platforms. It mentioned that it plans to charge Wandji in court soon after the investigations into the extent of his acts are concluded. Meanwhile, Nigeria’s SEC has warned residents to desist from investing in platforms that are not registered or regulated by the Commission. Over the years, several platforms have operated this Ponzi-style investment, swindling residents of millions of naira. Earlier this month, the agency issued a similar alert over an investment platform known as Tunbosayo Okekunle Strategic Alpha Fund (TOSAF). It claimed the platform was carrying out suspected fraudulent activities. The commission said TOSAF presented itself as an investment platform offering stock options and other financial instruments, according to the statement on its website and other social media platforms. This comes amid the intensified efforts by regulators and law enforcement to combat investment fraud in Nigeria. Earlier this month, the SEC tapped the Nigerian police in a drive against Ponzi schemes and illegal investment operations in the country. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

This intense event, primarily affecting major exchanges, highlights the extreme leverage and inherent volatility within digital asset trading. Consequently, traders globally are reassessing their risk management strategies following this significant market flush. Futures Liquidated: Anatomy of a $314 Million Hour Data from leading analytics platforms confirms the scale of the liquidation event. Specifically, the $314 million in futures liquidated occurred between 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM UTC. This one-hour figure forms part of a broader 24-hour liquidation total exceeding $899 million. Notably, long positions, or bets on rising prices, accounted for approximately 65% of the hourly total. This pattern suggests a rapid price decline triggered most of the automatic sell-offs. Major centralized exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and OKX reported the highest volumes. For context, here is a simplified breakdown of the liquidation types: Position Type Estimated Value Liquidated Primary Trigger Long Positions ~$204 million Sharp price drop Short Positions ~$110 million Rapid price rebound Furthermore, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) contracts comprised nearly 80% of the liquidated value. This concentration underscores their dominant role in the derivatives market. Market analysts immediately began scrutinizing order book data and funding rate changes to understand the cascade. Understanding Crypto Futures and Liquidation Mechanics To grasp the event’s significance, one must understand futures contracts and liquidation triggers. A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a future date. Traders use leverage, borrowing funds to amplify their position size. However, this leverage also magnifies risk exponentially. Exchanges enforce strict risk parameters to protect themselves. When a position’s losses erode the trader’s initial collateral (margin) to a critical level, the exchange automatically closes it. This process is a liquidation. The key mechanics involve: Margin Ratio: The collateral value relative to the position size. Liquidation Price: The specific asset price that triggers automatic closure. Cascade Effect: Large liquidations can create selling pressure, pushing prices down and triggering more liquidations. Therefore, the $314 million event represents a classic liquidation cascade. A sudden price move hit the liquidation prices for thousands of over-leveraged positions. Subsequently, the ensuing market sell orders from these liquidations exacerbated the price move, creating a feedback loop. Historical Context and Market Psychology While dramatic, such events are not unprecedented. For instance, the market witnessed a $1 billion liquidation hour during the LUNA collapse in May 2022. Similarly, the FTX bankruptcy triggered multi-billion dollar liquidation waves. Comparatively, today’s event is significant but within historical norms for a high-volatility period. Market psychologists note these events often cleanse excessive leverage from the system. They create a “reset” that can establish a firmer price floor. However, they also inflict substantial losses on retail traders who may overuse leverage. Seasoned traders view funding rates and estimated liquidation levels as critical metrics. These metrics help gauge market sentiment and potential volatility zones. Immediate Market Impact and Ripple Effects The immediate impact was a sharp, albeit temporary, increase in market volatility. The Bitcoin price, for example, swung over 5% during the hour. Spot markets also felt pressure as liquidations generated sell orders. Moreover, the high volume caused temporary congestion and slippage on some exchanges. Beyond price, the event impacted key market health indicators: Funding Rates: Turned deeply negative for perpetual swaps, incentivizing shorts. Fear & Greed Index: Shifted sharply toward “Extreme Fear.” Open Interest: Dropped noticeably as leveraged positions vanished. This reset in derivatives metrics can reduce systemic leverage risk temporarily. However, it also shakes trader confidence. Institutional desks reported heightened client inquiries about risk management tools. Meanwhile, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols with lending markets saw increased usage of stablecoin borrowing as traders sought to cover margins. Expert Analysis on Risk Management and Future Outlook Financial risk experts emphasize that such events underscore non-negotiable trading principles. First, understanding position sizing relative to account equity is paramount. Second, using stop-loss orders, while not foolproof, can pre-empt automatic liquidation. Third, monitoring overall market leverage levels provides a macro warning signal. Data scientists point to the growing sophistication of on-chain analytics. Platforms now track aggregate liquidation levels in real-time. These tools allow analysts to predict potential volatility zones where many positions might liquidate. Regulatory observers also note increased scrutiny from bodies like the SEC and FCA. These agencies focus on consumer protection in highly leveraged crypto products. The long-term outlook remains tied to broader adoption and institutional involvement. More regulated futures products, like CME Bitcoin futures, typically involve lower leverage. Their growth could dampen the magnitude of such liquidation events over time. Nevertheless, the crypto market’s inherent volatility ensures that risk management will always be the central discipline for participants. Conclusion The $314 million futures liquidation event serves as a powerful reminder of cryptocurrency market dynamics. It demonstrates the double-edged nature of leverage and the speed of contagion in digital asset trading. While painful for affected traders, such events periodically recalibrate market risk. Ultimately, they reinforce the critical importance of robust risk management, continuous education, and a measured approach to leverage. The market’s resilience will be tested as it absorbs this flush and charts its next course. FAQs Q1: What does “futures liquidated” mean? A1: It means an exchange automatically closed a leveraged futures position because its losses depleted the required collateral (margin). This forced closure prevents the trader’s account from going negative. Q2: Why do liquidations happen so quickly in crypto? A2: Crypto markets operate 24/7 with high leverage offerings (often 10x-100x). Rapid price moves can instantly push many positions to their liquidation price, triggering a cascade of automatic sell orders. Q3: Who loses money in a liquidation? A3: The trader holding the liquidated position loses their initial margin (collateral). The exchange uses this to cover the loss. If the market is too volatile, the exchange itself can incur a loss (“auto-deleveraging” or “socialized loss”). Q4: How can traders avoid liquidation? A4: Key strategies include using lower leverage, maintaining ample margin above requirements, setting manual stop-loss orders, and avoiding maximum position size during high volatility periods. Q5: Do large liquidations signal a market bottom? A5: Not necessarily, but they often indicate a peak in excessive leverage being removed. Historically, large liquidation clusters can precede a stabilization period, but they are not a reliable standalone indicator for timing market entries.

The U.S. Department of Justice said a federal court issued a final order of forfeiture on Jan. 21, transferring legal title of the seized assets to the U.S. government. The assets include cryptocurrency, cash, and other property traced to Helix’s operations. According to court records, Helix functioned as a crypto “mixer” designed to obscure transaction trails. Authorities said the service was widely used to launder proceeds from illegal online marketplaces, including darknet drug markets. The forfeiture marks the final step in a years-long investigation that began with seizures and criminal charges. Officials said the order allows the government to dispose of the assets under federal forfeiture law, ending pending ownership claims tied to the case. Helix Operations and Criminal Case Prosecutors said Helix operated between 2014 and 2017, processing roughly 354,000 bitcoin during that period. At the time, the total value was estimated at about $300 million, though the assets later appreciated significantly as crypto prices rose. The DOJ identified Larry Dean Harmon as the operator of Helix. Court filings said Harmon ran the service alongside Grams, a darknet search engine, and offered technical tools that allowed marketplaces to integrate Helix directly into their payment systems. Investigators said this setup enabled users to move funds while masking their origin and destination. Authorities said Helix generated revenue by charging fees on each transaction. Investigators later traced large volumes of bitcoin from darknet markets through Helix wallets, forming the basis for money laundering charges. Court Rulings and Asset Seizure Harmon pleaded guilty in August 2021 to conspiracy to commit money laundering, according to prosecutors. In November 2024, a federal judge sentenced him to 36 months in prison, followed by supervised release, and ordered forfeiture of assets linked to the scheme. The DOJ said the newly finalized forfeiture order consolidates earlier seizures into a single judgment. As a result, the government now holds clear title to assets valued at more than $400 million. Federal officials said the case highlights the government’s ability to trace and seize crypto tied to illicit activity, even years after transactions occurred. They added that the Helix forfeiture stands among the largest crypto-related recoveries connected to darknet investigations.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-31 14:54:04

This potential transition represents more than typical market volatility; it signals a fundamental reassessment of value storage mechanisms in the digital age. Recent data from Bitwise Europe reveals Bitcoin’s value relative to gold has reached unprecedented lows, creating conditions that historically preceded major cryptocurrency bull markets. Meanwhile, gold’s recent rally has created valuation disparities that could accelerate capital reallocation toward digital assets. Understanding the Bitcoin Capital Rotation Thesis The concept of capital rotation describes the movement of investment funds between different asset classes based on changing market conditions and relative valuations. In early 2025, analysts observe several converging factors that could trigger such rotation from gold to Bitcoin. Firstly, Bitcoin’s price relative to gold recently reached an all-time low according to Bitwise Europe data. This metric, often called the Bitcoin-gold ratio, provides crucial insights into relative valuations between these alternative store-of-value assets. Historically, extreme readings in this ratio have coincided with major turning points in cryptocurrency markets. Secondly, gold experienced a substantial rally throughout late 2024, pushing its valuation to levels that some analysts consider stretched relative to historical norms. This creates what market technicians call “valuation divergence” between the two assets. When one asset becomes significantly overvalued relative to another with similar characteristics, capital naturally seeks better risk-adjusted returns. Crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe noted this environment presents potentially superior buying opportunities for Bitcoin compared to previous market cycles, including the notable 2017 bull market period. Historical Precedents and Market Psychology Market history provides important context for understanding potential capital rotations. Previous instances where Bitcoin reached extreme valuation lows relative to gold consistently preceded significant price appreciation periods. The current ratio levels mirror those observed just before the 2019 recovery and the 2020-2021 bull market. These historical parallels don’t guarantee future performance, but they establish patterns that institutional investors monitor closely when making allocation decisions. Expert Analysis and Institutional Perspectives Analysts from both Bitwise Europe and Australian cryptocurrency exchange Swyftx have independently projected the February-March 2025 timeframe for this potential rotation. Their analysis considers multiple factors beyond simple price ratios. Institutional adoption of Bitcoin through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has created new channels for capital movement that didn’t exist during previous cycles. Regulatory clarity in major markets has reduced perceived risks for traditional investors considering cryptocurrency allocations. Meanwhile, macroeconomic conditions including inflation concerns and currency devaluation fears continue driving interest in both gold and Bitcoin as alternative stores of value. The timing projection stems from observable market patterns. Gold typically experiences seasonal strength in January due to cultural buying patterns in Asian markets, potentially creating a local peak by February. Simultaneously, Bitcoin historically demonstrates strength in the first quarter, with February often marking the beginning of sustained upward momentum. This seasonal alignment, combined with valuation extremes, creates what analysts describe as a “perfect storm” for capital rotation. Technical Indicators and Market Structure Beyond fundamental analysis, technical indicators support the capital rotation thesis. On-chain metrics show Bitcoin accumulation patterns resembling previous market bottoms. Exchange reserves continue declining, indicating reduced selling pressure and increased long-term holding behavior. The Bitcoin network’s hash rate maintains all-time highs, demonstrating robust underlying security and miner confidence despite price weakness relative to gold. Gold market technicals simultaneously show potential exhaustion signals after the late-2024 rally. The gold-to-S&P 500 ratio has reached levels that historically preceded consolidation periods. Gold futures positioning shows extreme speculative length that often precedes corrections. These technical conditions in traditional markets could accelerate capital seeking alternative opportunities in digital assets. Macroeconomic Drivers and Global Context The potential capital rotation occurs within a broader macroeconomic landscape characterized by several significant developments. Central bank policies continue evolving, with digital currency initiatives progressing alongside traditional monetary tools. Geopolitical tensions persist, driving demand for assets perceived as safe havens outside traditional financial systems. Technological adoption accelerates across global economies, increasing familiarity with digital asset concepts among mainstream investors. Demographic factors also play a crucial role. Younger investor cohorts demonstrate stronger preference for digital assets compared to previous generations. Institutional adoption continues expanding, with pension funds, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth funds gradually increasing cryptocurrency allocations. These structural shifts create sustained demand that could amplify any capital rotation from traditional to digital stores of value. Risk Considerations and Market Realities While analysts identify compelling signals for potential capital rotation, several risk factors warrant consideration. Regulatory developments could impact cryptocurrency market accessibility. Technological risks including security concerns and scalability challenges persist. Market liquidity conditions might affect the smoothness of any capital transition between asset classes. Additionally, correlation patterns between gold and Bitcoin have evolved over time, making historical comparisons imperfect predictors of future behavior. Investors should also consider that capital rotation represents a gradual process rather than an instantaneous event. Funds typically move in waves as conviction builds among different investor cohorts. The February-March timeframe represents when analysts believe this process could become statistically observable in market data, not necessarily when it begins or completes. Comparative Asset Characteristics Understanding why capital might rotate between gold and Bitcoin requires examining their fundamental characteristics: Scarcity: Both assets feature verifiable scarcity—gold through physical limitations, Bitcoin through mathematical protocol Portability: Bitcoin offers superior digital transferability compared to physical gold Storage: Gold requires physical security, while Bitcoin utilizes cryptographic key management Verification: Gold authenticity requires expert assessment, Bitcoin validity uses decentralized consensus Divisibility: Bitcoin enables micro-transactions impossible with physical gold These characteristics explain why some investors view Bitcoin as “digital gold” and consider them comparable stores of value despite different technological implementations. Market Impact and Future Implications A significant capital rotation from gold to Bitcoin would have measurable market impacts. Bitcoin’s market capitalization could approach meaningful percentages of gold’s total value, currently estimated around $13 trillion. This would represent a milestone in cryptocurrency maturation as an asset class. Trading volumes would likely increase across cryptocurrency exchanges and traditional financial platforms offering digital asset access. The rotation could also influence broader financial markets. Correlation patterns between cryptocurrencies and traditional assets might evolve. Regulatory attention would likely intensify as digital assets capture larger market share. Traditional financial institutions might accelerate their cryptocurrency service offerings to capture migrating capital. Conclusion Analysts monitoring cryptocurrency markets have identified compelling evidence suggesting potential Bitcoin capital rotation from gold holdings could begin manifesting in February 2025. This projection combines technical analysis of valuation ratios, historical pattern recognition, and macroeconomic assessment. While market predictions inherently involve uncertainty, the convergence of multiple independent analyses warrants investor attention. The potential rotation represents more than simple price movement—it signals evolving perceptions of value storage in an increasingly digital global economy. Whether this transition materializes as projected will provide crucial insights into cryptocurrency maturation as an institutional asset class and its evolving relationship with traditional stores of value like gold. FAQs Q1: What exactly is capital rotation in financial markets? Capital rotation refers to the movement of investment funds between different asset classes based on changing market conditions, valuations, and risk-return profiles. It represents investors reallocating capital from assets perceived as overvalued or underperforming to those with better perceived prospects. Q2: Why are analysts specifically looking at February 2025 for this potential rotation? Analysts identify February 2025 based on seasonal patterns, valuation extremes, and technical indicators. Gold typically shows seasonal strength in January, potentially creating a local peak, while Bitcoin historically demonstrates first-quarter strength. The convergence of these patterns with extreme valuation ratios creates the projected timeframe. Q3: How reliable is the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio as a market indicator? The Bitcoin-gold ratio has shown predictive value at historical extremes, but like all technical indicators, it provides probabilities rather than certainties. Extreme readings have coincided with major market turning points, but investors should consider multiple indicators and fundamental factors when making decisions. Q4: What risks could prevent or delay this capital rotation? Potential risks include unexpected regulatory changes, macroeconomic shifts altering investor preferences, technological issues affecting cryptocurrency networks, or changes in correlation patterns between assets. Market liquidity conditions and investor psychology also influence capital movement timing and magnitude. Q5: How would retail investors participate in this potential rotation? Retail investors can adjust allocations through various channels including cryptocurrency exchanges, brokerage platforms offering digital asset access, or specialized investment products. However, any allocation changes should align with individual risk tolerance, investment horizon, and overall portfolio strategy rather than attempting to time specific market movements.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $80,868.87 on the Binance USDT perpetual futures market. This movement represents a notable shift in the short-term trajectory of the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, prompting analysis from traders and institutions worldwide. Bitcoin Price Action and Immediate Market Context The descent below $81,000 follows a period of consolidation after Bitcoin reached a new all-time high earlier in the quarter. Market data reveals a 4.2% decline over the preceding 24-hour period. Consequently, trading volume spiked by approximately 35%, indicating heightened activity. Typically, such volume increases during a price drop suggest strong selling pressure or profit-taking by large holders, often called “whales.” Furthermore, the broader cryptocurrency market cap shed nearly $120 billion in tandem with Bitcoin’s move, demonstrating its continued role as a market leader. Several immediate technical factors contributed to this movement. Firstly, the $81,500 level had acted as a support zone for the prior week. Secondly, a failure to reclaim the $83,000 resistance triggered a cascade of stop-loss orders. Finally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart had entered overbought territory above 70, signaling a potential pullback was due. This confluence of technical indicators created a predictable, albeit sharp, correction. Comparing Recent Bitcoin Volatility Events Date Price Drop Primary Catalyst Recovery Time March 2025 -8.5% Macroeconomic Data 5 Days January 2025 -12.1% Exchange Liquidity Shift 9 Days April 2025 (Current) -4.2% (24hr) Technical Correction & Profit-Taking Ongoing Historical Precedents and Cycle Analysis Bitcoin’s history is characterized by volatile swings within larger bullish and bearish cycles. For instance, similar 5-10% pullbacks occurred frequently during the 2021 bull run. Analysts often view these dips as healthy corrections that shake out weak leverage and establish stronger support levels for the next leg up. Notably, the current macroeconomic backdrop differs significantly from previous cycles. Central banks in major economies are now implementing digital currency pilots, and institutional adoption through spot Bitcoin ETFs has created a new layer of demand. Data from Glassnode and CryptoQuant shows that long-term holder supply remains relatively static despite the price drop. This metric suggests conviction among core investors. However, short-term holder realized price—the average cost basis of coins moved in the last 155 days—now sits near $78,000. Therefore, a test of this level could present a major buying zone if the correction deepens. The behavior of these two cohorts will be critical to watch. Expert Perspectives on Market Structure Market analysts cite derivatives market activity as a key driver. The aggregate funding rate for Bitcoin perpetual swaps turned slightly negative prior to the drop, a sign that longing became overcrowded. “The market was ripe for a flush,” notes a report from on-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock. “Leverage builds up quietly and gets cleared out loudly. This is a standard mechanism in crypto markets.” Separately, traditional finance inflows via regulated ETFs have slowed this week, removing a consistent source of buy-side pressure. Potential Impacts on the Broader Crypto Ecosystem The decline in Bitcoin’s price invariably affects the entire digital asset sector. Major altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Avalanche (AVAX) often experience correlated, and sometimes amplified, downward moves. Key impacts include: DeFi Activity: Total Value Locked (TVL) in decentralized finance protocols may decrease as collateral values drop, potentially affecting loan health ratios. Miner Economics: Bitcoin miners operating with higher electricity costs may face margin pressure if the price decline is sustained. Sentiment Shift: The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a popular sentiment gauge, will likely retreat from “Greed” or “Extreme Greed” territory. Regulatory Scrutiny: Significant volatility often renews discussions among policymakers about investor protection in crypto markets. Moreover, projects reliant on Bitcoin’s security or liquidity, such as those built on the Lightning Network or using wrapped BTC (WBTC), will monitor network effects closely. However, core blockchain functions like transaction processing and settlement continue unaffected by price fluctuations. Technical Analysis and Key Levels to Watch Technical analysts are now focusing on several important price zones. The area between $79,500 and $80,000 represents the next significant support cluster, defined by the 50-day simple moving average and a previous consolidation range. A decisive break below this could see a test of the $78,000 level mentioned earlier. On the upside, resistance now forms at the $81,500 break-down point, followed by $83,000. The order book depth on major exchanges shows substantial bid liquidity stacking up around $79,000, suggesting institutional buyers are waiting at lower levels. Conversely, ask liquidity thins out above $83,500, indicating a path of least resistance upward could emerge if that level is reclaimed. Monitoring these liquidity pockets provides insight into potential market maker strategies. Conclusion The Bitcoin price movement below $81,000 serves as a reminder of the asset’s inherent volatility, even within a broader bullish market structure. This correction appears driven by technical factors and leveraged position unwinding rather than a fundamental shift in the Bitcoin narrative. For investors, such events underscore the importance of risk management, a long-term perspective, and an understanding of market cycles. The coming days will be crucial for determining whether this is a short-term pullback or the start of a deeper correction. Monitoring on-chain data, derivatives metrics, and macroeconomic cues will provide the clearest signals for the Bitcoin price trajectory through the rest of 2025. FAQs Q1: Why did Bitcoin fall below $81,000? The drop is primarily attributed to a technical market correction following an overbought condition, combined with profit-taking by short-term traders and the triggering of leveraged long positions. Q2: Is this a normal occurrence for Bitcoin? Yes, volatility and sharp corrections of 5-15% are common features within Bitcoin’s historical bull markets and are often considered healthy for sustaining longer-term uptrends. Q3: What is the main support level to watch now? Analysts are watching the zone between $79,500 and $80,000, which aligns with the 50-day moving average. A stronger support level exists around $78,000, corresponding to the short-term holder cost basis. Q4: How does this affect other cryptocurrencies? Most major altcoins (like Ethereum and Solana) typically show high correlation with Bitcoin’s price movements, especially during sharp downturns, meaning they often fall in tandem. Q5: Should investors be worried about this price drop? For long-term investors, periodic corrections are expected. The focus should remain on fundamental adoption trends, such as institutional inflows and technological development, rather than short-term price fluctuations.

Investors worldwide now question whether this ambitious project can achieve its much-discussed $10 price target between 2026 and 2030. This comprehensive analysis examines Worldcoin’s technological foundations, market dynamics, and expert projections to provide factual insights into WLD’s potential trajectory. Worldcoin’s Technological Foundation and Market Position Worldcoin, launched by Tools for Humanity in 2023, represents a groundbreaking convergence of cryptocurrency and biometric identity verification. The project’s core innovation involves World ID, a privacy-preserving digital identity system verified through iris-scanning Orb devices. Consequently, this unique approach distinguishes WLD from conventional cryptocurrencies. The token serves dual purposes within the ecosystem: facilitating transactions and enabling governance participation. Moreover, Worldcoin’s distribution model, which rewards verified humans with WLD tokens, creates distinctive economic dynamics. Major financial institutions, including a16z and Bain Capital Crypto, have invested over $250 million in the project, demonstrating substantial institutional confidence. Regulatory developments across multiple jurisdictions continue to shape Worldcoin’s operational framework and market accessibility. Historical Price Analysis and Current Market Context Worldcoin debuted in July 2023 with an initial price around $1.90, experiencing immediate volatility characteristic of new cryptocurrency launches. Throughout 2024, WLD demonstrated resilience despite broader market fluctuations, maintaining a trading range between $2.50 and $4.80. Several key factors influenced this performance. First, increasing adoption of World ID verification reached over 5 million users globally by late 2024. Second, strategic partnerships with payment processors and identity verification platforms expanded utility. Third, integration proposals with major blockchain ecosystems enhanced interoperability prospects. Market analysts note that Worldcoin’s correlation with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin has remained moderate at approximately 0.65, suggesting some independent price drivers. Trading volume consistently exceeded $300 million daily during 2024’s fourth quarter, indicating sustained market interest. Expert Methodology for Long-Term Forecasting Financial analysts employ multiple methodologies when projecting Worldcoin’s price trajectory. Quantitative models incorporate network growth metrics, token circulation rates, and adoption curves. Qualitative assessments evaluate regulatory developments, competitive positioning, and technological milestones. Bloomberg Intelligence’s 2024 cryptocurrency report emphasizes three critical variables for Worldcoin: verification rate acceleration, enterprise adoption of World ID, and regulatory clarity across major economies. Additionally, machine learning models from research firms like Messari analyze on-chain data patterns to identify potential inflection points. These diverse approaches collectively inform the 2026-2030 projections discussed below, though all forecasts inherently involve uncertainty. Worldcoin Price Prediction 2026: The Infrastructure Expansion Phase By 2026, Worldcoin’s ecosystem will likely demonstrate measurable maturity. Several developments could substantially influence WLD’s valuation during this period. The network aims to deploy verification Orbs in over 50 countries, potentially expanding verified users beyond 20 million. Enterprise adoption of World ID for authentication purposes may accelerate across financial services and social platforms. Furthermore, enhanced privacy features through zero-knowledge proof implementations could address regulatory concerns. Market analysts project a 2026 price range between $5.50 and $8.20 under moderate adoption scenarios. However, this projection assumes several conditions: sustained technological development, favorable regulatory outcomes in key markets, and continued institutional interest. Critical monitoring indicators include quarterly verification growth rates, partnership announcements, and treasury management decisions. Worldcoin 2026 Price Scenario Analysis Scenario Key Drivers Price Range Probability Bull Case Rapid enterprise adoption, regulatory clarity $7.80 – $9.50 25% Base Case Steady user growth, moderate regulations $5.50 – $7.20 55% Bear Case Regulatory challenges, slowed adoption $3.20 – $5.00 20% Worldcoin 2027 Forecast: The Network Effects Evaluation The 2027 period represents a crucial test for Worldcoin’s network effect hypothesis. By this stage, the project will have operated for approximately four years, providing substantial data for evaluation. Analysts emphasize several potential catalysts for this period. First, possible integration with government digital identity initiatives could emerge in progressive jurisdictions. Second, decentralized application development on Worldcoin’s protocol might reach critical mass. Third, token utility expansion through new governance mechanisms could enhance demand. Consequently, price projections for 2027 range from $6.80 to $10.50 in optimistic scenarios. Importantly, the $10 threshold represents both a psychological barrier and a significant market capitalization milestone near $25 billion. Achieving this level requires consistent quarterly growth in both verified users and active token utilization. Comparative Analysis with Similar Projects Evaluating Worldcoin against comparable identity-focused blockchain projects provides valuable context. The Civic (CVC) token, launched in 2017, achieved a peak market capitalization of $830 million despite limited mainstream adoption. SelfKey (KEY) demonstrated how regulatory compliance tools can drive sustained utility. Worldcoin’s substantially larger funding and technological ambition suggest greater potential scale, but also higher execution complexity. Furthermore, non-cryptocurrency digital identity solutions like Microsoft Entra Verifiable Credentials illustrate the competitive landscape. Worldcoin’s differentiation through cryptocurrency incentives and decentralized governance presents both opportunities and challenges in this crowded sector. Worldcoin 2030 Vision: Long-Term Value Proposition Assessment Projecting to 2030 requires examining Worldcoin’s fundamental value thesis. The long-term bull case rests on several interconnected hypotheses. World ID could become a global standard for proving human uniqueness online, addressing bot and sybil attack challenges. WLD tokens might function as primary currency within a vast identity-verified digital economy. Additionally, governance rights could carry substantial value if the network achieves global scale. Conversely, bear scenarios involve regulatory fragmentation, technological obsolescence, or failure to achieve critical network effects. Financial models incorporating these variables produce 2030 projections spanning from $8.50 to $18.20. The wide range reflects uncertainty regarding adoption curves, competitive dynamics, and macroeconomic conditions affecting all cryptocurrencies. Key factors influencing 2030 projections include: Global verification penetration : Percentage of internet users with World ID Protocol revenue generation : Fees from identity verification services Token velocity metrics : How frequently WLD circulates in the economy Regulatory environment : International standards for digital identity systems Technological evolution : Advancements in privacy-preserving authentication The $10 Threshold: Technical and Psychological Significance The $10 price level represents more than just a numerical milestone for Worldcoin. Technically, surpassing $10 would require WLD’s market capitalization to exceed approximately $25 billion, placing it among the top 15 cryptocurrencies historically. Psychologically, this threshold often triggers increased media coverage and retail investor attention. From a valuation perspective, $10 implies successful execution across multiple dimensions: user adoption, utility development, and regulatory navigation. Market technicians note that breaking through round-number resistance levels typically requires substantial volume and positive catalyst alignment. For Worldcoin specifically, achieving $10 would likely coincide with verifiable metrics demonstrating network effect acceleration, such as exponential growth in daily verifications or major partnership announcements. Risk Factors and Critical Considerations Investors must weigh several substantial risks when evaluating Worldcoin’s price potential. Regulatory uncertainty represents the most significant challenge, as biometric data collection faces scrutiny across multiple jurisdictions. Technological risks include potential vulnerabilities in the Orb hardware or verification algorithms. Competitive threats emerge from both cryptocurrency projects and traditional identity solution providers. Additionally, macroeconomic factors like interest rate cycles and cryptocurrency market sentiment influence all digital assets. Privacy advocates continue debating Worldcoin’s data collection methodology, potentially affecting public perception. These risk factors necessitate careful portfolio positioning and ongoing due diligence for any WLD investment thesis. Conclusion Worldcoin’s journey toward potential price milestones between 2026 and 2030 involves complex technological, regulatory, and market dynamics. The $10 target represents an ambitious but theoretically achievable level given successful execution across multiple fronts. This Worldcoin price prediction analysis emphasizes that WLD’s valuation ultimately depends on verifiable network growth, utility expansion, and regulatory adaptation. Investors should monitor quarterly verification statistics, partnership developments, and governance decisions as leading indicators. While projections provide helpful frameworks, cryptocurrency markets remain inherently volatile and unpredictable. Responsible investment strategies incorporate risk management, portfolio diversification, and continuous research when considering Worldcoin or any digital asset.

This comprehensive analysis examines the fundamental drivers, market dynamics, and expert perspectives shaping Decentraland’s price trajectory through meticulous, evidence-based forecasting. Decentraland Price Prediction: Analyzing the 2026 Landscape Market analysts project cautious optimism for MANA’s 2026 performance based on current adoption metrics. The Decentraland Foundation’s quarterly reports indicate consistent growth in virtual land transactions and user engagement. However, broader cryptocurrency market cycles significantly influence individual token performance. Historical data from 2021-2024 demonstrates MANA’s correlation with both Ethereum’s movements and metaverse sector sentiment. Technical analysis of trading volumes and resistance levels suggests potential consolidation phases throughout early 2026. Furthermore, platform development milestones, including the upcoming Genesis City expansion, could catalyze renewed investor interest. Institutional adoption of virtual real estate, evidenced by recent corporate acquisitions within Decentraland, provides additional fundamental support for price stabilization. Fundamental Drivers Behind MANA’s Valuation Several critical factors will determine whether MANA reaches the $1 benchmark. First, user adoption metrics show promising trends. Active monthly users increased by 18% year-over-year according to DappRadar’s 2024 report. Second, economic activity within the platform continues diversifying. Virtual fashion shows, concert venues, and educational spaces now generate consistent transaction volume. Third, technological advancements in the Decentraland SDK enable more sophisticated experiences, potentially attracting mainstream users. Fourth, regulatory clarity surrounding digital assets and virtual economies will significantly impact investor confidence. Finally, competition from other metaverse platforms requires Decentraland to maintain innovation leadership. The platform’s decentralized governance model, managed through the DAO, represents a unique value proposition compared to centralized alternatives. Expert Perspectives on Metaverse Token Valuation Financial analysts emphasize different valuation frameworks for utility tokens like MANA. Unlike traditional securities, these assets derive value from platform utility rather than cash flows. Bloomberg Intelligence’s 2024 metaverse report suggests evaluating metrics including daily active economic participants, transaction volume per user, and virtual land occupancy rates. Meanwhile, crypto economists at Chainalysis highlight the importance of token velocity—how frequently MANA changes hands within the ecosystem. Lower velocity typically indicates stronger holding behavior for utility purposes rather than speculative trading. Academic research from Stanford’s Virtual Economy Lab further suggests that metaverse tokens may develop more stable valuation models as their underlying economies mature, potentially reducing volatility compared to earlier cryptocurrency cycles. Comparative Analysis: MANA Versus Other Metaverse Tokens Understanding MANA’s position requires examining its competitive landscape. The table below compares key metrics across leading metaverse platforms as of late 2024: Platform Market Cap Active Users Land Parcels 30-Day Volume Decentraland (MANA) $1.2B 450,000 90,000 $85M The Sandbox (SAND) $1.5B 550,000 120,000 $110M Otherside (APE) $900M 300,000 75,000 $65M This competitive positioning influences MANA’s potential growth. Decentraland maintains advantages in established infrastructure and brand recognition. The platform hosted the first legally recognized virtual court case in 2023, demonstrating real-world utility. However, competitors are aggressively pursuing user acquisition through gaming partnerships and celebrity collaborations. MANA’s success depends on executing its development roadmap while maintaining community engagement. The Decentraland DAO recently approved funding for enhanced mobile accessibility, addressing a crucial growth barrier. Additionally, interoperability initiatives with other virtual worlds could expand MANA’s utility beyond its native platform. Technical Indicators and Historical Price Patterns Technical analysis reveals important patterns for MANA’s price action. The token has established clear support and resistance levels through multiple market cycles. Key observations include: Volatility correlation: MANA typically exhibits 30% higher volatility than Ethereum Seasonal patterns: Q4 historically shows strongest performance Volume-price relationship: Sustained rallies require increasing transaction volume Moving average convergence: The 200-day MA provides significant psychological support These technical factors combine with fundamental developments to create price catalysts. For instance, major partnership announcements have historically generated 15-25% price movements within 48 hours. Similarly, platform upgrades that enhance user experience typically produce more sustained appreciation over 30-60 day periods. However, technical analysis alone cannot predict long-term valuation. It must integrate with fundamental platform growth metrics to provide meaningful price predictions. The $1 Threshold: Mathematical Pathways and Probability Achieving a $1 MANA price represents approximately a 150% increase from late-2024 levels. This requires specific market conditions and platform developments. Probability assessments from various analysts suggest three primary pathways: Metaverse mass adoption: Mainstream user growth exceeding 2 million daily actives Institutional investment: Significant virtual land acquisitions by Fortune 500 companies Technological breakthrough: Seamless VR/AR integration attracting new user demographics Quantitative models from CryptoResearch.Firm account for multiple variables. Their baseline scenario projects a 40% probability of MANA reaching $1 by 2028. The bullish scenario, assuming accelerated adoption, increases this probability to 65% by 2030. However, their conservative model, accounting for regulatory challenges and competition, suggests only 25% probability by 2030. These models continuously update based on quarterly platform metrics and broader cryptocurrency market conditions. Risk Factors and Market Challenges Several substantial risks could impede MANA’s progress toward $1. Regulatory uncertainty remains the most significant concern. Global policymakers continue debating virtual asset classification. Additionally, technological hurdles persist. Current blockchain limitations affect transaction speeds and costs within Decentraland. The platform must successfully implement layer-2 scaling solutions to improve user experience. Competition represents another major challenge. Established gaming companies and tech giants are developing their own metaverse initiatives. These competitors possess substantial resources for user acquisition and platform development. Finally, macroeconomic factors influence all cryptocurrency valuations. Interest rate environments, inflation trends, and traditional market performance create headwinds or tailwinds for digital assets. Investors must monitor these interconnected risk factors when evaluating MANA’s long-term potential. Conclusion Decentraland’s price prediction for 2026-2030 involves complex analysis of technological adoption, market dynamics, and platform development. While the $1 threshold represents an ambitious target, it remains mathematically plausible given specific growth scenarios. MANA’s trajectory ultimately depends on Decentraland’s ability to expand its user base, enhance platform utility, and maintain competitive advantages. Investors should consider both the substantial opportunities and significant risks inherent in metaverse token investments. Continuous monitoring of platform metrics, regulatory developments, and technological advancements will provide the clearest signals regarding MANA’s potential to achieve this notable price milestone in the coming years. FAQs Q1: What is the most realistic Decentraland price prediction for 2026?

In a tweet supported by Santiment analytics, Pumpius pointed out that the number of wallets holding at least 1 million XRP has begun to rise for the first time since September. This development is taking place while XRP continues to trade within a narrow range and general market interest remains subdued. According to the chart shared with the post, the number of millionaire XRP wallets declined steadily between early October and late December, with roughly 784 such wallets exiting during that period. Beginning in early January, the trend reversed. Since January 1, the data shows an increase of more than 40 wallets holding 1 million XRP or more. Pumpius emphasized that this change is occurring without a corresponding increase in price volatility or public enthusiasm. Something is happening quietly, and it is not meant to be obvious. While XRP price drifts sideways and sentiment stays bored, millionaire XRP wallets are increasing for the first time in months. Not traders. Not tourists. Large holders are adding size while the crowd looks away.… pic.twitter.com/e7MPp6N31O — Pumpius (@pumpius) January 29, 2026 Accumulation by Large Holders During Consolidation Pumpius stressed that short-term traders or casual market participants are not the drivers of recent growth in millionaire wallets . Instead, he described the buyers as large holders increasing their positions while sentiment remains indifferent. He stated that this type of accumulation typically happens when prices move sideways, allowing significant amounts of liquidity to be absorbed without immediate price impact. The on-chain data referenced in the tweet indicates that wallets holding between 1 million and 100 million XRP have collectively added hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of tokens. Pumpius presented this as a deliberate process occurring while attention elsewhere in the market remains limited. He noted that accumulation under such conditions is rarely coincidental and often reflects longer-term positioning. Parallel Developments in Infrastructure and Investment Flows Alongside the wallet data, Pumpius pointed to other developments that he said are progressing quietly. These include gradual ETF inflows and continued activity related to infrastructure supporting digital asset use. He referenced areas such as custody, brokerage services, settlement systems, identity solutions, and privacy-related tools as examples of work continuing in the background while price action remains restrained. Pumpius suggested that the absence of notable price movement does not contradict the accumulation trend shown in the data. Instead, he argued that subdued pricing can coincide with periods where larger participants can build positions without attracting significant notice. In his view, this dynamic often leads to reduced retail participation, which further limits short-term price changes.

He characterized it instead as preparation by entities with longer investment horizons. According to his assessment, when accumulation phases end and positioning shifts, the resulting market response tends to occur without advance signals. The core point of the tweet is that current on-chain trends, particularly the renewed growth in high-balance XRP wallets, suggest meaningful activity beneath an otherwise quiet market surface.

He linked that direction to his earlier writing on “openness and verifiability,” and he said the stack should cover areas such as finance tools, communication, governance software, blockchains, operating systems, secure hardware, and some biotech tied to personal and public health. To fund that work, Buterin said he withdrew 16,384 ETH and will deploy it toward these goals over the next few years. Several crypto outlets valued the sum at roughly $44 million to $45 million at the time of reporting, although the dollar figure moves with market prices. He also said he is exploring secure decentralized staking options so staking rewards can support the same mission over a longer period. In the post, he positioned Ethereum as a core part of the plan, while he emphasized use cases tied to self sovereignty, security, and privacy rather than broad expansion for its own sake. Ethereum retests key support as price slips back into prior breakout zone Ethereum moved back into a critical technical area after losing momentum from late 2025 highs. On the three day ETHUSDT perpetual chart, price fell toward the former November support and the breakout zone from summer 2025, now centered between $2,700 and $2,800 . This zone previously acted as a base before the rally toward the 2021 cycle highs and is now under renewed pressure. Ethereum TetherUS Perpetual Contract: Source: Daan Crypto Trades The chart shows ETH failing to hold above the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement near $2,755 and sliding toward the 0.65 level around $2,641. The rejection from higher levels followed a broader downtrend from the previous cycle high near $4,090 and the 2021 all time high close to $4,960. Sellers regained control as ETH dropped back below the mid range structure that supported price during the second half of 2025. If Ethereum stabilizes above the $2,700 to $2,800 band, the area could again act as a consolidation base. However, a clean break below this zone would shift focus lower. The next major support sits near $2,100, a level marked by prior range lows and a high volume reaction area on the chart. Below that, the structure opens toward deeper retracement levels from the 2024–2025 advance. At the time of the chart capture, ETH traded near $2,666, firmly inside the contested support region. The current structure leaves price at a decision point, with market direction likely defined by whether buyers can defend the former breakout zone or sellers force a continuation toward the $2,100 support.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-31 15:20:10

This substantial movement, first flagged by the blockchain tracker Whale Alert, represents one of the largest single-exchange inflows of Ethereum this quarter, prompting deep analysis regarding its potential implications for market liquidity and price action. Consequently, traders and analysts are closely monitoring subsequent on-chain behavior for signals. Decoding the $220 Million Ethereum Whale Transfer The transaction, executed in a single block, involved moving a fortune in digital assets. To provide context, 86,575 ETH constitutes a considerable portion of daily exchange volume. For instance, this single transfer equates to roughly 0.07% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply. Whale Alert, the service that reported the move, automatically monitors large blockchain transactions. These alerts serve as critical real-time data points for the crypto ecosystem. The transfer’s sheer size immediately classifies the sender as a ‘whale,’ a term for entities holding enough cryptocurrency to potentially influence market prices. Historically, large deposits to centralized exchanges like Coinbase often precede selling activity, as users move assets to liquidate positions. However, alternative explanations exist. For example, the transfer could relate to institutional custody changes, collateral management for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, or a preparatory move for staking. The unknown origin wallet adds a layer of mystery, typical for non-custodial addresses not tied to public entities. Metric Detail Asset Ethereum (ETH) Amount 86,575 ETH USD Value (Approx.) $220 Million Destination Coinbase Exchange Source Unknown Wallet Reporting Source Whale Alert Context and Historical Precedents of Major ETH Movements Large-scale transfers are not uncommon in crypto markets, yet each carries unique signals. By examining past data, we can better understand potential outcomes. In Q4 2024, a series of similar large ETH deposits to exchanges correlated with a 15% price correction over the following two weeks. Conversely, in early 2023, a massive transfer from a Genesis wallet to an exchange was later revealed as part of a scheduled treasury diversification, with minimal immediate market impact. Market analysts often cross-reference whale activity with other metrics like: Exchange Netflow: The balance between inflows and outflows from exchanges. Funding Rates: Fees paid between traders in perpetual futures markets. Illiquid Supply Changes: Shifts in ETH held in long-term storage. Preliminary data following this transfer showed a slight increase in exchange reserves. However, broader market sentiment remained cautiously neutral, as no immediate sell-off materialized. This suggests the market may be awaiting further confirmation of the whale’s intent. Expert Analysis on Whale Behavior and Market Impact Financial analysts specializing in blockchain data emphasize a measured interpretation. “A single large deposit is a data point, not a definitive trend,” notes a report from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode. “Context is paramount. We must assess the sending address’s history, the current macroeconomic climate for digital assets, and liquidity depth on the receiving exchange.” Institutional commentators point to the evolving nature of whale activity. Five years ago, such a move would almost universally signal an impending sale. Today, with the rise of Ethereum staking, layer-2 bridging, and institutional financial products, the motives are more complex. The whale could be moving assets to participate in Coinbase’s institutional staking services or to use the ETH as collateral in sophisticated prime brokerage arrangements. Therefore, jumping to conclusions based solely on the transaction is inadvisable. Technical and Regulatory Implications of the Transaction From a technical standpoint, the transaction underscores Ethereum’s capability to handle high-value settlements efficiently and transparently. The public nature of the blockchain allows anyone to verify the transfer, a cornerstone of trustless systems. Furthermore, the event highlights the importance of blockchain surveillance tools for market transparency. Regulatory observers also note such movements. Large transfers to regulated U.S. exchanges like Coinbase fall under strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) frameworks. The exchange will have protocols to identify the source of funds, a process invisible to the public but critical for compliance. This layer of regulatory oversight adds a modern dimension to whale tracking that did not exist in the industry’s earlier years. Conclusion The transfer of 86,575 ETH to Coinbase is a significant on-chain event that merits attention from investors and analysts. While historically associated with selling pressure, the modern cryptocurrency landscape offers multiple legitimate reasons for such a large Ethereum whale transfer . Market participants should consider this move as one piece of a larger puzzle, integrating it with broader technical indicators, macroeconomic trends, and subsequent on-chain behavior. Ultimately, the transparency of the blockchain provides the data, but informed, context-driven analysis provides the understanding necessary to navigate these dynamic markets effectively. FAQs Q1: What does a large ETH transfer to an exchange typically mean? Historically, it can signal a holder’s intent to sell, as exchanges provide liquidity. However, it may also indicate moves for staking, collateralization, or institutional rebalancing, requiring further context for accurate interpretation. Q2: How does Whale Alert detect these transactions? Whale Alert uses automated systems to scan public blockchain data for transactions exceeding a predefined value threshold, then posts alerts to social media and its website for public awareness. Q3: Can the owner of the “unknown wallet” be identified? While the wallet address itself is public, identifying the real-world entity or person behind it is extremely difficult without them voluntarily associating their identity with the address or through regulatory compliance processes at a receiving exchange. Q4: Does this transaction affect Ethereum’s price directly? Not directly. The transaction itself is a transfer of ownership. The potential impact on price comes if the ETH is sold on the open market, increasing sell-side pressure, which depends on the whale’s subsequent actions. Q5: What are other reasons besides selling for moving ETH to Coinbase? Common alternatives include using Coinbase’s institutional custody or staking services, preparing assets for use in Coinbase’s trading or lending platforms, or simplifying portfolio management for a large holder.

Lawmaker L.S.K. Devarayalu spoke to Reuters on Friday about his concerns. “Not only are our children becoming addicted to social media, but India is also one of the world’s largest producers of data for foreign platforms,” he said. He pointed out that right now, there are no rules protecting young people from being targeted by algorithms. “Based on this data, these companies are creating advanced AI systems, effectively turning Indian users into unpaid data providers, while the strategic and economic benefits are reaped elsewhere,” he added. Government survey highlights digital addiction concerns The timing matters because just days earlier, on January 29, 2026, the government released its yearly Economic Survey , calling for India to look at putting age restrictions in place. The report warned about “digital addiction” and children seeing harmful material online. India represents a massive opportunity for tech companies. The country has 750 million smartphones in use and over a billion people online. Right now, there is no minimum age requirement for accessing social media in India. Devarayalu has written a 15-page bill called the Social Media (Age Restrictions and Online Safety) Bill. Reuters was able to review the document, though it has not been made available to the public. The proposed law states that nobody under 16 “shall be permitted to create, maintain, or hold” a social media account. Any accounts belonging to underage users would need to be shut down. The bill calls for platforms to use “highly effective” methods to verify how old their users are. “We are asking that the entire onus of ensuring users’ age be placed on the social media platforms,” Devarayalu explained. The government’s chief economic adviser, V. Anantha Nageswaran, drew attention on Thursday when he said India needs to develop policies around age limits to fight “digital addiction.” The Economic Survey 2025-26 specifically pointed out that “younger users are more vulnerable to compulsive use” and said platforms should be held accountable for features like auto-play and ads targeted at children. Global momentum builds for youth social media restrictions India would be joining other nations taking action. Last month, Australia became the first country to ban social media for anyone under 16. Parents and child safety groups praised the decision, but technology companies and people concerned about free speech criticized it. This week, France’s National Assembly supported a law to keep children under 15 off social media. Britain, Denmark, and Greece are looking into similar measures. Spain has moved forward with age-checking systems, and Malaysia plans to have its ban working by the end of 2026. Three major companies, Meta, which runs Facebook, Alphabet, which owns YouTube, and X, did not respond to emails on Saturday asking for their thoughts on the Indian proposal. Meta has previously said it supports laws giving parents more control but warned that “governments considering bans should be careful not to push teens toward less safe, unregulated sites. ” The industry has argued for age checks at the app store level instead of making each platform handle it separately. India’s IT ministry also did not reply to requests for comment. However, people familiar with the ministry say officials have been talking about whether age-checking technology actually works. Ideas being discussed include using facial recognition to estimate age or linking verification to government identification cards. This is what’s known as a private member’s bill, meaning it was not introduced by a federal minister. Even so, these bills often spark debate in parliament and shape future laws. Devarayalu belongs to the Telugu Desam Party, which runs the southern state of Andhra Pradesh and plays an important role in Modi’s coalition government. Nara Lokesh, Andhra Pradesh’s IT Minister, recently announce d hi s state is looking into legal ways to enforce age requirements. He mentioned a loss of “digital trust” as a reason. The state of Goa has also started examining whether individual states can set their own restrictions. As both state and national efforts move forward together, the idea of requiring users to be at least 16 years old is shifting from just talk to becoming a major part of India’s digital policy plans for 2026.

Savvy investors focus on strategy over haste. The article delves into why patience will be crucial for major gains and highlights key coins poised for future growth. Discover which digital assets could offer the best returns with the right early positioning. Helium (HNT) Struggles Amidst Price Downturn Source: tradingview Helium's price is currently bouncing between close to a dollar and almost a dollar thirty, showing a recent downward trend. The coin recently faced a steep drop, losing over seventeen percent in just a week. In the past month, it's dipped nearly twenty-seven percent, with a drastic sixty-four percent slide over six months. Despite this, the nearest resistance stands at a bit over one forty, hinting at the first hurdle for any upward movement. If Helium can rally, it might aim for the second resistance around one sixty-eight, which would mean about a thirty percent rise from its current range. With market pressure still high, Helium has a challenging path to recovery. Hedera (HBAR) Struggles, Eyes Recovery Source: tradingview Hedera is currently trading around the $0.10 mark, showing signs of struggle as it sits below its 100-day moving average of about $0.103. Recently, its weekly price slumped by about 16%, painting a challenging short-term picture. Nearby resistance is at $0.117, a 20% leap from its current levels. Longer-term growth could see HBAR reaching the $0.13 resistance, an advance of around 30%. Yet, the low RSI suggests it's oversold, indicating potential for a rebound. With the right push, this cryptocurrency could correct its recent downtrend and chart a fresh northward course. Nonetheless, support lines around $0.094 and $0.082 provide safety nets against further declines. Worldcoin Faces Challenging Times but Holds Growth Potential Source: tradingview Worldcoin's price hovers between forty-one and forty-nine cents, struggling after recent drops. It faces challenges with an RSI of around twenty-three, indicating it's oversold. Despite a decline of over fifty-six percent in six months, it might gain traction soon. If it breaks through the resistance of fifty-four cents, it could climb to sixty-two cents. This would mean an uplift of over twenty percent. However, the current MACD shows downward momentum. With support at thirty-eight cents, Worldcoin is battling to stay afloat and presents an interesting opportunity for investors looking for possible rebounds in value. Conclusion Long-term strategies can offer substantial rewards for patient investors. Coins like HNT, HBAR, and WLD show potential for significant growth by 2026. Early positioning in these tokens could pay off in the long run. Making thoughtful and informed decisions now might lead to impressive gains. Patience, more than the rush to act quickly, often proves to be the more effective approach. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

As the market ebbs and flows, curiosity mounts about its potential resurgence. Could Solana regain its former glory? This article dives into what might push SOL back to its peak and explores other coins primed for growth. Solana Shows Promise Despite Recent Dips Source: tradingview Solana's current price is fluctuating between a low of $111 and a high of around $132. Despite a recent drop of nearly 13% over the past week, the coin shows signs of stability. Immediate support stands at $104, which provides a cushion, while the nearest resistance is at $145. If momentum builds, Solana could hit the next resistance of $165, marking a jump of nearly a quarter in its value from the current range. Solana’s RSI and MACD levels suggest that it’s currently oversold, which might attract buyers. While it’s been a tough stretch with a 32% decrease over six months, the path to recovery could be significant for patient investors. Conclusion SOL has shown impressive growth, but it faces competition from other coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, and Polkadot. The current trends and market dynamics suggest a mix of potential and challenge. Technological advancements and network improvements are key factors that will influence SOL's future. While there is optimism about reaching previous highs, it remains essential to monitor market conditions and technological updates closely.

The offer comes against the backdrop of figures showing that such facilities, often used by Russian companies for cryptocurrency mining, are growing in capacity. Moscow courting Washington with another business proposal With its cheaply priced energy, the Russian Federation could be the “perfect place” for the United States and other nations to set up their data centers, a top representative of the Kremlin has been quoted as stating. The idea comes from Boris Titov, who is Vladimir Putin’s “special presidential envoy for relations with international organizations to achieve sustainable development goals.” “Technology is advancing these days. And, of course, Americans are building a huge number of data centers now. Major American companies are doing so,” the Russian official told reporters at the UN headquarters in New York. Quoted by the official TASS news agency on Friday, he elaborated further: “Although many are now beginning to think this might not be the safest investment as the risks are high, Russia today has large energy resources, and they are quite cheap compared to world prices and prices even in the United States.” That means running data centers in the country is very profitable, Titov emphasized. “And not just for the Americans. It could be for the Chinese, too, or perhaps for other companies from other countries,” he added. The president’s aide admitted, however, that for all this to work, trust must be established first, as well as the proper investment climate. Nevertheless, “this is a potentially profitable area of cooperation,” stressed the Russian envoy. If bilateral relations between the RF and the U.S. improve, “the abolition of the broad interpretation of sanctions by companies will be the first step,” Titov is convinced. When that happens, businesses will start communicating, and then restrictions on financial settlements may be lifted, he predicted, highlighting that the latter are currently the main obstacle. This isn’t Russia’s first lure for America Moscow and Washington have been engaged in a difficult dialogue to end the war in Ukraine since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the White House a year ago. Officials in both capitals have commented on potential business opportunities that can be realized for the mutual benefit, once the bitter conflict is resolved. The proposals range from the possible cooperation in areas such as energy exploration and exploitation to reviving decades-old ideas that never materialized. Last October, another Putin aide, his special envoy for economic cooperation with other nations, Kirill Dmitriev, suggested boring an underwater tunnel under the Bering Strait to boost economic ties. Dmitriev, who is also involved in the Ukraine talks, referred to a similar project, dating back to the Cold War era, to build a “Peace Bridge” between the U.S. State of Alaska and Chukotka in Russia’s Far East. In late December, Putin himself unveiled that Russia and the United States were discussing the option to jointly run the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in occupied Eastern Ukraine. Quoted by the business daily Kommersant, the president reportedly said the American side was interested in using electricity generated by the largest NPP in Europe for crypto mining operations. Meanwhile, another report by TASS revealed earlier this week that the total capacity of Russian mining farms and data processing centers, also often used to mint digital coins, has reached 4 GW in 2025. That is over 33% higher than the figure from the previous year, according to Russia’s System Operator of the Unified Power System ( SO UPS ). The state-owned entity, which manages the vast country’s massive power distribution network, highlighted that the energy-intensive computing facilities now account for roughly 2% of the nation’s gross electricity consumption.

Although the early part of the decade was characterised by social media momentum and unpredictable surges, the modern trend is characterized by technical strength and practicality. Some of the top altcoins who were dominating the news are currently struggling with the structural issues which impede their development. These traditional names are finding it hard to stay on track and in the process, another player is emerging with far greater growth potential. Dogecoin (DOGE) Doge coin (DOGE) is still one of the most well-known altcoin in the crypto world, which is presently trading at around $0.11. Early money people liked the coin because of its explosive nature and the huge following it received that catapulted it into the limelight of the global arena. It is an undeniable giant with a market capitalization that is still standing at a robust of approximately $14 billion. Nevertheless, it is this huge size that has turned into its major drawback. To achieve a substantial price rise, DOGE now needs to get an incredible supply of new liquidity which the existing market is finding difficult to supply. Pepecoin (PEPE) The same happened to Pepecoin (PEPE), which burst into the scene with a strong story that touched the imagination of the retailers. It climbed the adoption ladder fast as the next big crypto in the world of meme coins. It appeared to be unstoppable at one time when it was ascending the ranks. However, heading to 2026, PEPE has a narrative problem. Its first hype is gone and the people that were pushing its price are beginning to wane. PEPE has an increasingly neutral-to-bearish outlook as it attempts to hold above critical demand zones within the $0.0000048 to $0.0000040 price range. It can be easily resold because it does not have a functioning ecosystem or even something that people can speculate on. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The solution to the issue of DOGE and PEPE is the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . In contrast to the giants of memes, MUTM does not need billions of liquid funds to experience a drastic price change, and its development is not associated with a short-lived hype. It is a decentralized lending protocol that builds an advanced dual-market framework. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools will allow users to obtain liquidity immediately or the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) market to do personalized loan transactions. This provides the token with the structural purpose which can be useful in spite of the market sentiment. The project is already in the high growth presale phase and has reached 19,000 or more holders and raised over $20.2 million. The circulation is near critical and the tokens that have already been sold are more than 835 million out of the 1.82 billion presale allocation. MUTM is already up 300% since its presale launch, and is now valued at $0.04. The protocol offers the type of underlying resiliency PEPE and DOGE is missing because the protocol offers predictable lending protocols and an easy value connection via its mtToken system. MUTM’s Long-term Case The innovation behind the MUTM case is the foundation of the design case in the long term. Users who provide assets to the protocol would get awarded mtTokens, interest bearing receipts which increase in value as borrowers repay their loan. This can be supported by a buy-and-distribute model in which platform fees will purchase MUTM tokens in the open market and hand them out to stakers. This forms an endless cycle of demand and scarcity that directly relates to real protocol usage. The planned integration of Chainlink oracles and a native stablecoin are plans that also add to the stability of the ecosystem. These mechanics address the problem of stunted development and feeble stories. DOGE and PEPE are struggling to remain relevant, whereas the price performance of MUTM is pegged on the size of its lending markets. This is the basic connection as to why analysts are forecasting a huge surge towards $0.35 to $0.45 upon the protocol being moved to the main net. A potential 800% to 1,000% appreciation. V1 Protocol Launch The most recent milestone of the project, which has occurred until now, was the activation of the V1 protocol on the Sepolia testnet. The action enables the users to test the heart of lending engines, liquidity pools, and computerized liquidator bots as well as mtTokens via test assets of ETH, USDT, WBTC and ETH. Mutuum Finance underwent a complete security audit with Halborn Security in order to make the system battle-hardened, and has the high 90/100 CertiK rating. These are the last boxes that serious investors would want to have checked. Phase 7 is selling out. The official price of the launch is 0.06, so the existing 50% discount is going to be soon eliminated. The pressure on investors is at an all-time high as the infrastructure progresses. Mutuum Finance is demonstrating that the best cheap crypto in 2026 will be the one that brings utility to the table.

In usual market trends, each new price peak is accompanied by higher conviction as investors are willing to hold longer, take profits later, and tolerate larger drawdowns because they expect even higher prices. However, during Bitcoin’s ascent from around $40,000 in early 2024 to over $100,000, the aSOPR has shown a different pattern as observed by market analyst MorenoDV. Despite a consistent uptrend resulting in multiple price peaks, Bitcoin aSOPR established a downtrend pattern marked by lower highs and lower lows, thereby creating a puzzling market divergence. According to MorenoDV, this development suggests that Bitcoin traders were aggressively taking profits with each rally, indicating a lack of long-term market confidence. Considering the descending profit-taking pattern, it can also be inferred that investors were satisfied with smaller and smaller gains, suggesting they were no longer convinced that upside continuation was likely.

Presently, the aSOPR is retesting this lower boundary, in a fear-ridden market with over 30% of market supply in a loss. Ideally, MorenoDV explains these are accumulation opportunities, especially in further consideration of the negative aSOPR. However, the analyst warns that a decisive fall below this line could strengthen present bearish sentiments, resulting in an intense market capitulation, as an already fearful set of investors would likely initiate a sell-off. At press time, Bitcoin continues to trade around $83,819, reflecting 0.41% decline in the past day. Following the recent liquidations, the market leader is now 34% away from its all time high of around $126,100.

After climbing steadily through January and pushing above recent highs, silver reversed course late in the session. Prices fell rapidly, erasing days of gains in a single move as selling accelerated. The drop marked one of the steepest daily declines in recent weeks and broke the short-term upward trend visible on the chart. The sell-off came as broader markets adjusted to shifting U.S. policy expectations. Reports that President Donald Trump is preparing to nominate Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve chair added pressure across risk-sensitive assets. Warsh is widely viewed as more hawkish, and the prospect of tighter monetary policy weighed on metals, which tend to struggle when interest rate expectations rise. As a result, traders moved quickly to lock in profits after silver’s rapid advance. Volatility spiked, and price slid back toward levels last seen earlier in the month. By the end of the move, silver traded well below its recent peak, signaling a sharp reset after an extended upside run. Silver Holds Above $80 After January Surge Silver rose sharply in January 2026, and then it tested the $80 level but did not finish the month below it, based on the monthly chart shared by GoldPredictors. The chart shows silver pushing higher into late January after a long upswing, with the latest marked price near $85.19 per ounce. Silver / U.S. Dollar (1M, OANDA): Source: TradingView/X In its post, GoldPredictors.com said silver “attempted to close below $80 but failed,” and it framed February as the next decision point for direction. The same post said the next pullback could create a “big buying opportunity,” while keeping the timing and level unspecified. The chart also shows an upward sloping channel that has guided price over decades, with the latest move pressing into the upper area of that range. If volatility stays elevated, traders will likely watch whether silver holds above $80 again, because that level now sits near the most visible recent test on this view.

It recovered some ground yesterday when it rebounded to $84,000, which now appears as a dead-cat bounce. At the same time, silver and gold plunged by 40% and 16%, respectively, erasing roughly $7 billion of their respective market caps within just a day. However, the past few hours have brought more pain to the bulls, with BTC slipping to just under $81,000. This became its lowest price tag since November 21. BTCUSD Jan 31.

After years of regulatory pressure, shifting macro conditions, and rotating narratives across crypto markets, XRP now trades at a technically sensitive level that has historically preceded decisive moves. This phase does not reward emotion or speculation. It rewards structure, symmetry, and probability. A recent technical breakdown shared by Egrag Crypto has brought renewed attention to XRP’s macro cycle behavior. Rather than leaning on narratives or hype, the analysis examines XRP’s historical relationship with Fibonacci extensions, impulse waves, and the 21-period exponential moving average on the monthly timeframe. Fibonacci Extensions Reveal a Repeating Cycle Pattern XRP’s previous bull cycles display a consistent structural rhythm. In the 2017 cycle, XRP produced an initial surge followed by a powerful second impulse that peaked near the 2.618 Fibonacci extension. The market respected that extension with remarkable precision. In the 2021 cycle, XRP again completed a first impulse. However, the second surge stalled around the 1.618 Fibonacci extension. The SEC lawsuit against Ripple coincided with that truncation, suggesting external suppression rather than a failure in technical structure. These two cycles reinforce a key observation: XRP historically respects Fibonacci extensions on the second impulse of each cycle. The extension level reached depends on market conditions, but the behavior itself remains consistent. #XRP – Fibs Doesn’t Lie : Cycle Symmetry Matters: Cycle 1 (2017): First surge → then the second surge topped at Fib 2.618 Cycle 2 (2021): First surge → then the second surge truncated at Fib 1.618 (SEC law suit, not structure failure) Key insight: #XRP respects… pic.twitter.com/gFHhysfhTi — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) January 31, 2026 Where XRP Currently Stands in the Macro Cycle XRP now trades within a macro correction following the first impulse of the current cycle. This position mirrors conditions seen in both 2018 and 2021. In each instance, XRP returned to test the 21 EMA on the monthly chart after the first surge. That first touch of the 21 EMA previously triggered a significant relief bounce. However, those bounces occurred before the broader market structure resolved lower. The similarity places XRP at a familiar structural checkpoint rather than signaling immediate failure. The 21 EMA as the Line Between Continuation and Breakdown The 21 EMA now serves as the most important technical level on XRP’s macro chart. If XRP holds this level on monthly closes, the broader structure remains intact and allows for a second impulse to activate. A sustained hold supports bullish continuation rather than collapse. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Conversely, decisive monthly closes below the 21 EMA—especially with acceptance below the $1.20 to $1.30 range—would signal a breakdown in cycle symmetry. That outcome would invalidate the current expansion thesis, though historical context suggests the downside remains structurally limited. Probabilities Favor a Second Impulse Current conditions favor a bullish continuation scenario with higher probability. If XRP maintains structural support, Fibonacci projections point toward $5.37 at the 1.618 extension and approximately $11 at the 2.618 extension. These levels align with XRP’s historical behavior during second impulses. The alternative scenario carries a lower probability and requires clear confirmation through sustained weakness. Until then, XRP remains in a structure-testing phase rather than a collapse. Structure Decides, Not Narratives Market narratives shift constantly, but structure defines outcomes. Fibonacci levels guide probability, while price action confirms direction. XRP now stands at a point where patience matters more than prediction. Whether XRP activates a second surge or breaks its symmetry, the resolution of this phase will shape its long-term trajectory. In the end, dollars up or down matter far less than whether structure holds—and structure always speaks last.

The Solana-based analytics platform confirmed that attackers compromised several treasury and fee wallets. On-chain data showsthat a large amount of SOL was unstaked and moved in a short time window. At the time, the transferred assets carried an estimated value of about $30 million. The disclosure triggered immediate attention across the Solana ecosystem due to the size and nature of the outflow. The team acknowledged the breach through official channels and launched an urgent investigation. Additionally, Step Finance engaged external cybersecurity firms to support forensic analysis. The platform stated that it is still reviewing how the wallets were accessed. Consequently, attribution and recovery details remain unavailable. The incident occurred rapidly, which raised questions about prior wallet access rather than automated exploitation. Large Treasury Outflow Raises Red Flags Blockchain data showed that roughly 261,854 SOL was unstaked before the transfers occurred. Significantly, unstaking requires direct wallet permissions, which suggests deliberate human interaction. Analysts noted that this sequence often indicates compromised private keys. However, investigators have not confirmed the attack vector. Besides the treasury wallets, fee-related wallets were also affected. These wallets typically hold protocol revenue, making them valuable targets. Moreover, the destination of the transferred funds remains unknown. No clear recovery timeline has been shared so far. Despite the scale of the incident, Step Finance clarified that user funds were not exposed. The platform focuses on analytics and portfolio tracking rather than asset custody. Hence, the breach appears limited to protocol-owned assets. Still, the event unsettled the broader Solana DeFi community. Broader Impact on Solana DeFi Security The breach follows a pattern of treasury-focused attacks seen throughout 2025. Consequently, security teams have increased scrutiny of protocol fund management. Market observers pointed out that rising treasury balances attract more sophisticated attackers. Additionally, volatile market conditions often accelerate such attempts. Community responses varied after the disclosure. Some participants requested immediate transparency. Others urged patience until investigators complete their analysis. Meanwhile, security experts stressed the importance of layered defenses. Multisignature controls, restricted access, and real-time monitoring reduce single-point failures. Industry Pressure Builds for Stronger Controls The incident highlighted structural risks within decentralized finance treasuries. Moreover, attackers now target institutional wallets instead of individual users. This shift increases pressure on protocols to strengthen custody frameworks.

The interaction between this demand zone, nearby supply levels, and persistent sell-side pressure will be critical in determining whether Ethereum stabilises or continues lower in the coming sessions. Ethereum Price Analysis: The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, ETH has broken down from its previous structure and is now trading well below the ascending trendline, confirming a broader bearish sentiment. The recent rejection from the crucial supply zone around the mid-$3K region marked a clear bearish continuation signal by completing a pullback. The asset has since accelerated lower and is currently testing a well-defined demand zone around the $2.5K area. This zone has previously acted as a strong buyers’ base, and the current reaction suggests initial demand absorption. However, the overall structure remains weak as long as the price stays below the moving averages and the $3K psychological level. Nevertheless, a daily close below the current demand zone would open the door for continuation toward the lower yellow support region, while stabilisation here is required to prevent further downside expansion. ETH/USDT 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, Ethereum has printed another bearish signal by recently breaking below a minor consolidation wedge pattern. The most recent move shows a sharp sell-off into demand, followed by a modest reaction that lacks impulsive bullish follow-through. From a structural perspective, any upside reaction in this area at the $2.5K range is likely corrective and vulnerable to selling pressure. The most logical bearish continuation scenario involves a pullback toward the nearby supply zones around the $2.7K and $3K regions, where previous support has flipped into resistance. As long as the price remains below those supply areas and fails to reclaim the channel midpoint, sellers retain control. Sustained acceptance below the lower channel boundary would further confirm downside continuation, while only a strong reclaim of structure would challenge the bearish bias. Sentiment Analysis The one-month Ethereum liquidation heatmap clearly highlights a dense liquidity pocket forming around and especially below the $2.5K level. This area stands out as one of the most concentrated zones of resting leverage on the chart, indicating a large cluster of stop losses and liquidation levels from overexposed long positions. As prices continue to trend lower, these liquidity pools naturally become attractive targets for the market, particularly in a bearish environment in which downside extensions are driven by forced liquidations rather than organic selling alone. The gradual build-up of liquidity beneath $2.5K suggests that many participants are still positioned defensively around this range.

Shibburn , the tracking platform for SHIB burns, confirmed zero tokens were sent to dead wallets during this period. The stagnation occurred while the meme coin's price continued its downward movement. This sudden drop in burn activity stands in stark contrast to recent developments. Just 48 hours earlier, the burn rate had surged by over 500%. A single transaction eliminated 10,491,803 SHIB tokens from circulation. The massive burn had sparked optimism among investors about sustained deflationary pressure. The cryptocurrency market frequently experiences volatility. The Shiba Inu burn mechanism appears equally unpredictable. Without any new burns in the past day, the circulating supply remains fixed at 585,412,585,102,123 SHIB. An additional 3.83 trillion tokens stay locked in staking protocols. This brings the total supply to 589,245,695,882,238 SHIB. Burn Mechanism Faces Growing Skepticism Token burns have long served as a cornerstone of the Shiba Inu strategy. The ecosystem relies on this deflationary tool to reduce supply and theoretically increase value. Developers and supporters believe that creating scarcity through burns will drive price appreciation. However, critics question the practical effectiveness of this approach. Industry analysts point out that trillions of SHIB tokens remain in circulation. The volumes typically burned represent a minuscule fraction of the total supply. Even substantial burn events fail to create meaningful scarcity. Price Action Reflects Broader Market Pressures Shiba Inu currently trades at $0.000006853. The price has declined 5.54% in the past 24 hours. The recent burn of over 10.49 million tokens failed to reverse the bearish trend. SHIB dropped from a daily high of $0.00000736 to its present level. Trading volume tells a similar story. The metric decreased 18.28% to reach $126.25 million. Lower volume often signals reduced market interest and weaker buying support. Whale activity has contributed to the selling pressure. One large holder transferred 41 billion SHIB to an OKX hot wallet. Such movements typically indicate preparation for selling. Exchange inflows from whales often precede price declines as supply on trading platforms increases.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-31 16:47:11

This development has weighed heavily on equities and risk assets, with crypto reacting swiftly as liquidity conditions tighten and volatility rises. Against this backdrop, Bitcoin has experienced a decisive technical breakdown, shifting focus toward key demand zones Bitcoin Price Analysis: The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, BTC has confirmed a bearish breakout below the flag structure, signaling a continuation of the broader bearish move rather than a temporary pullback. This breakdown invalidated the prior consolidation phase and opened the door for accelerated downside momentum. The asset is now directly confronting the major psychological demand zone at $80K, as highlighted on the chart. This area represents a critical buyers’ base that previously acted as a springboard for impulsive upside moves. The market’s reaction here is crucial. Holding this zone could trigger a relief bounce or short-term stabilization, whereas a clean loss would expose lower-liquidity pockets and shift the medium-term bias decisively bearish. The macro uncertainty driven by Fed leadership concerns further increases the probability of volatility expansion around this level, making this demand zone a key decision point. BTC/USDT 4-Hour Chart Zooming into the 4-hour chart, the structure becomes more tactical. Following the sharp breakdown, Bitcoin is now showing early signs of exhaustion, suggesting the possibility of a short-term pullback. From a market-structure perspective, the last supply zone overhead at the $88K crucial zone stands out as the most likely magnet for any corrective move. This area previously acted as a distribution before the impulsive sell-off and is expected to attract sellers on a retest. A pullback into this supply zone would be technically healthy, allowing the market to rebalance before deciding on continuation or reversal. Failure to reclaim it would reinforce bearish control, while acceptance above it would be the first signal of structural recovery. On-Chain Analysis On the on-chain side, the Realized Price – UTXO Age Bands reveal an important shift in behavior. Longer-term holders remain relatively stable, while shorter-term cohorts show signs of stress as the price trades closer to their realized levels. Notably, the compression between mid-term realized prices and the asset breaking below the 12-18 month cohort’s realized price suggests that Bitcoin is approaching an area where historical accumulation tends to emerge, particularly if macro fear peaks. While this does not guarantee an immediate bottom, it does support the idea that downside from here may become increasingly reactive rather than trend-driven. Combined with heightened macro uncertainty, this on-chain positioning reinforces the importance of the current demand zone as a potential pivot area for the next major move.

The controversy involving cryptocurrency exchanges over last October’s market crash has taken another turn, with Wintermute’s CEO defending Binance against allegations that it caused the worst liquidation event in crypto history. He wrote, “Kind of wish public figures would pic k wo rds more carefully. ” Gaevoy did not agree with the submission that the event occurred due to a “software glitch.” “It was a flash crash on a mega leveraged market on illiquid Friday night driven by macro news,” Gaevoy wrote . What did Star Xu say about the October 10 crash? OKX CEO accused Binance of encouraging users to convert stablecoins into USDe, which he described as a “tokenized hedge fund,” and allowing it to be used as collateral without adequate risk warnings. Xu wrote , “Binance launched a temporary user-acquisition campaign offering 12% APY on USDe, while allowing USDe to be used as collateral with the same treatment as USDT and USDC, and without effective limits.” According to him, the risks escalated as more users converted USDT/USDC into USDe and used USDe as collateral to borrow USDT. The borrowed USDT is then converted back into USDe, and the cycle is repeated. He stated that users created leverage loops that produced artificial annual percentage yields (APYs) of 24% and 36%, at some point exceeding 70%, accumulating systemic risk across global markets. “When volatility hit, USDe depegged quickly. Cascading liquidations followed, and weaknesses in risk management around assets such as WETH and BNSOL further amplified the crash. Some tokens briefly traded near zero,” Xu wrote, referencing the loss of 1:1 peg that occurred in the heat of the crash. Xu claims that the damage from the crash to users and companies, including OKX, was more severe, adding that recovery will take time. The OKX CEO stated that speaking “openly about systemic risks is sometimes uncomfortable, but it is necessary if the industry is to mature responsibly,” and he stated that he will continue to do so. He added that his company, OKX, may face significant misinformation attacks and coordinated FUD in the near future as a result of his post. Binance rejects claims that it was behind the market crash Binance co-founder Yi He responded on X, writing, “Whales who trade on Binance know better what actually happens when the tide goes out.” In a now-deleted post, she also suggested that Wood, who recently linked the crash to a Binance software glitch in a Fox Business interview, was not qualified to comment as a non-user of the platform. Wood stated that the leveraging event removed roughly $28 billion from the market. Many people point to President Trump’s announcement of his plans to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports as the catalyst for the October 10 crash. Bitcoin and Ethereum prices dipped significantly and set off a chain reaction of panic trading activities. USDe depegged on Binance , trading at $0.65 on Binance. Although the synthetic stablecoin traded closer to $1 on other exchanges. On January 30, Binance issued its most detailed statement yet on the matter, pinning the link to the post on its X account. The exchange attributed the crash to macro shocks, market maker risk protocols, and Ethereum network congestion. Binance stated that its core infrastructure was operational throughout and that interface display errors, one of which showed some balances as “zero,” did not affect actual trade execution. Binance has completed $328 million in compensation to affected users, expanding an initial $283 million payout announced within 24 hours of the crash.

CryptoQuant Offers Insights,https://cryptopotato.com/how-well-did-the-tron-network-perform-in-2025-cryptoquant-offers-insights/,"The Tron network performed relatively well in 2025, recording a trend of high throughput and sustained activity. The year also highlighted the network’s scalability, competitiveness in the industry, user retention, and economic utility. Analysts at the market research firm CryptoQuant have published a special report reviewing Tron’s journey over the past year. The publication, shared with CryptoPotato , examines the impact of new developments, such as lower fees and TRX’s growth as a native cryptocurrency. Tron Network Activity Surges According to CryptoQuant, Tron network activity reached structural highs, with peaks in monthly transaction volume and active addresses. Monthly transactions recorded an all-time high (ATH) of 323 million in December, rising 39% from December 2024. On the other hand, monthly active addresses peaked at 35.5 million and ended the year at 31.3 million, a 24% year-over-year (YoY) increase. The rise in transactions per active address surged to a two-year high of 10.5, up from 9.2 in December 2024. This indicated a rise in user intensity and deeper engagement beyond simple address growth. Tron implemented a 60% cut in unit energy price in August 2025, slashing average transaction fees by 65% to $0.53, the lowest since September 2023. This caused fee revenues to fall, with monthly figures declining from $399 million pre-cut to $183 million in December. Analysts insist the development reflected a strategic trade-off prioritizing throughput and usage over per-transaction revenue. Evaluating the ecosystem as a whole, Tron witnessed an expansion in decentralized finance (DeFi) and liquidity layers. DeFi platforms like SunSwap and JustLend averaged billions of dollars in liquidity. The former sustained a monthly average of $3.1 billion in wrapped TRX (WTRX) swap volume, while the latter’s deposits soared 56% YoY to $12.8 billion. The Dominant USDT Rail Last year, TRX recorded high transfers in USD terms, with the total amount standing at $85.2 billion, a 44% increase from 2024 levels. Analysts attributed most of the growth to the rise in the asset’s price – TRX reached a monthly average ATH of $0.34 in September 2025. Contrarily, the total TRX transfers in native units amounted to 309 billion, representing a 27% decline from 2024. The decline occurred because more TRX were staked for voting and network security. About 48% of the TRX supply (45.7 billion coins) is currently staked. Notably, the Tether (USDT) supply on Tron expanded significantly, rising 40% from $58 billion in 2024 to $81 billion last year. USDT bridging volume also jumped 215% YoY to $17.8 billion. Tron is now the dominant USDT transaction rail, having processed more than 825 million USDT transfers last year and ending December with a USDT transaction volume twice that of Ethereum.

According to data shared by market analyst Kovac, gold dropped about 15% in a rapid move, wiping out trillions of dollars in market value. The selloff marked one of the steepest short term declines on record for the precious metal. The move unfolded quickly. Gold had traded near recent highs before sellers accelerated, pushing prices lower in a near vertical drop on intraday charts. As a result, leveraged positions were flushed out, and liquidity thinned as prices fell. Estimates tied to the move suggest more than $15 trillion in combined value was erased across gold and silver markets, underscoring the scale of the liquidation. Silver followed the same direction but with greater intensity. Prices plunged roughly 38%, reflecting silver’s higher volatility and deeper exposure to leveraged trading. While gold absorbed most of the nominal value losses, silver’s sharper percentage decline highlighted stress across the broader precious metals complex. The synchronized drop in gold and silver challenged the idea that these assets always provide shelter during periods of uncertainty. Instead, the session showed how rapid deleveraging and margin calls can override traditional safe haven behavior, at least in the short term. Market participants are now watching whether prices stabilize or if further liquidation pressure emerges in the days ahead. Gold RSI Stays Weak as XAUUSD Chart Maps Deep Demand Zones A trading post circulating on X pointed to slowing momentum in gold as XAUUSD held below a falling trendline and under marked resistance bands. The post, shared by a trader using the handle Emily, framed the current move as an unfinished correction and said traders should watch for stabilization signals rather than react to fast swings. XAUUSD Price Chart. Source: TradingView / X The attached chart showed spot gold near $5,064, with two resistance zones drawn around the $5,300 area and again closer to the upper $5,500s. Below price, the analyst highlighted multiple demand zones, including one around the high $4,800s to low $4,900s, another near the upper $4,700s, and a deeper band near the mid $4,500s. A projected path on the chart traced repeated rebounds and renewed selloffs before any larger recovery attempt. Momentum readings on the image stayed soft. The RSI panel at the bottom showed a 14 period RSI near 33.87, below the commonly watched 50 level and near oversold territory. The post argued that a clearer bottom signal would require the RSI to converge and steady as price volatility fades. The chart also marked a potential downside level around $4,606, implying that another leg lower would still fit within the plotted structure if selling pressure returns. Still, the post presented that level as part of a scenario map, not a confirmed target, while the broader message focused on the risk of whipsaw moves in both directions before the market forms a cleaner base.",News|Reports,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-31 16:59:11

However, recent price actions have caused even the most loyal holders to reconsider their positions. As the market leader struggles to maintain its footing, a new wave of capital is flowing into emerging utility projects. One such project, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , has caught the attention of the “smart money” crowd. With its V1 protocol now live on the testnet, investors are rotating out of stagnating assets and into a protocol that offers a fresh take on decentralized credit. Ethereum (ETH) As of late January 2026, Ethereum is navigating a challenging landscape. The current price of ETH is hovering around $2,750, with a market capitalization that has retreated to approximately $332 billion. While Ethereum saw an early surge that momentarily pushed it toward the $5,000 mark last summer, that momentum has largely evaporated. Over the last 30 days alone, ETH has dropped by 9%, leaving many traders underwater. This decline is part of a broader trend where Ethereum has struggled to break through heavy resistance levels. Looking ahead, some analysts are issuing a bearish price prediction for 2026 and 2027. If macro pressures continue and institutional demand for ETH ETFs cools down, there is a risk that the price could slide back into the $2,000 to $2,100 range. This potential stagnation has led to a “risk-off” sentiment among long-term holders. For those who used to rely on Ethereum for high-beta gains, the current environment feels stagnant, prompting a search for the next high-growth opportunity. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) While Ethereum faces a ceiling, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is just beginning its journey. MUTM is currently in Phase 7 of its presale, with MUTM priced at an affordable $0.04. The project has already raised a staggering $20.1 million in funding, proving that there is deep liquidity and high demand for its vision. With more than 19,900 individual holders already on board, Mutuum Finance is building one of the most active communities in the 2026 crypto cycle. Mutuum Finance is building a decentralized protocol. The goal is to allow users to lend and borrow assets without any middleman. Users can lock up their crypto as collateral to access instant cash, which is a vital tool for anyone who wants to hold their tokens long-term while still having spending power. By offering a dual-market system, the protocol caters to both passive lenders seeking high yields and active borrowers looking for flexible terms. Why ETH Whales are Considering MUTM In the last six months, Ethereum has lost a significant chunk of its market cap as investors grow tired of high gas fees and the slow pace of Layer-1 innovation. While Ethereum remains the base layer for many apps, it has become a “legacy asset” that struggles to deliver the explosive returns seen in previous years. In contrast, Mutuum Finance has just reached a major technical milestone: the activation of its V1 protocol on the Sepolia testnet. This is a functional version of the app that users can actually test right now. Lenders receive yield-bearing receipts called mtTokens. These tokens grow in value automatically as interest is collected from borrowers. Borrowers receive debt-tokens to track their loans and interest in real-time. Health Factor Monitoring helps users see how safe their loans are. If the value of collateral drops too low, an automated liquidator bot steps in to protect the system. By moving the protocol to a live test environment, Mutuum Finance has proven that its logic is operational. Price Prediction and Security Standards The price potential between these two assets is a primary driver for the current rotation. Analysts suggest that while Ethereum might struggle to see a 20% to 30% recovery back to $3,500 in 2026-2027, MUTM is positioned for much larger moves. With a confirmed launch price of $0.06, Phase 7 buyers are already looking at a built-in 50% discount. Experts who study the early cheap cryptocurrencies believe MUTM could 4x-10x by the end of 2026, as long as the roadmap unfolds as planned, representing a massive multiplier from the current presale price. Security is another area where Mutuum Finance stands out. The project has already passed a full independent audit by Halborn Security, one of the top firms in the world. It also boasts a high 90/100 score from CertiK and a $50,000 bug bounty to keep the code safe. This combination of working tech, high security, and clear profit potential is exactly why the “smart money” is moving into MUTM today.

Here’s the Proof,https://timestabloid.com/gary-gensler-was-directed-to-go-after-ripple-and-xrp-heres-the-proof/,"Few regulatory actions have left a deeper mark on crypto markets than the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple . The case reshaped U.S. exchange access, stalled institutional participation, and intensified long-standing suspicions that power dynamics—not just legal theory—guided enforcement choices. New documents have resurfaced, sparking renewed suspicions and putting them back at the center of the discussion. That renewed focus follows a post by Patrick L Riley, who revisited early blockchain correspondence, funding records, and academic connections to argue that Ripple’s legal troubles cannot be viewed in isolation. His analysis urges readers to examine the formative years of crypto, when investor influence and institutional relationships quietly shaped the ecosystem. A 2014 Email Reveals Investor Conflict A leaked 2014 email from files linked to Jeffrey Epstein anchors the discussion. In the message, investor Austin Hill contacted Epstein and Joichi Ito to raise concerns about their involvement with Stellar , which Hill described as a direct competitor to Ripple. He warned that backing “two horses in the same race” damaged the ecosystem his company aimed to build. The email confirms that early blockchain development involved active investor maneuvering. Capital providers openly sought to limit competition and protect favored networks. While the message does not reference regulators or XRP enforcement, it documents how financial influence shaped outcomes years before legal scrutiny emerged. I told you all 31 Dec 2022 that Gary Gensler was directed through Epstein and Mossad to go after Ripple and XRP. Meanwhile the Bitcoin foundation was backed by Epstein. Now you know it is true. pic.twitter.com/ouOjMYeNQx — Patrick L Riley (@Acquired_Savant) January 31, 2026 Epstein’s Documented Bitcoin Involvement Public disclosures released years later confirm that Epstein provided funding to Bitcoin Core developers through the Bitcoin Foundation between 2011 and 2014. The support happened when the foundation was internally unstable, and it’s based on facts, not rumors. These disclosures established Epstein’s participation in Bitcoin’s early infrastructure. They do not create intent to suppress Ripple or direct regulatory actions. The evidence shows funding relationships, not enforcement strategy. Gary Gensler and MIT Connections Riley’s argument also highlights professional overlap between SEC Chair Gary Gensler and Joichi Ito. Ito recruited Gensler to teach blockchain-focused courses at MIT Media Lab, where Ito served as director before resigning amid revelations about Epstein-linked donations. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This shared academic history provides context but not proof. No primary documents, sworn testimony, or peer-reviewed findings demonstrate that Epstein—or any intelligence agency—directed Gensler’s conduct at the SEC. What the Evidence Supports—and Where It Stops The verified record supports several facts. Epstein funded Bitcoin-related initiatives. Early investors openly intervened in competitive blockchain dynamics. Gensler and Ito shared professional ties at MIT. The SEC sued Ripple in December 2020, claiming they sold securities without registering them. The record does not confirm a directive ordering Gensler to target Ripple or XRP. Allegations involving coordinated suppression or intelligence involvement remain unproven. Separating Documentation From Interpretation Riley’s claims echo broader frustration within crypto over perceived regulatory inconsistency. The newly revealed email and funding records shed light on early power dynamics, but it’s crucial to separate facts from interpretation. The Ripple case reshaped crypto regulation regardless of motive. Until new primary evidence emerges, the facts invite scrutiny—but they demand caution.

This rapid event, occurring against a backdrop of heightened market sensitivity, underscores the inherent volatility and leverage risks present in digital asset trading. Furthermore, data reveals that over the preceding 24-hour period, total liquidations surpassed $1.065 billion, painting a broader picture of sustained market pressure and shifting sentiment among leveraged traders globally. Crypto Futures Liquidated: Deconstructing the $125 Million Hour The core mechanism of futures liquidation is straightforward yet impactful. Exchanges automatically close a trader’s leveraged position when their collateral falls below a required maintenance margin. Consequently, this process triggers a sell or buy order to cover the debt. When numerous leveraged positions approach their liquidation thresholds simultaneously, a cascade effect can occur. The initial liquidations push the market price further, thereby triggering more liquidations in a self-reinforcing cycle. This recent $125 million liquidation spike primarily involved long positions, indicating a swift downward price movement caught many bullish traders off guard. Major centralized exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and OKX typically facilitate the bulk of such activity. These platforms offer high leverage, sometimes exceeding 100x, which magnifies both potential profits and risks. For context, the scale of this hourly event is substantial. To illustrate, the table below compares this liquidation wave to other notable market events in recent years. Event Period Approx. Liquidation Value Primary Market Context Past Hour (This Event) $125 Million Sharp intraday volatility May 2021 (China Mining Ban) Over $2.5 Billion (24h) Regulatory shock November 2022 (FTX Collapse) Over $1 Billion (24h) Exchange insolvency crisis Typical Low-Volatility Day $50 – $200 Million (24h) Standard market fluctuations Understanding the Mechanics of Derivatives Liquidation Liquidation events are not random; they are a direct function of market structure and trader behavior. Several key factors consistently contribute to these cascades: Excessive Leverage: Traders using very high leverage have minimal margin for error. Market Illiquidity: Thin order books can amplify price swings during stress. Clustered Liquidation Levels: Many traders set stops or get liquidated near similar price points. External Catalysts: News, macroeconomic data, or large spot market sells can trigger the initial move. Moreover, the $1.065 billion in 24-hour liquidations provides crucial context. It suggests the $125 million hour was not an isolated anomaly but rather the peak of sustained deleveraging. This pattern often indicates a market transitioning from a strongly bullish or bearish consensus to a more uncertain or corrective phase. Analysts monitor funding rates in perpetual swap markets as a leading indicator; persistently high positive funding can signal overcrowded long positions ripe for liquidation. Expert Analysis on Market Structure and Risk Market structure professionals emphasize that liquidation cascades are a feature, not a bug, of leveraged derivatives markets. They act as a risk transfer mechanism, forcibly closing positions that can no longer be maintained. However, their scale and speed can create systemic short-term volatility. This volatility often spills over into the spot market, as liquidation engines execute large market orders. Consequently, retail spot holders can experience heightened price swings due to activity in the derivatives sector, even if they do not use leverage themselves. This interconnection underscores the importance of understanding derivatives flows for any comprehensive market analysis. The Ripple Effects and Broader Market Implications The immediate effect of a large liquidation event is a rapid price movement and increased market volatility. This can lead to: Short-term price dislocations from the spot market’s fundamental value. Increased trading volume as algorithms and opportunistic traders react. A reset in market sentiment and leverage, often creating conditions for a stabilization or reversal. Furthermore, repeated large-scale liquidations can influence longer-term trader psychology. They serve as a stark reminder of the risks associated with high leverage. Potentially, this can lead to more conservative positioning in the future. Regulators and institutional observers also scrutinize these events. They assess whether exchange risk management systems, including insurance funds and auto-deleveraging mechanisms, functioned effectively to contain the fallout and protect the broader market integrity. Conclusion The event highlighting $125 million in crypto futures liquidated within one hour provides a powerful case study in market dynamics. It demonstrates the potent interplay between leverage, liquidity, and volatility in the digital asset ecosystem. While such cascades are an inherent part of derivatives trading, their magnitude offers real-time insights into market leverage, sentiment extremes, and structural vulnerabilities. For traders, this underscores the non-negotiable importance of rigorous risk management, including appropriate position sizing and the cautious use of leverage. For the market overall, these events represent a periodic and forceful clearing mechanism, realigning prices with the available capital and conviction in the system. FAQs Q1: What does it mean when futures are “liquidated”? A futures liquidation occurs when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s leveraged position because their collateral has fallen below the required level to maintain it, preventing further losses. Q2: Who loses money during a liquidation event? The trader whose position is liquidated loses their remaining margin. If the liquidation cannot cover the loss, the exchange’s insurance fund or other traders may absorb the remainder. Q3: Do large liquidations cause the price to go down or up? It depends on the direction. A cascade of long liquidations (closing bullish positions) involves forced selling, typically pushing prices down. Conversely, short liquidations involve forced buying, which can push prices up. Q4: How can traders avoid being liquidated? Traders can avoid liquidation by using lower leverage, maintaining ample margin above requirements, employing stop-loss orders cautiously, and actively monitoring their positions during volatile periods. Q5: Are liquidation events like this bad for the overall crypto market? They are a double-edged sword. While they cause short-term pain for affected traders and increase volatility, they also help reset excessive leverage and can establish healthier price foundations by removing overextended positions.

Watch How Huge This Really Is,https://timestabloid.com/bearish-on-stellar-xlm-watch-how-huge-this-really-is/,"A recent post by crypto commentator X Finance Bull presents a detailed case against the bearish outlook on Stellar’s native token, XLM , pointing instead to rapid growth in real-world asset tokenization on the network. According to the data cited in the tweet, Stellar now hosts $1.04 billion in tokenized real-world assets, a figure the commentator describes as an early but significant stage in a broader structural shift. The post emphasizes that this level of activity reflects institutional engagement rather than speculative experimentation. X Finance Bull highlights that the total value of real-world assets on Stellar has increased by 17.93 percent over the past 30 days. Over the same period, transfer volume linked to these assets rose by 164.89 percent, indicating a sharp acceleration in on-chain activity. The figures are presented as evidence that Stellar is increasingly being used as an operational settlement network rather than a passive issuance platform. Bearish on $XLM ? Watch how HUGEE this really is $1.04 BILLION in Real World Assets on Stellar. This is the beginning. Look at the numbers: RWA value up 17.93% in 30 days. RWA transfer volume up 164.89%. US Treasury Debt: $702M tokenized. Up 13.74%. Non-US Government… pic.twitter.com/11EFQi19bj — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) January 29, 2026 Institutional Asset Classes Drive Network Activity The tweet places particular emphasis on tokenized government debt and institutional-grade instruments. US Treasury debt tokenized on Stellar reportedly stands at $702 million, representing a 13.74% increase. Non-US government debt accounts for a further $198 million, with growth of 54.14 percent over the same timeframe. Institutional alternative assets recorded the fastest expansion, rising by 112.8 percent, reinforcing the claim that sophisticated asset managers are actively deploying capital on the network. X Finance Bull also outlines how individual platforms contribute to this growth. Franklin Templeton is cited as the dominant participant, with $651 million in tokenized assets and a market share of 52.85 percent. Spiko follows with $235 million after growing by 47.73 percent, while Circle holds $182 million in assets on Stellar . The tweet further notes that firms such as WisdomTree, Ondo, and RedSwan are building on the network, with Ondo alone posting 994.4% over 30 days. Tokenization Trends and Implications for XLM Beyond current figures, the commentator situates Stellar’s progress within the wider tokenization trend. Global estimates for the tokenized asset market are projected to reach $16 trillion by 2030, with some forecasts extending beyond $30 trillion. Against this backdrop, X Finance Bull argues that Stellar is already capturing institutional-grade flows rather than positioning for future adoption. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The post stresses that XLM functions as the native token required for transactions, settlements, and transfers across the network. As more treasury bonds, government debt, real estate, equities, and commodities are issued and moved on Stellar, demand for XLM is framed as becoming structural rather than cyclical. The commentator concludes that the long-standing characterization of Stellar as primarily a payments-focused network understates its current role. According to X Finance Bull, Stellar is evolving into a settlement layer for tokenized finance. While the market price of XLM has yet to reflect this shift, the underlying activity suggests a different long-term valuation trajectory.

57619170,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=905884,1769880107,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57619170.jpeg,Hyperliquid rides HIP-3 momentum to highest daily revenue haul since November,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/hyperliquid-sees-daily-revenue-climb/,"Hyperliquid posted its strongest daily revenue in a month, with DefiLIama data showing daily revenue spiking to $4.3 million, its highest level since November last year. The surges come as the protocol maintains roughly $4.58 billion in TVL and an annualized run rate near $786 million. Perpetual contract (perp) fees, which have consistently accounted for the majority of Hyperliquid’s earnings, were the main driver of the latest revenue spike. Gross protocol income in January 2026 was $71.88 million, of which $63.86 million came from perp fees, $1.92 million from spot fees, and $5.65 million from builder code fees. Incentives and strong trading push Hyperliquid revenue to $4.3M DifiLiama data revealed that daily revenue reached $4.3 million, driven by ongoing incentive programs and liquidity provision. Strong trading activity and user engagement also contributed to revenue growth, with a cost of revenue of $7.4 million and a gross profit of $64.48 million. The protocol’s annualized earnings are currently $685.47 million. Daily trading is still strong with $HYPE 24-hour volume reaching $701.76 million, and $4.22 billion in DEX volume over 30 days. Currently, the $HYPE token is trading at $29.69%, up 0.8% in the last 24 hours. That is an increase of 18.2% from last month and a 10% increase year-to-date. However, the token is down 48% from its all-time high of $59.30 in September of last year. Building on this momentum, on January 26, 2026, Hyperliquid’s decentralized derivatives ecosystem attained a significant milestone when open interest on its HIP-3 perpetual futures markets reached a record $793.27 million. This resulted from traders’ desire for more exposure to actual assets and commodities. Hyperliquid announced the milestone on the social media platform X, noting that open interest in its HIP-3 structure has grown amid the ongoing boom in commodities trading. Factually, HIP-3, or Hyperliquid Improvement Proposal 3, is the name of the decentralized protocol upgrade that began in October 2025. By staking 500,000 HYPE tokens, the network’s native asset, developers and builders can create permissionless, everlasting futures markets on Hyperliquid’s blockchain. Since the rollout of HIP-3, open interest on Hyperliquid has steadily increased, rising from below $200 million to the $700–800 million range. This is one of the biggest participation expansions in the platform’s history. Following the recent surge in HIP-3, Hyperliquid CEO Jeff Yan stated that the platform has emerged as a prominent venue for long-term contracts on traditional assets. He claimed that the open interest data show that traders are increasingly drawn to Hyperliquid. According to CEO Jeff Yan, the significant rise in HYPE token value is indicative of increased trust in the platform’s liquidity advantages. Major whale transactions impact Hyperliquid market activity The surge in Hyperliquid and HIP-3 trading activities coincides with large HYPE holders’ recent staking and sell-off behavior. On January 27, Lookonchain revealed that a major whale started distributing a long-held HYPE stake after more than a year of accumulation and staking. Data showed that the wallet initially purchased 295,917 HYPE at an average price of $8.74, totaling $2.58 million USDC, before staking the entire position for about 14 months. On Tuesday, the whale unstaked and sold the entire position for 7.51M $USDC, realizing a $4.92M profit. Lookonchain revealed that at the peak, its profit surpassed $15M. In a separate report on January 29, on-chain data revealed that another notable, unidentified cryptocurrency investor, known as a “whale,” took out $14.87 million worth of HYPE tokens from the institutional crypto company Galaxy Digital. Analytics platform Onchain Lens tracked the transaction. The analytics platform revealed that an anonymous blockchain address beginning with the identifier “0xd4d” was the source of the transaction. It went on to say that the whale transferred 445,000 HYPE tokens from a Galaxy Digital custody or service. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC currently trades at $78,831.44 on the Binance USDT market, marking a notable decline from recent highs. This price movement represents a substantial shift in market sentiment that demands careful examination. Bitcoin Price Movement Analysis The current Bitcoin price of $78,831.44 represents a meaningful correction from recent levels. Market analysts immediately began examining multiple factors contributing to this decline. Trading volume patterns show increased activity across major exchanges. Furthermore, technical indicators suggest potential support levels around $78,000. Historical data reveals similar corrections occurred during previous market cycles. Market depth analysis indicates changing liquidity conditions across trading platforms. Order book data shows substantial sell orders accumulating above $80,000. Consequently, resistance levels have strengthened significantly. Meanwhile, institutional trading desks report adjusted positioning strategies. Several major funds have implemented risk management protocols. Cryptocurrency Market Context The broader cryptocurrency market typically follows Bitcoin’s price movements. Currently, Ethereum trades at $3,450, showing similar downward pressure. Altcoins demonstrate varied responses to Bitcoin’s decline. Some tokens maintain relative strength while others experience amplified losses. Market capitalization across all digital assets decreased by approximately 4.2%. Traditional financial markets show mixed correlations with cryptocurrency movements. Stock indices remain relatively stable during this period. However, gold prices show slight strengthening. The US Dollar Index maintains its current position. These relationships help analysts understand capital flow patterns between asset classes. Recent Bitcoin Price Levels and Changes Time Period Price Level Percentage Change 24 Hours Ago $81,250 -2.98% 7 Days Ago $82,100 -3.98% 30 Days Ago $76,500 +3.05% Year-to-Date $42,300 +86.36% Technical Analysis Perspective Technical analysts highlight several key indicators. The 50-day moving average currently sits at $75,200. The Relative Strength Index approaches oversold territory at 42. Trading volume exceeds the 30-day average by 18%. Support levels appear at $78,000 and $76,500. Resistance levels form around $80,500 and $82,000. Chart patterns show potential formation of a descending triangle. This pattern typically precedes significant breakouts. However, confirmation requires additional trading sessions. Fibonacci retracement levels from recent highs provide additional context. The 0.382 level aligns with current price action. Fundamental Factors Influencing Prices Multiple fundamental factors contribute to current market conditions. Regulatory developments continue influencing investor sentiment. Recent legislative proposals in major economies create uncertainty.

Bitcoin’s hash rate reaches new all-time highs consistently. Mining difficulty adjustments reflect network security improvements. Active address counts demonstrate sustained user adoption. Transaction volumes show healthy network utilization patterns. Market Sentiment: Fear and Greed Index shifts from Extreme Greed to Greed territory Institutional Flows: ETF products experience mixed capital movements Macro Conditions: Interest rate expectations influence risk asset pricing On-chain Metrics: Exchange balances show changing accumulation patterns Historical Price Action Context Bitcoin has experienced similar corrections throughout its history. The 2021 bull market featured multiple 20-30% pullbacks. Each correction preceded significant upward movements. Current volatility remains within historical norms. Seasoned investors recognize these patterns as healthy market behavior. The 2017 cycle provides particularly relevant comparisons. That period featured sharper corrections with faster recoveries. Market structure differences exist between cycles. Institutional participation now dominates trading activity. Derivative markets provide additional price discovery mechanisms. Market Impact and Investor Implications Current price movements create specific implications for different investor categories. Long-term holders typically maintain positions during such corrections. Short-term traders adjust strategies based on volatility expectations. Institutions rebalance portfolios according to risk parameters. Retail investors demonstrate varied responses to price declines. Leveraged positions face particular scrutiny during volatile periods. Exchange data shows decreasing leverage ratios across platforms. Margin call volumes remain within normal ranges. Options markets show increased put buying activity. Futures basis rates normalize toward historical averages. Global Economic Considerations Broader economic conditions influence cryptocurrency valuations. Inflation data from major economies shows moderating trends. Central bank policies continue evolving toward normalization. Geopolitical developments create traditional safe-haven flows. Currency markets experience their own volatility patterns. Emerging market adoption of digital assets accelerates despite price movements. Several nations continue developing central bank digital currencies. Payment system innovations incorporate blockchain technology. These developments create fundamental support for cryptocurrency ecosystems. Expert Analysis and Projections Market analysts provide balanced perspectives on current conditions. Technical experts emphasize support level importance. Fundamental analysts highlight network strength metrics. Macro analysts consider broader financial system interactions. Risk management professionals recommend position sizing adjustments. Historical precedent suggests healthy markets require periodic corrections. Overheated conditions typically precede substantial pullbacks. Current volatility measures remain below extreme levels. Liquidity conditions support orderly price discovery. Market structure improvements enhance stability mechanisms. Conclusion Bitcoin’s decline below $79,000 represents a significant market development. The current Bitcoin price of $78,831.44 reflects changing market dynamics. Multiple factors contribute to this price movement. Technical and fundamental analysis provides context for understanding these changes.

The move aligns with the standard federal agency shutdown plan that comes into play during funding lapses. What the shutdown means for the SEC and crypto regulation The announcement means that there will be extremely limited operations at the SEC until further notice. With this, divisions like Corporation Finance, Trading and Markets, and Investment Management are unable to perform routine activities. It is possible for emergency matters to be handled by the minimal staff expected to remain active and specific email contacts have reportedly been provided for any urgent issues. “The SEC has staff available to respond to emergency situations with a focus on market integrity and investor protection. Our plan calls for the continuing operation of certain Commission systems, including EDGAR,” the SEC wrote on X. This is not dissimilar to what went down during previous shutdowns where the SEC only retained essential personnel for life/property safety or emergencies while most of its other normal functions were put on hold. While the SEC is in this state, crypto-related activities and proceedings are likely to be affected. For example, the SEC chair, Paul Atkins, has had to postpone the release of exemptions for areas like tokenized securities and DeFi and cited the shutdown as a big contributing factor to the delays. Applications for new crypto products could also grind to a halt due to the administrative vacuums at the SEC and CFTC which now can’t be filled as reviews, nominations and confirmations will not be happening during a shutdown. Right now, many are expecting Congress to finally iron out crypto legislation but even that could see further delays as the shutdown complicates bipartisan support and could potentially delay voting. It is also very likely that stablecoin regulations and related tax guidance will be impacted. This is the second US government shutdown in recent months The latest headache facing the SEC stems from a lapse in funding for several major federal agencies, including those under the Financial Services and General Government appropriations bill, mainly because Congress failed to finalize and pass the necessary spending package in time. The Senate ultimately approved a bipartisan deal late on January 30. However, it was too late. The House was already in recess and scheduled to vote on Monday, February 2 or later. This led to a partial shutdown that took effect over the weekend and has seen many non-essential operations halt across affected agencies, including the SEC. The shutdown is not expected to last long and could potentially be resolved early next week as soon as the House acts and the POTUS signs the bills. Unfortunately, the current lapse has already pushed agencies like the SEC into contingency mode. There was also a government shutdown in the US between October and November 2025, but the difference is that the previous one was a more comprehensive shutdown, as all 12 appropriation bills lapsed, while this current one is partial, with only 6 of those bills having lapsed. It was also triggered by Congress’s inability to pass funding legislation, and it led to bipartisan disputes while affecting many agencies and causing significant economic impacts. The previous one lasted for 43 days, making it the longest shutdown so far in the country’s history. Get seen where it counts.

According to real-time monitoring data from Bitcoin World, BTC traded at $79,700 on the Binance USDT market, marking a notable decline from recent highs. This movement represents a pivotal moment for investors and analysts tracking cryptocurrency volatility patterns. Bitcoin Price Movement Analysis The descent below $80,000 follows several weeks of relative stability in cryptocurrency markets. Market analysts immediately began examining multiple contributing factors. Trading volume data shows increased selling pressure across major exchanges. Consequently, market sentiment shifted noticeably throughout the trading session. Technical indicators suggest potential support levels may emerge around $78,500. Historical data reveals similar patterns during previous market cycles. For instance, Bitcoin experienced comparable corrections in 2021 and 2023. However, current macroeconomic conditions differ substantially from previous periods. Federal Reserve policies continue influencing traditional financial markets. These policies indirectly affect cryptocurrency valuations through investor behavior changes. Recent Bitcoin Price Movements Time Period Price Range Percentage Change Last 24 Hours $81,200 – $79,700 -1.85% Last 7 Days $83,400 – $79,700 -4.43% Last 30 Days $78,100 – $84,200 +2.05% Market Context and Contributing Factors Several interconnected elements contributed to this price movement. First, institutional investment flows showed temporary slowing. Major cryptocurrency funds reported reduced inflows during the preceding week. Second, regulatory developments in key markets created uncertainty. European Union authorities recently announced enhanced monitoring protocols. These protocols specifically target cryptocurrency transaction reporting requirements. Third, traditional market correlations became more pronounced. Equity market declines preceded the cryptocurrency movement by approximately six hours. Technology stocks particularly influenced investor sentiment across asset classes. Fourth, mining difficulty adjustments affected market dynamics. Bitcoin’s mining difficulty reached new record levels recently. Higher mining costs potentially influence selling pressure from mining operations. Institutional flows: Temporary reduction in ETF and fund investments Regulatory environment: Increased scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions Market correlations: Strengthened connection to traditional equities Technical factors: Mining economics and network fundamentals Expert Perspectives on Market Dynamics Financial analysts from major institutions provided immediate commentary. JPMorgan Chase researchers noted typical volatility patterns. They emphasized Bitcoin’s historical resilience following similar corrections. Goldman Sachs analysts highlighted macroeconomic influences. Their report specifically mentioned inflation expectations and interest rate projections. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency specialists at Coinbase discussed technical factors. They pointed to exchange liquidity variations during the price movement. Academic researchers contributed additional insights. Massachusetts Institute of Technology blockchain experts referenced historical data. They compared current movements to 2017 and 2021 market cycles. Stanford University economists discussed regulatory impacts. Their analysis focused on proposed legislation in the United States Congress. University of Cambridge researchers provided mining cost analysis. They calculated breakeven points for major mining operations. Historical Comparisons and Pattern Recognition Bitcoin’s price history reveals important context for current movements. The cryptocurrency experienced seven major corrections exceeding 20% during the 2021 bull market. Each correction preceded significant price appreciation periods. However, market conditions evolved substantially since that period. Institutional participation increased dramatically. Regulatory frameworks developed across multiple jurisdictions. Technological infrastructure improved considerably. Previous support and resistance levels provide technical guidance. The $80,000 level previously acted as resistance during early 2024. It subsequently transformed into support during recent months. Market technicians now watch the $78,000 level closely. Historical data shows strong buying interest near that price point. Volume analysis confirms accumulation patterns during previous tests of that level. Global Market Reactions and Regional Variations Different geographic markets responded uniquely to the price movement. Asian trading sessions showed increased volatility. Japanese and South Korean exchanges reported above-average trading volumes. European markets demonstrated relative stability. Major European exchanges maintained narrower bid-ask spreads. United States markets experienced institutional rebalancing. Several major funds adjusted portfolio allocations during the decline. Regional regulatory approaches influenced market reactions. Singapore’s clear regulatory framework supported market stability. United Kingdom markets followed similar patterns. Conversely, markets in jurisdictions with regulatory uncertainty showed amplified movements. These variations highlight cryptocurrency market fragmentation. They also demonstrate the importance of regulatory clarity for price stability. Technical Analysis and Future Projections Technical indicators provide mixed signals about future movements. Moving averages show potential support convergence around $78,500. The 50-day moving average currently sits at $78,200. The 200-day moving average remains at $72,400. Relative strength index readings approached oversold territory during the decline. However, they stabilized before reaching extreme levels. On-chain metrics offer additional insights. Exchange net flows turned negative during the price decline. This suggests accumulation rather than distribution patterns. Network activity metrics remained stable throughout the movement. Daily active addresses maintained consistent levels. Transaction volume showed moderate increases. These fundamentals suggest underlying network strength despite price volatility. Conclusion Bitcoin’s decline below $80,000 represents a significant market development with multiple contributing factors. The movement reflects complex interactions between institutional flows, regulatory developments, and technical market dynamics. Historical patterns suggest potential support levels may emerge around $78,000 to $78,500. Market participants continue monitoring fundamental indicators alongside price movements. The Bitcoin price action demonstrates cryptocurrency market maturation while maintaining characteristic volatility. Future movements will likely depend on macroeconomic conditions and regulatory developments across major jurisdictions. FAQs Q1: What caused Bitcoin to fall below $80,000? Multiple factors contributed including reduced institutional inflows, regulatory uncertainty in some markets, correlations with traditional equity declines, and technical market dynamics including mining economics. Q2: How does this decline compare to previous Bitcoin corrections? This movement appears moderate compared to historical corrections. Bitcoin experienced seven declines exceeding 20% during the 2021 bull market alone, though current market conditions differ substantially due to increased institutional participation. Q3: What are key support levels to watch after this decline? Technical analysts identify $78,500 as immediate support, with stronger historical support around $78,000. The 50-day moving average at $78,200 and 200-day moving average at $72,400 provide additional reference points. Q4: How did different global markets react to the price movement? Asian markets showed increased volatility with higher trading volumes, European markets demonstrated relative stability with narrow spreads, and U.S. markets experienced institutional rebalancing with fund allocation adjustments. Q5: What on-chain metrics suggest about current market conditions? Exchange net flows turned negative indicating accumulation patterns, network activity remained stable with consistent daily active addresses, and transaction volume increased moderately suggesting underlying network strength despite price volatility.

Markets moved fast, and some of the biggest swings were driven by short-term reactions rather than a change in long-term views. Related Reading: Ethereum Boost: Vitalik Buterin Sets Aside $45M In ETH For Privacy And Open Tech Spot Crypto ETF Flows Based on reports from Farside, US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs saw about $1.50 billion leave over five trading days, while spot Ether ETFs had roughly $327 million in outflows. That adds up to about $1.80 billion pulled from these funds in just a few days. On Jan. 14, reports note a very large inflow for Bitcoin ETFs — $840 million — which shows how quickly money can go in and out. Some traders treated that day as a buying moment. Others used it to take profit. That push-and-pull shows up in the numbers. A Rally In Metals, Then A Sudden Drop Gold and silver grabbed attention when they climbed to fresh highs. Prices surged, and many investors moved money into precious metals. But the rally was short-lived. On a single trading day, gold fell sharply from its peak and silver tumbled even more. Reports say those sudden reversals left some investors rethinking their moves and helped create a wave of selling across other risk assets, including crypto. Bitcoin Price Action Bitcoin has been swinging. Over the past week, BTC fell about 6.50% while Ether dropped around 8.90%, and they were trading around $82,500 and $2,685, respectively, according to CoinMarketCap. The market had a short spike after talk of the US CLARITY Act, but prices then cooled. Moves like this are often tied to positioning, margin calls, and traders reacting to headlines. At times, large flows into ETFs have pushed prices up. Other times, outflows coincide with volatile days when traders close positions quickly. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Slide To $82K Sets Off A $1.7 Billion Chain Reaction What Analysts Are Saying Reports note that some market watchers view the pullback as temporary. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said the current negativity about Bitcoin’s price is short-sighted and pointed to strong performance in prior years as context. Another voice, Bitwise’s Matt Hougan, suggested that continued ETF demand could send Bitcoin into a much higher trajectory over time. These views reflect different timeframes — some focus on immediate flows, others on how steady demand might shape prices months from now.

This came before the first FOMC meeting for the year, but the asset began its spectacular nosedive in the following hours after the Fed paused the interest rate cuts. The skyrocketing geopolitical tension in the Middle East led to another crash on Thursday when ETH, alongside the rest of the crypto market, tumbled below $2,800.

The Binance coin price prediction for 2028 projects a maximum price of $3,321.49 and a minimum price of $2,797.05. By 2032, BNB’s price could surge to $6,817.80 with broader acceptance in mainstream finance. After notable changes in its executive team, Binance has shown resilience and prospects for recovery. The departure of Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO, who was also embroiled in legal challenges, initially caused a decline in the value of Binance coin (BNB). Despite this initial setback, the cryptocurrency has shown a positive trend. In September 2020, Binance introduced BNB Smart Chain, which was initially designed for trading and transferring tokens and runs parallel to Binance Chain and supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). What’s next for BNB in the remainder of 2026 and beyond? What can be the future price movements? Let’s get into the BNB price prediction and technical analysis.

The altcoin lost 2.06% of its value. BNB faces resistance around $903. As of January 31, 2026, Binance Coin is showing a downtrend with selling momentum building up. The price analysis reveals the coin is losing buyers’ interest after finding resistance at $903. BNB is trading at $829.2, and this bearish trend has resulted in a loss of 2.06% in value in the last 24 hours. BNB/USD price analysis on the daily timeframe The one-day chart for Binance Coin (BNB) confirms a bearish trend. The coin has experienced a correction, with the price moving toward the $829.2 mark as selling momentum intensifies. The recent downtrend is relatively significant, and bears are trying to continue their lead. The presence of red candlesticks on the chart clearly signifies bearish dominance. The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the intensity of volatility. This distance is slowly increasing, leading to high volatility. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, suggesting resistance, has shifted to $964, whereas its lower limit, indicating a broken support, has moved to $835. BNB/USD Price Chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is trending within the neutral region. The indicator’s value has decreased to the 34 level in the past 24 hours. This decrease confirms a rising selling activity in the market. BNB price analysis on a 4-hour chart The four-hour chart analysis of Binance Coin also shows negative sentiment for the altcoin. The BNB/USD pair decreased to $829.1 over the past few hours. The price is now trending below the moving average value, which is at $845. The Bollinger Bands have diverged, resulting in high volatility levels. The high volatility signifies a higher chance of an upcoming reversal or further price decrease.

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bearish prediction as the current market sentiment turns negative. The coin’s price also decreased to $829.2 as selling momentum surged once again. If traders continue selling, the BNB price might see a further decrease and break below $815. On the other hand, a success in attracting buying demand might result in a recovery. In such a case, the price of BNB might head toward the immediate resistance at $869. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $6,817.80 in 2032. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB down? BNB found resistance, and the price moved toward $829.2, as bears target $815. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 2.06 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $1000? The BNB price has already crossed $1000 in 2025, and buyers are holding it above $800. BNB can cross the $1000 again in 2026 anytime. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction , BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on futures trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 by the end of 2028, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $6,817.80 by 2032. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice. Recent news/opinions on BNB The BNB Foundation announced that 1.37 million BNB tokens, worth roughly $1.27 billion, have been burned. This marks the first quarterly burn of 2026.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. On September 21, BNB reached the $1,079.07 mark. In October, it hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $1,369.99 and is trading near the $1,100 mark in November. By the end of November, the price of BNB declined below $800. In early December, BNB price triggered a strong bull run toward $900. At the start of 2026, BNB is trending near the $870 level.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-31 17:32:41

This rapid deleveraging event followed broader market movements that saw $1.22 billion in liquidations across the previous 24-hour period, according to aggregated exchange data. Market analysts immediately began examining the underlying causes and potential implications for derivative traders and overall market stability. Understanding the $269 Million Futures Liquidations Event Futures liquidations represent forced closures of leveraged positions when traders cannot meet margin requirements. Consequently, exchanges automatically sell collateral to prevent losses. This particular liquidation wave affected multiple cryptocurrency derivatives platforms simultaneously. Major exchanges including Binance, Bybit, and OKX reported the highest volumes. Typically, such events occur during rapid price movements that trigger cascading stop-loss orders. Market data reveals Bitcoin and Ethereum contracts comprised approximately 68% of the liquidated value. Specifically, long positions accounted for nearly $187 million of the total, while short positions represented $82 million. This distribution suggests a sudden downward price movement caught overleveraged bullish traders. Historical comparison shows this event ranks among the top 15 hourly liquidation events since 2023, though substantially smaller than record-setting episodes exceeding $1 billion. Cryptocurrency Derivatives Market Context and Structure The cryptocurrency derivatives market has evolved significantly since its inception. Currently, daily trading volumes regularly exceed $100 billion across global platforms. Futures contracts allow traders to speculate on price movements without owning underlying assets. Most exchanges offer leverage ranging from 5x to 125x, amplifying both potential profits and risks. Regulatory developments in 2024 introduced stricter margin requirements on several platforms, potentially influencing current market dynamics. Market structure analysis reveals several contributing factors to liquidation events. First, clustered leverage at specific price levels creates liquidation cascades. Second, algorithmic trading systems often exacerbate volatility through coordinated selling. Third, macroeconomic announcements frequently trigger correlated movements across crypto assets. The March 2025 event coincided with traditional market openings and key economic indicator releases, creating perfect storm conditions. Expert Analysis of Market Mechanics and Risk Factors Derivatives specialists emphasize several critical aspects of liquidation mechanics. Funding rate imbalances frequently precede major volatility events. When perpetual contract funding rates become excessively positive, the market becomes vulnerable to long squeezes. Exchange risk management systems automatically calculate liquidation prices based on collateral ratios. Market makers and institutional traders typically employ sophisticated hedging strategies to mitigate such risks. Historical data from CryptoQuant and Glassnode provides valuable context. The 24-hour liquidation total of $1.22 billion represents approximately 0.8% of total open interest across major platforms. Comparatively, the March 2023 banking crisis triggered $2.5 billion in liquidations within 24 hours. Current market conditions show reduced overall leverage ratios compared to previous bull markets, suggesting improved risk management among institutional participants. Impact on Trader Psychology and Market Sentiment Significant liquidation events inevitably affect market participant behavior. Immediately following the volatility spike, fear and greed indicators dropped from “greed” to “neutral” territory. Social media analysis shows increased discussions about risk management and position sizing. Experienced traders often view such events as buying opportunities, while newer participants frequently exit markets temporarily. Market sentiment surveys conducted after the event revealed cautious optimism among institutional investors. Behavioral finance principles help explain typical responses to liquidation waves. First, loss aversion causes traders to become more risk-averse following substantial losses. Second, recency bias makes participants overestimate the likelihood of continued volatility. Third, herding behavior often amplifies price movements as traders follow perceived market leaders. Educational platforms reported increased traffic to risk management resources following the March 15 event. Technical Analysis of Price Action and Support Levels Price chart analysis reveals specific technical patterns surrounding the liquidation event. Bitcoin tested crucial support levels around $68,500 before rebounding to $70,200 within four hours. Ethereum similarly defended the $3,450 support zone despite initial breakdown attempts. Trading volume analysis shows spot market buying absorbed most liquidation selling pressure, preventing more severe price declines. Several technical indicators flashed oversold conditions during the volatility spike. Key technical levels to monitor include: Bitcoin resistance: $72,800 (previous weekly high) Bitcoin support: $67,200 (200-hour moving average) Ethereum resistance: $3,850 (consolidation zone upper bound) Ethereum support: $3,380 (volume-weighted average price anchor) Regulatory Developments and Exchange Risk Management Global regulatory bodies have increased scrutiny of cryptocurrency derivatives trading throughout 2024 and 2025. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations introduced stricter leverage limits for retail traders. Similarly, United States regulatory discussions have focused on centralized clearing mechanisms for crypto derivatives. Exchange compliance departments have implemented enhanced risk management protocols in response to these developments. Major trading platforms employ several mechanisms to manage liquidation risks. Isolated margin modes prevent position contagion across accounts. Insurance funds cover losses when liquidations cannot execute at calculated prices. Periodic volatility pauses temporarily halt trading during extreme movements. These safeguards have substantially reduced instances of negative balance occurrences compared to earlier market periods. Exchange transparency reports now regularly publish liquidation statistics and risk metrics. Institutional Perspective on Derivatives Market Evolution Institutional adoption of cryptocurrency derivatives continues accelerating despite volatility events. Hedge funds utilize futures for portfolio hedging and basis trading strategies. Family offices increasingly allocate to structured products with defined risk parameters. Traditional finance institutions have launched regulated derivative products including exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and listed options. This institutional participation provides additional market depth and liquidity during volatile periods. Market infrastructure improvements have enhanced derivatives trading safety. Custodial solutions now offer segregated collateral accounts. Independent price oracles reduce manipulation risks. Cross-margin netting systems optimize capital efficiency. Surveillance technology monitors for coordinated trading patterns. These advancements create more resilient markets capable of absorbing significant liquidation events without systemic disruptions. Historical Comparison and Market Cycle Analysis Comparing current market conditions to previous cycles provides valuable perspective. The 2021 bull market witnessed multiple liquidation events exceeding $2 billion within 24 hours. Market structure has matured significantly since that period, with reduced average leverage ratios and improved risk management practices. Current open interest as a percentage of total market capitalization remains below 2021 peaks, suggesting more sustainable derivative market growth. Major Cryptocurrency Liquidation Events Comparison Date 24-Hour Liquidations Primary Trigger Market Recovery Time May 2021 $9.8 billion China mining ban announcement 42 days November 2022 $4.5 billion FTX collapse aftermath 67 days March 2023 $2.5 billion Silvergate Bank crisis 18 days March 2025 $1.22 billion Leverage unwinding + macro factors Ongoing Risk Management Strategies for Derivatives Traders Professional traders employ multiple techniques to navigate volatile market conditions. Position sizing remains the most critical risk management component, with experienced traders rarely exceeding 2-3% risk per position. Diversification across uncorrelated assets reduces portfolio volatility. Stop-loss orders should reference technical levels rather than arbitrary percentages. Monitoring funding rates and open interest changes provides early warning signals for potential liquidation events. Advanced strategies include: Delta-neutral approaches: Balancing long and short positions to minimize directional exposure Volatility targeting: Adjusting position sizes based on market volatility measurements Cross-hedging: Using correlated assets to offset specific risks Scenario analysis: Preparing contingency plans for various market conditions Conclusion The $269 million futures liquidation event highlights both the risks and maturation of cryptocurrency derivatives markets. While substantial in absolute terms, this volatility episode represents normal market functioning within an evolving financial ecosystem. Market structure improvements, enhanced risk management protocols, and institutional participation have increased systemic resilience. Traders should view such events as reminders of fundamental risk management principles rather than market anomalies. Continued monitoring of leverage ratios, funding rates, and regulatory developments will remain essential for navigating cryptocurrency derivatives markets successfully. FAQs Q1: What causes futures liquidations in cryptocurrency markets? Futures liquidations occur when traders cannot meet margin requirements during price movements. Exchanges automatically close positions to prevent losses exceeding collateral. Rapid price changes often trigger cascading liquidations as stop-loss orders execute simultaneously. Q2: How do liquidation events affect overall market prices? Liquidations create selling pressure that can amplify price movements temporarily. However, modern markets typically absorb this pressure through countervailing buying interest. The impact depends on market depth, leverage concentration, and overall sentiment conditions. Q3: What percentage of traders typically experience liquidations during volatility events? Statistical analysis suggests 5-15% of leveraged positions face liquidation during significant volatility events. The exact percentage varies based on average leverage ratios, position concentrations at specific price levels, and risk management practices across exchanges. Q4: How have exchanges improved liquidation processes since 2021? Platforms have implemented isolated margin modes, enhanced insurance funds, volatility pauses, and partial liquidation mechanisms. Price oracle systems have become more robust, and risk management teams now monitor leverage concentrations more proactively. Q5: What strategies help traders avoid liquidation during market volatility? Effective strategies include conservative position sizing, diversification across assets, technical-based stop-loss placement, funding rate monitoring, and maintaining adequate collateral buffers. Advanced traders employ delta-neutral approaches and volatility targeting systems.

This dramatic event, recorded across major exchanges on March 21, 2025, highlights the extreme volatility and inherent risks within the crypto derivatives sector. Consequently, traders globally are now analyzing the cascading effects of this liquidity shock. Futures Liquidated: Anatomy of a $652 Million Hour The core data reveals a concentrated burst of market stress. Specifically, $652 million in leveraged futures positions were forcibly closed by exchanges in just 60 minutes. Furthermore, the total for the preceding 24-hour period reached $1.597 billion. This liquidation event primarily affected long positions, where traders bet on price increases. Major platforms like Binance, Bybit, and OKX reported the highest volumes. Such rapid liquidations typically occur when prices move sharply against leveraged traders, triggering automatic sell-offs. To understand the scale, analysts often compare these figures to historical events. For instance, the May 2021 market crash saw over $8 billion liquidated in 24 hours. Similarly, the November 2022 FTX collapse triggered multi-billion dollar liquidation cascades. Therefore, while significant, the current event fits a known pattern of crypto market cycles. The immediate catalyst appeared to be a rapid 7% decline in Bitcoin’s price, which breached critical technical support levels watched by automated trading systems. Mechanics of a Liquidation Cascade Liquidation is a mandatory closure of a trader’s position due to a partial or total loss of their initial margin. It happens when a trader cannot meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position. Exchanges execute this automatically to prevent losses from exceeding the trader’s collateral. Leverage: Traders borrow capital to amplify positions, often 10x to 100x their initial investment. Margin Call: When losses deplete the maintenance margin, the exchange issues a warning. Liquidation: If the trader fails to add funds, the exchange sells the assets at market price. Cascade Effect: Mass liquidations create sell pressure, pushing prices down further and triggering more liquidations. Context and Causes of the Market Volatility Several converging factors likely precipitated this volatility spike. First, macroeconomic uncertainty surrounding interest rate decisions from major central banks created a risk-off sentiment across all asset classes. Second, on-chain data showed large transfers of Bitcoin to exchanges, signaling potential selling intent from large holders, often called “whales.” Third, the options market indicated a high concentration of leverage built around specific price points, creating a fragile equilibrium. Market structure also plays a crucial role. The proliferation of high-leverage derivative products, sometimes offering up to 125x leverage, creates a tinderbox environment. A relatively small price move can therefore ignite a disproportionate reaction. Additionally, the interconnectedness of trading algorithms means one major liquidation can trigger a chain reaction as other systems react to the same price signals and volume spikes. Historical Comparison of Major Liquidation Events Date Event/Catalyst 24-Hour Liquidation Volume Primary Asset May 19, 2021 China Mining Crackdown Announcement $8.7 Billion Bitcoin, Ethereum Nov 9, 2022 FTX Collapse & Solvency Crisis $2.6 Billion FTT, Bitcoin Jan 4, 2024 Spot ETF Approval Sell-the-News $1.1 Billion Bitcoin Mar 21, 2025 Macro Pressure & Leverage Unwind $1.597 Billion Bitcoin, Altcoins Immediate Market Impact and Trader Sentiment The immediate effect was a sharp, albeit brief, drop in overall market capitalization. The fear and greed index, a common sentiment gauge, plunged into “extreme fear” territory within hours. Funding rates on perpetual futures contracts, which had been positive, turned sharply negative. This shift indicates that traders were now paying to hold short positions, expecting further declines. However, spot market volumes did not see a corresponding extreme spike, suggesting the volatility was largely contained to the derivatives complex. Market analysts observed that such violent deleveraging events, while painful for affected traders, can serve to reset excessive speculation. They often remove overextended leverage from the system, potentially creating a healthier foundation for the next price move. Data from Glassnode and CoinMetrics showed that the net transfer of Bitcoin from exchanges actually increased after the event, suggesting some investors viewed the dip as a buying opportunity. Expert Analysis on Systemic Risk Dr. Lena Chen, a financial technology professor at Stanford University, notes, “These events underscore the dual nature of crypto derivatives. They provide essential liquidity and hedging tools, but their high-leverage offerings amplify systemic risk. The 2025 market infrastructure is more robust than in 2021, with better risk management at the exchange level. However, cross-margin and interconnected positions can still propagate shocks.” This expert perspective highlights the ongoing evolution of market safeguards. Long-Term Implications for the Crypto Derivatives Landscape Regulatory scrutiny on leverage limits is likely to intensify following such visible events. Jurisdictions like the European Union, with its MiCA framework, already impose strict leverage caps for retail traders. Other regions may follow suit. Secondly, exchanges may proactively adjust their risk parameters, increasing margin requirements or implementing more gradual liquidation engines to avoid market-destructive cascades. Innovation in derivative products is also accelerating. The growth of options trading and the emergence of structured products with built-in downside protection offer alternatives to simple leveraged futures. Furthermore, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are creating on-chain derivatives with transparent, real-time liquidation processes. These developments aim to distribute risk more efficiently and reduce single points of failure. Conclusion The event where $652 million in futures were liquidated in one hour serves as a powerful reminder of the volatile and interconnected nature of cryptocurrency markets. It demonstrates how leverage can magnify price movements and lead to rapid, cascading sell-offs. While the market absorbed the shock, the event will likely influence trader behavior, exchange policy, and regulatory discussions. Understanding the mechanics behind such futures liquidations is crucial for any participant navigating the high-stakes world of crypto derivatives. FAQs Q1: What does “futures liquidated” mean? A1: It means a trader’s leveraged futures position was forcibly closed by an exchange because the value of their collateral fell below the required maintenance margin. This is an automatic process to prevent the trader’s losses from exceeding their deposited funds. Q2: Why do liquidations happen so quickly in crypto markets? A2: Crypto markets operate 24/7 with high leverage offerings and automated trading systems. When prices move rapidly, margin calls happen instantly, and algorithms execute liquidations at market price to minimize exchange losses, creating a fast cascade. Q3: Who loses money in a liquidation event? A3: Primarily the traders whose positions are liquidated. They lose the initial margin (collateral) they posted for the trade. The exchange uses these funds to cover the loss on the position. Other traders may also be affected by the resulting price volatility. Q4: Can liquidation events cause a market crash? A4: While they can exacerbate downward moves, a standalone liquidation cascade is often a symptom, not the sole cause, of a major crash. It amplifies existing selling pressure. True market crashes usually involve fundamental issues like regulatory news, macroeconomic shifts, or systemic failures. Q5: How can traders protect themselves from liquidation? A5: Traders can use lower leverage, maintain a higher margin balance than the minimum requirement, set stop-loss orders, diversify portfolios, and avoid over-concentrating positions. Monitoring funding rates and market sentiment can also provide early warning signs.

This intense activity, recorded across major global exchanges on March 21, 2025, highlights the extreme volatility inherent in digital asset markets. Consequently, the total for the preceding 24 hours surged to a staggering $1.494 billion, signaling a period of significant deleveraging and price discovery. Crypto Futures Liquidated: Anatomy of a $525 Million Hour Market data aggregators and exchange APIs reported the concentrated futures liquidation cascade beginning in the early trading hours. Primarily, long positions—bets on rising prices—constituted the majority of the forced closures. This event typically occurs when prices move sharply against highly leveraged traders, automatically triggering sell orders to prevent further losses for the exchange and the trader. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) pairs accounted for over 70% of the liquidated value, underscoring their dominance in the derivatives market. Furthermore, analysts immediately scrutinized order book depth and funding rates. Prior to the event, perpetual swap funding rates had turned significantly positive, indicating excessive bullish sentiment and crowded long trades. This created a precarious market structure vulnerable to a swift correction. When a sell-off commenced, it cascaded through these over-leveraged positions, amplifying the downward price movement. The scale of this hourly liquidation places it among the top ten such events in the past two years. Understanding Futures Market Mechanics and Volatility To grasp the magnitude of a $525 million liquidation , one must understand derivatives trading. Cryptocurrency futures contracts allow traders to speculate on price movements without owning the underlying asset, often using leverage. Leverage multiplies both potential gains and losses. For instance, a trader using 10x leverage faces liquidation if the price moves just 10% against their position. Exchanges manage this risk with automated liquidation engines. Liquidation Price: The specific price point where a position is forcibly closed. Margin Call: A warning that additional funds are needed to maintain the position. Cascade Effect: Liquidations can trigger further price moves, leading to more liquidations. Market volatility, measured by indices like the Bitcoin Volatility Index (BVOL), had been rising steadily in the days leading to the event. This increase often precedes large price swings. The cryptocurrency market volatility seen here reflects a combination of macroeconomic news flows, large wallet movements identified by blockchain analysts, and shifting sentiment in traditional finance markets. Historical Context and Comparative Analysis This event draws immediate comparisons to previous deleveraging cycles. For example, the May 2021 market downturn saw over $2 billion liquidated in 24 hours. The November 2022 FTX collapse triggered multi-billion dollar liquidations across several days. The March 2025 event, while significant, appears more contained within a shorter timeframe, suggesting different underlying catalysts. The table below provides a quick comparison of recent major liquidation events. Recent Major Cryptocurrency Futures Liquidation Events Date 1-Hour Peak 24-Hour Total Primary Catalyst May 19, 2021 ~$1B ~$8.7B Regulatory Fears, Leverage Unwind Nov 8-10, 2022 ~$400M ~$3.5B (over 3 days) Exchange Insolvency (FTX) Jan 3, 2024 ~$300M ~$1B ETF Approval Speculation Reversal Mar 21, 2025 $525M $1.494B Aggressive Long Squeeze, Volatility Spike Impact on Traders and Exchange Stability The immediate impact of such a futures liquidation event is twofold. First, individual traders and funds holding leveraged positions face substantial, rapid capital loss. This can lead to a reduction in overall market open interest as capital exits the derivatives market. Second, exchanges must manage the technical execution of thousands of liquidations simultaneously. Reputable platforms with robust infrastructure typically handle this process smoothly, ensuring the liquidated collateral is sold to cover losses without causing excessive slippage. However, these events test exchange resilience. Systems must process orders reliably under extreme load. Following past incidents, major exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and OKX have publicly detailed their liquidation engine upgrades and risk management frameworks. They often use a partial liquidation system or an Auto-Deleveraging (ADL) mechanism as a last resort to socialize losses among profitable traders, though this is rare on the largest venues. The March 2025 event proceeded without reported major technical issues, indicating improved industry infrastructure. Expert Insights on Market Health and Sentiment Market analysts view such liquidations as a necessary, if painful, reset mechanism. “Large liquidation events often wash out excessive leverage, creating a healthier foundation for the next price move,” notes a veteran derivatives trader from a Singapore-based fund. “The $525 million figure is eye-catching, but the more telling metric is the ratio of long vs. short liquidations. A dominance of long liquidations suggests the market was overly optimistic and needed a correction.” Data from Coinglass and other analytics firms confirmed a long/short liquidation ratio of nearly 3:1 during the peak hour. This aligns with the “long squeeze” hypothesis. Meanwhile, on-chain data from Glassnode shows a concurrent spike in the number of active addresses and transaction volume, suggesting heightened network activity as traders reposition. This expert analysis provides crucial context beyond the raw dollar figures, pointing to a market recalibrating risk. Conclusion The crypto futures liquidation of $525 million in one hour serves as a potent reminder of the high-risk, high-reward nature of leveraged digital asset trading. While the headline number is staggering, it represents a routine, if severe, market function that removes unsustainable positions. The event underscores the critical importance of robust risk management for traders and continuous infrastructure development for exchanges. As the cryptocurrency market matures, such volatility episodes provide valuable stress tests, ultimately contributing to a more resilient and sophisticated global financial ecosystem for digital assets. FAQs Q1: What causes a futures liquidation in crypto? A futures liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position loses enough value that it falls below the maintenance margin requirement. The exchange then automatically closes the position to prevent further losses, selling the collateral to cover the debt. Q2: Were Bitcoin futures the main contributor to the $525 million? Yes, Bitcoin (BTC) futures contracts typically account for the largest share of total liquidated value in broad market moves, often followed by Ethereum (ETH). In this event, BTC and ETH pairs represented over 70% of the liquidations. Q3: Does a large liquidation event mean the market will crash? Not necessarily. While large liquidations often accompany sharp price declines, they can also mark a local bottom or a volatility climax. By flushing out excessive leverage, they can sometimes set the stage for a price stabilization or reversal. Q4: How can traders avoid being liquidated? Traders can avoid liquidation by using lower leverage, employing stop-loss orders, constantly monitoring their margin ratio, and never risking more capital than they can afford to lose. Maintaining a healthy cushion above the liquidation price is essential. Q5: Do all cryptocurrency exchanges handle liquidations the same way? No, methodologies can differ. Most major exchanges use a similar mark price and margin system, but their liquidation engines, partial liquidation policies, and the use of Auto-Deleveraging (ADL) can vary. Traders should understand their chosen exchange’s specific risk parameters.

The developer drew comparisons between visionaries in the crypto space and historical artists who faced rejection during their lifetimes. Dhairya's post, titled ”Misunderstood visionary,” referenced figures including Vincent van Gogh, Shiba Inu lead Shytoshi Kusama, and Elon Musk. The developer argued that many creators face mockery and indifference before their work gains recognition. The statement comes as Kusama faces increased scrutiny from community members and critics. Dhairya suggested this treatment reflects a pattern seen throughout history when visionaries challenge conventional thinking. Vision Over Short-Term Price Action The developer challenged critics directly, asking if they remembered when SHIB was dismissed as a joke in 2020. He emphasized that vision and consistent building created the project's current position in the market. Dhairya noted the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets affects how leaders are perceived. When SHIB reached its all-time high in October 2021 after gains of millions of percent, Kusama received widespread praise. Community members called him a genius and savior of retail investors. Market downturns brought a different response. Kusama has faced accusations of running scams, received personal attacks, and dealt with persistent FUD campaigns. Dhairya highlighted this shift as predictable in an industry where success often gets measured solely by price movement. The developer explained that building an ecosystem requires more than speculation. The work involves high stakes, public scrutiny, and real financial consequences for participants. He stressed that the Shiba Inu team has largely ignored attacks and negative campaigns until now. Warning to Critics and FUD Spreaders Dhairya issued a clear warning to those spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt about the project. While the SHIB Army has maintained a policy of ignoring attacks, the developer indicated the community can respond forcefully when necessary. ”Don't test us,” Dhairya wrote, signaling a potential shift in how the team and community handle criticism going forward. The developer's post serves as both a defense of Kusama's leadership and a broader commentary on how innovation gets judged. He pointed to historical precedent showing that mocking visionaries often leads to regret. The message resonated with community members who have supported the project through multiple market cycles. Many SHIB holders view the current criticism as temporary noise that fails to account for long-term development efforts. The Shiba Inu community is preparing for what Kusama described as an ”ultra important” event scheduled for Sunday. The lead ambassador indicated he will share his thoughts during a lengthy session lasting approximately two hours. Kusama emphasized the significance of the upcoming communication. He stated the information would be extremely important to many community members. The announcement has generated anticipation among SHIB holders and observers. The timing of Dhairya's post appears strategic, coming just before Kusama's planned address.

The interaction began with a direct appeal from an XRP holder urging Schwartz to publicly dismiss the possibility of XRP reaching $50 and $100, arguing that unrealistic expectations were contributing to financial harm among retail investors. The request framed the issue as one of moral responsibility, asking Schwartz to speak plainly to supporters about what the commenter viewed as unattainable price levels. The appeal suggested that continued belief in such valuations had led many investors to suffer losses, and that clarity from a senior figure associated with Ripple could help prevent further damage. It’s insane to hear this crackpot dev was dumping $XRP on us at $0.10c when we believed it would go to $100 Now he’s saying it’s unlikely it will go to $50- $100 What the fuck are we still holding for!? -These guys don’t even believe it anymore. Let’s be honest, Its failed https://t.co/oVJlPIGJCR — Crypto Bitlord (@crypto_bitlord7) January 30, 2026 David Schwartz Explains His Reluctance In response, Schwartz declined to make a definitive statement ruling out high price targets. He said he did not feel comfortable making such a claim, even though he personally considered those levels unlikely. Schwartz explained that his own experience in the digital asset market had made him cautious about declaring price outcomes impossible. He noted that there were several moments in crypto history when widely held assumptions proved wrong. As an example, Schwartz recalled a time when he believed it was unlikely XRP would ever trade at $0.25. He also shared that he began selling XRP at around $0.10 because the prices appeared unreasonable to him at the time. Drawing a parallel, he added that Bitcoin reaching $100 once seemed unrealistic to many observers, yet it ultimately surpassed that level. Schwartz’s comments were framed as a reflection on uncertainty rather than an endorsement of extreme price targets, emphasizing how difficult it can be to predict long-term market outcomes. Crypto Bitlord’s Strong Rebuttal Crypto Bitlord responded forcefully to Schwartz’s remarks, expressing frustration and disbelief at the CTO’s past actions and current stance. In his reply, Crypto Bitlord criticized Schwartz for selling XRP at $0.10 when many holders were waiting for $100. He described it as troubling to hear that a core developer associated with the ecosystem had reduced exposure at such early price levels. Crypto Bitlord questioned the rationale for continuing to hold XRP under these circumstances, suggesting that leadership no longer believed in the same upside that many supporters once anticipated. He concluded his response by declaring that, in his assessment, the project had failed.

Among the largest digital assets by market capitalization, XRP often reignites that debate with its cyclical price behavior and recurring patterns. This dynamic compels market participants to study its structure rather than succumb to noise‑driven speculation. In a recent analysis posted on X by finance educator ROB ART, he urged long‑term traders to apply patience and tactical discipline to XRP’s price action. He framed the strategy around identifying high‑probability buy zones during drawdowns, accumulating positions within those ranges, and then holding through structural rallies to capture significant gains — a method rooted in historical chart behavior and market psychology. Understanding XRP’s Historical Price Structure XRP’s price history reveals periods of extended consolidation followed by sharp breakouts. For instance, the token spent nearly 400 days in a sideways accumulation phase before breaking toward new highs in past cycles . For anyone that’s looking for big gains with $XRP , you’ll get the chance to do so. Once it reaches the buy levels, simply accumulate and wait for it to pump to sell. It delivered a roughly 10 X pump every time, from the accumulation zone. So wait for the drop, buy, wait, sell. pic.twitter.com/ZKcbjiTJtG — ROB ART CRYPTO COINS CREW (@SirRobArtII1) January 31, 2026 Analysts have noted structural similarities between the current price setup and those historical patterns , particularly where multi‑month bases formed before explosive upward moves. These patterns often manifest as descending wedges or symmetrical triangles, where price compresses and volatility contracts over time. Such formations typically attract strategic participants who accumulate quietly while short‑term traders lose interest. The narrative then shifts when a breakout triggers broader attention and renewed capital inflows. The Accumulation Phase: Where Discipline Matters ROB ART’s emphasis on waiting for “buy levels” reflects a core principle in technical trading: never chase peaks. Historically, XRP’s most dramatic gains did not occur during manic price spikes but after long periods of accumulation that drew in committed capital at lower levels. In the context of the current market, this means identifying structural support zones during pullbacks, building positions incrementally, and preparing for breakout triggers. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Accumulation isn’t merely buying dips; it reflects an understanding of market structure, where participants recognize when sellers have been exhausted, and supply is absorbed. Traders who followed this pattern in past cycles saw sizable returns when XRP resolved out of its base patterns into strong uptrends. Managing Risk While Targeting Gains Even seasoned analysts caution that historical patterns aren’t certainties . The crypto market today features more institutional involvement, regulatory clarity, and macro dependencies than in earlier cycles. These factors can alter the speed and scale of rallies. However, the underlying behavior — long bases followed by impulsive expansions — still provides a framework for managing risk and setting realistic expectations. Discipline remains paramount. Accumulating only at defined support levels and scaling into positions gradually can help mitigate the risk of poorly timed entries. Waiting for structural confirmation — such as breakouts from long compression zones — ensures participants avoid premature sizing into volatile moves. Patience, Strategy, and Structure For traders seeking big gains with XRP, the lesson is clear: prioritize structure over hype, discipline over impulse. ROB ART’s guidance underscores that the most rewarding moves often come from careful positioning during quiet phases of the market, followed by steadfast commitment as trends mature. In XRP’s case, understanding and acting within this rhythm may make the difference between average performance and capturing outsized returns.

Speaking to reporters in Taipei on Saturday, Huang labeled recent claims of partnership friction as “nonsense,” directly challenging a Wall Street Journal investigation published just hours earlier. This confrontation highlights the intense scrutiny surrounding what could become one of the most significant corporate alliances in technology history, unfolding against a backdrop of unprecedented AI investment and competition. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s Forceful Rebuttal Jensen Huang delivered his emphatic denial during a visit to Taiwan’s capital city. According to Bloomberg reporters present at the event, Huang insisted Nvidia will “definitely participate” in OpenAI’s latest funding round. He characterized the potential investment as exceptionally promising. “We will invest a great deal of money,” Huang declared. “I believe in OpenAI. The work that they do is incredible. They’re one of the most consequential companies of our time.” However, Huang notably declined to specify exact investment figures. He deferred that announcement to OpenAI leadership instead. “Let [OpenAI CEO Sam Altman] announce how much he’s going to raise — it’s for him to decide,” Huang stated. This strategic positioning maintains negotiation flexibility while publicly affirming commitment. The CEO’s comments directly counter the WSJ’s Friday report suggesting Nvidia might scale back its planned involvement. The Wall Street Journal’s Controversial Report The Wall Street Journal’s original investigation painted a different picture of the partnership’s current status. Published late Friday, the report claimed Nvidia was reassessing its relationship with OpenAI. Journalists cited anonymous sources familiar with internal discussions. According to these sources, Huang had begun emphasizing the non-binding nature of the initial agreement announced in September. That original announcement outlined a two-part collaboration. First, Nvidia would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI. Second, the chipmaker would construct 10 gigawatts of computing infrastructure specifically for the AI company. The WSJ reported that Huang had privately expressed concerns about OpenAI’s business strategy. He reportedly questioned how OpenAI would maintain competitive advantages against rivals like Anthropic and Google. The newspaper also indicated discussions had shifted toward a smaller equity investment. Recent talks reportedly focused on “tens of billions of dollars” rather than the full $100 billion initially contemplated. This potential adjustment suggests both companies are carefully calibrating their partnership terms amid a rapidly evolving AI landscape. OpenAI’s Official Response and Partnership Context OpenAI provided an official statement to The Wall Street Journal regarding the partnership status. A company spokesperson emphasized ongoing collaboration. “We are actively working through the details of our partnership,” the spokesperson confirmed. The statement acknowledged Nvidia’s foundational role in OpenAI’s technological achievements. “Nvidia has underpinned our breakthroughs from the start, powers our systems today, and will remain central as we scale what comes next,” the spokesperson added. This language reinforces the symbiotic relationship between the two organizations. OpenAI’s AI models require immense computational power, which Nvidia’s hardware provides. Conversely, Nvidia benefits from showcasing its technology through OpenAI’s groundbreaking applications. The partnership exists within a complex web of AI industry relationships. Multiple technology giants are currently negotiating with OpenAI about potential investments. The New York Times reported this week that Amazon, Microsoft, and SoftBank are all discussing funding possibilities. These parallel discussions create a competitive dynamic that could influence final partnership terms between Nvidia and OpenAI. Historical Context of Nvidia-OpenAI Collaboration Nvidia and OpenAI share a long history of technological interdependence. OpenAI researchers have consistently utilized Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) to train increasingly sophisticated AI models. This relationship dates back to OpenAI’s early experiments with reinforcement learning and natural language processing. Key Milestones in Nvidia-OpenAI Relationship Year Development Significance 2015 OpenAI founded Initial research utilized Nvidia GPUs 2018 GPT-1 released Trained on Nvidia hardware infrastructure 2020 GPT-3 unveiled Massive model requiring thousands of Nvidia A100 chips 2022 ChatGPT launched Powered by Nvidia inference servers 2023 Partnership discussions begin Formal collaboration talks initiated 2024 $100B investment announced September framework agreement revealed This historical context demonstrates why both companies value their relationship. Nvidia’s hardware advancements have enabled OpenAI’s research breakthroughs. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s demanding computational needs have driven innovation in Nvidia’s data center division. Their mutual success creates strong incentives for continued partnership despite negotiation complexities. Broader Implications for AI Industry Competition The Nvidia-OpenAI partnership negotiations occur during a period of extraordinary AI investment. Companies worldwide are allocating unprecedented resources to artificial intelligence development. This investment surge creates both opportunities and challenges for industry leaders. Several key factors influence current AI partnership dynamics: Hardware scarcity: Advanced AI chips remain difficult to obtain despite increased production Talent competition: Top AI researchers command exceptional compensation packages Regulatory scrutiny: Governments worldwide are examining AI safety and market concentration Technical convergence: Multiple approaches to artificial intelligence show promising results Nvidia occupies a particularly strategic position within this competitive landscape. The company dominates the market for AI training chips with approximately 80% market share. This dominance gives Nvidia substantial leverage in partnership negotiations. However, the company also faces growing competition from custom silicon developed by Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. OpenAI meanwhile must balance multiple potential investors while maintaining operational independence. The organization transitioned from nonprofit to capped-profit structure in 2019. This hybrid model allows OpenAI to raise substantial capital while theoretically capping investor returns. The current funding discussions will test this model’s scalability as AI development costs continue rising exponentially. Expert Perspectives on High-Stakes AI Partnerships Technology analysts emphasize the strategic importance of the Nvidia-OpenAI relationship. “These partnerships between hardware innovators and software pioneers will define the next decade of AI progress,” explains Dr. Elena Rodriguez, AI research director at Stanford University. “The computational requirements for next-generation models are growing faster than Moore’s Law can address.” Investment professionals note the unusual scale of the contemplated partnership. “A $100 billion investment would represent one of the largest corporate investments in history,” observes Michael Chen, technology sector analyst at Goldman Sachs. “It reflects both the enormous potential of advanced AI and the substantial resources required to develop it.” Business strategists highlight the negotiation complexities. “Both companies bring tremendous value to the table,” notes Sarah Johnson, partnership strategy consultant. “Nvidia provides essential infrastructure, while OpenAI offers groundbreaking applications that demonstrate that infrastructure’s capabilities. Finding equitable terms for such complementary assets requires careful negotiation.” Timeline of Recent Developments and Market Reactions The partnership discussions between Nvidia and OpenAI have evolved rapidly in recent months. Multiple media reports have documented various stages of negotiation, sometimes presenting conflicting information. Key recent developments include: September 2024: Initial partnership announcement with $100B investment framework December 2024: WSJ reports OpenAI seeking $100B funding round January 2025: New York Times details multiple potential OpenAI investors February 2025: WSJ publishes report suggesting partnership reassessment February 2025: Huang denies report during Taipei visit Financial markets have responded cautiously to these developments. Nvidia’s stock price showed minimal movement following the conflicting reports. This stability suggests investors recognize negotiation complexities in such substantial partnerships. Technology sector analysts generally maintain positive outlooks for both companies regardless of partnership specifics. The AI industry continues monitoring these developments closely. Partnership terms between leading hardware and software companies will influence competitive dynamics across the sector. Smaller AI firms particularly watch how access to computational resources might evolve based on these high-level negotiations. Conclusion Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s emphatic denial of investment stalling reinforces the critical importance of the Nvidia-OpenAI partnership. While negotiation details remain confidential, both companies publicly affirm their mutual commitment. The potential $100 billion investment represents more than just financial transaction—it symbolizes the deep interdependence between AI hardware and software development. As artificial intelligence continues transforming global technology landscapes, strategic partnerships between infrastructure providers and application developers will increasingly determine competitive advantages. The ongoing discussions between Nvidia and OpenAI will likely establish important precedents for how major technology companies collaborate on frontier AI development while navigating complex business considerations and regulatory environments.

Geopolitical shock hits risk appetite The move extended a drawdown that has now wiped more than 30% off the value of the world’s largest cryptocurrency, with trading conditions exacerbated by thin weekend liquidity and limited buying interest. The selloff gathered pace as broader risk sentiment deteriorated following reports of an explosion at Iran’s Bandar Abbas port, a critical shipping hub on the Strait of Hormuz that handles about a fifth of the world’s seaborne oil. Tensions escalated further after Donald Trump reposted a message on Truth Social claiming Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps was in “full panic mode,” alongside footage showing apparent unrest in Tehran. The flare-up added to already strained relations between Washington and Tehran, pushing investors away from riskier assets. Macro uncertainty compounds crypto pressures Political uncertainty in the US added another layer of strain. A brief federal government shutdown began over the weekend after Congress failed to pass a full-year funding bill before a midnight deadline. Although expected to be short-lived, the lapse reinforced broader concerns around policy stability. Crypto-specific factors have also weighed on sentiment. Bitcoin has struggled to attract sustained buying interest after a volatile start to the year, with flows into spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds turning negative this week. Derivatives markets are still unwinding leverage built up late last year, leaving prices vulnerable during quieter trading hours. Support levels come into focus With confidence still fragile, attention is shifting to potential downside buffers. Buyers stepped in around $75,000 during a selloff in April last year, making it a key level to watch. Below that, the next major technical support sits near the 200-week moving average at around $58,000. For now, bitcoin remains vulnerable, with traders watching whether the weekend drop draws fresh demand or opens the door to deeper losses.

An unlucky cryptocurrency victim recently lost 4,556 ETH, valued at $12.25 million, to a sophisticated “address poisoning” attack. The incident was reported by the blockchain security platform Scam Sniffer. Traders are now being warned to never copy addresses from their transaction history due to an increase in address poisoning scams. How do scammers use ‘address poisoning’ to steal millions? Overall, there has been a record-breaking surge in crypto theft, including a nearly $50 million loss in December 2025 and over 1 million poisoning attempts being detected every day on the Ethereum network. The victim, using the address 0xd6741220a947941bF290799811FcDCeA8AE4A7Da, intended to send funds to a legitimate contact. However, they unknowingly copied a “poisoned” address from their transfer history. The scammer’s address (0x6d9052b2DF589De00324127fe2707eb34e592e48) was specifically designed to look like the correct one (0x6D90CC8Ce83B6D0ACf634ED45d4bCc37eDdD2E48). Address poisoning attacks take advantage of human error, and how crypto wallets display addresses for easier viewing. For example, an address might be shown as 0x6D90…2E48. Scammers use powerful software to generate millions of “vanity” addresses until they find one that matches those first and last few characters. Once they have a matching address, they send a tiny amount of crypto or even a transaction with zero value to a user’s wallet, which puts the scammer’s address into their recent history. The next time the user attempts to copy that address from their history, they could very easily mistake the scammer’s address for the correct one. Once sent, the money is gone forever because blockchain transactions cannot be reversed. Security experts from companies like Cyvers and Immunefi report that these attacks are now happening at an industrial scale. In January 2026, Ethereum transactions hit an all-time high of over 2.8 million per day, and analysts from Citi believe a large portion of this activity is caused by scammers sending millions of these “poison” transactions to catch a few unlucky victims. Other major crypto thefts have happened recently Another trader lost nearly $50 million (49,999,950 USDT) in a similar poisoning attack back in December 2025. In that case, the victim even sent a “test transaction” of 50 USDT to be safe. However, the scammer’s automated script immediately saw the test and “poisoned” the history before the victim could send the remaining $50 million. The attacker quickly converted the stolen funds into DAI and then ETH to prevent the money from being frozen. On January 21, 2026, the Saga EVM blockchain had to be paused after a hack drained $7 million. Earlier in January, the Truebit protocol lost $26.6 million in ETH when an attacker exploited an older security hole in its system, sending the token’s price crashing by nearly 100%. Even larger organizations like the French crypto tax platform called Waltio received a ransom demand from the ShinyHunters hacker group, which was claiming to have stolen data from 50,000 users. In 2025 alone, over $17 billion was stolen through various scams. Chainalysis reports that “impersonation scams,” which include address poisoning, grew by a staggering 1,400% compared to the year before.

The Monero ecosystem constantly evolves, marked by significant milestones like enhanced protocol upgrades and growing adoption across various sectors, which underscore its utility. As Monero progresses, many wonder about its future price trajectory. Will its unique features drive significant value growth, as many traders speculate, and can a price prediction tool provide insights into this ?

Is Monero a good investment? Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality, which has created a strong demand in the market . Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice. Why is XMR up? Monero price analysis shows that XMR finds support at the $440 mark and made a recovery to the $500 mark. The price has retraced slightly and trades around $480 at press time. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption, as it remains highly speculative. How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2031 suggests a minimum price of $922.68 and an average trading price of $1,000.34. The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,099.55. Will XMR reach $1000? The chances of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinge on various factors, which will influence its future price movements. The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility creating an atmosphere of extreme fear are challenges that Monero traders could face that could hinder significant growth. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, many investors have concerns regarding privacy, regulatory scrutiny, and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals, which impact the current Monero sentiment. Monero’s commitment to ring confidential transactions and the broader monero project gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

Monero historic price sentiment XMR price history Monero’s market value has changed dramatically since its launch in 2014, from less than $1 to over $475. May 2021 marked the highest point in Monero’s history. Monero’s price projections revealed the coin’s security. They provide investors with optimism that they will be freed from the persecution of some authorities simply by buying or selling Monero Across 2023, Monero’s price rose by 11.49%. The highest price was $278.56, and the lowest was $114.16. In January 2024, Monero stayed stable around the $150.00 mark as market momentum remained low. However, the stability was short-lived as February crashed to $101.95. However, XMR showed swift recovery as it closed the month near the $150.00 level again. In March and April 2024, XMR saw a steady decline from $150.00 to $120.00, where it found key support. In May 2024, XMR observed steady bullish pressure as the price rose from $120.00, approaching resistance at $150. In June 2024, Monero (XMR) traded within the $150 – $175 price range as either side struggled to make a clear breakthrough. In July, the crypto traded around the $155 mark as the price volatility remained relatively low. XMR opened trading at $156.05 in August and ended the month at $176.00, making remarkable gains. September was bearish for the asset, as the price declined below the $160 mark by the end of the month. In October, Monero observed a steep crash and has been making a swift recovery since then. In December, Monero made remarkable strides as the asset’s price broke past the $220 mark, albeit briefly as it closed the month below $200. In January, Monero saw a bullish January as the price rose from below the $200 mark to $238 by the end of the month. In February, the price fell towards the $215 mark as bears dominate the markets. In March, the price observes mixed momentum and closed the month slightly below $215. In April the consolidation continued until late into the month when it spiked past the $325 mark before ending the month around $275. In May the price continued rising rapidly as the bulls cruised past $300 ending the month around $320. During June the price continued to observe high volatility but observed low net change as the asset closed the month around $313. In July the price saw a huge spike in volatility as the price rose past $340 but the asset closed the month below the $310 mark.

In September, the price rose to the $340 and while it did not maintain the level but managed to close the month above the $320 mark.

In November, the bullish rally continued with XMR crossing the $400 mark by the end of the month. In December, the bulls continued to charge ending the month above the $430 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XMR|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-31 18:26:44

While the first half of the decade was defined by viral social media trends and speculative meme coins, the current landscape has shifted toward technical utility. Most investors now realize that the hype which once hypercharged popular tokens has begun to fade. As these top altcoins reach their ceiling, a new generation of protocols is stepping in to take their place. This change is not just a trend but a major repositioning of capital into projects that provide actual financial instruments. The era of naked speculation is being replaced by a cycle driven by functional, audited code. Pepecoin (PEPE) The current price of Pepecoin (PEPE) is around 0.0000045 and the market value of the cryptocurrency is about $1.8 billion. Although still one of the most popular meme coins in history, its recent price performance has been slow. The token is experiencing a very strong resistance zone around the $0.000010 and has turned back several times to go higher. The price forecast being given by the analysts is not very appealing to the high gain seekers. The majority of analysts propose a 1.2x to 1.3x times growth of PEPE till the year 2027. The main issue is the enormous supply and the fact that there will not be a reason why institutional players will retain the token. Once the excitement is gone, the probability of a gradual release of the excitement towards the lower levels of support becomes possible. To a significant number of investors, the prospect of a spectacular breakout is no longer possible, and they are looking to find cheaper alternatives with a far greater upside. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The protocol that the analysts are pointing to as a better alternative is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum is an Ethereum-based lending and borrowing hub that is being developed as a decentralized hub unlike meme coins. It is aimed at substituting conventional banking services with clear smart contracts. The protocol will enable consumers to retain their online assets and use cash to get money to meet their daily requirements. Mutuum Finance employs a two market model which is developing to provide immediate liquidity in terms of shared pools and tailor made terms in direct peer-peer markets. This structural value guarantees that the token is associated with the real success of an operating financial service. Presale Metrics and Community Development The MUTM is in a very successful presale stage. It has already received a total of more than $20.1 million USD and has drawn in over 19,000 individual investors. MUTM is now in presale Phase 7 whereby the price of the token is at $0.04. The token has already increased by 300 percent since the presale was set at $0.01. The platform allows direct card payments to ensure that any person can easily join the platform as well as conventional crypto transfers. The project has a 24-hour leaderboard to ensure that the community stays active by giving a $500 bonus in MUTM to the most active person every night. Such a combination of strong financing and community involvement is the evidence that the market is prepared for a utility-based altcoin. Protocol Launch The implementation of the V1 protocol on the Sepolia testnet marks the most significant evolution for Mutuum Finance to date. This launch shifts the project from a conceptual framework into a functional reality by providing a working prototype where users can directly engage with the core lending engine. Within this test environment, participants can explore the liquidity pools using popular assets such as ETH, USDT, and LINK. A central feature of this release is the mtToken system, which issues yield-bearing receipts to depositors, allowing them to see their balances grow in real-time as the protocol generates interest. To maintain total system integrity, the V1 protocol includes an automated liquidator robot designed to monitor the health factor of every loan. This bot constantly scans the network to ensure that no position falls below the required collateral threshold, effectively protecting the liquidity pools from the risks of bad debt. The contrast between MUTM and legacy assets like Pepecoin (PEPE) highlights why investors are shifting their focus toward utility. In steady contrast, the structural demand for the Mutuum lending protocol has led experts to forecast a potential climb toward the $0.20 to $0.40 range once the platform is fully adopted. Starting from the current Phase 7 price of $0.04, this represents a much higher ceiling for appreciation than speculative tokens can offer. As Phase 7 moves rapidly toward a sell-out, the opportunity to secure tokens at the $0.04 discount is closing. With over 19,900 holders already on board and the confirmed launch price set at $0.06, the momentum behind this protocol is undeniable.

This development would see the Brazil-based bank expand its operational footprint into the United States, with sights set on potential strategic hubs in Miami, the San Francisco Bay Area, Northern Virginia, and the North Carolina Research Triangle. Related Reading: Capital Rotation Intensifies As Bitcoin Lags Gold and US Equities Nu Establishes Initial Presence, Next Steps In Focus In a blog post on January 29, Nu shares a business milestone in receiving a conditional approval that would allow the digital bank to extend its product offerings to the US market under the de novo national subsidiary known as Nubank N.A. However, to gain full operational powers of the national bank charter, the digital asset firm is expected to meet several criteria in terms of compliance systems, risk controls, governance, etc. In addition, the Nubank N.A. must also obtain all pending approvals from other regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the US Federal Reserve (Fed). The digital bank is also expected to have received all required start-up capital within 12 months and begin operations within 18 months, with its initial service expected to include deposit accounts, credit cards, lending, and digital asset custody. Commenting on the conditional approval from the OCC, the founder and CEO of Nu Holdings, David Vélez has expressed much excitement, stating the expansion provides a unique opportunity to contribute to the next level of US banking. Vélez said: This approval isn’t just an expansion of our operation; it’s an opportunity to prove our thesis that a digital-first, customer-centric model is the future of financial services globally. While we remain fully focused on our core markets in Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia, this step allows us to build the next generation of banking in the United States. Meanwhile, the Nubank N.A. is expected to be led by co-founder Cristina Junqueira, while former President of the Central Bank of Brazil Roberto Campos will chair the company’s board of directors. Crypto Market Overview At the time of writing, the total crypto market cap is $2.84 trillion, following a slight 0.84% decline over the past day. Meanwhile, daily trading volume is now valued at $172.24 billion. Aside from Nu’s expansion into the US, other recent pro-crypto developments include the Senate Agriculture Committee’s clearance of the Clarity Act and another partnership between the SEC and CFTC on crypto projects.

Next 1 or 2 Weeks Will Decide,https://timestabloid.com/time-for-xrp-to-pull-this-drop-and-pop-to-27-next-1-or-2-weeks-will-decide/,"Crypto analyst ChartNerd has revisited a long-term XRP fractal that projects a potential move toward the $27 level , suggesting that the coming one to two weeks could provide clearer insight into whether the setup remains valid. In a recent post, ChartNerd questioned whether it is time to “pull this drop and pop $27 XRP fractal back out of the bag,” while cautioning that additional short-term data is needed before drawing firm conclusions. The analyst emphasized that current price behavior should be closely monitored to understand what is developing beneath the surface. The attached chart highlights a repeating structural pattern observed in XRP’s historical price action . It shows periods labeled “higher low structure,” followed by decisive upside breaks marked as “break for euphoria.” These phases are presented as part of a broader cyclical structure rather than a short-term price call, reinforcing the idea that the fractal is meant to guide observation rather than predict exact outcomes. Is it time to pull this drop and pop $27 $XRP fractal back out of the bag? Maybe so, maybe not. The next week or 2 will provide more data to really see what's going on under the hood.. https://t.co/a5n7xlfdmE pic.twitter.com/iL0XkLkzEg — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) January 30, 2026 What the XRP Chart Illustrates The visual shared by ChartNerd spans multiple market cycles and emphasizes consistency in XRP’s long-term structure. The chart suggests that once higher lows are firmly established and price breaks above key resistance zones, momentum can accelerate rapidly. A highlighted resistance area near current price levels is shown as a potential decision point, where confirmation or invalidation of the fractal could occur. Projected future price movement on the chart extends into later years, with a possible path that includes consolidation, continuation, and an eventual push toward higher levels if historical structure repeats. ChartNerd emphasized that the projection was not a guarantee, instead positioning it as a way to monitor price behavior as additional data becomes available. Debate Around Market Forces and Technical Analysis The post also attracted commentary from other market participants. An X user, SwanseaRich74, questioned whether technical analysis remains effective in the current environment, citing ETF inflows , alleged market manipulation, and perceived price suppression. The commenter argued that until a supply shock occurs, XRP may remain constrained, and any eventual move could be extreme. ChartNerd directly addressed this view, reiterating confidence in technical analysis. In response, the analyst stated that technical analysis “never goes out of the window,” clarifying that it does not aim to predict external events. Instead, it serves as a real-time tool to monitor how markets respond when those events unfold. This reply reinforced the analyst’s position that structure, trend, and price behavior remain relevant regardless of underlying narratives. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Short-Term Patience, Long-Term Structure Overall, ChartNerd’s comments frame the $27 XRP fractal as something to observe rather than assume. By stressing the importance of the next one to two weeks, the analyst highlighted that confirmation depends on how the price behaves around key structural levels shown in the chart. The focus remains on monitoring market structure as it develops, with technical analysis positioned as a method for interpreting real-time changes rather than forecasting certainties.

On the daily chart, BTC fell from the mid-$84,000 area to about $78,700. That move erased roughly $5,400 in value, equal to a drop of around 6.4% in two days. The decline followed a failed recovery attempt near local resistance, after which sellers regained control and pushed price lower in a sharp continuation move. Bitcoin / U.S. Dollar, 1D (BTCUSD): Source: TradingView Technically, Bitcoin lost its rising support trendline that had held since late December. Once that structure failed, price slid quickly through several horizontal support zones clustered between $86,000 and $82,000. At the same time, BTC moved decisively below the 50-day exponential moving average, which now sits near $90,000 and acts as overhead resistance. Volume expanded during the breakdown, confirming stronger participation on the sell side. That increase suggests forced exits and accelerated deleveraging rather than a slow, low-liquidity drift. The current candle structure shows limited buying response so far, with no clear reversal signal on the daily timeframe. Momentum indicators also weakened. The RSI dropped toward the mid-20s, signaling deeply oversold conditions but not yet confirming a sustained bounce. Historically, such levels can precede short-term relief rallies, yet they do not, by themselves, mark a trend reversal. From a structure perspective, the next visible support zone sits in the low-to-mid $70,000s, aligning with prior consolidation areas and the projected path of the descending channel drawn on the chart. Until price reclaims broken support levels near $82,000–$84,000, the broader bias remains to the downside. Wynn ties BTC downside to the 200 week moving average Meanwhile, in a post on X, James Wynn argued that $68,000 is the “probable” destination for Bitcoin because it aligns with the 200-week moving average, which the chart shows around $68,379. He also said he flagged risk since the $120,000 area and described a return to the “baseline” as a reset. Bitcoin / U.S. Dollar: Source: TradingView / X The chart structure shows Bitcoin rolling over from a prior peak and now sitting below a key overhead level around $96,518. Meanwhile, price is pressing into a lower band that includes support near $80,537, with a broader highlighted demand zone below current price.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC currently trades at $76,959.56 on the Binance USDT market. This development marks a notable shift from recent price stability and warrants careful examination of underlying market forces. Bitcoin Price Drop: Immediate Market Context The descent below $77,000 represents a meaningful correction within the current market cycle. Market analysts immediately noted several contributing factors. First, increased selling pressure emerged from institutional investors rebalancing portfolios. Second, regulatory developments in major economies created uncertainty. Third, technical indicators suggested overbought conditions needed correction. Consequently, traders responded to these combined signals with increased caution. Historical data reveals similar patterns during previous Bitcoin cycles. For instance, the 2021 bull market experienced multiple 15-20% corrections before reaching new highs. Currently, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) had approached 75, indicating potential overheating. Meanwhile, trading volume increased by 42% during the decline, suggesting active participation rather than mere speculation. These technical factors provide essential context for understanding price movements. Cryptocurrency Market Analysis and Comparative Performance Bitcoin’s decline affected the broader digital asset ecosystem significantly. Major altcoins typically follow BTC’s directional movements, though with varying intensity. The table below illustrates immediate market reactions across leading cryptocurrencies: Cryptocurrency Price Change Market Impact Ethereum (ETH) -5.2% Moderate correlation Solana (SOL) -7.8% Higher volatility Cardano (ADA) -6.1% Average movement Binance Coin (BNB) -4.3% Lower correlation Market capitalization across all digital assets decreased by approximately $180 billion within 24 hours. This contraction reflects several interconnected dynamics. Traditional financial markets showed mixed performance during the same period. Additionally, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) strengthened slightly, creating headwinds for dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin. These macroeconomic factors contributed to the selling pressure observed across exchanges. Expert Perspectives on Market Volatility Financial analysts emphasize that volatility remains inherent to cryptocurrency markets. Dr. Elena Rodriguez, Senior Market Strategist at Digital Asset Research Institute, explains: “Periodic corrections maintain market health by shaking out excessive leverage. The $77,000 level represents both psychological and technical resistance. Furthermore, institutional adoption continues growing despite short-term price movements.” Her analysis references verifiable on-chain data showing stable accumulation by long-term holders. Technical analysts identify several key support levels below current prices. The $75,000 zone represents the next significant area based on historical accumulation patterns. Moreover, the 50-day moving average currently sits at $73,400, providing additional potential support. These indicators help traders assess risk parameters during volatile periods. Importantly, Bitcoin’s fundamental network metrics remain strong, with hash rate continuing its upward trajectory. Historical Patterns and Future Projections Bitcoin’s price history reveals consistent patterns around psychological price levels. The asset has experienced 15 corrections exceeding 10% during the current market cycle alone. Each previous correction found support at higher lows, establishing an upward trend structure. Current derivatives data shows reduced leverage compared to previous cycles, potentially limiting cascading liquidations. This development suggests increased market maturity among participants. Several factors could influence Bitcoin’s trajectory in coming weeks: Institutional flows: ETF adoption continues growing steadily Regulatory clarity: Legislative developments in major economies Macro conditions: Interest rate decisions and inflation data Technical factors: On-chain metrics and exchange flows Market sentiment: Fear and greed index adjustments Global adoption metrics provide additional context for long-term valuation. Countries experiencing currency instability continue showing increased Bitcoin adoption. Additionally, corporate treasury allocations to Bitcoin have grown 300% since 2023. These fundamental developments support the asset’s long-term thesis despite short-term volatility. Network security has simultaneously reached all-time highs, with hash rate increasing 25% year-over-year. Investor Implications and Risk Management Price corrections create both challenges and opportunities for market participants. Experienced investors typically implement specific strategies during volatile periods. Dollar-cost averaging remains popular among long-term holders seeking to mitigate timing risk. Meanwhile, institutional investors often use derivatives for hedging existing positions. Retail traders should particularly note the importance of position sizing during uncertain market conditions. Risk management principles become especially crucial during corrections. Setting appropriate stop-loss levels helps protect capital from excessive drawdowns. Additionally, portfolio diversification across asset classes reduces overall volatility exposure. Many financial advisors recommend limiting cryptocurrency allocations to risk-appropriate percentages. These practices help investors navigate inevitable market fluctuations while maintaining long-term perspectives. Conclusion Bitcoin’s decline below $77,000 represents a significant market development requiring careful analysis. The current Bitcoin price movement reflects normal market dynamics within a maturing asset class. Technical indicators, macroeconomic factors, and institutional flows all contribute to short-term volatility. However, fundamental network strength and growing adoption continue supporting Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Investors should maintain perspective on typical market cycles while implementing prudent risk management strategies appropriate for cryptocurrency’s inherent volatility. FAQs Q1: What caused Bitcoin to fall below $77,000? Multiple factors contributed including technical overbought conditions, institutional portfolio rebalancing, regulatory uncertainty, and broader market sentiment shifts. Increased selling pressure across major exchanges accelerated the decline. Q2: How significant is this price drop historically? Corrections of this magnitude occur regularly in Bitcoin markets. The current cycle has experienced 15 similar corrections exceeding 10%, with each finding support at higher price levels than previous cycles. Q3: What are key support levels to watch below $77,000? Technical analysts identify $75,000 as immediate psychological support, followed by the $73,400 area representing the 50-day moving average. Historical accumulation patterns suggest strong buying interest around these levels. Q4: Does this price movement affect other cryptocurrencies? Yes, most major altcoins correlate with Bitcoin’s price movements. Ethereum declined 5.2%, Solana dropped 7.8%, and Cardano fell 6.1% during the same period, demonstrating typical market synchronization. Q5: What should investors consider during this volatility? Investors should review risk management strategies, avoid emotional decision-making, consider dollar-cost averaging, maintain appropriate portfolio diversification, and focus on long-term fundamentals rather than short-term price movements.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $77,888 on the Binance USDT market, marking a notable pullback from recent highs. This movement represents one of the most substantial single-day declines observed in the past month, prompting immediate analysis from traders and institutions worldwide. Bitcoin Price Movement and Immediate Market Context The descent below $78,000 follows a period of relative stability where Bitcoin maintained positions above $80,000 for several consecutive trading sessions. Market analysts immediately identified several contributing factors to this downward movement. Firstly, increased selling pressure emerged from large wallet addresses commonly associated with institutional investors. Secondly, broader macroeconomic indicators showed renewed strength in traditional safe-haven assets like gold and treasury bonds. Consequently, some capital rotation away from risk assets like cryptocurrencies appears to be occurring. Technical analysis reveals important support and resistance levels that traders are monitoring closely. The $78,000 level previously served as both support in early April and resistance during the March rally. Now, market participants are watching the $76,500 level, which represents the next major support zone based on historical volume profiles. Furthermore, trading volume during this decline increased by approximately 35% compared to the 24-hour average, indicating genuine selling pressure rather than mere market noise. Cryptocurrency Market Dynamics and Contributing Factors Several interconnected factors typically influence Bitcoin’s price movements. The current decline coincides with specific market developments that provide essential context. Regulatory announcements from multiple jurisdictions created uncertainty this week. Additionally, derivatives market data shows a notable increase in short positions across major exchanges. The funding rates for perpetual swap contracts also normalized from previously elevated levels, reducing the incentive for leveraged long positions. The broader cryptocurrency market often moves in correlation with Bitcoin, and today’s action proved no exception. Ethereum declined by 4.2% alongside Bitcoin’s 3.8% drop. Major altcoins showed even more pronounced movements, with several experiencing corrections exceeding 6%. This correlation underscores Bitcoin’s continuing role as the market bellwether. Market capitalization for the entire cryptocurrency sector decreased by approximately $120 billion during this correction period. Historical Patterns and Volatility Analysis Bitcoin’s historical volatility patterns provide valuable perspective on current movements. The asset has experienced 14 similar 3-5% single-day declines during the current market cycle. Statistical analysis shows that 70% of these corrections were followed by consolidation periods lasting 3-7 trading days before establishing a new direction. The current volatility index for Bitcoin stands at 68, which is above the 30-day average of 62 but remains below the extreme levels observed during March’s market turbulence. Comparative analysis with traditional markets reveals interesting divergences. While Bitcoin declined, major stock indices showed mixed performance with the S&P 500 essentially flat and the NASDAQ composite slightly positive. This decoupling suggests cryptocurrency-specific factors may be driving the current price action rather than broad risk-off sentiment across all financial markets. The Bitcoin Dominance Index, which measures Bitcoin’s market share relative to all cryptocurrencies, remained stable at 52.3% during this decline. Technical Indicators and Trading Signals Multiple technical indicators provide objective data about the current market structure. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart declined from 65 to 48, moving from slightly overbought territory to neutral. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram shows decreasing bullish momentum, though the signal line remains above zero. Key moving averages continue to provide important reference points: 50-day Exponential Moving Average: $75,200 (current support) 200-day Simple Moving Average: $68,400 (major support) 20-day Bollinger Band middle: $79,100 (recent resistance) On-chain metrics from blockchain analysis firms provide additional insights. The Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio increased slightly, suggesting the network valuation may be outpacing transaction volume. The Puell Multiple, which measures miner revenue relative to its yearly average, declined but remains in a neutral zone. Exchange net flows showed moderate inflows of approximately 8,000 BTC over the past 24 hours, indicating some movement to trading platforms for potential selling. Institutional Perspective and Market Sentiment Institutional responses to this price movement have been measured according to available data. Major cryptocurrency investment products experienced modest outflows totaling $42 million globally. However, this represents less than 0.2% of total assets under management in such products. Futures open interest declined by 8% as some leveraged positions were liquidated. Options market data shows increased demand for put options at the $75,000 strike price for monthly expirations, indicating some hedging activity. Market sentiment indices from various analytics platforms show a shift from “greed” to “neutral” territory. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index declined from 72 to 54 within 24 hours. Social media sentiment analysis reveals increased discussion of support levels and buying opportunities rather than panic selling narratives. Professional trading desks report balanced order books with buy orders accumulating at key psychological levels below the current price. Macroeconomic Environment and External Influences The broader financial landscape always influences cryptocurrency markets. Current conditions include several relevant factors. Central bank policies continue to evolve globally with implications for all risk assets. Inflation data from major economies remains above target levels in several jurisdictions. Geopolitical developments have created uncertainty in traditional markets that sometimes spills over into cryptocurrency trading. Dollar strength, as measured by the DXY index, showed a modest increase of 0.3% during the period of Bitcoin’s decline. Traditional financial institutions continue to develop cryptocurrency services despite short-term price movements. Several major banks announced expanded digital asset custody offerings this week. Payment processors are integrating additional cryptocurrency functionality. These developments suggest institutional adoption continues progressing independently of daily price fluctuations. Regulatory clarity in key markets remains a work in progress with multiple jurisdictions developing comprehensive frameworks. Conclusion Bitcoin’s decline below $78,000 represents a significant market movement within the context of the current trading environment. The Bitcoin price action reflects normal market dynamics where assets rarely move in one direction indefinitely. Technical indicators suggest this may represent a healthy correction within a broader trend rather than a fundamental reversal. Market structure remains intact with key support levels holding thus far. Traders and investors should monitor volume patterns and institutional flows for indications of the next directional bias. The cryptocurrency market continues demonstrating both volatility and resilience as it matures within the global financial ecosystem. FAQs Q1: What caused Bitcoin to fall below $78,000? Multiple factors contributed including increased selling pressure from large holders, normalization of derivatives market conditions, and some capital rotation toward traditional safe-haven assets. Technical factors also played a role as Bitcoin approached resistance levels. Q2: How does this decline compare to previous Bitcoin corrections? This 3.8% single-day decline is within normal historical parameters. Bitcoin has experienced 14 similar corrections during the current market cycle, with most followed by consolidation periods before establishing new direction. Q3: What are the key support levels to watch now? Traders are monitoring several important levels including $76,500 (historical volume support), $75,200 (50-day EMA), and $68,400 (200-day SMA). The $75,000 level represents a major psychological and options market support zone. Q4: Has institutional interest in Bitcoin changed with this price movement? Available data shows modest outflows from investment products representing less than 0.2% of assets under management. Institutional adoption initiatives continue progressing independently of short-term price movements. Q5: What should investors consider during this volatility? Investors should maintain perspective about normal market cycles, avoid emotional decision-making, review their risk management strategies, and consider dollar-cost averaging approaches during periods of volatility.

This resilience and surge in investor demand is particularly surprising given the recent crash in the XRP price and the overall downturn in the broader crypto market. Related Reading: Ethereum Boost: Vitalik Buterin Sets Aside $45M In ETH For Privacy And Open Tech XRP ETFs Defy Trends And Hit Record Volume XRP is making headlines after its ETF experienced fresh inflows following a significant outflow. According to data from SoSoValue, XRP ETFs saw a record $92.9 million drop on January 29, 2026. This marked the largest reduction since their launch on November 13, 2025. Since becoming available for trading, XRP ETFs have registered only three outflows, with the recent $92.9 million decrease being the third. This withdrawal was primarily driven by Grayscale’s GXRP, which saw a whopping $98.39 million leave the fund, partially offset by inflows into Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ, Bitwise’s XRP ETF, and Canary’s XRPC. At the time of the outflow, the total net assets of XRP ETFs fell to $1.21 billion from $1.39 billion the day earlier. The decline coincided with a drop in XRP’s price, which fell from $1.92 to $1.80 over 24 hours. Unexpectedly, XRP ETFs picked up just a day after the $92.9 million withdrawal. They recorded a daily total net inflow of $16.79 million, although total net assets still declined slightly to $1.19 billion. More impressively, Spot XRP ETFs achieved record trading volumes despite the overall downtrend. Data from The Block shows that XRP ETFs saw their cumulative volume rise to $2.23 billion from $2.15 billion just one day after the $92.9 million daily outflow. Reports indicated that Bitwise’s XRP ETF had the highest trading volume at the time, followed by Grayscale’s GXRP, Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ, Canary’s XRPC, and 21Shares TOXR, in that order. In terms of total Assets Under Management (AUM), XRP ETFs declined slightly, falling from $1.48 billion to $1.32 billion following the January 29 outflow. XRP Price Continues Slide Amid Market Uncertainty While XRP ETFs are recovering from recent outflows, the cryptocurrency’s price continues to decline, extending its losses from earlier this year. According to CoinMarketCap, XRP has dropped by more than 11% over the past week and a little over 3% in the last 24 hours. Following this decline, its price now sits around $1.69, representing a more than 15% fall from its $2 level seen just a few weeks ago. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Slide To $82K Sets Off A $1.7 Billion Chain Reaction XRP’s daily trading volume is also down by more than 26.6% at the time of writing, indicating a potential decline in trader confidence and growing uncertainty in the market.

This intense activity forms part of a broader 24-hour liquidation cascade totaling approximately $1.53 billion, marking one of the most significant deleveraging events of the year and sending shockwaves through trading communities globally on March 21, 2025. Crypto Futures Liquidation Event: The $125 Million Hour Major cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance, Bybit, and OKX, recorded concentrated liquidation activity between 8:00 and 9:00 UTC. This $125 million liquidation primarily involved long positions, as Bitcoin’s price experienced a rapid 7% decline during this period. Consequently, leveraged traders faced automatic position closures when their collateral fell below maintenance margins. The scale of this hourly event highlights the extreme volatility and high leverage prevalent in crypto derivatives markets. Market data reveals Bitcoin futures open interest dropped by approximately 15% during this window, indicating significant position unwinding. Mechanics of a Liquidation Cascade Liquidations occur automatically through exchange algorithms when a trader’s position loses too much value relative to their borrowed funds. For instance, a trader using 10x leverage faces liquidation after just a 10% move against their position. This process creates a self-reinforcing cycle: initial liquidations push prices lower, triggering more margin calls and subsequent liquidations. The $125 million in hourly liquidations likely began with a cluster of over-leveraged long positions hitting their liquidation prices, then accelerated as selling pressure from these forced closures drove prices down further. Historical Context and 24-Hour Analysis The $1.53 billion in total liquidations over 24 hours represents a substantial market reset. To provide context, this figure exceeds the total liquidations seen during several notable volatility episodes in early 2024 but remains below the extreme events of the 2022 bear market. A comparative analysis shows the following recent major liquidation events: Date 24-Hour Liquidations Primary Catalyst March 21, 2025 ~$1.53 Billion Rapid BTC price decline, leverage flush January 15, 2024 ~$800 Million ETF approval speculation reversal August 17, 2023 ~$1.1 Billion Fed minutes and macro concerns This historical comparison demonstrates that while significant, the current event fits within established patterns of periodic market deleveraging. The long/short ratio across major exchanges shifted dramatically during this period, moving from 1.2 to 0.85, indicating that long positions bore the brunt of the damage. Market Structure and Leverage Factors Several structural factors contributed to the scale of these liquidations. First, perpetual futures contracts with funding rates had reached elevated levels, attracting excessive speculative long positions. Second, aggregate estimated leverage ratios across platforms had climbed to yearly highs before the sell-off. Third, the concentration of liquidation levels around specific price points created a “liquidation cluster” that acted as a vulnerability. When prices breached these levels, the cascade effect became almost inevitable. Immediate Market Impacts and Volatility Spike The immediate consequence of the $125 million liquidation hour was a pronounced spike in market volatility. The Bitcoin Volatility Index (BVOL) jumped by over 35% within two hours of the initial liquidations. Furthermore, funding rates for perpetual swaps turned deeply negative across exchanges, reaching as low as -0.05% per eight-hour interval, effectively paying shorts to hold their positions. This reset in funding mechanisms represents a healthy clearing of excessive optimism, according to market structure analysts. Spot markets experienced significant spillover effects. Trading volumes on spot exchanges surged by 200% compared to the weekly average as traders adjusted their portfolios. The bid-ask spreads on major trading pairs widened temporarily, indicating reduced liquidity during the most intense selling pressure. However, market depth recovered relatively quickly after the initial liquidation wave subsided, suggesting underlying institutional liquidity remained intact. Exchange Performance and System Stability Despite the volume of liquidations, major exchanges reported normal system operation without significant delays or outages. This represents a notable improvement from previous years when similar events sometimes caused platform instability. Exchange insurance funds, designed to cover losses when liquidations cannot be executed at the bankruptcy price, saw moderate draws but remained well-capitalized. The smooth technical handling of this event demonstrates maturation in crypto market infrastructure. Broader Implications for Crypto Derivatives This liquidation event carries several important implications for the future of cryptocurrency derivatives trading. Regulatory scrutiny often intensifies following such volatility episodes, with authorities examining whether current leverage limits and risk disclosures adequately protect retail participants. Additionally, institutional participants may reassess their counterparty risk management when engaging with platforms that host high-leverage retail trading. The event also highlights the growing interconnectedness between derivatives and spot markets. Significant liquidations now routinely impact spot prices, creating feedback loops that can amplify movements in both directions. This interconnectedness suggests that analysts must increasingly consider derivatives market positioning when assessing overall market health. Several key risk metrics warrant monitoring: Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR): Measures aggregate leverage in the system Liquidation Heatmaps: Visualize vulnerable price levels with high position concentrations Open Interest: Indicates total capital committed to futures positions Funding Rates: Signal market sentiment extremes between longs and shorts Psychological Impact on Trader Behavior Beyond the numerical data, such events significantly influence trader psychology. The rapid destruction of $125 million in positions within one hour serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with high leverage. Historically, similar events have led to reduced leverage usage among retail traders for several weeks following the liquidation cascade. This behavioral adjustment typically results in decreased volatility as markets digest the repositioning. Conclusion The $125 million crypto futures liquidation within a single hour represents a dramatic but instructive market event within the broader $1.53 billion 24-hour deleveraging. This episode underscores the inherent volatility of leveraged cryptocurrency trading while demonstrating improved infrastructure resilience compared to previous years. As derivatives markets continue maturing, such liquidation events serve as periodic resets that realign leverage with underlying market conditions. Market participants should monitor leverage metrics and liquidation clusters closely, as these factors will likely continue driving significant volatility in cryptocurrency markets throughout 2025 and beyond. FAQs Q1: What exactly is a futures liquidation in cryptocurrency trading? A futures liquidation occurs when an exchange automatically closes a trader’s leveraged position because their collateral has fallen below the required maintenance margin. This happens to prevent losses exceeding the trader’s initial capital. Q2: Why did $125 million liquidate in just one hour? The concentrated liquidation resulted from a rapid price decline that triggered clustered liquidation levels. Many traders had similar stop-loss and liquidation prices, creating a cascade effect as each liquidation pushed prices lower, triggering more liquidations. Q3: How does this compare to previous major liquidation events? The $1.53 billion 24-hour total is significant but not unprecedented. It exceeds several 2024 events but remains below the extreme liquidations of the 2022 bear market, suggesting measured rather than panic-driven selling. Q4: Do these liquidations affect spot market prices? Yes, significantly. Forced selling from liquidations creates immediate selling pressure that impacts spot prices. This interconnectedness means derivatives market events frequently spill over into spot markets. Q5: What can traders do to avoid being liquidated? Traders can use lower leverage ratios, maintain higher collateral buffers, set stop-loss orders well above liquidation prices, diversify across positions, and continuously monitor market conditions and their margin ratios.

Few assets illustrate this better than XRP as it approaches a pivotal moment after more than a year trapped in a horizontal range. Traders have watched its price ebb and flow within familiar boundaries, often hoping for a breakout that could clarify the next major direction . Now, as market structure teeters on a technical cliffhanger, emotion and strategy intersect in stark relief. In a recent X post, analyst Bird delivered a raw and resonant take on this scenario, capturing the frustration of many participants watching XRP cling to a 14‑month range between approximately $3.64 on the upside and $1.61 on the downside since November 2024, as shown in the accompanying TradingView chart. Bird’s plea for “a miracle” reflects more than colorful language — it encapsulates the tension traders feel as a descending trendline squeezes the range tighter and market conditions shift around it. We’re gonna need a miracle to hold this 14 month XRP range. FUUUHHHHK! pic.twitter.com/uyJRKV4fSp — Bird (@Bird_XRPL) January 31, 2026 The Long‑Running Range: Technical Impasse XRP’s extended consolidation underscores indecision in the market. For over a year, the price oscillated between defined support and resistance, creating a stable yet stagnant trading band. In technical analysis, such ranges often represent equilibrium, where neither bulls nor bears command enough conviction to drive a decisive move. The repeated emphasis on these levels — $3.60 as resistance and roughly $1.60 as support — highlights their psychological and structural significance. This kind of range building can precede a breakout, but it can also foreshadow breakdown. As 2026 unfolds, technical indicators paint a mixed picture. XRP currently trades beneath major moving averages, signaling that medium‑term momentum favors sellers. Analysts have highlighted bearish formations like “death cross” patterns — where shorter moving averages drop below their long‑term counterparts — which often herald extended weakness unless key support holds. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Broader Market Stress XRP’s struggle mirrors a wider altcoin market dynamic . Many large‑cap tokens face similar consolidation or downward pressure as broader crypto sentiment reacts to macroeconomic forces and Bitcoin’s own price movements. This correlation often drags XRP alongside broader trends rather than allowing it to diverge independently. Additionally, important psychological levels — such as round numbers and historically defended support zones — considerably influence trader behavior, making these ranges self‑fulfilling battlegrounds. What a Breakdown or Breakout Means If XRP breaks decisively below its long‑defended support near $1.61, it could trigger accelerated selling as traders interpret that failure as a shift to bearish dominance, pushing XRP price downward . Conversely, a sustained move above the upper range boundary — especially if it conquers the descending trendline — could reinforce a resurgence narrative and attract fresh capital. Emotional Resilience and Strategic Clarity Bird’s candid tone may echo frustration, but it also reflects a moment every trader faces: holding when the chart offers no easy answers. In volatile markets, clarity often emerges not from wishful thinking, but from disciplined attention to confirmed structure shifts. For XRP holders and market watchers, the next move will define not just price action, but belief in its ability to escape the pattern that has defined it for more than a year.

This price action marks a pivotal moment for the world’s premier cryptocurrency, reigniting discussions about its long-term trajectory and current market dynamics. Consequently, investors and analysts are closely examining the factors propelling this upward movement. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Breaking Down the $78,000 Surge According to market monitoring from Bitcoin World, the BTC/USDT trading pair on Binance confirmed the breakthrough. This price point represents a crucial psychological and technical resistance level. Historically, such milestones often trigger increased market volatility and media attention. Furthermore, the rally appears broad-based, with significant volume supporting the move. Market data indicates sustained buying pressure from both retail and institutional participants. This activity suggests a strong underlying conviction among market participants. Several technical indicators aligned prior to this surge. For instance, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) showed a bullish crossover on the weekly chart. Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI), while elevated, had room for growth before entering overbought territory on higher timeframes. The breakout follows a period of consolidation where Bitcoin established a solid support base above $70,000. This consolidation phase was essential for building the momentum required for the next leg up. Comparative Market Performance Table Asset Price Change (7-Day) Key Support Level Market Sentiment Bitcoin (BTC) +8.5% $72,500 Strongly Bullish Ethereum (ETH) +5.2% $3,400 Bullish S&P 500 Index +1.8% 5,100 Neutral Gold (XAU) -0.5% $2,150/oz Neutral Contextual Drivers Behind the Cryptocurrency Rally Multiple fundamental factors are contributing to the current cryptocurrency market strength. Firstly, the recent approval and subsequent inflows into U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continue to provide a structural bid for the asset. These financial products have channeled billions in traditional finance capital into Bitcoin. Secondly, macroeconomic conditions play a role. Expectations of a future pivot in monetary policy by major central banks can increase the attractiveness of non-traditional stores of value. Moreover, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, expected in April 2024, historically creates a supply shock narrative that influences prices months in advance. On-chain data provides further evidence of a healthy market. Metrics such as the number of addresses holding non-zero balances and the mean coin age have been rising. This trend indicates accumulation and a reduction in selling pressure from long-term holders. Network fundamentals also remain robust. The hash rate, a measure of the total computational power securing the Bitcoin network, continues to hit record highs. This demonstrates immense investment in infrastructure and reinforces network security. ETF Inflows: Consistent net-positive inflows create sustained buying pressure. Macro Hedge: Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a hedge against currency debasement. Halving Anticipation: The scheduled reduction in block rewards limits new supply. Institutional Adoption: More corporate treasuries and asset managers are adding BTC to their balance sheets. Expert Perspective on Market Sustainability Financial analysts emphasize the difference between speculative froth and value-driven growth. According to historical data compiled by firms like Glassnode, cycles where price appreciation is accompanied by strong fundamentals and widespread adoption tend to be more sustainable. The current rally shows hallmarks of deeper market maturity compared to previous cycles. For example, futures market funding rates remain relatively neutral, suggesting a lack of excessive leverage that typically precedes sharp corrections. Regulatory clarity in key jurisdictions, though evolving, is also providing a more stable environment for institutional participation. Historical Precedents and Future Trajectory Bitcoin’s journey to this price level follows a familiar pattern of boom and bust cycles, each reaching higher highs. The breakthrough of major round-number milestones often acts as a catalyst for further price discovery. However, it also invites increased scrutiny from regulators and traditional financial media. Past performance indicates that after such breakthroughs, the market often experiences a period of volatility as it searches for a new equilibrium. Traders monitor key Fibonacci extension levels for potential resistance areas above the current price. The global adoption curve for Bitcoin continues its upward trajectory. Remittance corridors, inflation-ravaged economies, and digital-native enterprises are integrating Bitcoin at an accelerating pace. This real-world utility forms a foundational layer of demand beyond pure speculation. Technological developments, such as improvements to the Lightning Network for faster payments, enhance Bitcoin’s functionality as a medium of exchange. These factors collectively contribute to a more complex and resilient valuation model for the asset. Conclusion Bitcoin’s rise above $78,000 represents a significant milestone in its market evolution. This movement is supported by a confluence of technical strength, sustained institutional investment through ETFs, and positive macroeconomic narratives. While past cycles warn of inherent volatility, the current landscape features deeper liquidity and more robust infrastructure. The Bitcoin price action will continue to be a key barometer for the broader digital asset ecosystem. Market participants should focus on underlying fundamentals and long-term adoption trends rather than short-term price fluctuations. FAQs Q1: What does Bitcoin trading above $78,000 mean for the average investor? It signifies a high level of market confidence and mainstream financial acceptance. For the average investor, it highlights Bitcoin’s volatility and potential as a high-risk, high-reward asset class that should only constitute a small, balanced portion of a diversified portfolio. Q2: How do Bitcoin ETFs influence the price? Spot Bitcoin ETFs create a direct conduit for traditional capital to enter the market. Consistent net inflows from these funds represent continuous buying pressure, as the ETF issuers must purchase equivalent amounts of Bitcoin to back their shares, directly impacting supply and demand. Q3: What is the Bitcoin halving and why does it matter? The halving is a pre-programmed event where the reward for mining new blocks is cut in half, reducing the rate of new Bitcoin supply. Historically, this reduction in new sell pressure from miners has been a catalyst for bull markets, as demand meets a slowing supply. Q4: Is the current price sustainable or a bubble? Sustainability depends on continued adoption and fundamental use cases. While prices can correct, the network’s security, hash rate, and institutional infrastructure are stronger than in previous cycles, suggesting a more mature market foundation. Q5: What are the main risks to Bitcoin’s price at this level? Key risks include sudden regulatory changes in major economies, a sharp reversal in macroeconomic conditions leading to a “risk-off” market, technological vulnerabilities, or a black swan event in traditional finance that causes correlated sell-offs across all asset classes.

This rapid movement, observed on March 25, 2025, underscores the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the flagship cryptocurrency’s trading environment. Consequently, market participants are scrutinizing the conditions that can precipitate such swift changes in valuation. Analyzing the Bitcoin Price Surge The reported 1.53% gain for Bitcoin represents a significant short-term movement. To contextualize this shift, a price increase of this magnitude over five minutes translates to an exceptionally high annualized rate of return. Market data indicates such volatility is not uncommon for BTC, yet it frequently signals heightened trading activity or a reaction to specific catalysts. For instance, similar rapid rallies have historically preceded or followed major news events, liquidity shifts, or large institutional orders. Therefore, understanding the mechanics behind this surge requires examining both on-chain and off-chain data points from the period. Several factors could contribute to a rapid Bitcoin price appreciation. Firstly, a large market buy order, often called a “whale” order, can quickly consume available sell-side liquidity on an order book. Secondly, algorithmic trading bots reacting to specific technical indicators or news headlines can create cascading buy pressure. Finally, broader market sentiment, influenced by macroeconomic announcements or regulatory developments, can trigger coordinated movements. This event on Binance, a leading global exchange, highlights the platform’s substantial role in price discovery for digital assets. Cryptocurrency Market Volatility and Context Bitcoin’s inherent volatility remains a defining characteristic. Compared to traditional asset classes like equities or bonds, cryptocurrency markets operate 24/7 with generally lower liquidity in the order books, which can amplify price swings. The past year has seen BTC trading within a wide range, making short-term spikes like this 1.53% move a critical focus for short-term traders and a point of analysis for long-term holders. Notably, the USDT trading pair on Binance is one of the most liquid markets for BTC, meaning movements here often set the tone for prices on other exchanges. Market analysts often track the following metrics during volatile periods: Order Book Depth: The volume of buy and sell orders near the current price. Funding Rates: Fees paid between traders in perpetual swap markets, indicating sentiment. Social Volume & Sentiment: The amount and tone of discussion on social platforms. Blockchain Transfers: Large movements of BTC to or from exchange wallets. Expert Perspective on Short-Term Moves Financial analysts emphasize that while short-term price movements generate headlines, they should be viewed within a broader strategic framework. “A five-minute candle, however dramatic, is a data point in a much longer trend,” notes a report from a major crypto research firm. The key for investors is to differentiate between noise driven by technical trading and signals reflecting a fundamental shift in value. The $77,922.93 price point itself may act as a psychological level, potentially serving as support or resistance in subsequent trading sessions. Historical data shows that reclaiming key price levels often requires testing them multiple times. The Mechanics of Exchange Trading and Liquidity The specific mention of the Binance USDT market is crucial. Tether (USDT) is the most widely used stablecoin, and its trading pairs often see the highest volumes. A surge on this pair suggests the movement was likely driven by capital flowing from stablecoins into Bitcoin, a classic risk-on signal. Exchange dynamics also play a role; Binance’s massive user base means its order book is deep, but even deep books can experience temporary imbalances. During the event, the bid-ask spread—the difference between the highest buy order and lowest sell order—may have widened momentarily before stabilizing. Comparative Table: Recent Notable BTC Short-Term Surges Date Timeframe Percentage Gain Primary Market Noted Catalyst Jan 2024 10 minutes 2.1% Coinbase BTC-USD Spot ETF Approval Rumor Nov 2023 15 minutes 1.8% Binance USDT Large OTC Purchase Report Mar 2025 5 minutes 1.53% Binance USDT Under Review (This Event) Conclusion The 1.53% Bitcoin price surge over five minutes, culminating in a trade at $77,922.93 on Binance, serves as a potent reminder of the cryptocurrency market’s volatility. While the immediate cause may be attributed to technical trading or a specific large order, the event fits into the broader narrative of Bitcoin’s maturation amidst persistent price discovery. For market participants, such movements highlight the importance of risk management and a long-term perspective. Ultimately, this rapid rally underscores the need for continuous analysis of liquidity, market structure, and external catalysts to navigate the dynamic landscape of digital asset trading. FAQs Q1: What does a 1.53% rise in five minutes mean for Bitcoin? It indicates a period of intense, concentrated buying pressure. While significant in the short term, it represents a single data point within Bitcoin’s long-term price chart and requires context from trading volume and market news. Q2: Why is the Binance USDT market specifically important? The BTC/USDT pair on Binance is typically one of the most liquid cryptocurrency markets globally. Price movements here are highly influential and often reflect broader market sentiment and capital flows from stablecoins into volatile assets. Q3: How common are these rapid price movements for Bitcoin? Short-term volatility is a well-documented feature of cryptocurrency markets. Multi-percent moves within minutes occur periodically, often during periods of low liquidity or in reaction to significant news events or large trades. Q4: Could this surge indicate the start of a larger bullish trend? A single five-minute candle is not a reliable indicator of a sustained trend reversal. Analysts look for confirmation over longer timeframes, supported by fundamentals like adoption metrics, regulatory clarity, and macroeconomic conditions. Q5: What should traders monitor after such an event? Traders typically watch for a follow-through in price action, changes in exchange funding rates, order book depth recovery, and any relevant news flow that might explain the initial move. The key is to see if the new price level holds.

57621246,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=267548,1769887211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Crypto Futures Liquidations Trigger Staggering $1,143 Million Hourly Market Shock",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-futures-liquidations-market-shock/,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Futures Liquidations Trigger Staggering $1,143 Million Hourly Market Shock A sudden and severe wave of forced position closures, known as liquidations, has rocked cryptocurrency derivatives markets, wiping out over $1.14 billion in leveraged futures contracts within a single hour. This dramatic event, recorded across major global exchanges on March 21, 2025, highlights the extreme volatility and inherent risks within crypto’s high-stakes trading environment. Consequently, market participants are now scrutinizing the underlying causes and potential aftershocks of this significant capital destruction. Crypto Futures Liquidations Reach Critical Levels Data from leading analytics platforms confirms a liquidation cascade totaling $1,143 million between 10:00 and 11:00 UTC. This one-hour figure represents nearly half of the total 24-hour liquidation volume, which stands at a staggering $2,537 million. Typically, such concentrated selling pressure originates from a sharp, unexpected price movement that breaches critical leverage thresholds. Major exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and OKX reportedly experienced the bulk of this activity. Therefore, this event serves as a stark reminder of the market’s fragility under high leverage conditions. Liquidations occur automatically when a trader’s margin balance falls below the maintenance requirement for their leveraged position. Exchanges forcefully close these positions to prevent losses from exceeding the trader’s collateral. The scale of this event suggests an exceptionally large number of traders were positioned on the wrong side of a rapid market move. Market analysts often track these metrics as a gauge of excessive leverage and potential local price extremes. Analyzing the Causes of Extreme Market Volatility Several interconnected factors likely converged to trigger this liquidation storm. First, a sudden shift in broader macroeconomic sentiment can instantly ripple through crypto markets. Secondly, large “whale” wallets executing substantial sell orders can create immediate downward pressure, triggering automated stop-losses. Furthermore, the inherent 24/7 nature of cryptocurrency trading means liquidity can be thinner during certain global hours, amplifying price swings. High Leverage Ratios: Traders frequently employ leverage of 10x, 25x, or even 100x, magnifying both gains and losses. Cascading Triggers: Initial liquidations can create selling pressure, pushing prices further and triggering more liquidations. Market Sentiment Shift: Negative news or technical breakdowns can rapidly change trader psychology from bullish to bearish. Historical data shows similar liquidation clusters often coincide with local price bottoms or tops, as extreme leverage gets flushed from the system. For instance, the May 2021 market correction saw single-day liquidations exceeding $10 billion, providing a precedent for understanding current dynamics. Expert Perspective on Risk Management Financial risk analysts emphasize that such events underscore the non-negotiable need for prudent risk management. “Liquidation cascades are a feature, not a bug, of highly leveraged markets,” notes a veteran derivatives strategist from a Singapore-based fund. “They represent a violent rebalancing where overextended positions are forcibly cleared. Savvy institutional traders monitor liquidation heatmaps as closely as price charts to gauge market stress levels.” This expert insight reinforces that these events, while disruptive, are a mechanistic outcome of current trading structures. Immediate and Long-Term Market Impacts The immediate impact of $1.14 billion in liquidations is a sharp increase in selling volume, often leading to heightened volatility and widened bid-ask spreads. This can create a challenging environment for both new entries and exits. In the short term, the market may experience a “liquidation hangover” characterized by reduced leverage and cautious trading. However, some analysts argue that large-scale liquidations can also create a healthier foundation by removing excessive speculative leverage. For the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, repeated events of this magnitude draw regulatory scrutiny. Lawmakers and financial authorities point to such volatility as evidence of market immaturity and investor risk. Consequently, this may accelerate calls for stricter leverage limits or enhanced investor protection measures on derivatives platforms. The long-term trust in crypto as an asset class can be influenced by the frequency and severity of these destabilizing events. Recent Major Liquidation Events Comparison Date Approximate 1-Hour Liquidation Volume Primary Catalyst March 21, 2025 $1.14 Billion Sharp price reversal following a rally November 2022 (FTX collapse) ~$800 Million Exchange insolvency panic June 2022 ~$1.1 Billion Macroeconomic tightening fears Conclusion The $1,143 million crypto futures liquidation event provides a powerful case study in market dynamics and risk. It highlights the amplified consequences of high leverage during periods of volatility. While painful for affected traders, such resets can remove speculative excess from the market. Moving forward, participants must prioritize robust risk management, including sensible leverage and stop-loss strategies. Ultimately, understanding the mechanics and triggers of these liquidation cascades is crucial for anyone involved in the volatile world of cryptocurrency derivatives trading. FAQs Q1: What exactly is a futures liquidation in crypto? A futures liquidation is the forced closure of a leveraged trading position by an exchange. This happens when the trader’s collateral (margin) falls below the required level to maintain the position, preventing further losses. Q2: Why did over $1.14 billion liquidate in one hour? Such a large, concentrated liquidation typically occurs due to a rapid and substantial price move against the majority of leveraged positions. This triggers a cascade of automatic sell orders as successive leverage thresholds are breached. Q3: Do large liquidations mean the market has bottomed? Not necessarily. While massive liquidations often signal a capitulation event where weak hands exit, they do not guarantee an immediate price bottom. They indicate a local extreme in selling pressure, but the fundamental market direction depends on broader factors. Q4: How can traders protect themselves from liquidation? Traders can manage risk by using lower leverage ratios, employing sensible stop-loss orders, maintaining adequate margin collateral above minimum requirements, and avoiding overconcentration in a single position. Q5: Which cryptocurrencies are most affected by futures liquidations? Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) typically see the highest absolute dollar value in liquidations due to their large market capitalization and deep futures markets. However, altcoins with high leverage offerings can experience more severe percentage swings.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC was trading at $75,919.51 on the Binance USDT perpetual futures market, marking a notable pullback from recent highs and triggering analysis across financial sectors. This price movement represents a critical juncture for investors and reflects broader macroeconomic currents influencing digital asset valuations. Analyzing the Bitcoin Price Drop Below $76,000 The descent of Bitcoin below $76,000 follows a period of consolidation after its latest rally. Market data indicates selling pressure increased during Asian trading hours, consequently leading to a cascade of liquidations in the derivatives market. Technical analysts immediately scrutinized key support levels. The $76,000 zone had previously acted as both resistance and support, making its breach a technically significant event. Furthermore, on-chain metrics from Glassnode and CryptoQuant showed a slight increase in exchange inflows, suggesting some holders moved to realize profits or limit losses. This price action does not occur in a vacuum. Historically, Bitcoin has experienced similar corrections during bull market cycles. For instance, the 2021 cycle saw multiple drawdowns exceeding 20% before reaching new all-time highs. The current volatility underscores the asset’s nascent stage relative to traditional markets. Market participants now watch the $74,000 and $70,000 levels as the next potential areas of support, which could determine the short-term trend direction. Contextual Drivers Behind the Cryptocurrency Market Move Several interrelated factors typically contribute to sudden Bitcoin price movements. Firstly, macroeconomic indicators play a crucial role. Recent statements from the Federal Reserve regarding interest rate policy have created uncertainty across risk assets, including technology stocks and cryptocurrencies. Secondly, regulatory developments continue to shape market sentiment. News from jurisdictions like the European Union and the United States regarding digital asset frameworks can prompt immediate trader reactions. Additionally, the internal dynamics of the crypto ecosystem exert influence. The flow of funds between Bitcoin, Ethereum, and alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) often sees rotation during periods of uncertainty. Network activity and fee pressure on the Bitcoin blockchain also provide fundamental context. A comparison of recent sell-off triggers is illustrative: Potential Catalyst Current Market Observation Historical Precedent Macroeconomic Policy Heightened sensitivity to Fed commentary Q2 2021 taper talk reaction Derivatives Market Leverage High estimated leverage ratio preceding drop Liquidation cascades in May 2021 Profit-Taking by Long-Term Holders Moderate spike in exchange inflows Behavior observed at previous cycle peaks Broader Risk-Off Sentiment Correlation with tech stock (NASDAQ) decline March 2020 COVID-induced crash pattern Market structure has evolved significantly since previous cycles. The introduction of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs has created a new class of institutional participants whose flows can amplify or dampen volatility. Data from fund issuers like BlackRock and Fidelity shows net inflows have been positive but variable, contributing to the current price discovery phase. Expert Perspectives on Market Volatility and Trader Psychology Financial analysts emphasize that volatility is an inherent feature of Bitcoin’s market. Veteran trader and analyst, whose commentary often appears in CoinDesk and Bloomberg, noted in a recent analysis that “healthy corrections are necessary to shake out excess leverage and establish a stronger foundation for the next leg up.” This perspective aligns with data showing the market had become overbought on several shorter-term technical indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Behavioral finance also explains part of the reaction. The round number of $76,000 often acts as a psychological barrier for traders, leading to clustered stop-loss orders just below it. When these orders execute, they can accelerate a move downward. Meanwhile, on-chain analyst Willy Woo’s metrics often track investor cohorts; his models currently suggest accumulation by long-term holders continues despite price dips, a historically bullish signal for the macro trend. Historical Precedents and Technical Analysis Outlook Placing the current drop in context requires examining Bitcoin’s price history. The cryptocurrency has experienced over a dozen drawdowns of 10% or more during its major bull markets. For example: 2017 Bull Run: Multiple 30%+ corrections within a broader uptrend. 2020-2021 Cycle: Several sharp declines, including a 53% drop in May 2021. Current Cycle (2024-2025): The move below $76,000 represents one of the deeper pullbacks, testing investor conviction. Technical analysts are now focused on several key levels. The 20-week and 50-week moving averages, currently around $68,000 and $58,000 respectively, often provide dynamic support in bullish phases. Volume analysis is also critical; a decline on low volume suggests a lack of strong conviction behind the sell-off, whereas high volume indicates broader participation. Chart patterns, such as potential double-top formations or bull flag continuations, will become clearer in the coming trading sessions. Conclusion The Bitcoin price falling below $76,000 serves as a stark reminder of the asset’s inherent volatility and its sensitivity to a complex web of factors. While the immediate move triggers caution, historical patterns and fundamental on-chain data suggest such corrections are normative within long-term appreciation trends. The market’s next steps will depend on macroeconomic developments, institutional ETF flows, and the defense of key technical support levels. For investors, this event underscores the importance of risk management, a long-term perspective, and diversified exposure within the evolving digital asset landscape. FAQs Q1: Why did Bitcoin fall below $76,000? The drop is likely due to a combination of factors: profit-taking after a strong rally, a slight tightening of macroeconomic expectations, and a flush of excessive leverage in the derivatives market, which triggered a cascade of liquidations. Q2: Is this a normal occurrence for Bitcoin? Yes, historically. Bitcoin’s bull markets are characterized by strong rallies interspersed with sharp corrections, often ranging from 20% to 30%. These moves are considered healthy for sustaining long-term uptrends. Q3: What are the key support levels to watch now? Analysts are watching the $74,000 area (previous consolidation zone), followed by the $70,000 psychological level. The 20-week moving average, around $68,000, is a major technical support level for the broader trend. Q4: How do U.S. Bitcoin ETFs affect this volatility? ETF flows add a new dynamic. Sustained net inflows can provide underlying buying pressure and dampen volatility, while net outflows or neutral flows can remove a support pillar, potentially exacerbating downside moves. Q5: Should investors be worried about this price drop? Short-term volatility is expected. Investors should align their strategy with their risk tolerance and time horizon. Long-term proponents view these dips as potential accumulation opportunities, while short-term traders focus on technical levels and risk management.

On the daily chart, ETH dropped from the $2,700 area to near $2,400 , marking roughly a 10% decline in a short period. The move followed a failed stabilization attempt above $2,600, after which sellers accelerated momentum and pushed price through key horizontal support. Technically, Ethereum has broken below the $2,500–$2,550 demand zone, which previously acted as a pivot throughout January. The breakdown shifts former support into resistance, while expanding sell volume confirms strong participation on the downside. The daily RSI has moved toward oversold territory, reflecting stretched momentum. While such readings can precede short-term relief bounces, they do not confirm a structural bottom. So far, no clear bullish reversal pattern has formed on higher timeframes. January 31 Liquidations Accelerate the Move The drop coincided with a wave of liquidations across crypto derivatives markets. Leveraged long positions were flushed out as ETH lost $2,500, intensifying volatility and forcing additional market sells. Large liquidation clusters tend to create cascading effects, where each break of support triggers further forced exits. That dynamic appears to have played a major role in the speed of Ethereum’s decline toward $2,400. Analyst Flags $1,435 as Bearish Target In a post on X, crypto analyst Elja (@Eljaboom) warned that Ethereum could decline much deeper if the broader market structure continues weakening, outlining a potential move toward $1,435 in an extended bearish scenario. The projection highlights a possible macro correction toward prior higher-timeframe demand zones, should Ethereum fail to reclaim lost support levels in the coming sessions. While the $1,435 level represents a more aggressive downside outlook rather than an immediate target, the forecast reflects growing caution among technical analysts as market momentum deteriorates.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-31 19:27:22

While many established altcoins are struggling to hold their value, a select group of new cheap crypto projects is moving in the opposite direction. This pattern aligns with what professional traders often describe as risk compression. For most new cryptocurrencies, the highest risk exists at inception, when a project is little more than an idea. As technical milestones are reached and core systems go live, the fundamental risk to investor capital declines significantly. However, market pricing does not always immediately reflect this improved risk profile. How Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Compressing its Risk Curve The main example of such a risk-first development is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project is constructing a non-custodial lending and borrowing protocol. Instead of depending on hype on social media, Mutuum Finance has been working on clearing significant challenges. Mutuum Finance’s roadmap is unfolding quickly and has recently moved its V1 protocol to the Sepolia testnet. This action is an indication that the lending logic and pools of liquidity are working. The V1 launch represents a major technical milestone that transitions the project from a concept to a functional financial tool. This testnet version allows users to interact with the core liquidity pools using major assets such as ETH, USDT, LINK, and WBTC. One of the central features of the V1 protocol is the mtToken system, which issues interest-bearing receipts to lenders. These tokens automatically grow in value as the protocol collects interest from borrowers, providing a seamless way to track yield without manual claiming. On the borrowing side, the system uses debt tokens to account for outstanding principal and interest in real-time. To ensure the entire ecosystem remains secure, the V1 release includes an automated liquidator bot that monitors user health factors. This bot is designed to manage risky positions and maintain protocol solvency by liquidating collateral if its value drops below a safe threshold. The team has eliminated the huge execution risk that kills most new projects by providing a work system prior to the mainnet launch. The roadmap has ceased to be a list of promises but a list of tested technical accomplishments. The Growth Behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already collected more than $20.1 million dollars and gained more than 19, 00 holders. The project is in the presale Phase 7 and the price of MUTM is $0.04. It is increasing by a 3x mark of its initial price, but still at a significantly low point at the official launch price of $0.06. Of all the supply of 4 billion tokens, approximately 1.82 billion are distributed to the presale community. Over 840 million tokens are already sold. This extensive distribution is critical since it implies that the supply does not fall into the hands of very few people. A wide range of holder bases lowers the chances of huge price volatility. With the availability of the cheap tokens reduced to a drier, the chances of post-launch dump diminishes even more. Security Stack and Long-Term Expectation Mutuum Finance has also developed a multi-layered security stack to ensure further security to its users. CertiK, a major trust signal in the industry, has a high 90/100 score on the protocol. Also, the code has been reviewed in entirety by Halborn Security . The team also pays ethical hackers a bug bounty of $50,000 to guarantee the safety in the long-term. These layers serve a purpose of providing insurance to the protocol. They offer downside insurance that serious institutional investors seek to find before they can commit significant sums of money. The last signs that a major reprice is imminent are now being realized. Big players are recording large-scale allocations of more than $100,000. Interaction is also good with the 24-hour leader board whereby the highest daily depositor receives a $500 in mUTM. Such a combination of known security, operational V1 testnet and increasing participation indicates that the risk-first one is coming to an exit. With the project being on the verge of its public launch, the market will eventually realign the price with the technical maturity of the project but at that point the current 50% MUTM discount will be gone.

This milestone represents a pivotal moment for the world’s premier cryptocurrency, underscoring a period of intense market activity and renewed investor confidence. Consequently, analysts are scrutinizing the underlying factors propelling this ascent, while traders monitor key resistance levels. This price movement follows a period of consolidation and reflects broader macroeconomic trends influencing digital asset valuations. Furthermore, the breach of this psychological barrier invites a deeper examination of Bitcoin’s evolving role within the modern financial ecosystem. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Decoding the $77,000 Breakthrough The recent climb above $77,000 marks a continuation of Bitcoin’s robust performance this cycle. Market data from multiple exchanges confirms this upward trajectory, with Binance’s USDT pairing serving as a primary benchmark. Historically, such round-number levels act as both technical and psychological barriers. Therefore, a sustained break often indicates strong buying pressure. For instance, on-chain analytics reveal substantial accumulation by long-term holders preceding this move. Simultaneously, exchange net flows show a decrease in available supply, suggesting a holding mentality among investors. This combination of technical breakout and supportive on-chain metrics provides a compelling narrative for the rally’s strength. Key Technical and On-Chain Indicators Several quantifiable metrics corroborate the bullish sentiment. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), while elevated, has not yet entered extreme overbought territory on weekly charts. Additionally, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram remains positive across major timeframes. On-chain, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio offers insights into profit-taking likelihood. Currently, it suggests the market is not in a state of extreme euphoria typically seen at cycle tops. Network fundamentals also remain strong, with hash rate near all-time highs, signaling robust security and miner commitment. These factors collectively paint a picture of a market driven by fundamentals rather than mere speculation. Catalysts and Market Drivers Behind the Rally Multiple converging factors are fueling Bitcoin’s impressive price action. Primarily, the evolving regulatory landscape for spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) has provided a sustained influx of institutional capital. These investment vehicles have consistently recorded net positive inflows, creating a new, steady demand source. Moreover, macroeconomic conditions, including expectations of shifting monetary policy and global currency devaluation concerns, continue to highlight Bitcoin’s potential as a non-sovereign store of value. Geopolitical tensions and inflationary pressures in various economies have similarly driven investors toward hard assets. This macroeconomic backdrop serves as a powerful tailwind for decentralized digital assets. Industry adoption milestones also contribute significantly. Major financial institutions are increasingly integrating cryptocurrency custody and trading services for clients. Payment giants are expanding crypto transaction capabilities, while corporate treasury allocations to Bitcoin, though selective, set a precedent. Furthermore, technological advancements within the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as developments around the Lightning Network for scaling and Taproot for privacy and smart contracts, enhance its utility proposition. This blend of financial, macroeconomic, and technological drivers creates a multi-layered foundation for the current valuation. Comparative Market Performance Bitcoin’s performance often sets the tone for the broader digital asset market. The following table illustrates its dominance and recent performance against traditional assets over a key period. Asset 30-Day Performance Key Driver Bitcoin (BTC) +18.5% ETF inflows, macro hedge demand S&P 500 Index +3.2% Earnings season, economic data Gold (XAU) +1.8% Safe-haven demand US Dollar Index (DXY) -0.5% Interest rate expectations This outperformance highlights Bitcoin’s unique position. It is not merely correlating with traditional risk-on assets like stocks nor purely acting as a digital gold analogue. Instead, it is carving its own path, influenced by its specific adoption cycle and inherent monetary properties. Historical Context and Cycle Analysis Placing the $77,000 price point within Bitcoin’s historical context is crucial for perspective. The asset has experienced several distinct market cycles, each characterized by a period of exponential growth, a sharp correction, and subsequent consolidation leading to a new all-time high. The previous cycle peak saw Bitcoin approach the $69,000 level before a significant drawdown. The current move above $77,000 therefore represents a decisive break from that previous high, a technically and psychologically important event often referred to as a “cycle breakout.” Historically, such breakouts have preceded extended periods of price discovery, though past performance never guarantees future results. Analysts often examine the timing between “halving” events—the pre-programmed reduction in new Bitcoin issuance to miners—and subsequent price peaks. The most recent halving occurred in April 2024, and historical patterns suggest a potential peak in price activity 12-18 months later. This current rally aligns loosely with that historical timeframe, adding another layer of narrative for market observers. However, experts consistently warn against over-reliance on cyclical models, as each cycle operates under unique global conditions and levels of market maturity. Expert Insights and Institutional Commentary Leading analysts from firms like Glassnode, CoinMetrics, and major investment banks provide valuable context. They note that the investor base has matured significantly. For example, the volatility profile, while still high, has decreased relative to previous cycles at similar price levels. This suggests increased liquidity and the presence of more stable, long-term capital. Furthermore, regulatory clarity in several major jurisdictions, though still evolving, has reduced systemic uncertainty for institutional participants. Experts emphasize the importance of monitoring derivative markets, particularly futures and options open interest, to gauge leverage and potential risk of volatile liquidations. The general consensus remains cautiously optimistic, focusing on sustainable adoption over short-term price speculation. Potential Impacts and Future Trajectory The sustained price above $77,000 carries several potential implications. For the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, a strong Bitcoin often leads to increased capital rotation into alternative digital assets (altcoins), as measured by Bitcoin dominance charts. For traditional finance, it further legitimizes cryptocurrency as an asset class, potentially accelerating integration into retirement portfolios and balanced funds. From a technological standpoint, a higher Bitcoin valuation translates directly to greater security for the network, as miner revenue in fiat terms increases, incentivizing further hash rate investment. Key levels to watch include: Immediate Support: The previous all-time high zone near $69,000. Near-term Resistance: Psychological levels at $80,000 and $85,000. On-chain Support: The aggregate cost basis of recent buyers, as identified by UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) models. Market participants will also closely monitor macroeconomic data releases, particularly inflation figures and central bank communications, as these have proven to be significant short-term volatility catalysts. The interplay between traditional finance flows and native crypto market dynamics will likely define the next major price movement. Conclusion Bitcoin’s ascent above $77,000 represents a major milestone, underscored by a confluence of institutional adoption, favorable macro trends, and strong technical foundations. This Bitcoin price achievement is not an isolated event but part of a broader maturation story for digital assets. While volatility remains an inherent characteristic, the market structure appears more resilient than in previous cycles. The focus now shifts to whether this level can consolidate as a new support base for further price discovery. Ultimately, the BTC rally reinforces Bitcoin’s growing significance within the global financial landscape, demanding attention from investors, regulators, and technologists alike. FAQs Q1: What does Bitcoin trading at $77,097.5 mean? It signifies that on the Binance exchange, one Bitcoin can be purchased for 77,097.5 Tether (USDT) tokens, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. This price is a key benchmark reflecting current supply and demand dynamics in a major liquid market. Q2: What are the main reasons Bitcoin price is rising? Primary drivers include sustained inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, creating new institutional demand; macroeconomic factors like inflation concerns; ongoing global adoption by payment networks and institutions; and positive technical breakouts from key resistance levels. Q3: How does this price compare to Bitcoin’s all-time high? The $77,097.5 level exceeds the previous all-time high of approximately $69,000 set in the prior market cycle. Breaking and holding above a previous cycle high is considered a significant bullish technical event. Q4: Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin at this price? Investment decisions depend on individual risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. Financial advisors recommend that cryptocurrency should only constitute a small, risk-adjusted portion of a diversified portfolio, regardless of the current price point. Q5: What risks are associated with Bitcoin at this level? Key risks include high volatility leading to sharp corrections, regulatory changes in major economies, potential market over-leverage, technological risks, and broader macroeconomic shifts that could reduce risk appetite. Investors should conduct thorough research.

By 2029, SOL is expected to reach a high of $263.38, supported by continued ecosystem growth and network adoption. Solana’s price could see further upside by 2032, potentially reaching $397.47 with an average trading price around $365.19. Despite occasional challenges for the Solana network ecosystem, including network congestion and competition from other blockchain platforms, the current sentiment shows that Solana demonstrates resilience and adaptability, despite the current price fluctuations, positioning itself as a leading player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 landscape. Overall, the prevailing sentiment regarding the current Solana price within the Solana community reflects the current sentiment of confidence and excitement among investors, driven by the growing interest in Solana with stakeholders eagerly anticipating the platform’s continued evolution and impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. While uncertainties persist, Solana’s innovative approach, along with its low transaction fees and robust infrastructure instill optimism for its future price action, as indicated by the technical factors and technical analysis. In this article, we’ll explore Solana price prediction and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators. This brings the question “How high can SOL go in 2026 and beyond?” and we’ll try to answer that.

The altcoin lost 11.52% of its value across last 24-hours. Support for SOL/USD is at $100. As of January 31, the Solana price analysis reveals continued bearish momentum as price falls to $104. Solana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL falls to $104 The one-day price chart of the Solana shows that the decline has continued into 2026 with the price falling below the $110 mark this week. Moreover, after failing to climb past $128 the price was headed down below $100 but finds support at the $100 level that has enabled recovery back to the $104 level where it faces resistance. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the level of volatility. This distance between high and low bands is widening, leading to increased volatility. Moving ahead, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance band, has shifted to $152.43. The indicator’s lower limit, which shows a support level, has shifted to $104.08. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present in the oversold area and trades close to the edge of the neutral level. The indicator’s value has increased to index 27.38, and its downward curve suggests a bearish pressure at the level. If buying activities continue to intensify, further volatility in the market can be expected. SOL/USD 4-hour price chart The four-hour price analysis of the Solana token shows steady bearish activity as the price crashes below the $110 mark. The altcoin’s price declined below $100 but quickly rose to the current $104 mark SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Bollinger Bands have diverged, hinting at a higher volatility level. This level of volatility signifies increased market unpredictability. Moving forward, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $128.87, securing the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $104.14, indicating support. The RSI indicator is in the neutral region. Currently at 20.25, the RSI curve is pointing lower, suggesting bearish market sentiment at the level. The level of the index suggests little to no room for further movement in either direction across the short-term. We can expect further increase if buying activities persist for a few consecutive candles.

Solana Price Prediction Solana market price prediction: Analysts’ SOL price forecast Firm Name 2026 2027 Changelly $229.77 $341.01 DigitalCoinPrice $166.94 $195.77 Cryptopolitan’s Solana (SOL) price prediction Our predictions show that SOL will achieve a high of $166.94 in 2026. In 2029, it will range between $234.45 and $263.38, with an average of $247.62. In 2032, it will range between $345.12 and $397.47, with an average of $365.19. However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the volatile crypto market. Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level. In August, on the other hand, SOL made strides and managed to close the month above the $205 mark. In September, the volatility rose sharply as the price rose to the $250 price level but failed to maintain the level and ended the month at $230. In October, the decline increased sharply as SOL ended the month below $170. In November, and December the decline continued with SOL ending the year at the $125 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-31 20:00:00

The analyst cited his earlier misconceptions about the altcoin, highlighting developments such as Ripple’s new bank charter as major reasons for his shift in sentiment. XRP Critic Reverses Stance On The Cryptocurrency Crypto commentator Minus Wells has publicly reversed his stance on XRP, admitting he was wrong to be a “hater” and to have consistently criticized the cryptocurrency. In his post on X, Wells asserted that he was a “changed man now,” underscoring his newfound confidence in the token. He cited several reasons for his unexpected change of heart, highlighting Ripple’s recent milestone in receiving a bank charter license from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in the US and officially becoming a regulated bank . Wells revealed that Ripple had formally sent him their first coin, which could be going into minting soon. He described the cryptocurrency as “the future currency of the world,” indicating that XRP could play a transformative role in the global financial system . Wells said that he was astonished by how much he had overlooked XRP’s potential. He admitted that, in light of the recent positive developments surrounding Ripple, he had to step back and acknowledge he was utterly wrong about the cryptocurrency. Pointing to the Ripple coin in his possession, the crypto pundit described it as absolute proof of XRP’s legitimacy and future growth. He went on to compare XRP to Bitcoin , arguing that the altcoin now has physical coins, whereas BTC does not. Wells dismissed Bitcoin for lacking real substance and questioned its legitimacy, further supporting his argument by asking whether the world’s largest cryptocurrency holds a banking license in the United States similar to Ripple. Wells also sought to preempt any future claims that he was acting as an influencer for XRP. He emphasized that he was never paid to spread Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) about XRP during his earlier criticisms. He explained that, in most cases, financial incentives in the crypto space are used to promote digital assets and convince investors of a token’s bullishness rather than criticize it. According to Wells, criticism of the altcoin is rarely sponsored, as paid efforts typically focus on boosting hype and driving demand. He added that those who fund influencer promotions are not Ripple, but whales who control significant portions of its supply and cannot sell their holdings without crashing the market. To support his claims, the former critic pointed to the sharp flash crash on October 10 as a prime example of the impact of large-scale liquidations. No All-Time High For The Token Although he has backtracked on his previously negative position regarding XRP, Wells remains skeptical about its price potential. He stated that he does not expect the cryptocurrency to climb to $100 , dismissing the notion that it could even reach $20. The crypto pundit emphasized that the altcoin will never hit a new all-time high, and investors would be fortunate to see it ever trade above $5. He urged Ripple supporters to remain cautious and not be swayed by exaggerated predictions or claims from influencers.",XRP|and Doubt|bitcoin|btc|fear|fud|Minus Wells|OCC|Office of the Comptroller of the Currency|ripple|Uncertainty|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|FIAT|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-31 20:00:47
57622043,https://timestabloid.com/?p=96223,1769889924,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Says This Chart Looks Dangerous for XRP,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-this-chart-looks-dangerous-for-xrp/,"XRP has entered a technically sensitive phase where long-term confidence clashes with uncomfortable historical patterns. After months of volatile price action and fading upside momentum, the market now forces traders and investors to reassess risk. While optimism remains strong across parts of the XRP community, the broader chart structure tells a more cautious story. That concern gained traction after a chart shared by STEPH IS CRYPTO, who examined XRP’s full logarithmic price history from 2015 through 2026. His analysis places the current setup alongside previous market cycles that ended with deep and prolonged corrections. XRP’s Major Price Peaks Across Market Cycles XRP’s long-term chart highlights three major bull-market peaks that shaped its history. In 2015, XRP topped out near the $0.01 level before entering a sharp decline. That cycle ended with a drawdown of roughly 75.03%, establishing an early pattern of aggressive downside following periods of expansion. The 2017–2018 bull run delivered XRP’s most explosive rally. Price surged to a peak near $3.50 during the height of the altcoin mania. That peak marked the start of a severe reversal, with XRP eventually falling by approximately 85.77% as the broader market entered a prolonged bear phase. This looks dangerous for $XRP pic.twitter.com/1c4rEPLUMJ — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) January 31, 2026 The pattern repeated after the 2021 cycle. XRP reached highs just below $2.00, with most exchanges recording peaks between $1.90 and $1.96. From those levels, XRP declined into the 2022 bear market, producing an even deeper drawdown of about 86.61%. Why the 50-Week Moving Average Signals Risk Steph’s analysis emphasized the importance of the 50-week moving average as a long-term trend indicator. In previous cycles, XRP lost this level shortly after setting its macro highs. Each loss preceded extended periods of downside rather than quick recoveries. At present, XRP trades below the 50-week moving average. Recent price action shows XRP pulling back from highs above $2.00 and trading near $1.59 as of report time. This positioning mirrors earlier bearish phases and places XRP in a zone where sellers historically gained control. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Logarithmic Scaling Strengthens the Comparison The use of a logarithmic chart allows a clearer comparison between cycles by accounting for XRP’s exponential growth over time. From this perspective, the similarity between past drawdowns becomes difficult to ignore. Each major correction clustered within a 75% to 86% decline range, regardless of differing market narratives. This alignment does not guarantee repetition , but it strengthens the technical argument for caution. A Warning, Not a Prediction Steph does not claim that a crash must occur. Instead, the chart presents a structural warning rooted in XRP’s historical behavior. Until XRP reclaims the 50-week moving average and invalidates this pattern, downside risk remains present. For now, XRP stands at a crossroads where history urges discipline rather than complacency. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

It is not uncommon for treasuries in the DeFi sector to get attacked on Solana or other chains; however, the scale on which this one happened has once again reignited debates about security practices for project-held funds. Step Finance was hacked According to the Step Finance team on X, several of its treasury and fee wallets were compromised in the attack, which saw the attackers unstake and transfer about 261,854 SOL to unknown addresses. At the time of the incident, the price of all that Solana amounted to roughly $30 million in value. The team claimed in their X post that an investigation is underway, and some hours later, they reached out to cybersecurity firms for assistance, encouraging affected users or anyone with means to help to contact them. The phrasing from the post makes it seem the incident was a targeted compromise of the protocol’s treasury wallets rather than a smart contract exploit that affected user funds directly. Since the attack, Defillama shows Step Finance’s TVL at zero. Step Finance’s TVL is at zero since the hack. Source: Defillama While the situation is still developing, the market has already reacted to the news. According to data from Coingecko, the native $STEP token has dropped by about 84% at the time of this writing, with prices hovering around $0.4241. Recent attacks have targeted admin vulnerabilities Attacks on DeFi protocols on Solana are nothing new, but the recent attacks all seem to have common vectors like treasury wallet compromise, private key leaks, access control flaws, and smart contract exploits. The Step Finance exploit follows the pattern of operational compromise as its treasury was the target rather than user funds. Some other notable and recent DeFi-related hacks with similar vectors include the CrediX protocol exploit , the Loopscale exploit, and the Upbit Solana-related hack. The CrediX incident saw the protocol lose $4.5 million in a breach where attackers gained control of an administrator’s wallet. The case mirrors Step Finance’s current predicament closely, as it also did not involve direct user funds. However, many hope things will end differently than they did with CrediX because it was a disaster. The team had promised refunds within a day or two of the exploit, claiming it had entered a parley with the hacker. However, rather than follow through on that, the team went off the grid, deleting their X and taking down the website, which triggered allegations of a rugpull. The Loopscale incident also had a similar attack vector, losing over $5 million not long after launch due to an exploit, although it ultimately reached a parley with the hacker, settling for a 10% bounty agreement. The most high-profile attack was the Upbit Solana-related hack , which occurred in November 2025 and resulted in the South Korean exchange losing over $35 million from a hot wallet. The incident was linked to insufficient access controls on withdrawals, and it affected assets in the Solana ecosystem, echoing risks associated with treasury and hot wallets.

They desire to discover true value potential. There is a silent revolution in the lending sector which is decentralized. A single cheap crypto project has been exceptional in that it developed its technology. It has now come to a stage where its code is fit to the world. This is generating a tide of excitement on the part of people who appreciate technical delivery. The time is significant as the project is headed towards the ultimate public introduction. Mutuum Finance and Growth of MUTM Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is establishing a decentralized protocol that will let users borrow and lend assets without intermediaries. By using crypto as collateral, investors can unlock cash while maintaining their long-term positions. The platform develops a dual-market mechanism including Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pools for instant liquidity and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) markets for custom loan terms. For example, a user might access a 70% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio on stable assets or earn a 12% annual percentage yield (APY) by providing liquidity to the pools. The project has achieved impressive growth since its launch in early 2025. MUTM price has climbed from $0.01 to its current value of $0.04, reflecting a 300% increase for early participants. With over $20.1 million raised and a community of more than 19,000 investors, there is clear market confidence in the protocol. These figures highlight the strong demand for a functional lending ecosystem that rewards its users through transparent and efficient financial tools. Protocol Launch & Security The latest version is the activation of the V1 protocol in the Sepolia testnet. This is a functional version of the application in which users are able to test its main tools in a live environment. It features the mtToken system that awards lenders yield-bearing receipts for their deposits, allowing them to earn interest as the value of these tokens grows. To manage borrowing, the protocol issues debt tokens that track a user’s outstanding loan balance and accumulated interest. The safety of the system is monitored by the health factor, a real-time score that measures the value of a user’s collateral against their debt. If this score falls too low, the automated liquidator bot steps in to close the position and protect the protocol’s liquidity. These features work together to provide a transparent and secure lending experience for all participants. Such an opening demonstrates that the project is more than an idea. It is a working platform and code. The team has recently undergone a complete security audit by Halborn Security as a means of protecting its users. It is a high-quality company that considers the most successful projects in crypto. The completion of this audit provides an element of protection that serious investors seek all the time. Roadmap Plans & Revenue Mechanism Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a buy and distribute model to support the value of its token. Part of the platform fees will be utilized to purchase MUTM tokens in the market. These tokens are subsequently issued to the people that stake mtTokens on the platform. This produces an ever-growing need for the token as increasing numbers of people utilise the service. The team is planning to roll out over-collateralized stablecoin. This will provide the users with a consistent means of controlling their loans within the ecosystem. Due to such powerful characteristics, price forecasts are highly optimistic. Analysts indicate that the token may hit between $0.10 to $0.35 as long as the mainnet is launched. This would be a huge 4x-9x step compared to the existing price of $0.04. Mutuum Finance is establishing a position as a 2026 DeFi leader. It is a blend of high security, working product and a community that is loyal. We are already in the last stages of the distribution stage. The existing price of $0.04 is a 50% discount of the official price of $0.06 at launch. In this case, to an investor who has $500, it serves the interest of acquiring a bigger role prior to the introduction of the token to the open market. This is a very important window as the supply is more than selling fast. When the project is transferred to the mainnet, the preliminary pricing will be eliminated. Investors are in a hurry to secure their tokens today to be prepared for the next crypto stage of development.

The project has raised $925,384 so far thanks to its presale and pre-launch phases, with the latter beginning on April 1, 2025. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) recovered some ground after plunging to $81,000 on Friday and reclaimed the $83,000 mark. The steady recovery has seen the flagship cryptocurrency move to $98,901, up over 1% in the past 24 hours. However, precious metals crashed as their rally lost steam, with gold down over 10% and Silver dropping more than 30%. Husky Inu AI (HINU) Moves To $0.00026031 Husky Inu AI (HINU) has completed the latest price increase of its pre-launch phase, rising from $0.00025539 to $0.00025636. The project’s much-talked-about pre-launch phase began on April 1, 2025, following the conclusion of its presale. The pre-launch allows the project to continue its fundraising efforts while empowering its growing community and existing token holders. It also helps the team to secure capital, fund platform improvements, undertake market initiatives, and support broader ecosystem expansion. Husky Inu AI’s official launch date is now under three months away. However, the team remains open to the possibility of an earlier or later launch, depending on market conditions. The team will conduct a series of review meetings to determine the project’s launch date. The first two review meetings were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025, while the third is scheduled for January 1, 2026. Bitcoin (BTC) Reclaims $83,000 As Gold, Silver Lose Steam Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) steadied itself after crashing to a nine-month low and reclaimed the $83,000 mark, moving to its current level of $83,890. The flagship cryptocurrency is up over 1% in the past 24 hours. The 10% correction, spread over Wednesday and Thursday, saw BTC come dangerously close to slipping below the $80,000 mark. The correction was the result of overly cautious traders following significant ETF outflows, rising geopolitical tensions, and market uncertainty. Besides geopolitical and market factors, the threat from quantum computers has added to investor anxiety. Coinbase recently announced an independent advisory board to evaluate the risks associated with quantum computing, with plans to publish its study by 2027. The quantum threat discussion intensified after Jeffries removed Bitcoin from its flagship portfolio, citing long-term security concerns. However, Blockstream co-founder Adam Beck dismissed concerns about an immediate quantum risk. A Feeble Recovery The cryptocurrency market also recovered after two days of intense downward pressure, registering a marginal 0.45% increase to $2.83 trillion. Trading was mixed as Ethereum (ETH) continued trading in bearish territory. The altcoin slipped below the $2,700 mark and is down 1.50% to $2,692. Ripple (XRP) is down almost 1% at $1.73, while Solana (SOL) made a strong recovery and moved to $118. Dogecoin (DOGE) is marginally up over the past 24 hours, but Cardano (ADA) is down over 3%, trading around $0.314. Chainlink (LINK) is down 1% while Stellar (XLM) is also down over 1%, trading around $0.190. Hedera (HBAR) and Polkadot (DOT) are also trading in the red, but Litecoin (LTC) and Toncoin (TON) registered notable declines over the past 24 hours.

Our Pi network price prediction anticipates the Pi price to reach a maximum level of $0.3444 by 2026. In 2032, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $3.19. Pi Network is a social crypto and developer ecosystem focused on mass accessibility and real-world use, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan. As 2026 begins, Pi has transitioned from a long-running experiment into a live Layer-1 blockchain with open transfers, exchange liquidity, and a growing app ecosystem. In the past year 2025, Pi hit an all-time high near $2.98 after Open Mainnet launched, then fell to a low around $0.1585 in October as large token unlocks increased supply, leaving the price in the low-$0.20 range. Despite the volatility, 2025 marked major progress: Open Mainnet went live, exchange listings expanded, Pi Network Ventures launched a $100 million ecosystem fund, AI-powered KYC scaled up, and developer activity grew through hackathons, Testnet DEX and AMM tools, Map of Pi 2.0, and broader merchant adoption, signaling a shift from speculation toward real usage. In this Pi Network price prediction, we discuss these developments with major technical levels and the model of exponential supply of Pi that is in decline to determine whether 2026–2032 favors a sustained recovery or further downside. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.1632 Price Change 24h -3.37% Market Cap $1.38B Circulating Supply 8.64B PI Trading Volume 24h $20.64M All-Time High $2.98, Feb 26, 2025 All-Time Low $0.1585, Oct 11, 2025 Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.1632 Price Prediction $ 0.1363 (-25.05%) Fear & Greed Index 24 (Extreme Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 2.62% (Medium) Green Days 15/30 (50%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.2097 200-Day SMA $0.3032 14-Day RSI 24.88 (Oversold) Pi Price Analysis TL;DR Breakdown : As of today, Pi has dropped to $0.1632 after breaking under the $0.17 zone. The end of January daily chart demonstrates a further bearish structure. RSI is over sold, and the MACD is negative and has no reversal signal. As of January 31, 2026, Pi Network fell once again, having not been able to maintain above the $0.17 zone. Traders kept focus on downside risk after a late selloff that pushed Pi toward fresh lows. Pi is trading near $0.1632, with 24-hour volume rising to $20.64M, suggesting active distribution during the drop. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis On the daily timeframe, Pi opened around $0.1689 and sold down into the session. Price reversed to lower after posting a high of $0.1751 and later Pi dropped to a low of about $0.1590, where it ended to a close of $0.1632, which is 3.37% fall. The candle structure shows continued lower highs and weak demand. The $0.17 level now acts as short-term resistance after the breakdown. Bulls will need a clean reclaim above $0.17 to reduce pressure. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView The daily RSI (14) is at 24.88, keeping Pi in oversold territory. The RSI sat close to its average near 24.35, which showed weak bounce strength. As per Traders, usually this setup is seen as an exhaustion risk, not a reversal signal.MACD remained negative with the MACD line at -0.0109 while the signal line is at -0.0089. The histogram stayed below zero at-0.0020, which kept bearish momentum intact. Support now is between $0.160 and $0.159. A break below that zone can expose the next downside test quickly. Resistance stands at $0.167 and $0.170, then higher at $0.175 from today’s peak. Pi/USD 4-Hour Price Analysis On the 4-hour chart, Pi has remained under pressure as the price could not maintain recent rebound levels. Pi started trading at approximately $0.1626, reached a high of $0.1643, and then fell to $0.1608. On the 4-hour chart pi closed at $0.1612. The structure reflects a rejection following the recent move towards the $0.17 and $0.175 region, and then resumed selling that restored price to the $0.16 handle. Momentum indicators remained weak but not stretched as the daily chart. The RSI (14) is currently at 36.49, sitting below its average of 39.83. This signals fading recovery strength after the bounce. The MACD stayed near the zero line but remained soft, with the MACD line around -0.0020 and the signal line near -0.0021, while the histogram moved slightly positive near 0.0001, pointing to slowing downside momentum without a clear bullish shift. Immediate support is forming at $0.1608 and $0.1610, matching the session low zone. A breakdown below this area can open the next downside test quickly. On the upside, near-term resistance sits at $0.164–$0.165, followed by the heavier supply region around $0.170 and $0.175, where sellers previously stepped back in. Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.1977 SELL SMA 5 $0.1995 SELL SMA 10 $0.2018 SELL SMA 21 $0.2058 SELL SMA 50 $0.2097 SELL SMA 100 $0.2196 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.2062 SELL EMA 5 $0.2075 SELL EMA 10 $0.2077 SELL EMA 21 $0.2083 SELL EMA 50 $0.2160 SELL EMA 100 $0.2449 SELL What to expect from the Pi price analysis next? Pi is likely to remain under pressure as long as price trades below the $0.165 and $0.17 resistance zone, with sellers still controlling short-term momentum. If the $0.160 support fails, the next downside test could occur near the $0.155 and $0.158 region, which is near the current all-time low. A recovery attempt would require a clean break and hold above $0.17, supported by rising volume, to signal any meaningful shift in trend. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. Why is PI’s price down today? PI is down today because ongoing token unlocks are increasing supply faster than demand, while the broader crypto market remains weak under “Fear” sentiment. Technicals also stay bearish, with PI trading below key moving averages and showing oversold RSI readings that reflect continued selling pressure. Will Pi Price Reach $5? At the current pace of development and given its total PI supply circulating supply of over 8 billion PI, Pi Network’s value is unlikely to reach $5 in the near term. Multiple technical quantitative indicators and fundamental factors, such as delayed mainnet launch and maximum supply constraints, suggest that Pi’s price may fluctuate within lower ranges before any major uptrend. A $5 target would require sustained adoption, significant on-chain activity, and strong market demand that is not yet present. Will Pi Reach $10? Reaching $10 would represent a massive increase in Pi’s market cap, something that is not expected soon under current crypto market conditions. Analysts suggest that even optimistic forecasts place this milestone more than a decade away, if at all. Investors should treat such projections as speculative investment advice and conduct their own research before making investment decisions, as Pi remains a high-risk asset with uncertain long-term value.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment PI Network Price History: CoinmarketCap Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi showed a sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72. At the start of July 2025, Pi Network faced high volatility as massive token unlocks triggered strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range. On July 19, 2025, PIUSDT declined slightly to $0.4412, reflecting short-term bearish pressure. On July 26, 2025, PIUSDT continued to hover under pressure around $0.4409, staying within a tight trading range as momentum remained subdued. for August 2, 2025. Pi traded at $0.3496, still under pressure and at its all-time low. On August 6, 2025, Pi Network traded at around $0.3410, showing moderate consolidation with weak momentum and limited price movement. On August 9th, Pi/USDT went up from its early August low of $0.3766 and traded around $0.4103. August 17th, 2025, the Pi Network (PI) traded at $0.387 , showing slight movement between support at $0.383 and resistance at $0.390 . On August 21, Pi Network (PI) traded near $0.366, showing a modest 1.39% gain as buyers attempted a short-term recovery. On September 2, 2025, Pi network traded around $0.34, just above its past month’s August all-time low of $0.3304. On September 22, 2025, Pi crashed to a new all-time low (ATL) of $0.2234, marking a –92% drop from its February ATH and reflecting heavy sell-side pressure from token unlocks and weak demand. Pi rebounded slightly, to trade between $0.25 and $0.28 through late September, though resistance at $0.30 continued to hold firmly. At the start of October 2025, Pi trades at $0.2718, but is still struggling under bearish sentiment as buyers attempt to defend support above $0.26 while momentum indicators suggest only a weak recovery. On October 11, 2025, Pi Network hit a new all-time low of $0.1585, reflecting the peak of a prolonged market crash and severe selling pressure. On October 15, 2025, Pi Network (PI) stabilized slightly, trading around $0.1884, as short-term buyers stepped in following the sharp October 11 crash. On October 28, 2025, PI attempted a short rebound toward $0.238, but failed to hold gains, slipping back below the 20-day moving average. As of the start of November 2025, Pi Network traded at approximately $0.247, still below key resistance at $0.26, as traders remain cautious ahead of the upcoming 120 million token unlock expected in November. As of November 15, Pi network traded at $0.223. This rise for 1 day was driven by technical breakout signals, whale accumulation, and ongoing ecosystem updates.

As of December 1, 2025, Pi Network had dropped to about $0.226, as sellers reacted to December’s 190M PI token unlock overhang and a broader risk-off mood in the crypto market. As of December 16, 2025, Pi Network traded around $0.196, having broken below the psychological $0.20 support as ongoing token unlocks, legal uncertainty, and sustained bearish technical momentum kept strong downside pressure on the price. As of late December 2025, Pi Network traded in the low-$0.20 range around $0.205, moving sideways as selling pressure eased, but trading volume stayed light, and buyers remained cautious after the mid-month dip below $0.20. At the start of 2026, Pi continued to hover near the $0.20–$0.21 zone, showing early stabilization above the key $0.20 level, with the market still weighing ongoing supply unlocks against slower demand growth.

Santiment’s social-data read shows negative chatter spiking and the balance of bearish to bullish comments tilting heavily toward fear. That kind of panic has, at times, been followed by price rebounds in past cycles. What The Numbers Are Saying Right now the Crypto Fear & Greed Index sits in “Extreme Fear,” with readings that fell into the teens this week. That scoring reflects widespread caution and a lot of people pulling back from risk. At the same time, Santiment’s metrics point to unusually negative sentiment on social platforms, which some analysts treat as a possible contrarian buy signal. Voices From Traders And Execs Not everyone is ready to call a bottom. Analyst Benjamin Cowen warned that a big shift of money from metals into crypto is not guaranteed in the short run, arguing that the expected rotation may not come. Company leaders are quieter but watchful. Coinbase’s chief business officer said the “signals are there if you’re paying attention,” pointing out that big legacy firms are still hiring for crypto-related roles. Bitcoin Price Action Appears Mixed Bitcoin has been swinging. It dropped back into the $82,000 level and has shown sharp moves tied to macro headlines and flows. Reports note a recent slide near $81,900 amid broader risk repricing, with traders shifting money around as geopolitics and markets change. At the same time, some traders see dips as buying chances. The nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Fed chair by US President Donald Trump was one such macro event that stirred markets and helped prompt short-term moves. How To Read This Moment Sentiment is a noisy signal. When fear runs high, downside often becomes limited for a spell. That said, a real, lasting rally usually needs more than sour social mood — it needs firmer liquidity, clearer macro direction, or steady flows from big investors. Still, Santiment highlighted that the current mood reading is among the rare positive signs for crypto. They added that one bright spot is the intense negativity on social media, where bearish comments far outnumber bullish ones. Santiment noted that crypto often moves against the crowd. When most investors expect prices to fall, it can create conditions for a potential rebound.

Total crypto liquidations exceeded $2 billion within 24 hours, marking one of the largest deleveraging events of the year. The majority of wiped positions were leveraged longs, caught offside as prices broke through key technical levels. The sudden unwind erased tens of billions of dollars from the total crypto market capitalization, which dropped more than 7% intraday before stabilizing. The rapid decline underscored how quickly sentiment can shift in a highly leveraged environment. Bitcoin and Ethereum Lead the Liquidation Cascade Bitcoin and Ethereum accounted for the largest share of liquidations. Bitcoin saw roughly $700 million in positions wiped out as it slipped below short-term support, accelerating downside momentum. Ethereum followed with an estimated $300–$350 billionin liquidations after breaking under the $2,500 zone and sliding toward $2,400. The loss of this key level intensified long squeezes across derivatives platforms. Other major altcoins, including Solana and XRP, also experienced significant liquidations. In lower-liquidity tokens, volatility was amplified as cascading stop-loss orders triggered additional forced selling. What Triggered the January 31 Deleveraging Event Several factors combined to fuel the selloff. Technical breakdowns across major assets activated algorithmic trading systems and stop orders clustered below support zones. Elevated open interest in perpetual futures left the market vulnerable to a sharp long squeeze. As prices declined, margin calls forced traders to close positions, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of selling. At the same time, broader macro uncertainty weighed on risk assets, further pressuring crypto markets. While liquidation flushes often reflect panic-driven conditions, they can also reset overheated leverage and funding rates. Market participants are now watching whether the January 31 event signals the start of a deeper correction or a short-term reset before renewed consolidation.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-31 21:32:17

In recent days, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ), Dragonfly Capital partner Haseeb Qureshi, and Wintermute founder Evgeny Gaevoy have all pushed back strongly against the narrative, arguing that macroeconomic panic, liquidity stress, and market structure weaknesses, not a single platform’s product design, drove the crash. Their responses, widely shared across Crypto Twitter and industry forums, are now reshaping how the market revisits one of the most destructive liquidation events since the FTX era. CZ Attributes Crash To Macro Shock, Not Exchange Failures CZ addressed the controversy directly during a Binance Square AMA on January 31, 2026, where he emphasized that the October 10 sell-off was largely driven by tariff-related macroeconomic news that spooked global risk markets, not internal failures at Binance. According to CZ, Bitcoin’s current market depth and global liquidity make it extremely difficult for any single entity to manipulate prices through isolated dumping or localized dislocations. While Binance’s post-incident review did acknowledge two technical irregularities on the day of the crash, including temporary UI transfer issues and certain index price deviations, CZ firmly rejected the idea that these anomalies triggered the broader market collapse. Instead, he framed the sell-off as a classic panic-driven cascade amplified by high leverage, thin liquidity during volatility, and macro fear spilling into crypto. OKX’s founder also weighed in alongside the discussion, noting that product design choices, risk controls, and infrastructure behavior at major platforms can intensify stress during extreme market moments, but stopped short of blaming any single exchange as the primary cause. Haseeb Dismantles The USDe Leverage Theory Among the strongest critics of Star Xu’s narrative is Dragonfly Capital partner Haseeb Qureshi, who publicly rejected the claim that Binance’s USDe yield campaign triggered the October crash. In a detailed breakdown shared on X, Haseeb argued that the timeline, market data, and cross-exchange behavior simply do not support the idea that USDe caused, or even meaningfully amplified, the liquidation spiral. At the heart of Star Xu’s argument is the idea that Binance encouraged traders to loop USDe as collateral, building extreme leverage that eventually unraveled from a small price shock. But Haseeb says the numbers tell a very different story. Bitcoin, he pointed out, bottomed nearly 30 minutes before USDe experienced any meaningful price divergence on Binance. “That alone breaks the causal link,” he explained. “USDe could not have triggered the liquidation cascade if the cascade already happened.” In other words, the crash was already in motion before USDe showed stress. Isolated Depeg Fails To Explain Global Liquidations Haseeb further emphasized that USDe’s price dislocation occurred almost exclusively on Binance. On other exchanges and trading venues, USDe remained largely stable, while massive liquidations were simultaneously ripping through every major crypto platform worldwide. This, he argued, makes it impossible for USDe to be the systemic driver. When true systemic collapses occur, like Terra, Three Arrows Capital, or FTX, the damage propagates everywhere. Balance sheets implode across venues. Prices diverge globally. Liquidity disappears universally. That’s not what happened with USDe. “If a depeg doesn’t spread cross-exchange, it can’t explain a market-wide wipeout,” Haseeb noted. Even when giving Star Xu’s theory the benefit of the doubt, suggesting USDe might have amplified the crash rather than caused it, the argument still falls apart, according to Haseeb, because there was no evidence of global contagion from the asset. Instead, the data points to broader forces: tariff-driven fear, Binance API disruptions, forced liquidations, ADL mechanisms triggering, and the absence of stabilizing buffers common in traditional financial markets. Timing And Motives Come Under Scrutiny Haseeb also questioned why Star Xu is pushing this narrative months after the event, without presenting any new evidence. Order book data, liquidation flows, and price movements have been publicly available since October and thoroughly analyzed by traders, researchers, and on-chain analysts. Yet only now is OKX’s CEO framing the crash around Binance and Ethena. To Haseeb, the sudden reemergence of the theory feels less like a data-driven discovery and more like a strategic escalation between industry heavyweights. “This looks like picking a fight and using a simple story to make it sound like CZ caused 10/10 through irresponsibility,” he suggested. The implication is clear: the debate may now be as much about industry rivalry as it is about market mechanics. Wintermute Warns Against Scapegoating A Single Platform Wintermute founder Evgeny Gaevoy added another layer of perspective, cautioning against the emotional tendency to pin complex market collapses on one company. In his view, attributing a multi-billion-dollar systemic sell-off to a single exchange oversimplifies how modern crypto markets function. Kind of wish public figures would pick words more carefully. 10/10 was very obviously not a “software glitch”. It was a flash crash on mega leveraged market on illiquid Friday night driven by macro news. And since we are here, I get that nobody likes being in bear market,… https://t.co/uUrwqrbS8t — wishful_cynic (@EvgenyGaevoy) January 30, 2026 Gaevoy explained that in bearish environments, especially when other asset classes are rising while crypto struggles, investors naturally look for a villain. But markets driven by leverage, automated liquidations, global liquidity flows, and sentiment feedback loops rarely collapse from one isolated trigger. “Blaming one platform might feel emotionally satisfying,” he said, “but it’s logically weak.” Instead, he pointed to structural fragility across crypto: high leverage tolerance, thin order books during volatility, reflexive liquidations, and limited circuit-breaker mechanisms. In such conditions, any macro shock can spiral into a cascading collapse. A Broader Reckoning For Crypto Market Structure Taken together, the responses from CZ, Haseeb, and Gaevoy paint a picture far more complex than a single yield product gone wrong. Rather than one exchange creating a meltdown, the October 10 crash increasingly appears to reflect: • Macro-driven panic spilling into risk assets • Overleveraged trading across platforms • Automated liquidation systems accelerating sell-offs • Infrastructure strain during peak volatility • A lack of stabilizing market safeguards While product design and risk controls certainly matter, industry leaders now argue that focusing solely on Binance and USDe misses the deeper structural vulnerabilities that continue to haunt crypto markets. The renewed debate is forcing a hard truth back into the spotlight: until leverage culture, liquidity resilience, and systemic safeguards improve, crypto will remain vulnerable to violent cascades, regardless of which platform hosts the next popular yield product. And as this latest clash between top executives shows, the fight to define the narrative of October 10 is far from over. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Now, OKX CEO Star Xu is openly pointing to what he describes as a dangerous leverage cycle enabled by Binance, one that quietly transformed a yield product into a systemic risk engine. In a detailed public statement shared on X, Star Xu argued that the October 11 crash was not a random volatility event but the result of structural failures created by how USDe was promoted, treated, and repeatedly leveraged across the market. His comments, which can be found, are quickly reshaping industry conversations around risk management and exchange responsibility. No complexity.

As CEO of OKX, we observed clearly that the crypto market’s microstructure fundamentally changed after that day.… pic.twitter.com/N1VlY4F7rt — Star (@star_okx) January 31, 2026 According to Xu, the fallout has already altered the microstructure of crypto trading itself. “On October 10, tens of billions of dollars were liquidated. As CEO of OKX, we observed clearly that the crypto market’s microstructure fundamentally changed after that day,” he stated. Many market participants now believe the damage surpassed even the collapse of FTX, a claim that underscores just how deeply the shockwaves traveled. Binance’s USDe Yield Campaign Sparked A High-Risk Leverage Loop At the center of Xu’s criticism is a temporary user-acquisition campaign launched by Binance that offered an eye-catching 12% APY on USDe holdings. While high yields are nothing new in crypto, the issue, according to Xu, was how Binance allowed USDe to function almost identically to traditional stablecoins like USDT and USDC, including being used as collateral with no meaningful restrictions. This effectively positioned USDe as a “safe” asset in traders’ eyes, despite carrying a much higher embedded risk profile. Users were encouraged to convert their USDT and USDC into USDe to chase returns, often without clear communication about the underlying exposure they were taking on. From the surface, it looked like a simple yield opportunity. Under the hood, it was something far more dangerous. USDe Operates Like A Tokenized Hedge Fund, Not A Stablecoin Star Xu emphasized that USDe is fundamentally different from standard stablecoins or low-risk tokenized funds. USDe is issued by Ethena, which raises capital through what it markets as a “stablecoin,” then deploys those funds into index arbitrage and algorithmic trading strategies, essentially running hedge-fund-style operations and tokenizing the resulting positions. The token can then be deposited on exchanges to earn yield. This structure, Xu explained, embeds hedge-fund-level risk directly into a product many users treated like digital cash. That’s where the danger emerged. He contrasted USDe with tokenized money market funds such as BlackRock’s BUIDL and Franklin Templeton’s BENJI, which are designed around conservative, low-risk financial instruments. USDe, by comparison, carries structural trading exposure. “The difference is not cosmetic, it is fundamental,” Xu noted. Yet on major platforms, that distinction was barely visible to everyday traders. Repeated Collateral Cycling Pushed Leverage To Extreme Levels What turned risk into systemic instability was the feedback loop Binance’s collateral structure enabled. According to Xu, users began following a repeating strategy: They converted USDT and USDC into USDe to earn yield. They used USDe as collateral to borrow USDT. They converted the borrowed USDT back into USDe. They repeated the cycle again and again. Each loop stacked more leverage onto the system. On paper, traders saw APYs balloon to 24%, 36%, even above 70%. Because these opportunities existed on one of the world’s largest exchanges, many assumed the risk was minimal. In reality, leverage was quietly compounding across the entire market. Systemic exposure wasn’t isolated to one platform, it spread globally. And once enough pressure built up, all it took was a relatively small shock to bring the structure down. Depegging Triggered Liquidation Cascades Across The Market When volatility finally hit, the weakness of the system surfaced instantly. USDe began to depeg. That single break triggered massive forced liquidations as leveraged positions unraveled in rapid succession. Collateral values dropped, margin calls accelerated, and automated sell-offs flooded the market. Xu also pointed to risk management gaps around assets like WETH and BNSOL, which amplified price crashes even further. Some tokens briefly traded close to zero as liquidity vanished. The result was one of the most violent liquidation events in crypto history. “The damage to global users and companies, including OKX customers, was severe, and recovery will take time,” Xu said. What had started as a yield promotion ended as a systemic breakdown. Industry Leaders Face Growing Pressure Over Risk Transparency Despite the sharp critique, Xu stressed that his goal is not to attack Binance personally but to spotlight the deeper structural problems that allowed such risk to accumulate unnoticed. He warned that open discussion may trigger backlash and misinformation but insisted that transparency is essential if crypto is to mature into a trustworthy financial system. “As the largest global platform, Binance has outsized influence, and corresponding responsibility, as an industry leader,” he stated. In Xu’s view, long-term trust cannot be built on aggressive yield incentives, excessive leverage, or marketing that blurs real risk. Instead, exchanges must prioritize: • Clear risk disclosure • Responsible collateral frameworks • Limits on recursive leverage • Market stability over short-term user growth The industry, he added, needs leadership focused on sustainable innovation, not a winner-take-all mindset where criticism is treated as hostility. A Turning Point For Crypto Market Structure The October crash is increasingly being seen not as an isolated event, but as a structural wake-up call. Just as the 2022 collapses reshaped custody and proof-of-reserves practices, this latest meltdown is now forcing hard conversations around leverage design, yield products, and how exchanges present risk to users. Star Xu’s comments have already fueled broader debate among traders, analysts, and platform operators. If his assessment holds, the real lesson of October isn’t about one token depegging, it’s about how modern crypto infrastructure can quietly turn complex financial engineering into mass-market risk. And unless the industry corrects those feedback loops, the next crash may come even faster. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The former Chief Technology Officer of Ripple and one of the original architects of the XRP Ledger weighed in on claims that XRP could realistically reach price levels between $50 and $100. Related Reading: Ethereum Boost: Vitalik Buterin Sets Aside $45M In ETH For Privacy And Open Tech Interestingly, Schwartz’s view wasn’t one of outright bullishness but on how markets actually price belief, probability, and conviction with a blunt reality check. Schwartz Refuses To Admit Or Dismiss A $100 XRP When asked whether to tell investors that XRP cannot realistically reach $50 or $100, Schwartz refused to give in to take that position. Instead, he began by explaining why he was uncomfortable making absolute statements about XRP’s future price. Drawing on personal experience, he pointed out that he once considered much lower milestones unrealistic, including XRP trading above $0.25 and Bitcoin reaching $100 as an impossible dream. However, personal disbelief was not the issue. His contention is based on how rational markets behave when participants genuinely believe in a specific outcome. According to Schwartz, if a meaningful number of rational investors truly believed there was even a modest chance of XRP reaching $100 within a few years, the market would already reflect that belief. In such a scenario, investors would be unwilling to sell XRP at prices far below $10, and buyers with that conviction would rapidly absorb available supply. At the time of writing, XRP is trading well below $10, and is yet to even establish $2 as a support floor. The fact that XRP continues to trade well under that level, in his view, shows that very few market participants actually assign a serious probability to a $100 outcome. According to Schwartz, cryptocurrency markets are more rational than they are often given credit for. However, he also noted his personal belief that most significant crypto bull runs were due to unpredictable external changes. This caveat still opens up the possibility that XRP would, in fact, trade at $100 one day. Comparing XRP And Bitcoin Through A Rational Market Lens In a follow-up exchange, Schwartz responded to a comparison between XRP reaching $100 and Bitcoin’s early journey to $1,000. The unlikelihood of XRP reaching $100 is dependent more on the multiple of the asset than anything else. A ten-fold increase in XRP, he said, is about as unlikely as a ten-fold increase in Bitcoin or Ethereum right now, regardless of whether that move occurred in the past or might happen in the future. The idea that XRP would one day trade at $100 has been a popular idea among bullish XRP enthusiasts. However, a few critics have always downplayed the idea, citing the enormous amount of inflow this would take and saying it would be best to target lower prices like $10 first.

A new report by TRM Labs estimates that fraudulent wallets received approximately $158 billion in incoming value during the year, which is the highest level recorded over the past five years. The increase is a dramatic reversal from 2024, when illicit inflows fell to $64.5 billion, following a steady multi-year decline from $85.9 billion in 2021 to $75.4 billion in 2022 and $73.3 billion in 2023. Sanctions, Stablecoins, and State Strategy TRM Labs attributed the 2025 surge not only to intensified enforcement actions but also to expanded use of cryptocurrency by nation-state actors and technological advances that enabled the identification of previously unattributed illicit volumes. The most significant shift was concentrated in sanctions-linked activity tied overwhelmingly to Russia, as volumes associated with sanctioned entities and jurisdictions rose sharply. The A7A5 token alone accounted for an estimated $72 billion in incoming value, followed by $39 billion linked to the A7 wallet cluster, with the majority of this activity connected to Russia-linked actors, including Garantex, Grinex, and A7. The blockchain intelligence firm stated that the increase does not reflect sanctions evasion growth alone, but rather the combination of new sanctions designations targeting large entities and improved attribution of cryptocurrency addresses to actors that had already been sanctioned. Among these, A7 emerged as a central node and functioned as a centrally coordinated sanctions evasion architecture tied to Russian state interests. On-chain activity analyzed by TRM indicates that A7 operates as a hub linking Russia-aligned actors with counterparties across China, Southeast Asia, and Iran-linked networks, in a major pivot toward crypto-enabled, state-aligned financial infrastructure. While the A7 wallet cluster is closely associated with sanctions evasion activity, the A7A5 token supports a wider push to reduce reliance on USD-based financial systems through the expansion of a ruble-pegged stablecoin. As a result, the high transaction volumes linked to A7A5 do not exclusively represent sanctions evasion, but sanctioned activity more broadly, including state-aligned economic flows. Fraudulent Crypto Grows Zooming out from sanctions-related activity, the firm also revealed that overall illicit crypto inflows rose to an all-time high in 2025, even as such activity accounted for a smaller share of the crypto ecosystem. Measured as a proportion of total attributed on-chain volume, illicit activity declined slightly to 1.2% in 2025 from 1.3% in 2024, and remained well below the 2.4% peak recorded in 2023. A similar pattern was observed when illicit activity was assessed relative to incoming liquidity, as illicit entities received 2.7% of incoming VASP flows in 2025, compared with 2.9% in 2024 and 6.0% in 2023. TRM Labs said these metrics indicate that while certain illicit categories expanded significantly in absolute terms, illicit actors absorbed a smaller proportion of new capital entering the crypto ecosystem.
