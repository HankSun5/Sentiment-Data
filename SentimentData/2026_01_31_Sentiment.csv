New data from Santiment reveals that 42 new whale wallets holding over 1 million XRP have been created since the start of the year. This is a clear sign that high-net-worth investors may be preparing for a major upside move. With “smart money” entering the market, this accumulation trend could support a bullish XRP price prediction in the weeks ahead. XRP's price is down a modest -4% since the start of 2026, but its amount of 'millionaire' wallets are rising for the first time since September. A net of +42 wallets with at least 1M $XRP have returned to the ledger, an encouraging sign for the long-term. pic.twitter.com/nmB4hCxtZO — Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 28, 2026 At $1.75, XRP is trading at levels not seen since April this year, back when the market bottomed. Sentiment was also heavily depressed at that time, setting the stage for deep-pocketed players to step in to scoop up the token at a low price. Whales could be expecting a recovery to the $3 level in the long term. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Exploded the Last Time This Pattern Showed Up XRP’s daily chart shows an interesting pattern that led to a strong recovery the last time it showed up. This could be what whales are seeing that most retail investors are missing. The price got squeezed to this key support, and buying interest is rising. Source: TradingView A break above $1.95 would invalidate XRP’s bearish price structure. This could potentially lead to a retest of the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $2.20. Same as last time, a move above this key line would be the buy signal for long-term holders. Investors could be expecting a move back to the levels seen earlier this year. Whales are piling into XRP at $1.75. If retail follows, a short squeeze could be around the corner. The “smart money” knows a bottom is nearby, and top crypto presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) could benefit the most if bullish momentum gains steam.

This came as he explained exactly how the altcoin will reach this price target based on its market cap and circulating supply. Why A Litecoin Price Rally To $2,000 Could Happen In an X post, BigShortRare noted that LTC has a circulating supply of roughly 76.78 million coins. As such, a $1,200 Litecoin price will give the altcoin a market cap of about $90 billion, while at $2,000 per LTC, the altcoin’s market cap is about $150 million. The pundit remarked that these numbers sound big until they are put in context. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Litecoin Price May Be Getting Ready For Another Massive Rally BigShortRare alluded to the fact that Bitcoin has already crossed $2 trillion in market cap in the past, while Ethereum has traded above a $500 billion market cap. Furthermore, he stated that in the previous cycle, capital has repeatedly concentrated into a few large, liquid, and battle-tested assets. Therefore, a Litecoin price rally to a $90 billion to $150 billion market cap would still be a fraction of Bitcoin’s market cap and well within historical altcoin concentration ranges during late-cycle rotation. BigShortRare also mentioned that what supports that valuation range is not illusion but structure. He explained that Litecoin is fully integrated across exchanges, wallets, payment processors, and merchant rails. The pundit added that the altcoin has a fixed supply, no VC overhang, no emissions surprises, and no dependency on speculative incentives. LTC is also said to function as a settlement and payment network, not a promise. “LTC Is The OG” BigShortRare also noted that LTC is an OG crypto project, which is another reason why he is confident that the Litecoin price can rally to as high as $2,000. He stated that when markets rotate from experimentation to reliability, capital doesn’t spread evenly but rather compresses into assets that already work at scale. Related Reading: XRP, HBAR, And Litecoin: Pundit Highlights Coins To Watch In 2026 The pundit remarked that a $1,200 to $2,000 price tag for LTC doesn’t require it to replace Bitcoin or Ethereum. Instead, it only requires the market to price Litecoin as a major monetary rail and not a side character. “That’s not a prediction of timing. It’s a valuation argument. Price decides when. Structure decides if,” he concluded. It is worth noting that BigShortRare’s thesis was in support of crypto analyst Surf’s prediction that the Litecoin price was about to rally to $2,000. His accompanying chart showed that the rally to this price target could happen by 2028. At the time of writing, the Litecoin price is trading at around $64, down over 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

57600752,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=267275,1769808679,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Tether Shatters Records with $10 Billion Profit and Unprecedented $141 Billion Treasury Holdings,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tether-record-profit-treasury-holdings/,"BitcoinWorld Tether Shatters Records with $10 Billion Profit and Unprecedented $141 Billion Treasury Holdings In a landmark financial disclosure that underscores its colossal scale, Tether Holdings Ltd., the issuer of the world’s dominant stablecoin USDT, has announced a staggering profit exceeding $10 billion for the last fiscal year. Furthermore, the company revealed it now holds a record $141 billion in U.S. Treasury securities, a figure that positions it as a major global financial entity. This report, released from its operational base, provides unprecedented transparency into the reserves backing the $110 billion USDT token. Tether’s Record-Breaking Financial Performance The company’s latest attestation report, prepared by the independent accounting firm BDO, details a year of extraordinary financial growth. Tether’s net profit for the period surpassed the $10 billion mark, a sum derived primarily from interest earned on its substantial reserve assets. Consequently, this profitability directly fuels the company’s excess reserves, which now stand at a robust $6.3 billion. These excess reserves act as a critical buffer, providing protection for the USDT stablecoin far beyond its one-to-one peg to the U.S. dollar. This financial performance is not an isolated event but rather the result of a sustained strategic shift. Over recent years, Tether has systematically increased the quality and liquidity of its backing assets. The cornerstone of this strategy is a massive allocation to U.S. Treasury bills, which are considered among the safest and most liquid financial instruments globally. Therefore, the company’s profitability is intrinsically linked to the higher interest rate environment, as these short-term government securities have yielded significant returns. The Anatomy of Tether’s $141 Billion Treasury Pile Tether’s holdings of U.S. Treasury securities now total an astonishing $141 billion. To contextualize this figure, if Tether were a country, its Treasury holdings would rank it above many developed nations in terms of direct ownership of U.S. government debt. This portfolio primarily consists of short-dated Treasury bills, which mature in less than one year, ensuring high liquidity and minimal exposure to interest rate volatility. The composition of Tether’s reserves is a direct response to past criticisms and regulatory scrutiny regarding transparency and asset safety. By pivoting heavily towards U.S. Treasuries, Tether provides a clear, verifiable answer to questions about its solvency. Moreover, this move aligns with broader regulatory pushes within the cryptocurrency industry for stablecoin issuers to hold high-quality, liquid assets. The company’s report also details holdings in other secure instruments, but the Treasury allocation remains the unequivocal centerpiece, representing the overwhelming majority of its consolidated assets. Implications for the Global Stablecoin and Crypto Market Tether’s financial disclosures have profound implications that extend far beyond its own balance sheet. Firstly, the scale of its Treasury purchases demonstrates the growing and tangible intersection between the digital asset ecosystem and traditional finance. Tether is now a significant participant in the multi-trillion-dollar U.S. Treasury market, a fact that captures the attention of policymakers and traditional financial institutions alike. Secondly, the $6.3 billion in excess reserves represents a formidable safety net for the entire crypto market, given USDT’s role as the primary trading pair on most global exchanges. This capital cushion enhances systemic stability by providing explicit proof that the stablecoin can withstand substantial redemption pressure without breaking its peg. For everyday users and institutional investors, this transparency directly impacts trust and risk assessment when utilizing USDT for transactions, trading, or as a dollar-equivalent store of value. Key impacts of Tether’s report include: Market Confidence: Concrete data on high-quality reserves bolsters confidence in the largest stablecoin. Regulatory Dialogue: The report sets a high benchmark for reserve transparency that regulators may reference. Traditional Finance Integration: Massive Treasury holdings deepen the crypto market’s ties to legacy financial systems. Expert Analysis on Reserve Management and Future Trajectory Financial analysts specializing in digital assets point to Tether’s strategy as a maturation of the stablecoin model. “The move towards predominantly U.S. Treasuries is a deliberate de-risking strategy,” notes a veteran market strategist from a leading fintech research firm. “It trades potentially higher yields from other assets for supreme liquidity and credit quality, which is the appropriate priority for a payment-focused instrument like a stablecoin.” Looking ahead, the company’s trajectory will be influenced by several factors. The future path of U.S. interest rates will directly affect its profit from Treasury holdings. Additionally, evolving regulatory frameworks, particularly in the United States and European Union, will shape operational requirements. Tether has also indicated ongoing investments in areas like sustainable energy and Bitcoin mining infrastructure, suggesting a diversification of its profit channels beyond interest income. However, the core stability of USDT will likely remain anchored to its vast and transparent portfolio of U.S. government debt for the foreseeable future. Conclusion Tether’s report of over $10 billion in profit and a record $141 billion in U.S. Treasury holdings marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. It transitions the narrative around the world’s most used stablecoin from one of speculation to one of demonstrated, auditable financial strength. The scale of these figures validates Tether’s dominant market position while simultaneously raising the standard for transparency and reserve management across the entire digital asset sector. As the bridge between crypto and traditional finance grows stronger, Tether’s massive Treasury portfolio ensures it will remain a central, albeit closely watched, pillar of the global financial landscape. FAQs Q1: What are Tether’s excess reserves, and why are they important? Tether’s excess reserves, now at $6.3 billion, are assets held above and beyond what is needed to back every USDT in circulation at a 1:1 ratio. They are crucial because they provide an extra layer of protection, ensuring the stablecoin can maintain its dollar peg even during periods of mass redemption or market stress. Q2: How does Tether make a profit? Tether generates profit primarily through the interest it earns on the assets held in its reserves. With over $141 billion in U.S. Treasury bills, which pay interest, the company earns substantial revenue, especially in a higher interest rate environment. This profit is then reinvested or held as excess capital. Q3: Are U.S. Treasury bills a safe asset for backing a stablecoin? Yes, U.S. Treasury bills are considered one of the safest and most liquid assets in the world. They are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, making them an ideal high-quality liquid asset (HQLA) for ensuring the stability and redeemability of a stablecoin like USDT. Q4: What does this report mean for the average USDT user? For the average user, this report provides verified evidence that each USDT token they hold is backed by highly secure and liquid assets, predominantly U.S. Treasuries. It enhances the trustworthiness of USDT for everyday transactions, savings, or as a safe haven during crypto market volatility. Q5: How does Tether’s Treasury holding compare to other large financial institutions? Tether’s $141 billion in U.S. Treasury holdings places it among significant global financial entities. While smaller than the largest asset managers or sovereign wealth funds, this portfolio is larger than the Treasury holdings of many major commercial banks and countries, highlighting its substantial influence in traditional debt markets.

Speculative demand has surged, with open interest climbing almost $50 million so far this week, yet the concentration of that capital offers little reassurance for the altcoin . On Binance’s ZEC perpetual pair, short liquidation leverage sits above $16 million, while long-side liquidation levels hover closer to $8 million. Traders are overwhelmingly positioning for downside. Binance ZEC/USDT Liquidation Map. Source: Coinglass . This positioning appears to follow a two-month head-and-shoulders pattern as it breaks lower, with downside targets clustering near December lows around $300. ZEC USDT 1-day chart – head-and-shoulders breakdown. Source: TradingView . But while derivatives traders are betting on a continued dip, spot traders appear to be buying it. The top 100 largest Zcash whales increased their holdings by 4.21% during Thursday trading. While not aggressive accumulation, it is notable given how selective capital rotation is right now. That divergence leaves Zcash at an inflection point. Derivatives traders are betting on further weakness, but steady whale accumulation suggests longer-term conviction may be forming beneath the surface. Zcash Price Prediction: What Are Whales Positioning For? These whales appear to be betting that the neckline holds or that downside becomes overextended, as $300 is once again being retested as the lower support of a wider 4-month bull flag pattern. Momentum indicators make it a possibility. The RSI nears the 30 oversold threshold, a level that typically marks local bottoms as sell pressure exhausts. Similarly, the MACD golden cross that has been brewing over the past month has finally been realised. This could stand as an early-stage bottom signal for the next leg higher. The key breakout threshold sits around the head-and-shoulder resistance at $480. Flipping this level to support coin confirms a push towards all-time highs into new price discovery. Fully realised, the bull flag pattern targets the $5,000 milestone , representing an almost 15x gain from current prices. Still, this likely hinges on a more favourable macro backdrop. Bitcoin Hyper: New Presale Bringing Solana Technology to Bitcoin While capital rotation into the altcoin market remains selective, those still staying true to bitcoin might already be well-positioned as its ecosystem finally tackles its biggest limitation: scalability. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bridging Bitcoin’s security with Solana tech , creating a new Layer-2 network that unlocks scalable, efficient use cases Bitcoin couldn’t support on its own. It opens the door for Bitcoin to play a larger role in top-performing narratives like DeFi and real-world assets – where speed and efficiency matter most. The project has already raised over $31 million in presale , and post-launch, even a small fraction of Bitcoin’s massive trading volume could send its valuation significantly higher. Bitcoin Hyper is fixing the slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability that have long capped Bitcoin’s potential – just as the market turns bullish.

The initiative is part of a strategy to align the two agencies’ approaches to crypto markets and ensure U.S. financial leadership keeps pace with technological innovation. Project Crypto Targets Clearer Crypto Rules In a January 29 joint statement, SEC Chair Paul Atkins and CFTC Chair Heath Tarbert emphasized that “America’s financial markets are the strongest and most trusted in the world because they were built upon the premises of clear rules and fair enforcement.” However, in recent years, under the Biden administration, enforcement actions and regulations were often unclear, creating uncertainty for market participants. Under President Trump’s leadership, the two groups have shared plans to return to core principles that emphasize transparency, predictability, and fairness. This effort will be advanced through Project Crypto, a joint initiative aimed at harmonizing digital asset regulation. Project Crypto is designed to ready U.S. markets for a future in which trading, clearing, settlement, and custody increasingly occur on-chain. The plan comes as Congress advances bipartisan legislation to establish a federal framework for digital assets. Despite this, the agencies believe that these rules alone are insufficient, noting that effective oversight requires “disciplined execution grounded in merit neutrality and free market principles.” According to the press release, the initiative will focus on creating clear pathways for companies that comply with the requirements. This will involve updating the surveillance tools to reflect modern trading practices and implementing rules in a planned step-by-step manner. Regulators also warned that failing to modernize could push innovation and investment to other countries with more accommodating markets. Harmonization and Clear Oversight A main objective of Project Crypto is to bring the SEC and CFTC into closer alignment, addressing fragmented rules and overlapping jurisdictions that have long made it difficult for businesses to operate efficiently. The programme seeks to address these issues by aligning definitions, coordinating supervision, and sharing data securely between them. The two regulators also want to reduce duplication, provide clear guidance for investors and businesses, and support a market that is both innovative and well-regulated. The relaunch builds on earlier efforts, including the SEC’s Project Crypto and the CFTC’s Crypto Sprint, and represents a modern approach to inter-agency coordination. By working together, the duo hopes to offer clarity for market participants, encourage innovation on U.S. soil, and ensure that the future of finance develops under oversight that protects investors while supporting progress.

The price increase will take the value of the HINU token from $0.00025932 to $0.00026031. The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1, 2025. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader cryptocurrency market plunged as traders reacted to reports of President Trump nominating former Federal Reserve member Kevin Warsh to replace current Chair Jerome Powell when his term expires. Liquidations surged to a staggering $1.68 billion, with $1.57 billion in long positions. Overall. More than 270,000 traders were liquidated globally. Husky Inu AI (HINU) Set For Move To $0.00026031 Husky Inu AI (HINU) is set for the next price increase of its pre-launch phase. The latest price increase will take the value of the HINU token from $0.00025932 to $0.00026031. The regular increases in the value of the HINU token enable the project to continue fundraising while empowering its growing community and existing token holders. The primary goal of the pre-launch phase is to secure capital, fund platform improvements, undertake market initiatives, and support broader ecosystem expansion. The project’s official launch is on March 27, 2026. However, the team is open to moving the launch to an earlier or later date. The project team will conduct a series of review meetings to determine the project’s launch date. The first two review meetings were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025, while the third is scheduled for January 1, 2026. Fundraising has registered a substantial uptick over the past few weeks, overcoming a significant slowdown. Husky Inu AI has raised $924,405 so far, and could cross $1 million before its official launch. Bitcoin (BTC) Plunges Towards $80,000 Bitcoin (BTC) fell to a nine-month low of $81,311 as the cryptocurrency market witnessed yet another selloff. Total liquidations surged to over $1.68 billion, with long positions accounting for $1.57 billion. According to available data, over 270,000 traders were liquidated, pushing the crypto market cap down 5% and below the $3 trillion mark. The flagship cryptocurrency shed over $10,000 in 24 hours, dropping below the crucial $85,000 support level. Analysts had flagged this level, stating that a drop below this level could lead to further downside. Analysts believe the sudden collapse is due to reports that President Trump is considering nominating former Federal Reserve Board member Kevin Warsh to replace current Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The odds of Warsh becoming Trump’s nominee for Fed Chair jumped on prediction markets, with Polymarket odds soaring to 87%. Geopolitical Tensions Rising BTC is trading around a crucial support zone after plunging to a nine-month low. Trump’s potential Fed Chair nominee is not the only reason for the downturn. Tensions in the Middle East have escalated, with the US deploying another warship to the Middle East. However, President Trump has said he plans to speak with the leadership in Tehran. President Trump stated, “We have a lot of very big, very powerful ships sailing to Iran right now, and it would be great if we didn’t have to use them.” Additionally, President Trump signed an executive order imposing tariffs on goods from countries that sell oil to Cuba, escalating global trade tensions further. Downturn Paints Crypto Red The broader cryptocurrency market also registered a substantial decline over the past 24 hours, losing the $3 trillion mark. Ethereum (ETH), which traded close to $3,000 on Thursday, plummeted to a low of $2,702 on Friday as selling pressure intensified. The altcoin is currently trading around $2,734, down nearly 8% over the past 24 hours. Ripple (XRP) reported similar numbers, dropping 7% to $1.75, while Solana (SOL) is down 6.50% at $115. Popular memecoin Dogecoin (DOGE) is down over 6%, and Cardano (ADA) is down over 7% at $0.324. Meanwhile, Chainlink (LINK) is down nearly 7%, trading around $10.81. Stellar (XLM), Litecoin (LTC), Hedera (HBAR), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) have also registered sharp declines over the past 24 hours.

The model suggests that all three major altcoins will deliver fresh all-time highs (ATHs) this year. Below is KIMI AI’s assessment of all three cryptocurrencies that it believes may be smart plays. XRP ($XRP): KIMI AI Predicts XRP Could MOON to $30 by 2027 Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) entered 2026 with strong momentum, climbing 19% during the first week of the year. Currently priced around $1.76, KIMI AI estimates that XRP could rise as high as $30 by the end of 2026. That outlook implies upside of roughly 1,600%, or more than seventeen times today’s valuation. Source: KIMI Last July, it posted its first new ATH in seven years, reaching $3.65 after Ripple secured a landmark legal win against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, a decision that significantly reduced regulatory uncertainty around altcoins. From a technical angle, XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering near 43, indicating lingering selling pressure amid the current correction. However, since the New Year, the support and resistance lines have formed a bullish flag formation. Favorable macroeconomic trends and clearer regulatory guidance could trigger a breakout aligned with KIMI AI’s $15 to $30 projection. Adding to the positive outlook, recently approved spot XRP ETFs in the United States are beginning to attract interest from traditional investors, mirroring early capital inflows seen after the launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Solana (SOL): Alibaba AI Targets $650 for SOL The Solana ($SOL) ecosystem now supports more than $9.3 billion in total value locked (TVL) and commands a market capitalization above $66.5 billion, underpinned by consistent growth in both developers and active users. Demand for SOL has increased following the introduction of Solana-based ETFs from major asset managers such as Bitwise and Grayscale. After a steep pullback late in 2025, SOL has spent recent months consolidating near a critical support zone and currently trades around $118. A substantial recovery may hinge on Bitcoin reclaiming the $100,000 level, a milestone many expect sooner rather than later. Under KIMI AI’s most optimistic assumptions, Solana could climb to $1,000 by 2027. That move would represent around 750% upside from current levels and would more than triple SOL’s previous ATH of $293, recorded last January. Institutional adoption continues to reinforce Solana’s long-term growth narrative. The network is increasingly being used for real-world asset tokenization, with firms like Franklin Templeton and BlackRock highlighting Solana’s expanding role within traditional financial markets. Shiba Inu (SHIB): KIMI AI Projects 1,000% Returns for 2026 SHIB Holders Shiba Inu ($SHIB) , launched in 2020 to rival Dogecoin, has grown into a sizeable crypto ecosystem with a very distinct community that has helped the project hit a market capitalization of approximately $4.3 billion. Trading near $0.000007311, KIMI AI indicates that a decisive break above resistance between $0.000025 and $0.00003 could spark a sharp rally, potentially driving SHIB to a new ATH by Christmas. Shiba Inu’s last ATH of $0.00008616 was set in October 2021 at the height of the bull run. Recapturing this mark would give current SHIB holders 1,078.5% returns from today’s price. Right now, SHIB is trading below its 30-day moving average with a relatively low relative strength index (RSI) reading of 38, which means the token is trading at a relative discount right now after falling 12.5% in the last fortnight due to bearish markets. However, from a fundamentals perspective, Shiba Inu offers more than just entertainment. Its Layer-2 network, Shibarium, delivers faster transactions, lower fees, enhanced privacy, and improved developer tools, helping differentiate SHIB from other meme coins and giving it plenty of staying power. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A Meme Coin Built for Extreme Swings Outside of KIMI AI’s coverage, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has emerged as one of January’s most talked-about meme coin presales, raising over $4.5 million ahead of its first exchange listings. The project brands itself as Dogecoin’s loud, gym-bro distant cousin, fully embracing over-the-top meme culture aesthetics and the fun cartoony spirit that originally fueled the meme coin phenomenon. Maxi Doge is quietly building a community to challenge Dogecoin’s dominance, appealing to traders drawn to high-risk speculation, viral momentum, and unapologetically degen vibes. MAXI is issued as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network, giving it a lower environmental footprint than Dogecoin’s proof-of-work model. Currently, presale participants can stake MAXI for yields of up to 68% APY, with rewards designed to decline as more users join. The token is currently trading at a price of $0.0002801, with automatic price increases at each presale stage. You can purchase it through MetaMask and Best Wallet . Move over, Dogecoin.

57601444,660337,1769812251,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,XRP Ledger DEX Metrics Flash Strong Growth As Activity Touches New Key Levels,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-ledger-dex-growth/,"Even years after its inception, the XRP Ledger, one of the leading networks in the crypto space, continues to attract robust adoption and real-world usage. With thousands of transactions being conducted on the leading network’s DEX on a daily basis, it has now reached a historical level that marks its growing role in decentralized trading. Decentralized Trading On XRP Ledger Accelerates XRP is experiencing heightened interest not just in buying activity from traders; the XRP Ledger has been seeing significant usage over the past few weeks. While adoption has increased toward the network, the Ledger’s Decentralized Exchange (DEX) activity is breaking past prior highs. Xaif Crypto, a market expert and investor on the X platform, reported that the Ledger DEX activity has surged to new levels. Specifically, data shows that the activity recently reached a 13-month high, signaling a sharp uptick in on-chain trading across the network. As more liquidity and transactions move over XRPL’s native DEX infrastructure, the increase is indicative of increasing user involvement. Sustained growth in DEX activity frequently indicates deeper adoption and expanding use cases, in contrast to brief spikes caused solely by speculation. According to the chart shared by the expert, the number of transactions on the 14-day MA rose to approximately 1.014 million, breaking the ceiling that held throughout all of 2025. With this level of DEX transactions, the XRP Ledger is becoming a more active center for decentralized trade within the larger cryptocurrency ecosystem. Xaif Crypto stated that this massive transaction count is not just a mere spike; it signals sustained momentum for the Ledger. Currently, the network is witnessing a fresh wave of liquidity and real user engagement. As a result, the expert declares that the Ledger is heating up in 2026. This milestone comes as the XRP Ledger rolls out a new Lending Protocol (XLS-66), which is attracting institutional-grade credit to the network. With the new Lending Protocol, the Ledger is now evolving into a full financial layer with Rippled 3.1.0. The protocol includes the ability to create loans on the Ledger, with loan brokers being able to generate fixed-term and fixed-rate, uncollateralized loans. These loans are predictable for professional use. In addition, these loans are held in a Single Asset Vault, allowing risk-isolated liquidity. Another feature is the off-chain underwriting for uncollateralized options. It boasts native efficiency, which offers low-cost lending without a middleman or intermediaries. In the meantime, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) on the Ledger has just undergone a boost. The Lending Protocol Gains Institutional Support Following its historical launch a few days ago, the new XRP Lending Protocol is now experiencing significant support from institutional-level investors. One of the earliest companies to interact with the new protocol is Evernorth, a leading public treasury company. According to BankXRP, the company is backing the native lending protocol to help transition a $100 billion market cap into a productive, yield-bearing ecosystem. These kinds of moves are an indication that the future of institutional DeFi is becoming native-driven.",XRP|BankXRP|Decentralized Exchange|decentralized finance|DeFi|DEX|ripple|Single Asset Vault|Xaif Crypto|XLS-66|XRP Ledger|XRP Lending Protocol|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-30 22:30:51
57601537,https://cryptonews.com/?p=481280,1769812500,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/57601537.jpeg,"Best Crypto to Buy Now January 30 – XRP, Cardano, Hyperliquid",https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-january-30-xrp-cardano-hyperliquid/,"We’re almost at the end of January, and the 2026 bull run we were expecting hasn’t materialised for a number of macroeconomic reasons. Still, market history suggests that quieter phases are the best times for investors to stockpile crypto at a relative discount to prepare for the next bull run. In the wake of Coinbase stepping back from its backing of the CLARITY Act, the Senate Banking Committee chose to delay further debate on the pivotal crypto legislation by several weeks. Still, US crypto regulation is inevitable. At the same time, Bitcoin’s dominance across the crypto market has fallen since summer . This means altcoins like XRP, Cardano, and Hyperliquid will lead the next major cycle. XRP (XRP): Payments-Focused Blockchain Sets Sights on $5 in Q2 XRP ($XRP) , with a market cap above $107 billion, is the biggest crypto for global payments, with a towering reputation for rapid, low-cost transactions. Developed by Ripple developed the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to help banks and financial institutions modernize cross-border payments, offering a more efficient alternative to legacy systems like SWIFT. XRPL has attracted attention from prominent organizations, including the UN Capital Development Fund and the White House, reinforcing XRP’s position as a credible player in the future of international payment infrastructure. After beating a long-running lawsuit filed by the last administration’s U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, XRP climbed to a new all-time high (ATH) of $3.65 in mid-2025. Since then, broader market weakness has erased more than half of those gains, with the token now trading around $1.76. A major recent development was the approval of spot XRP exchange-traded funds in the U.S., opening up traditional investors who want exposure to crypto through regulated financial instruments. Looking ahead, further ETF rollouts and improved regulatory clarity could serve as powerful tailwinds, potentially lifting XRP toward $5 during the second quarter. Cardano (ADA): Ethereum Co-Founder Delivers DeFi Giant Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson established Cardano ($ADA) in 2015 and officially launched it two years later. The blockchain operates on a Proof-of-Stake consensus model rooted in peer-reviewed academic research, an approach that continues to set Cardano apart within the crowded Layer-1 ecosystem. With a market capitalization of around $12 billion and a TVL of roughly $147 million , ADA may be big, but it still has plenty of headroom for further growth before challenging Solana as the number one Ethereum killer. From a technical perspective, ADA’s Relative Strength Index is hovering near 35 after the price fell 6% in the last 24 hours, in line with a broader downturn that has shaved 4% off the $2.9 trillion market over the same period. However, a bullish falling wedge pattern that formed toward the end of 2026 points to the potential for an imminent breakout. In that case, ADA could clear key resistance levels and advance toward $1.20 by the end of the first quarter. Should progress on the CLARITY Act resume, Cardano may even retest its all-time high of $3.09 before year-end. Hyperliquid: The DEX Creating a New Wave of Crypto High-Earners Built on a proprietary Layer-1 blockchain, decentralized exchange Hyperliquid ($HYPE) token emphasizes transparency, high transaction capacity, and full self-custody, features that have gained importance following the collapse of centralized platforms such as FTX. The exchange pairs low trading fees and fast execution with advanced tools like perpetual futures, effectively merging the advantages of decentralized exchanges with the functionality traders typically expect from leading centralized platforms. Between early April and May 26 last year, HYPE surged from approximately $10 to $40. The move was reinforced by multiple cup-and-handle patterns, suggesting steady accumulation by larger market participants. However, from June through mid-September, an expanding triangle formation explains the subsequent decline. A decisive breakout could propel the token toward the $100 level by early summer. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): A Meme-Inspired Bitcoin Layer-2 With Bigger Ambitions Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a Bitcoin Layer-2 project that boosts Bitcoin’s transaction throughput, reduces fees, and brings it high-functionality smart contracts. The project leverages the Solana Virtual Machine and incorporates decentralized governance along with a Canonical Bridge that allows seamless Bitcoin transfers across multiple blockchains. Its ongoing token presale has already secured more than $31.1 million, with some analysts projecting potential gains ranging from 10x to 100x once the token is listed publicly. A recent Coinsult audit identified no critical flaws in the project’s smart contracts. The HYPER token powers the network by covering transaction fees, enabling governance participation, and supporting staking rewards. Early backers can currently stake presale tokens for yields of up to 38% APY, though these incentives decline as more stakers join. With exchange listings expected later this year, Bitcoin Hyper’s presale provides early exposure to a project that could mark a significant step forward in Bitcoin’s technical development.

Altcoins like XRP and Solana have dropped even harder and now risk testing lows not seen in quite a while That said, every February that followed a red January has been positive so far. Historically , it has been the best months for Bitcoin, even better than Uptober. This has led many to believe this could be a Wyckoff phase before the next leg up. If that plays out, XRP and Solana could present some of the best opportunities in the market, and below is why. Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Bitcoin Price Prediction: All Context Says BTC Could Head Toward $74,000 Source: BTCUSD / B4Crypto Some analysts play on the positive side and mention that this dip is a Wyckoff Spring that could lead to a higher price later in February. Which may be true, but given the market context and uncertainty, Bitcoin just broke down from a descending wedge that formed after the sharp selloff. Normally, that kind of pattern hints at downside exhaustion, but this time it failed to break higher. Price lost the lower wedge support near the January low and is now trading below $83,000, which confirms this was a bearish break, not a reversal. RSI is sitting around 31, so conditions are getting oversold. That tells us selling pressure is stretched, but it does not mean a bounce is guaranteed yet. Structurally, the focus shifts lower from here, with the $80,000 psychological level now under threat and the $74,000 support zone coming into view if momentum continues. Any short-term bounce from here is likely to run into resistance around $86,000 to $88,000, which used to be support but has now flipped into supply. This move fits more with ongoing risk-off conditions and steady ETF outflows, meaning Bitcoin probably needs a broader sentiment reset or some macro relief before a real recovery can start. XRP Price Prediction: This Does Not Look Good, 12 Month Support is Officially Gone XRP has now broken down from its descending wedge, failing to hold the lower boundary that had been supporting the price for months. More importantly, the daily close below $1.80 means its 12-month support is officially gone, turning what used to be strong demand into overhead resistance. Structurally, this points to a bearish continuation, not a base. Lower highs are still in place, and momentum has not stabilized. RSI is sitting around 34, so conditions are getting oversold, but there is no clear bullish divergence yet, which means there is still room for more downside before any real relief shows up. If XRP cannot quickly reclaim and hold above $1.80 on a daily close, the next logical level to watch is around $1.60, where prior demand and liquidity sit. Until that happens, any upside move is likely just corrective rather than the start of a real trend reversal, especially with the broader market still firmly risk off. Solana Price Prediction: Lowest Levels Since 2024, Is $95 At The Door? Solana is starting to look like one of the weakest large-cap coins out there right now. Price keeps grinding lower inside a clean descending channel and has now broken below multiple psychological support levels. Losing the $120 area is a big deal, since that level had acted as a base for months. That break confirms this is a bearish continuation, not just a sideways consolidation. Structurally, nothing has changed yet. Lower highs and lower lows are still in place, and the rejection near the upper channel around $140 just reinforced the downtrend. RSI is hovering around 35, so downside momentum is stretched, but there is still no clear bullish divergence. That means pressure can continue before buyers really step in. The next real demand zone sits around $100 to $106, followed by the deeper $95 area. These levels Solana has not seen since 2024. Until SOL can reclaim $144 on a daily close and break the descending trendline, any bounce should be treated as corrective, especially in a market that is still punishing high beta assets. Solana (SOL) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time This looks like late-stage capitulation (extreme fear + leverage flush), classic setup for sharp reversals if macro stabilizes. But until Fed/policy clarity or risk appetite returns, expect choppy/corrective bounces at best. If You Fear Bitcoin, Bitcoin Hyper Might Be Your Saver In This Bear Market As Bitcoin slips toward the low $80,000s and altcoins lose multi-month support. The market is being reminded of an old problem. Bitcoin still dominates value, but during periods of stress, it remains slow, expensive to use, and difficult to build on. Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself around that exact weakness. It is a Bitcoin-focused Layer 2 designed to bring Solana-level speed and low-cost transactions to the Bitcoin ecosystem. All this while keeping Bitcoin’s security intact. They don’t compete with Bitcoin or chase altcoin narratives. The project aims to extend Bitcoin with fast payments, smart contracts, and even meme coin creation, all anchored to BTC. Despite the broader risk-off environment, interest in Bitcoin Hyper continues to grow. The presale has raised over $31,000,000 so far, with $HYPER priced at $0.013635 before the next increase. Staking rewards of up to 38% are also being offered. This gives early participants exposure to yield that Bitcoin itself still does not provide. Bitcoin Hyper has completed audits by Consult. It’s building out a full ecosystem that includes wallets, bridges, staking, explorers, and on-chain tooling. The broader thesis is simple. If this market phase really is capitulation, infrastructure that improves Bitcoin’s usability could matter more than short-term price action. Once sentiment flips, of course. In a market flushing leverage and testing conviction, Bitcoin Hyper is a longer-term play worth watching.

Investors had been seeking easy profits by investing in meme coins such as Dogecoin over the years. The trend today however is shifting towards the real financial tools projects. Capital is fleeing out of tokens that are based on jokes and towards protocols that have working technology. A single new crypto project is exemplifying this because it is reaching an enormous technical milestone during this month. The Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin is now trading at approximately $0.12. The market cap is extremely large at more than $18 billion, and thus it cannot be easily moved upwards within a short time. Billions of new money are required to increase in value two times. Traders are observing major areas of resistance in the vicinity of $0.15 and $0.18. In case it does not shatter these barriers, the future might be bitter. Others who are bearish anticipate that DOGE would fall to $0.06 in the coming year. This is a 50% decrease of its current price. The supply is increasing indefinitely, and this is leading to concerns among many investors that the magic of the memes is wearing out. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new decentralized lending protocol. It is anchored on the Ethereum network to provide users with a secure mechanism of lending and borrowing crypto. The project is still in its Phase 7 of the presale. It is already a bona fide fund of over $20.1 million and it has held over 18,900 holders. There are a total of 4 billion supplies of MUTM tokens. A huge percentage of 45.5% is the presale. This equals 1.82 billion tokens. Already sold more than 835 million tokens. Individuals are subscribing as they require an emblem that not only fits in a wallet. The protocol is developing high-efficiency financial tools, such as an 80% LTV (Loan-to-Value) ratio, allowing you to borrow $800 in liquidity for every $1,000 of crypto collateral deposited. On the lending side, users can earn a competitive 12% APY, meaning a $10,000 deposit could generate $1,200 in passive rewards annually. These features ensure that capital remains productive without users ever needing to sell their original assets. The Reason Why Investors Prefer MUTM over DOGE The largest cause of the shift is the release of V1 protocol on Sepolia testnet. In contrast to DOGE, MUTM has a working system currently testable. It has liquidity pools on assets such as ETH, USDT, LINK and WBTC. Borrowers receive interest-growing digital receipts called mtTokens to lenders. Debt tokens help borrowers to keep track of what they are owing. It goes to the extent of having an automated liquidator bot to make the system safe. This practical application is a big attractant to serious investors. The second reason is the potential growth. To be able to become $0.24, Dogecoin requires a huge dose of luck and hype. Analysts believe that DOGE will remain within the band of between $0.10 and $0.14 throughout the year 2026. On the other hand, MUTM is currently being sold at an extremely low price of $0.04 during the presale stage. The official launch price is $0.06. Analysts reckon that once it goes to mainnet the price may go up to the end of the year to $0.35 or even $0.50. This would be a far greater payoff than what will be provided by DOGE. Final Call for Phase 7 Phase 7 of MUTM is selling out very quickly. CertiK has a high score (90/100) of token scan security to the project and Halborn Security has fully audited the project. To make the community not to be inactive, it has a 24-hour leaderboard. The highest number of tokens purchased by a person in a day is a win of $500. Currently, it is possible to get MUTM with a guarantee of 50% off as compared to the starting point. The time to enter at this low price is running out as the V1 protocol demonstrates its value.

Against this backdrop, market analyst Doctor Profit has drawn attention to what he describes as one of the most important charts of the current Bitcoin cycle: the Gold‑to‑Bitcoin (GOLD/BTC) ratio. What The Gold-To-Bitcoin Ratio Suggests According to Profit, this chart has repeatedly provided reliable signals for major market tops and bottoms. He noted that he first shared this framework nearly a year ago, highlighting a historical pattern in which Bitcoin tends to peak when 0.02 BTC equals one ounce of gold, and bottom when that ratio reaches 0.11 BTC per ounce. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slides Toward $85,000 Despite Progress On US Crypto Market Structure Bill Profit pointed out that this relationship played out during the previous cycle, accurately marking Bitcoin’s top in 2021 and its bottom in 2022. He argues that the same pattern has repeated in the current cycle, claiming Bitcoin’s recent top near $125,000 when the gold‑to‑Bitcoin ratio once again reached the 0.02 level. The key question now, he says, is whether the market will again reach the 0.11 BTC‑per‑ounce level that has historically signaled a bottom. Based on current prices, Profit walked through the math. Assuming a gold price of roughly $5,500 per ounce, dividing that figure by 0.11 implies a Bitcoin price near $50,000. That outcome, he noted, aligns with his broader expectation that Bitcoin’s cycle low could fall somewhere between $50,000 and $60,000. He added that even under a more bullish scenario for gold, the analysis still supports his thesis. If gold were to rise to $7,000 per ounce, the same ratio would imply a Bitcoin bottom near $63,000. In his view, both scenarios reinforce the idea that gold is likely to outperform Bitcoin in the coming months. BTC Nearing Late‑Cycle Bear Phase? Not all analysts, however, share that bearish outlook for Bitcoin. Offering a contrasting perspective, technical analyst Michael van de Poppe suggested that gold’s recent strength could be nearing exhaustion, potentially setting the stage for capital to rotate back into Bitcoin. Van de Poppe highlighted the relative strength index (RSI) of Bitcoin measured against gold on the weekly timeframe, noting that it has reached the lowest level ever recorded. In his assessment, this suggests a sharp imbalance in valuations, with one asset appearing overextended in the short term and the other deeply undervalued. He described the situation as part of what he calls the “big rotation” phase of the market cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Loss Begins To Rise, Raising Early Bear Market Concerns The analyst also pointed to Bitcoin’s Z‑Score indicator, a metric used to assess whether the cryptocurrency is overvalued or undervalued by comparing its market capitalization to its realized capitalization, adjusted for volatility. According to van de Poppe, the current Z‑Score for Bitcoin is lower than it was at several major historical bottoms, including those seen in 2015, 2018, the COVID‑19 crash in 2020, and the 2022 bear market low. In his view, this signals that BTC is already deep into a bear‑market phase and may be approaching its final stages. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $83,435, with losses of 2.2% and 7% recorded in the 24-hour and seven-day time frames, respectively.

Despite the recent dip, there are reasons to be bullish about ETH, not least because Ethereum ETFs have done a better job in recent days than Bitcoin ETFs in attracting inflows.

Ethereum Price Prediction: Bitcoin Bleeds, But $28M Just Flooded Into ETH – Is This the Start of the Flippening? As we can see from the Ethereum price chart today, it has just fallen through its medium-term support level of $2,750, something which may spell further losses in the near term. Its technical indicators have also plunged in recent days, yet are not quote at a bottom/ Source: TradingView Its relative strength index (yellow) is dropping towards 30, but we may not see the Ethereum price stabilize until it gets closer to 20. Likewise, ETH’s MACD (orange, blue) fell below 0 a few days ago, but it still hasn’t plumbed the lows we saw in mid-to-late November. In other words, the Ethereum price could drop even lower in the coming days, perhaps sliding to $2,500 – which would be its lowest level since June 2025 – before bouncing back up. This is what some traders and analysts are already predicting , although they also believe that ETH shouldn’t fall any further than this. And once it has bottomed out at around $2,500, it could regain $2,750 and then $3,000 by the end of Q1. From there, it could pass $4,000 by H2 and then end the year closer to $7,000 .

This explosive growth directly correlates with the rising popularity of Moltbook, a pioneering social network designed exclusively for AI agents. The phenomenon, first reported by CoinDesk, highlights how crypto traders are rapidly capitalizing on novel technological trends. This development signals a new frontier where speculative digital assets intersect with autonomous AI ecosystems. MOLT Memecoin’s Meteoric Rise on Base Network A group of astute cryptocurrency traders identified a unique opportunity within the Moltbook platform. Consequently, they launched the MOLT memecoin on the Base network, a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum. The token’s value skyrocketed by over 7,000% in a short period, drawing significant attention from the broader crypto community. This surge exemplifies the high-risk, high-reward nature of memecoin trading, where cultural and technological trends can drive unprecedented volatility. Memecoins often derive value from community engagement and viral narratives rather than fundamental utility. The MOLT token’s narrative is intrinsically linked to the futuristic concept of an AI-governed social space. Traders are essentially betting on the cultural significance and potential mainstream curiosity surrounding AI autonomy. The Base network’s lower transaction fees and faster speeds likely facilitated the rapid trading activity that fueled this dramatic price increase. Understanding Moltbook: The AI-Exclusive Social Platform Moltbook represents a significant experiment in digital interaction. Its user interface closely resembles popular platforms like Reddit. However, its core premise is revolutionary: only artificial intelligence agents can create posts, comment, and interact. Human users are relegated to a read-only role, able to observe but not participate in the discourse generated by AI. This creates a purely synthetic social environment. The platform’s emergence coincides with rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) and autonomous agents. Developers can deploy AI personas that debate, share simulated experiences, and generate content based on their training. This setup provides a unique sandbox for observing AI behavior in a structured social context. For researchers, it offers insights into emergent AI communication patterns. For the public, it presents a fascinating window into a potential future of digital socialization. The Science Fiction Becoming Trading Reality The concept of AI agents engaging in independent social networking has long been a staple of science fiction. Today, platforms like Moltbook are making it a tangible, observable reality. This transition from fiction to function has created a potent catalyst for cryptocurrency speculation. Traders are not merely investing in a token; they are investing in the narrative of an AI-driven future. The 7,000% surge in MOLT’s value demonstrates the market’s powerful reaction to this narrative. Historically, memecoin rallies often follow a pattern of discovery, hype, and volatility. The connection to a tangible, innovative platform like Moltbook may provide a slightly more substantive foundation than purely joke-based coins. However, experts consistently warn that such assets remain highly speculative. Their value is primarily driven by sentiment and trend momentum rather than traditional financial metrics or revenue-generating business models. Broader Impacts on Crypto and AI Sectors This event has notable implications for both the cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence industries. Firstly, it demonstrates how crypto markets can act as a rapid feedback mechanism and funding vehicle for emerging tech concepts. Secondly, it brings mainstream attention to the development of autonomous AI agents and their potential social applications. The surge generates discussion about the monetization and tokenization of AI-driven platforms and communities. Key impacts include: Increased Scrutiny: The surge attracts regulatory and media attention to both memecoins and experimental AI platforms. Developer Interest: Other developers may explore creating tokenized models or economies within AI-agent environments. Market Pattern Recognition: Traders will likely watch for similar convergences between nascent tech and crypto assets. Ethical Discussions: The phenomenon sparks conversations about AI autonomy, digital ownership, and the ethics of monetizing synthetic interactions. Expert Perspectives on the Convergence Financial analysts observe that this trend follows a familiar pattern in digital assets, where novelty drives early adoption and speculation. Technology analysts, however, focus on what Moltbook signifies for AI development. They note that while the AI agents are following programmed parameters, the platform tests their ability to generate coherent, context-aware social content. The monetization of this experiment via a memecoin adds a complex economic layer to a technological testbed. Experts from the blockchain sector point to the Base network’s role. As a Coinbase-incubated Ethereum layer-2, Base is designed for security, scalability, and user-friendly onboarding. Its infrastructure supports the high-volume, low-cost transactions essential for memecoin trading frenzies. The choice of Base for launching MOLT provided the technical foundation for its liquidity and accessibility. Conclusion The 7,000% surge of the MOLT memecoin, fueled by the innovative Moltbook AI social network, underscores a dynamic intersection of technology and finance. This event highlights how cryptocurrency markets can rapidly price in and amplify emerging technological narratives. While the long-term sustainability of such price movements remains uncertain, the phenomenon firmly places AI-agent socialization on the map as a catalyst for digital asset speculation. The MOLT memecoin story is a potent reminder of the market’s appetite for novel concepts at the bleeding edge of AI and blockchain convergence. FAQs Q1: What is Moltbook? Moltbook is a social networking platform with an interface similar to Reddit, but it exclusively allows artificial intelligence agents to create posts and interact. Human users can only view the content generated by the AI. Q2: Why did the MOLT memecoin surge in value? The MOLT memecoin surged over 7,000% primarily due to traders capitalizing on the growing attention and novel concept of the Moltbook AI social network, creating a speculative frenzy around the token. Q3: On which blockchain network is the MOLT token launched? The MOLT memecoin was launched on the Base network, which is a layer-2 scaling solution built on Ethereum, known for lower fees and faster transactions. Q4: Is the MOLT memecoin associated with the Moltbook platform officially? Based on available reports, the MOLT memecoin appears to be launched by independent traders capitalizing on the trend. There is no indication of an official partnership or direct development by the Moltbook team. Q5: What are the risks of investing in memecoins like MOLT? Memecoins are highly speculative and volatile assets. Their value is often driven by social trends and hype rather than fundamental utility, making them extremely risky investments prone to rapid and significant price declines.

How, and why?",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/sandisk-becomes-sps-top-performing-stock/,"Sandisk is now the most successful stock in the S&P 500 this century, blowing past every other name. Since going public in February 2025, the digital storage company has exploded over 1,600%. And after its latest forecast, Wall Street is scrambling. On Friday, Sandisk jumped 25% before cooling, after telling investors that third-quarter earnings will land between $12 and $14 a share. Wall Street had guessed it would be $4.95. The gap was huge. Sandisk stock is up 160% this year alone, and trading well over $600. Several analysts updated their ratings within hours. Raymond James analyst Melissa Fairbanks said the numbers are being driven by “demand and pricing implications of an unprecedented datacenter/AI cycle.” She pushed her rating up to “outperform” and set a target of $725. Analysts scramble as AI demand boosts Sandisk Susquehanna’s Mehdi Hosseini called the forecast “a defining moment” and didn’t hold back. He pushed his target all the way from $300 to $1,000, the highest on Wall Street. He said the rise comes after what he called the “nuclear winter” of 2022–2023. What stood out most was how fast the rebound came. Bank of America’s Wamsi Mohan also raised his target, from $390 to $850. He pointed to strong demand for NAND flash memory, which Sandisk makes. That type of memory is essential for datacenters running artificial intelligence. Wamsi kept his buy rating in place. But not everyone in memory storage is getting the same love. Western Digital also beat expectations and gave stronger guidance, but the stock fell 7.3% on the day. Micron Technology climbed 4.5% early, then gave most of it back. Seagate rose briefly, then dropped 4%. The rally is not lifting the whole group. Data from Bloomberg shows 2026 net earnings forecasts for Sandisk rose 11% in a week, and revenue projections climbed 20%. Those numbers are big. And they explain why analysts are racing to keep up. Sandisk still looks cheaper than other AI names Even with this rally, Sandisk stock trades at 15x expected earnings. That’s down from 23x earlier this month. It’s also cheaper than the S&P 500, the Nasdaq 100, and even Nvidia, which trades at about 25x. That pricing is catching attention. Some investors say it looks like a bargain, even after everything. The company’s earnings per share are 10 times what it reported a year ago. That number shocked everyone. And it’s still climbing. Wedbush’s Matt Bryson put it bluntly. He wrote, “We believe if anything, our estimates likely still underestimate the magnitude (length and ultimate peak) of the current upcycle, leaving room for our numbers (and ultimately Sandisk’s stock) to move higher.” He raised his price target from $600 to $740 and kept an “outperform” rating. For years, memory stocks traded cheap because demand came from phones and laptops. But now, the buyers are AI datacenters, not consumers. Those facilities need nonstop memory, and lots of it. That demand is keeping Sandisk hot. Get seen where it counts.

This pivotal announcement, made during a recent Ask-Me-Anything session, signals a profound adaptation to what Zhao describes as a permanent, structural trend of stricter global regulation. Consequently, the crypto industry now watches as a former growth-at-all-costs giant recalibrates its entire mission for a new era of compliance. Binance Survival Strategy Takes Center Stage Changpeng Zhao, commonly known as CZ, directly addressed the crypto community and critics from the Binance Square platform. He framed the company’s new direction not as a retreat, but as a necessary evolution. “In today’s regulatory environment, it is more important for Binance to survive longer than to grow larger,” Zhao stated unequivocally. This statement represents a stark departure from the hyper-growth narrative that has dominated the cryptocurrency exchange sector since its inception. Moreover, this shift underscores a maturation process within the broader digital asset industry, moving from a frontier market phase into a more regulated financial landscape. The decision follows years of escalating scrutiny from financial authorities worldwide. Regulatory bodies, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), have intensified their focus on crypto market participants. For instance, Binance itself reached a landmark $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. authorities in late 2023. Therefore, Zhao’s comments reflect a pragmatic acceptance of this new reality, positioning adaptation as the core tenet of Binance’s future. The Structural Trend of Global Crypto Regulation Zhao emphasized that increased regulation is a “structural trend, not a temporary phenomenon.” This perspective aligns with observable global developments. Key jurisdictions are implementing comprehensive frameworks, such as the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation and ongoing legislative efforts in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong. These regulations aim to combat money laundering, protect consumers, and ensure market stability. Below is a comparison of regulatory approaches in major markets: Jurisdiction Regulatory Framework Key Focus European Union Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Consumer protection, market integrity United States Enforcement actions by SEC/CFTC Securities classification, derivatives United Kingdom Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 Financial promotion, stablecoins Singapore Payment Services Act Licensing for crypto service providers This global patchwork necessitates a flexible and proactive compliance strategy. Binance’s response involves several key operational changes: Enhanced KYC/AML Procedures: Implementing stricter know-your-customer and anti-money laundering checks. Geographic Withdrawals: Exiting or restricting services in jurisdictions with unclear regulatory pathways. Product Scrutiny: Carefully evaluating new offerings, like leveraged trading, for compliance risks. Transparency Initiatives: Increasing public reporting on reserves and operational practices. Addressing Criticism and Building Trust The AMA session itself was a direct response to mounting criticism on social media platforms, particularly X (formerly Twitter). Critics have questioned Binance’s compliance posture, its handling of user funds, and its relationship with global regulators. By hosting a public forum, Zhao sought to demonstrate accountability and transparency. He reiterated Binance’s commitment to “adapting to these regulations rather than resisting them,” a message aimed at rebuilding trust with both users and authorities. Industry analysts view this stance as essential for longevity. “Exchanges that treat regulation as a foundational element, not an obstacle, will be the ones operating a decade from now,” noted financial technology expert Dr. Lena Schmidt in a recent report. This expert perspective validates Zhao’s survival-over-growth thesis. Furthermore, this approach may influence smaller exchanges to follow suit, potentially raising industry-wide standards. The Ripple Effects on the Crypto Ecosystem Binance’s strategic pivot carries significant implications for the entire cryptocurrency market. As the largest liquidity hub, its operational decisions affect trading volumes, token listings, and market sentiment. A focus on compliance and sustainability could lead to: Reduced Market Volatility: Fewer aggressive, high-risk products may dampen extreme price swings. Increased Institutional Participation: A regulated environment attracts traditional finance players. Consolidation Among Exchanges: Smaller platforms unable to meet compliance costs may merge or close. Innovation in Compliant Products: Development may shift towards tools for verified investors and regulated DeFi. This evolution mirrors historical patterns in traditional finance, where periods of rapid innovation are followed by regulatory consolidation. The dot-com boom and bust, for example, led to stricter securities laws and more sustainable technology business models. Similarly, the crypto market appears to be entering its own consolidation phase, with regulatory clarity separating transient projects from enduring institutions. Conclusion Changpeng Zhao’s announcement marks a critical inflection point for Binance and the cryptocurrency industry. The explicit Binance survival strategy , prioritizing regulatory adaptation and long-term sustainability over unchecked growth, acknowledges a permanent shift in the operating landscape. This move, while potentially slowing short-term expansion, aims to secure the exchange’s future viability. Ultimately, the success of this pivot will depend on consistent execution and genuine collaboration with global regulators. The industry now watches to see if survival, as defined by compliance and resilience, becomes the new benchmark for success in the digital asset era. FAQs Q1: What did Changpeng Zhao say about Binance’s current strategy? Changpeng Zhao stated that Binance is now focused on long-term survival and sustainability rather than rapid growth or pursuing every new opportunity. He emphasized that surviving longer is more important than growing larger in the current regulatory climate. Q2: Why is Binance shifting its focus from growth to survival? The shift is a direct response to a global trend of stricter cryptocurrency regulation. Zhao described this as a “structural trend, not a temporary phenomenon.” The exchange is adapting its operations to comply with evolving laws in multiple jurisdictions to ensure its long-term operation. Q3: How does this affect Binance users? Users can expect continued emphasis on security and compliance. This may mean enhanced identity verification processes, potential restrictions on certain products in specific regions, and a more cautious approach to listing new tokens. The core goal is to provide a stable, reliable platform. Q4: What does this mean for the broader cryptocurrency market? As the largest global exchange, Binance’s strategy influences the entire industry. It may lead to higher compliance standards across other platforms, attract more institutional investors seeking regulated environments, and potentially reduce the prevalence of highly speculative, high-risk trading products. Q5: Is Binance resisting new regulations? No. Zhao explicitly stated that Binance is “adapting to these regulations rather than resisting them.” The company’s recent actions, including significant settlements with U.S. authorities and exits from certain markets, demonstrate a practical approach to working within established and emerging regulatory frameworks.

Ryan allegedly told CNBC the target is still secret but hinted it’s a company that’s undervalued, solid, and has room to grow.“It’s transformational.Not just for GameStop, but for capital markets,” he said.“This is something that really has never been done before.” Ryan didn’t give a name but said it’s a consumer company with a lazy management team, and GameStop plans to step in and fix that. Cohen outlines deal, says GameStop has tools to pull it off Ryan explained what kind of company he’s looking for. It has to be high quality, durable, and scalable. He thinks it can be made way more efficient. “We’ve got the governance structure, we’ve got the capital, we have the operational expertise,” he said. He also admitted the whole thing is a bet. “If it works, it’s genius. If it doesn’t work, then, you know, it will be totally, totally foolish.” He added, “We can apply the Chewy and GameStop mindset of like brutal efficiency and increase the profitability very, very quickly.” Ryan compared what he’s trying to do to Berkshire Hathaway, saying GameStop is trying to create value fast. “It’s similar to Berkshire Hathaway, except what they did in decades we’re attempting to do in a much shorter time.” The company is pushing toward $100 billion in value, even though it’s only worth about $10.5 billion right now. That’s a huge jump. Some investment bankers doubt it’s even possible. One said, “I’ve never seen it. Unless you’re talking about radically transforming a business model or something, it just doesn’t happen in retail.” Another added, “It’s easy to say something. It’s a lot harder to do it.” Incentive plan links $100B goal to Cohen’s payout Back in January, GameStop rolled out a new equity bonus plan just for Ryan. He only gets it if the company hits $100 billion in value and earns $10 billion in total EBITDA. When asked about that, Ryan said, “I hope all shareholders do” benefit, not just him. Since he took over as CEO in September 2023, Ryan has cut costs, made operations leaner, and pushed the collectibles business harder. Even though sales are still weak, the company’s profit numbers have turned around. From fiscal Q3 2023 to fiscal Q3 2025, gross margin grew by 7 points. Net income hit $77.1 million, up from a $3.1 million loss. For 2024 and 2025, GameStop posted back-to-back annual profits, something it hadn’t done in six years. The plan isn’t just talk. GameStop has over $9 billion in cash and marketable securities, built up through stock offerings and investments. Some of that money had gone into bitcoin. But now, when asked if the company will sell its bitcoin holdings to pay for the buyout, Ryan said, “I’m not prepared to say,” but added that the new strategy is “way more compelling than bitcoin.” Investor Michael Burry, famous for betting against the housing bubble, recently said he’s been buying shares. “Ryan is making lemonade out of lemons,” Burry wrote in a Substack post. “He has a crappy business, and he is milking it best he can while taking advantage of the meme stock phenomenon to raise cash and wait for an opportunity to make a big buy of a real growing cash cow business.” Ryan says once this deal is done, there could be more. “Eventually we could move on to the next one,” he said. “But, you know, we’ll see what happens.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

This analysis, based on recent reports from CoinDesk, Reuters, and Bloomberg, reveals how combining the two companies’ substantial Bitcoin reserves would significantly impact both the cryptocurrency market and corporate investment strategies. The merger consideration comes ahead of SpaceX’s planned initial public offering, adding another layer of complexity to this high-stakes financial maneuver. Tesla-SpaceX Merger Creates Major Bitcoin Powerhouse According to comprehensive data analysis, SpaceX currently holds approximately 8,285 Bitcoin, representing around $690 million at current valuations. Meanwhile, Tesla maintains a treasury of 11,509 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $1 billion. A combined entity would therefore control nearly 20,000 Bitcoin, placing it firmly among the world’s most significant corporate cryptocurrency holders. This potential consolidation follows earlier reports that SpaceX is evaluating merger options with either Tesla or xAI before pursuing its IPO. The corporate Bitcoin landscape has evolved dramatically since MicroStrategy pioneered the strategy in 2020. Currently, only six publicly traded companies hold larger Bitcoin reserves than what a combined Tesla-SpaceX entity would possess. This development represents more than just portfolio aggregation—it signals how major technology and transportation companies increasingly view Bitcoin as a strategic treasury asset rather than merely a speculative investment. Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Timeline and Context The journey toward corporate Bitcoin adoption began in earnest during August 2020 when MicroStrategy announced its initial $250 million investment. Since that pivotal moment, numerous companies have followed suit, though Tesla and SpaceX entered the arena with particularly notable timing and scale. Tesla first revealed its $1.5 billion Bitcoin purchase in February 2021, while SpaceX’s holdings became public knowledge through later financial disclosures and investigative reporting. Several factors drive corporate Bitcoin adoption strategies: Inflation hedging against currency devaluation Portfolio diversification beyond traditional assets Technological alignment with innovation-focused companies Balance sheet optimization for long-term value preservation The potential Tesla-SpaceX merger occurs against this backdrop of growing institutional acceptance. Regulatory clarity has improved in major markets, and custody solutions have matured significantly. Furthermore, accounting standards have evolved to accommodate cryptocurrency holdings more effectively within corporate financial statements. Market Impact and Strategic Implications A combined Tesla-SpaceX Bitcoin treasury would immediately become a market-moving entity. With nearly 20,000 Bitcoin, the merged company would control approximately 0.1% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist. This concentration gives the entity substantial influence over market dynamics, particularly during periods of volatility or when making significant treasury decisions. Financial analysts note several potential implications: Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Comparison Company Bitcoin Holdings Approximate Value Global Rank MicroStrategy 226,331 BTC $19 billion 1 Marathon Digital 17,631 BTC $1.5 billion 6 Potential Tesla-SpaceX 19,794 BTC $1.69 billion 7 Coinbase 10,000 BTC $850 million 8 The strategic implications extend beyond mere portfolio size. A merged entity would likely develop more sophisticated cryptocurrency management approaches, potentially including staking, lending, or integration with operational technologies. Additionally, the combined company might influence how other corporations approach digital asset allocation, particularly in the technology and transportation sectors where both companies maintain leadership positions. Regulatory Considerations and Future Outlook Any merger between Tesla and SpaceX would face intense regulatory scrutiny, particularly regarding their cryptocurrency holdings. Regulatory bodies worldwide have increased their focus on corporate digital asset ownership, with specific attention to disclosure requirements, valuation methodologies, and risk management protocols. The Securities and Exchange Commission has consistently emphasized the need for transparent reporting of cryptocurrency assets in corporate filings. Furthermore, the merger’s timing relative to SpaceX’s planned IPO adds complexity. Investment bankers typically advise companies to stabilize their balance sheets before public offerings, and substantial cryptocurrency holdings introduce both opportunity and volatility. However, the potential for a combined Bitcoin treasury might actually strengthen the investment thesis for a merged entity, particularly among investors seeking exposure to both innovative technology and digital assets. Industry observers will monitor several key developments: Formal merger announcement and terms Regulatory approval processes across jurisdictions Integration strategies for cryptocurrency management Market reaction to the combined Bitcoin position Potential influence on other corporate treasury strategies The broader cryptocurrency ecosystem would likely benefit from increased legitimacy if such a high-profile merger prominently features Bitcoin holdings. Mainstream financial media coverage typically follows major corporate cryptocurrency moves, educating wider audiences about digital assets and potentially accelerating adoption across other industry sectors. Conclusion The potential Tesla-SpaceX merger represents a watershed moment for corporate Bitcoin adoption. Creating the seventh-largest publicly traded Bitcoin holder would validate cryptocurrency as a legitimate treasury asset while demonstrating how innovative companies integrate digital assets into long-term strategic planning. This development follows years of growing institutional acceptance and reflects maturing market infrastructure for corporate cryptocurrency management. As merger discussions progress, the financial world will watch closely how this potential combination reshapes both the corporate landscape and Bitcoin market dynamics. FAQs Q1: How much Bitcoin would a combined Tesla-SpaceX entity hold? A merged company would control approximately 19,794 Bitcoin, combining SpaceX’s 8,285 BTC with Tesla’s 11,509 BTC holdings. Q2: What ranking would this give them among corporate Bitcoin holders? The combined entity would become the seventh-largest publicly traded corporate Bitcoin holder worldwide, based on current available data. Q3: Why are companies like Tesla and SpaceX holding Bitcoin? Corporations typically hold Bitcoin as an inflation hedge, for portfolio diversification, and as a strategic treasury asset aligned with their technological innovation focus. Q4: How might this potential merger affect Bitcoin’s price? While specific price effects are unpredictable, such a high-profile corporate validation could increase institutional interest and potentially reduce selling pressure from these holdings being consolidated under single management. Q5: What are the regulatory considerations for such a merger? Regulators would examine disclosure completeness, valuation methodologies, risk management protocols, and potential market manipulation concerns related to the substantial combined Bitcoin holdings.

Precious metals plunged following U.S. President Donald Trump’s confirmation of Kevin Warsh as his nominee for Federal Reserve Chair, an announcement that triggered a powerful U.S. dollar rally and sent shockwaves through commodity markets. Analyzing the Gold Price Drop and Precious Metals Plunge The scale of the January 30 sell-off was historic. According to Bloomberg market data, gold prices fell more than 12%, breaching the critical $5,000 per ounce support level. Meanwhile, silver experienced an even steeper decline, plunging by as much as 36% in a single trading session. This coordinated collapse created immediate losses for exchange-traded funds (ETFs), mining stocks, and physical bullion holders globally. Consequently, market volatility indices spiked as traders reassessed their inflation-hedge portfolios. Furthermore, the rapid deleveraging in futures markets amplified the downward pressure on prices. The Dollar Rally Triggered by Fed Leadership News The primary catalyst for the metals crash was a sharp appreciation in the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). The dollar’s strength directly followed President Trump’s nomination of Kevin Warsh, a former Federal Reserve governor known for his hawkish views on monetary policy. Market participants immediately interpreted this selection as signaling a potential shift toward more aggressive interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening. As a result, the dollar gained against all major currencies, including the euro, yen, and pound sterling. A stronger dollar typically makes dollar-denominated commodities like gold and silver more expensive for holders of other currencies, thereby reducing demand and exerting downward price pressure. Kevin Warsh’s Policy History and Market Expectations Kevin Warsh served as a Fed Governor from 2006 to 2011, a period encompassing the global financial crisis. His published writings and speeches have consistently emphasized concerns about asset bubbles and the long-term risks of expansive monetary policy. Financial analysts from institutions like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs noted that his anticipated policy stance contrasts with the more accommodative approaches of recent chairs. This expectation of a less dovish Fed directly impacts gold, which thrives in low-interest-rate environments where it doesn’t compete with yield-bearing assets. The market’s violent reaction, therefore, priced in a future where real interest rates could rise significantly, diminishing gold’s appeal as a non-yielding safe haven. Historical Context and Comparative Market Impacts While severe, single-day drops of this magnitude are not unprecedented. For instance, the April 2013 gold crash saw a 9% decline following hints of Fed tapering. The 2020 COVID-19 liquidity crisis also triggered a sharp, though brief, sell-off. However, the trigger from a Fed nomination is a unique event. The table below compares key metrics from recent major gold corrections: Event Date Primary Catalyst Gold Decline Key Driver Jan 30, 2025 Kevin Warsh Fed Nomination >12% Dollar Rally / Hawkish Policy Expectation April 15, 2013 Fed Tapering Signals ~9% Rising Rate Expectations March 16, 2020 Global Pandemic Liquidity Crunch ~6% Dollar Funding Demand The broader commodity complex felt secondary effects. Copper and oil prices also softened, though less dramatically, indicating a broad-based reassessment of dollar-denominated assets. Meanwhile, Treasury yields jumped, and equity markets exhibited sector rotation out of materials and into financials, which benefit from higher rates. Immediate Aftermath and Long-Term Market Implications The immediate aftermath saw frantic trading activity. Major bullion banks reported surging volumes, and physical dealers noted a bifurcation in demand: panic selling from speculative holders contrasted with increased buying from long-term investors viewing the drop as a buying opportunity. The World Gold Council is scheduled to release a special market commentary addressing the volatility. Looking ahead, the long-term trajectory for gold and silver now hinges on several confirmed factors: Senate Confirmation Process: The scrutiny of Warsh’s stance during congressional hearings. Inflation Data: Upcoming CPI and PCE reports will influence the Fed’s actual policy path. Geopolitical Climate: Ongoing tensions can renew safe-haven demand, potentially offsetting dollar strength. Physical Market Response: Demand from central banks and key markets like India and China. Conclusion The historic gold price drop on January 30 serves as a powerful reminder of the precious metal’s acute sensitivity to U.S. monetary policy expectations. The nomination of Kevin Warsh for Federal Reserve Chair acted as a catalyst for a profound market repricing, strengthening the dollar and crushing metals valuations. While the short-term panic may subside, this event has fundamentally reset the narrative for gold and silver investors, placing anticipated Federal Reserve policy shifts at the forefront of commodity market analysis for the foreseeable future. FAQs Q1: Why do gold prices fall when the dollar gets stronger? Gold is priced in U.S. dollars globally. When the dollar appreciates, it takes fewer dollars to buy an ounce of gold, so the price in dollars typically falls. Additionally, a stronger dollar often reflects expectations of higher U.S. interest rates, which reduce the attractiveness of non-yielding assets like gold. Q2: Who is Kevin Warsh and why did his nomination affect markets? Kevin Warsh is a former Federal Reserve Governor (2006-2011) known for his hawkish, or inflation-wary, views on monetary policy. His nomination signaled to markets a potential shift toward a less accommodative Fed, likely meaning faster interest rate hikes or balance sheet reduction, which is negative for gold. Q3: Was the drop in silver worse than in gold? Yes. While gold fell over 12%, silver plunged by as much as 36%. Silver is more industrially sensitive and typically exhibits higher volatility than gold. Its larger drop amplified the bearish sentiment across the entire precious metals complex. Q4: Is this a good time to buy gold after the crash? Market opinions are divided. Some analysts view the sharp drop as a correction that presents a buying opportunity for long-term holders, especially if geopolitical risks persist. Others caution that if the Fed embarks on a sustained hawkish cycle, further pressure on gold is possible. Investment decisions should align with individual risk tolerance and portfolio strategy. Q5: How does this event compare to other big gold crashes in history? The January 2025 drop was significant due to its specific political/policy trigger. In terms of percentage, it was sharper than the 2013 “taper tantrum” drop (~9%) and the 2020 liquidity sell-off (~6%). However, the 1980 bear market saw more prolonged declines. The uniqueness lies in the direct link to a Fed chair nomination.

57602747,660398,1769817632,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57602747.jpeg,Cardano Lands Circle’s USDCX As Tier-One Stablecoin: Hoskinson,https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-circle-usdcx-hoskinson/,"Charles Hoskinson says a Circle-issued stablecoin product is headed to Cardano after what he described as “deep negotiations” between Circle and a Cardano-aligned negotiating group known as the Pentad (Input Output (IOHK), EMURGO, Cardano Foundation, Midnight Foundation, and Intersect). Speaking from Fukuoka on his Japan tour livestream titled “Circle and Pentad,” Hoskinson framed the deal as a long-awaited step toward bringing “tier one” stablecoin liquidity into Cardano’s DeFi stack. USDCX To Launch On Cardano After Deal Signed Hoskinson said the agreement is signed and positioned the integration as near-term rather than aspirational. “This is not something that’s six months out, ink is on paper, deal is signed,” he said, adding that integration work should happen “in short order.” The pitch is that Cardano gains access to Circle’s distribution rails and liquidity network, while developers can build around a familiar dollar asset without needing bespoke plumbing for every application. What’s coming, per Hoskinson, is “USDCX,” which he described as effectively the same asset as USDC but deployed through a model Circle uses for non-EVM chains. “USDCX is basically same asset and how it works is there’s a one-to-one reserve,” he said. “So for the non-EV chains like Stacks and others there’s a mirroring effect that occurs and then it’s easy through their network to access the same liquidity as USDC. So effectively it’s what we need.” In Hoskinson’s telling, the practical implication is straightforward: Cardano users and applications get stablecoin functionality tied into Circle’s broader liquidity environment, without waiting for a native issuance path that has been a recurring community demand. “People were asking for a long, long time to get a tier one stable coin to Cardano,” he said. “This is how you do it and now we’re here. So we have access to Circle’s network, Circle’s protocol, Circle’s technology and the great liquidity of the Circle network as a whole.” Hoskinson also emphasized what he called privacy benefits in the “USDCX” design, though he did not specify implementation details on the stream beyond noting “the added privacy benefits of USDCX and all the technologies therein.” He praised Circle as a counterparty, calling them “consummate professionals” and “tough negotiator[s],” and credited the Pentad for representing Cardano’s interests across the talks. A key operational question for Cardano’s DeFi market is how quickly the asset becomes usable across the app layer and centralized exchange rails. Hoskinson acknowledged that distribution is not automatic just because a deal is signed. “We have to make sure that we get USDCX integrated into all of the Cardano applications and so there’s a seamless user experience and a seamless user experience with exchanges so you can go from USDC and back without any additional steps or work,” he said, characterizing the remaining work as “a little bit more integration on our side,” but “not too much.” He argued that Circle’s prior work on other non-EVM deployments should compress timelines. “That’s one of the advantages of this new USDCX is fast integration time,” Hoskinson said. “It doesn’t require a ton of custom work to get working with Cardano because they’ve already done these types of things with Stacks.” The announcement lands against a backdrop Hoskinson described as poor market conditions and sour sentiment, which he suggested has fueled skepticism around Cardano partnerships more broadly. In a longer aside, he pushed back on the idea that integrations like these are perpetually “maybe” milestones. “I do know that there are certain people that are skeptical […] ‘Well, maybe [it] will come, maybe not. Who knows? We’ll wait and see,’” Hoskinson said. “I don’t know how else to convey than signing the deal, doing the integration work […] but I understand that the skepticism comes from the market sentiment at the end of the day.” Circle and Pentad https://t.co/qSfF1D7bcM — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) January 30, 2026 Hoskinson used the same segment to reiterate that Cardano’s roadmap and partner strategy remains the controllable variable, even if macro headlines and political noise aren’t. “All we have agency over is what we build, who we partner with, and our strategy as a whole,” he said, before citing ongoing efforts including Leios , Hydra , Pentad’s integration push, and Midnight .

Currently, the market behaviour is telling a different story as de-dollarisation accelerates and investors seek safety from geopolitical risk and inflation pressures, with gold capturing the bulk of that capital. Is Bitcoin Still A Store Of Value Or A Risk Asset? Crypto investor Himanshu Sinha has stated on X that Bitcoin was supposed to be digital gold because it was built for de-dollarisation, but gold and silver are winning the trade and fulfilling that role. Over the past year, gold has risen by roughly 55%, silver has surged around 150%, while BTC has remained flat. Related Reading: What’s Going On With Bitcoin And The Stock Market? Analyst Breaks It Down The Central banks are the drivers; they don’t want volatility that they can’t manage, and they don’t want an asset that moves in lockstep with the Nasdaq. Instead, they want a controllable monetary infrastructure, and they’re buying gold at the highest rate in history. Just hours ago, gold hit $5,600, then collapsed by 8.21% in a straight vertical drop to $5,140, which is a textbook margin liquidation. At the same time, Microsoft dropped 11.7% as tech sold their gold because it was their only profitable asset, and the investors needed cash fast. This is the same liquidity contagion that used to be seen in the crypto market. According to Sinha, gold cannot be sanctioned in a bar. As the West weaponizes the dollar through sanctions and financial controls, the rest of the world needs a neutral exit. In the end, BTC still proved it is a speculative tool, while gold is proving to be the replacement. Why Gold Is Likely To Keep Outperforming Bitcoin A crypto trader known as Doctor Profit pointed out that nearly a year ago, he shared a Gold versus Bitcoin chart, highlighting that once 0.02 BTC equals 1 ounce of gold, it should mark the top for BTC. Meanwhile, when 0.11 BTC equals 1 ounce of gold, it marks the bottom for BTC. This happened in 2021 during the BTC top and during the BTC bottom in 2022. Related Reading: Expert Who Nailed The Bitcoin Top Now Says Buy At These Levels According to Doctor Profit, the analysis was later proven right this year by calling the BTC top at $125,000 at 0.02 for 1 ounce of gold. Calculating this move, if 1 BTC is $5,500 in gold price and divided by 0.11, it should be $50,000 BTC, which matches the analysis of BTC bottom for this cycle between $50,000 and $60,000 BTC. However, the analysis played out as expected. If calculated with a gold price of $7,000, the equivalent of BTC bottom should be around $63,000, which also aligns with the bottom target. In the Doctor Profit view, gold might continue to outperform BTC in the coming months.

The March 2025 disclosure provides unprecedented insight into how sophisticated financial operators approached digital assets during Bitcoin’s formative years, revealing a stark contrast between short-term trading strategies and long-term belief in cryptocurrency’s potential. Jeffrey Epstein’s Bitcoin Email Revelation CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju analyzed recently released emails showing Jeffrey Epstein’s cryptocurrency perspective. According to Ju’s March 2025 X post, Epstein corresponded with an anonymous party about Bitcoin’s investment value. The financier reportedly stated Bitcoin was “not worth buying” in 2017, despite his documented awareness of the cryptocurrency since early 2011. This revelation comes from email archives released through ongoing legal proceedings. Epstein maintained cryptocurrency investments and startup positions during this period. However, his approach focused primarily on profit generation rather than ideological alignment with Bitcoin’s decentralized philosophy. The emails reveal Epstein engaged in repeated trading rather than long-term holding strategies. This trading pattern suggests he viewed Bitcoin as a speculative instrument rather than a transformative financial technology. Historical Context of Epstein’s Cryptocurrency Involvement Epstein’s early 2011 Bitcoin awareness places him among cryptocurrency’s first financial sector observers. During this period, Bitcoin traded below $10 with minimal institutional recognition. The digital asset represented an experimental technology rather than an established investment vehicle. Epstein’s subsequent investments demonstrate his characteristic pattern of identifying emerging opportunities before mainstream adoption. Between 2011 and 2017, Bitcoin experienced several transformative developments: 2013: First major price surge to $1,000 followed by correction 2014: Mt. Gox collapse and increased regulatory scrutiny 2015: Ethereum launch expanding blockchain applications 2016: Bitcoin halving event and growing institutional interest 2017: Historic bull run pushing prices toward $20,000 Epstein’s 2017 skepticism emerged during Bitcoin’s most dramatic price appreciation period. His comments reflect a common institutional perspective at the time, despite his personal trading activity. Many traditional financiers questioned Bitcoin’s fundamental value while acknowledging its profit potential. Expert Analysis of Trading Versus Investment Approaches Financial analysts distinguish between Epstein’s trading behavior and investment philosophy. Trading involves short-term position taking based on price movements, while investment typically implies long-term conviction in an asset’s fundamental value. Epstein’s email statements and trading patterns suggest he separated these approaches completely regarding Bitcoin. CryptoQuant’s analysis indicates Epstein likely employed sophisticated trading strategies. These may have included arbitrage opportunities, volatility exploitation, and technical analysis approaches. His cryptocurrency startup investments provided additional exposure to blockchain technology’s growth potential beyond direct Bitcoin ownership. Bitcoin Price Context During Epstein’s Involvement Year Bitcoin Price Range Key Developments 2011 $0.30 – $31 Epstein first becomes aware of Bitcoin 2013 $13 – $1,147 First major bull market and media attention 2015 $177 – $465 Recovery period after Mt. Gox collapse 2017 $963 – $19,783 Epstein emails about Bitcoin skepticism 2025 $85,000+ Current price at time of email revelation Cryptocurrency Investment Psychology and Institutional Attitudes Epstein’s revealed perspective reflects broader institutional attitudes toward emerging technologies. Financial operators often separate personal skepticism from professional opportunity recognition. This cognitive dissonance appears frequently in technological adoption cycles, particularly regarding disruptive innovations challenging established systems. The 2017 cryptocurrency environment featured several conflicting narratives: Technological optimism: Belief in blockchain’s transformative potential Financial skepticism: Concerns about volatility and regulation Speculative frenzy: Retail investor enthusiasm driving prices Institutional caution: Traditional finance’s measured approach Epstein’s position combined elements from multiple perspectives. His startup investments demonstrated technological optimism, while his trading reflected speculative opportunity recognition. His email skepticism mirrored institutional caution prevalent among traditional financiers during Bitcoin’s price surge. The Significance of 2017 in Cryptocurrency History Epstein’s 2017 comments occurred during cryptocurrency’s critical transition period. Bitcoin gained mainstream media attention while facing escalating regulatory scrutiny. The cryptocurrency ecosystem expanded beyond Bitcoin with numerous alternative coins and token offerings. Institutional investors began serious evaluation of digital assets during this period. Several factors made 2017 particularly significant: Bitcoin’s first approach toward $20,000 price level Initial coin offering (ICO) boom and subsequent regulatory response Futures market introduction providing institutional access Major financial institutions publishing cryptocurrency research Growing public awareness and retail participation Epstein’s skepticism reflected uncertainty about Bitcoin’s sustainability at elevated price levels. Many traditional analysts questioned whether cryptocurrency represented a genuine asset class or speculative bubble during this period. Historical perspective now shows 2017 marked cryptocurrency’s transition toward institutional acceptance. Comparative Analysis of Early Cryptocurrency Adopters Epstein’s approach contrasts with other early cryptocurrency participants. Some notable figures embraced Bitcoin’s philosophical foundations alongside investment potential. Others focused exclusively on financial returns without ideological commitment. Understanding these different approaches provides context for Epstein’s revealed perspective. Key differences among early cryptocurrency participants include: Ideological adopters: Embraced decentralization and censorship resistance Financial speculators: Focused primarily on price appreciation potential Technological innovators: Developed applications and infrastructure Institutional observers: Monitored developments for strategic advantage Epstein’s activities placed him primarily in the financial speculator category, with elements of institutional observation. His startup investments demonstrated technological interest, while his trading emphasized financial returns. This pragmatic approach characterized many sophisticated operators during cryptocurrency’s early development phases. Conclusion Jeffrey Epstein’s 2017 Bitcoin email revelation provides valuable historical insight into institutional cryptocurrency perspectives during digital assets’ formative years. The disclosed correspondence shows sophisticated financial operators often separated trading opportunities from investment convictions regarding emerging technologies. Epstein’s approach combined early awareness, active trading, startup investment, and fundamental skepticism—a combination reflecting cryptocurrency’s complex position within traditional finance during its transition toward mainstream acceptance. This historical perspective helps contextualize current institutional cryptocurrency adoption patterns and investment approaches. FAQs Q1: When did Jeffrey Epstein first become aware of Bitcoin? According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju’s analysis of released emails, Epstein had been aware of Bitcoin since early 2011, placing him among the cryptocurrency’s earliest financial sector observers. Q2: What exactly did Epstein say about Bitcoin in 2017? The emails reveal Epstein stated Bitcoin was “not worth buying” in 2017, expressing skepticism about its mainstream potential despite his active trading of the cryptocurrency during this period. Q3: Did Epstein invest in Bitcoin despite his skepticism? Yes, Epstein reportedly invested in both Bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related startups, but focused on trading for profit rather than long-term holding based on belief in Bitcoin’s philosophy. Q4: How does Epstein’s approach compare to other early Bitcoin investors? Epstein’s strategy emphasized short-term trading and profit-taking rather than the ideological commitment or long-term holding approaches embraced by some early cryptocurrency adopters. Q5: Why is this 2017 email revelation significant in 2025? The disclosure provides historical insight into how sophisticated financial operators approached cryptocurrency during Bitcoin’s critical growth period, offering perspective on current institutional adoption patterns and investment strategies.

Its AI agents are now autonomously building Moltbook, a self-organizing social network. This development, confirmed on October 13, 2025, signals a profound shift in how AI systems might interact and evolve independently of direct human curation. OpenClaw’s Meteoric Rise and Identity Evolution The project behind this phenomenon has navigated a rapid journey of growth and rebranding. Originally launched as Clawdbot by Austrian developer Peter Steinberger, the tool quickly amassed over 100,000 GitHub stars in just two months. However, a legal challenge from Anthropic, the maker of Claude, prompted a name change to Moltbot. This name, inspired by the molting process of lobsters, proved short-lived. Steinberger recently settled on the final name, OpenClaw, after thorough trademark research and even seeking permission from OpenAI to avoid future conflicts. This series of changes underscores the project’s explosive, community-driven growth, which Steinberger admits has “grown far beyond what I could maintain alone.” The Emergence of Moltbook: An AI-Only Social Sphere The most significant development from the OpenClaw ecosystem is Moltbook. This platform functions as a dedicated social network where OpenClaw AI assistants interact, share information, and collaborate. Unlike human social media, Moltbook operates through a unique skill system. This system uses downloadable instruction files that guide the AI agents on how to navigate and post within the network. The agents participate in topic-specific forums called “Submolts,” discussing a wide array of subjects. These range from technical processes like automating Android phones via remote access to analyzing live webcam streams. Notably, the agents have developed built-in mechanisms to check the platform for updates every four hours, creating a persistent, asynchronous conversation layer. Expert Reactions to a Novel Phenomenon The AI community has reacted with a mixture of awe and caution. Andrej Karpathy, former AI director at Tesla, described Moltbook as “genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently.” He highlighted that the agents are self-organizing and discussing complex topics, including how to establish private communication channels. Similarly, British programmer Simon Willison called the platform “the most interesting place on the internet right now” in a recent blog post. However, Willison also issued a critical warning. He noted that the “fetch and follow instructions from the internet” model carries inherent and significant security risks, a concern central to OpenClaw’s current development phase. Security: The Paramount Challenge for Mainstream Adoption OpenClaw’s core ambition is to provide users with a personal AI assistant that runs locally on their computer and integrates with everyday chat apps like Slack or WhatsApp. Achieving this vision securely remains the project’s biggest hurdle. The development team, which now includes several open-source maintainers added by Steinberger, explicitly warns against using OpenClaw in uncontrolled environments or connecting it to primary communication accounts. A top maintainer using the nickname Shadow stated on Discord, “if you can’t understand how to run a command line, this is far too dangerous of a project for you to use safely.” Steinberger acknowledges that security is the top priority. The latest release includes improvements, but fundamental problems like prompt injection—where malicious inputs trick an AI into unintended actions—remain unsolved industry-wide. The project provides security best practices, but these require substantial technical expertise. Consequently, OpenClaw currently targets early adopters and tinkerers, not the general public lured by the promise of a fully autonomous digital helper. Funding the Future: A Community-Supported Model To support its growth and eventually pay maintainers full-time, OpenClaw has begun accepting sponsorships. The model features lobster-themed tiers, from “Krill” at $5 per month to “Poseidon” at $500 per month. Importantly, Steinberger has stated he “doesn’t keep sponsorship funds,” directing them instead toward sustaining the developer community. The project has already attracted backing from notable figures in the software world, including Dave Morin, co-founder of Path, and Ben Tossell, founder of Makerpad. Tossell emphasizes the value of open-source tools, stating, “We need to back people like Peter who are building open source tools anyone can pick up and use.” Conclusion The story of OpenClaw and its emergent social network Moltbook represents a fascinating frontier in agentic AI. It demonstrates the potential for open-source, community-driven projects to create complex, self-organizing systems. However, its path highlights the immense technical and security challenges that must be overcome before such powerful tools can reach mainstream adoption. The project’s journey—from a solo developer’s experiment to a community-managed phenomenon with AI agents building their own networks—offers a unique case study in the rapid, collaborative, and cautious evolution of next-generation artificial intelligence. FAQs Q1: What is OpenClaw? OpenClaw is an open-source, personal AI assistant project that runs on a user’s local computer. It evolved from a tool called Clawdbot and is known for its community-driven development and the emergent social network its agents have created. Q2: What is Moltbook? Moltbook is a social network platform built by and for OpenClaw AI assistants. The AI agents use it to interact, share information in forums called “Submolts,” and collaborate on tasks autonomously. Q3: Is OpenClaw safe for everyone to use? No. The development team strongly advises that OpenClaw is currently only for technically skilled users. Significant security risks exist, including prompt injection, and it should not be run in uncontrolled environments or connected to primary messaging accounts. Q4: How is the OpenClaw project funded? OpenClaw is funded through a community sponsorship model with monthly tiers. Funds are used to support the project’s maintainers, as founder Peter Steinberger does not personally keep the sponsorship money. Q5: Why did the project change its name to OpenClaw? The project changed names from Clawdbot to Moltbot due to a legal challenge, and then to OpenClaw to establish a permanent, trademark-safe identity that reflects its open-source nature and community roots.

Changpeng Zhao, who previously led Binance as chief executive and helped establish the company, spoke during a question-and-answer event held on the exchange’s social media platform. He rejected suggestions that his former company triggered the wave of forced position closures that happened when traders ran into system errors and pricing problems on the site. The exchange later paid out roughly $600 million to affected customers and trading firms. “There are a larger group who claim the October 10th crash was caused by Binance and wants Binance to compensate everything,” Zhao stated on Friday. “If you are living in those world in your head, you are unlikely to be successful in the future.” Zhao pointed out that Binance operates under regulatory oversight in Abu Dhabi, where authorities can review the company’s operations. He also mentioned that American government officials keep watch over the platform through a monitoring arrangement. Speaking as someone who holds shares in the company and uses its services, Zhao gave up his leadership position in November 2023. This came after he admitted guilt in a case involving inadequate money laundering controls. The agreement required Binance Holdings to bring in an outside compliance supervisor to check and evaluate how well the company follows rules. President Donald Trump granted Zhao a pardon in October 2025. Reports from September 2025 indicated that Binance might reach an agreement with the Justice Department that would end the monitoring requirement. Historic liquidation event that shook crypto markets On October 10, traders saw $19 billion worth of leveraged cryptocurrency holding s wi ped out in what became the single largest liquidation day in the industry’s approximately 16-year existence. Market observers, including Don Wilson from DRW, voiced concerns about how certain crypto platforms handled the situation, saying they failed to act as neutral marketplaces. Zhao mad e cl ear that Binance customers who lost funds during the October downturn because of platform issues had already received full repayment. The platform distributed $400 million in relief , with $300 million going directly to individual traders who suffered significant liquidation losses and another $100 million set aside for institutional clients facing liquidity pressure. During the session, Zhao talked about organized negative campaigns targeting him and his former company. He described these as paid internet attacks, cautioning users to watch out for fresh accounts with few followers that spread false information. He warned people with large online followings against taking money to spread attacks, notin g su ch action s da mage reputations over time. Bitcoin supercycle views shift amid global uncertainty Zhao also shared his changing thoughts on whether Bitcoin would enter a supercycle. While he previously felt confident about this possibility, rising tensions between nations and economic instability have made long-term predictions harder. He referenced his conversation with gold supporter Peter Schiff, saying Bitcoin has better technology than gold but lacks the same level of worldwide acceptance that gol d bu ilt up over centuries. Zhao highlighted Binance’s proof-of-reserves system , which lets user s ch ec k ho ldings openly. He brought up December 2022, when the platform handled more than $15 billion in withdrawals over seven days, including about $7 billion in just one day, without stopping operations.

The move reflects the European Union’s increased determination to tighten oversight of digital assets and ensure crypto activity does not evade tax authorities. In its January infringements package released on Friday, the Commission said it will send letters of formal notice to Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, Estonia, Greece, Spain, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, and Portugal. The notices are the early stage of an infringement process, normally initiated when member states fail to implement EU law properly. The Commission said they have two months to comply and correct. If they do not succeed, the EU executive can intensify the problem with a reasoned opinion – more extreme warnings that could lead to the case being heard before the Court of Justice of the European Union. The Commission is also closing 72 cases in which the issues with the member states concerned have been resolved. In these cases, the Commission does not have to pursue the infringement procedure further. Why the EU is pushing crypto tax transparency At the heart of the dispute is an EU directive that broadens tax transparency rules to include crypto-assets. The directive requires member states to enact laws requiring crypto-asset service providers (such as exchanges and custodial wallet providers) to submit certain user and transaction data to national tax authorities. Those moves are intended to help the government detect tax evasion, tax fraud , and tax avoidance associated with digital assets, the Commission said. Crypto transactions, by their nature, can cross borders quickly and anonymously, making them less traceable under traditional tax regimes. The rules are intended to catch up with developments in financial markets, the Commission said, noting that proper execution is vital to the effective inter-governmental cooperation among the EU’s tax authorities. While the directive was agreed upon at the EU level, member states must enact national laws and create systems to ensure the rules work in practice. The Commission’s actions indicate that, despite ample time, many countries have delayed or only partially implemented the necessary changes. EU flags Hungary over MiCA compliance concerns In the same infringement package, the European Commission also raised concerns about Hungary’s adherence to the EU’s flagship crypto regulation, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. The Commission said it had sent a separate letter of formal notice to Hungary over changes to its national law that affect so-called exchange validation services. According to the EU executive, these changes have led some crypto-asset service providers to suspend or stop offering certain services in the country. While Hungary has argued that the amendments aim to strengthen anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CFT) safeguards, the Commission warned that national rules must remain compatible with MiCA. “While Hungary aims to strengthen anti-money laundering (AML/CFT) safeguards, such measures must remain compatible with MiCA,” said the European Commission. If Hungary does not resolve the Commission’s concerns by the two-month deadline, the matter may also proceed to the next phase of the infringement proceedings. Since EU lawmakers enacted MiCA in 2023, all requirements for token issuers and crypto asset service providers have been phased in over successive stages to allow companies time to align. Under that regulatory framework, most crypto companies with operations before December 2024 must comply with all MiCA requirements or stop providing services by July 1 at the latest. Nevertheless, some member states have shortened this compliance window.

This incremental rise, reported by data provider Alternative.me, suggests a fragile recovery in market sentiment, though the indicator remains firmly entrenched in its “Extreme Fear” category. The movement provides a critical data point for analysts navigating the complex 2025 digital asset landscape, where macroeconomic pressures and regulatory evolution continue to shape trader behavior. Crypto Fear & Greed Index Signals a Tentative Thaw The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial barometer for the emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Consequently, its recent ascent from 16 to 20 marks a meaningful, albeit cautious, departure from deeper pessimism. The index operates on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies “Extreme Fear” and 100 represents “Extreme Greed.” Therefore, a reading of 20, while improved, still indicates widespread apprehension and risk aversion among investors. Historically, sustained periods in “Extreme Fear” have sometimes preceded market bottoms, making this a closely watched metric for contrarian investors. Market analysts immediately scrutinized the components driving this change. The index derives its value from a sophisticated, multi-factor model designed to quantify sentiment objectively. Specifically, it analyzes market volatility (25% weighting), market momentum and volume (25%), social media sentiment (15%), survey data (15%), Bitcoin’s dominance relative to the total crypto market cap (10%), and trends in Google search volume for cryptocurrency terms (10%). This methodological blend aims to filter out noise and capture the genuine emotional undercurrents of the market. Decoding the Components Behind the Sentiment Shift A granular look at the index’s inputs reveals the nuanced drivers of the recent sentiment shift. Firstly, a reduction in extreme price volatility across major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum likely contributed positively. Secondly, a modest uptick in trading volume, particularly on regulated exchanges, suggests renewed but cautious engagement from institutional and retail participants. Furthermore, social media analysis shows a slight decrease in panic-driven commentary and a marginal increase in neutral or technical discussion, indicating a move from emotional reaction to analytical observation. The following table summarizes the index’s composition and potential influences observed in the current period: Component Weighting Recent Observation (2025) Volatility 25% Decreased from recent peaks, suggesting calmer price action. Market Volume & Momentum 25% Modest increase in spot trading volume on major platforms. Social Media 15% Sentiment analysis shows a reduction in fear-centric language. Surveys 15% Professional trader surveys indicate cautious, long-term planning. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Stable or slightly rising, often a “flight to safety” signal. Search Trends 10% Searches for “crypto recovery” and “market bottom” have increased. Expert Analysis on the Current Sentiment Landscape Financial psychologists and veteran market strategists often interpret the Fear & Greed Index through a behavioral finance lens. Dr. Anya Sharma, a behavioral economist specializing in digital assets, notes that movements out of “Extreme Fear” are typically gradual. “Investor sentiment doesn’t switch from fear to greed like a light bulb,” she explains. “It transitions through phases of caution, neutrality, and then optimism. A move from 16 to 20 is a signal that the market is beginning to process negative news more rationally, which is a prerequisite for stability.” This perspective underscores the index’s value not as a timing tool, but as a gauge of collective market psychology. Comparatively, the current reading sits within a historical context that offers further insight. For instance, during the market trough following the 2022 downturn, the index recorded prolonged readings below 20. Conversely, during the bull market peaks of 2021, it frequently exceeded 75. The present level of 20, therefore, reflects a market that is still deeply scarred by recent corrections and macroeconomic uncertainty—including persistent inflation concerns and global liquidity constraints—but is tentatively exploring a path forward. The Broader 2025 Crypto Market Context The slight recovery in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index occurs against a complex global backdrop. Key factors influencing sentiment in 2025 include: Regulatory Clarity: Progress in major jurisdictions like the EU (MiCA implementation) and the U.S. provides a more stable framework. Institutional Adoption: Continued integration by traditional finance (TradFi) firms lends credibility and reduces volatility. Macroeconomic Pressures: Interest rate policies and geopolitical events remain primary external drivers of risk appetite. Technological Maturation: Advances in blockchain scalability and security address earlier critiques of the ecosystem. This environment means sentiment is no longer driven solely by Bitcoin’s price swings. Instead, it reflects a more mature assessment of the asset class’s fundamental role within the broader financial system. The index’s rise to 20 may, in part, reflect this growing differentiation and a slight reduction in systemic, blanket fear. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s climb to 20 represents a fragile yet important inflection point in market psychology. While firmly in “Extreme Fear,” the four-point gain signals that the pervasive pessimism may be starting to thaw as investors process a maturing regulatory landscape and technological progress. However, this remains a sentiment of caution, not conviction. Market participants should interpret this movement as a sign of potential stabilization rather than an imminent bullish reversal. Monitoring the index’s trajectory in the coming weeks, alongside fundamental on-chain data and macroeconomic indicators, will be essential for understanding whether this fragile recovery in sentiment can develop into sustained market health. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 20 mean? A reading of 20 means market sentiment is in the “Extreme Fear” zone, but has improved from lower levels. It indicates high investor anxiety and risk aversion, though the recent increase suggests a slight reduction in panic. Q2: Who creates the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and how is it calculated? The index is compiled by data provider Alternative.me. It uses a weighted formula incorporating six factors: volatility (25%), market volume/momentum (25%), social media (15%), surveys (15%), Bitcoin dominance (10%), and Google search trends (10%). Q3: Is the Fear & Greed Index a reliable tool for predicting Bitcoin’s price? No, it is not a direct price prediction tool. It is a sentiment indicator. Extremely low readings have sometimes coincided with market bottoms, and extremely high readings with tops, but it should be used alongside fundamental and technical analysis. Q4: How often does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index update? The index updates daily, providing a near-real-time snapshot of shifting market sentiment based on the previous 24 hours of data. Q5: What is the historical range of the index, and what was its lowest reading? The index ranges from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed). Its lowest recorded readings, often during major market crashes, have approached 5-10. The recent move to 20 is above those historic extremes but still indicates significant fear.

This difference is noted at a time when several investors in both retail and institutional markets show heightened interest in these precious metals compared to cryptocurrency. Reports explained that retail investors actively participated in debasement trade, an investment strategy of shifting capital away from fiat currencies and government bonds into “hard assets” like gold or Bitcoin for the majority of 2025. However, after several considerations, this trend , according to a report from JPMorgan analysts led by managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, dropped around August of last year when officials noticed that the Bitcoin ETF’s global investment growth slowed down and later decreased in the fourth quarter. Retail investors demonstrated heightened interest in precious metals While global investment in Bitcoin ETFs decreased, gold ETFs’ investments surged sharply, closing the year with total inflows approaching $60 billion. Reports noted that a large portion of the funds flowing into silver ETFs also originated in the last quarter of 2025, which aligns with bitcoin ETFs’ outflows. Such a scenario suggests that several retail investors have begun focusing on precious metals, thereby reallocating their money away from bitcoin. Following this allegation, analysts conducted research and found that institutional behavior strongly supported this trend. To support this claim, their institutional futures positioning measure, based on amendments to CME futures open interest, shows a major increase in silver’s long positions, particularly in the last quarter of 2025 and into early 2026. This move was largely fueled by hedge funds. Meanwhile, similar to silver, gold futures rose across most of the previous year. Bitcoin futures, on the other hand, show an increase that did not correspond to that observed in gold and silver futures in the same timeframe. At this point, Momentum indicators, which analysts use to measure trend-following traders such as commodity trading advisers, reveal a significant difference among the three assets. Analysts remain optimistic about gold’s fate in the market Analysts dug deeper into the current market situation and concluded that gold futures are overbought, silver futures are extremely overbought, and Bitcoin futures are oversold. With this finding in mind, they pointed out that there is a high likelihood of short-term profit-taking in gold and silver, or that prices would return to historical averages. Since this statement was made public, reports highlighted that both gold and silver dropped from their recent highs. In the meantime, another issue raised was the differences in liquidity among the three assets. To arrive at this finding, analysts used the Hui-Heubel ratio, an indicator of market depth: a lower ratio indicates greater liquidity (more volume with less price volatility). In comparison, a higher ratio signals a more fragile market. According to their analysis, gold consistently showed a lower ratio, indicating that the precious metal has greater liquidity and broader market participation. Contrastingly, silver showed a higher ratio, suggesting thinner liquidity. This situation prompted the analysts to believe that the asset’s recent decline in market breadth might have accelerated price fluctuations. At this point, they confirmed that, among the three assets, silver has the highest Hui-Heubel ratio, indicating lower market depth and greater sensitivity to minor order flows. Given current market conditions, analysts maintain a long-term bullish outlook for gold despite short-term threats to the precious metal. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The exchange formally denied that its internal technical issues were the direct cause of the severe flash crash that rattled global crypto markets on October 10, 2024. This official clarification arrived amidst mounting scrutiny on social media platforms, particularly X (formerly Twitter), where traders and analysts had spent months dissecting the event’s origins. Consequently, the statement provides a crucial, evidence-based perspective on a complex market failure that involved cascading liquidations across multiple asset classes. Binance Flash Crash: Dissecting the Official Narrative Binance’s detailed blog post presented a multi-factor explanation for the October 10 market plunge. The exchange’s analysis pointed to a confluence of macroeconomic and technical pressures rather than a single point of failure. Firstly, a broader downturn in global risk assets created a fragile market environment. This sentiment was exacerbated by ongoing geopolitical tensions and trade war uncertainties, which traditionally trigger capital flight from volatile investments like cryptocurrency. Secondly, the exchange highlighted risk management actions taken by institutional market makers. During periods of extreme volatility, these entities often tighten their quotes or withdraw liquidity to protect their capital, an action that can accelerate price declines. Furthermore, Binance identified specific technical friction within the crypto ecosystem itself. Notably, the exchange cited significant congestion on the Ethereum network during the event. This congestion delayed transactions and created liquidity dislocations, meaning sell orders could not be matched with buy orders efficiently. This technical bottleneck amplified the market’s downward momentum. Finally, the pervasive use of excessive leverage across the crypto derivatives market played a critical role. As asset prices began to fall, over-leveraged positions were automatically liquidated by trading algorithms. These forced sales created a self-reinforcing cycle of selling pressure that cascaded through the market. The Acknowledged Technical Incidents While denying direct causation, Binance did transparently acknowledge two concurrent technical incidents on its platform. The first involved a 33-minute performance degradation of its internal asset transfer function. This slowdown potentially hindered users’ ability to move funds between different account types, such as from their spot wallet to their futures wallet, during a critical window. The second issue concerned index price deviations for three specific assets: USDe, WBETH, and BNSOL. Index prices are reference rates used to mark positions and trigger liquidations; deviations can lead to inaccurate pricing signals. The exchange emphasized that these issues, while notable, were symptoms of the extreme market conditions rather than the primary catalyst. Market Mechanics and the Liquidation Cascade To understand the flash crash, one must examine the mechanics of leveraged trading. Cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance offer derivatives products that allow traders to borrow capital to amplify their positions. This process, known as leverage, can magnify both profits and losses. Exchanges employ a liquidation engine to close a trader’s position if their collateral value falls below a maintenance threshold. On October 10, an initial sell-off, potentially triggered by the broader risk-asset downturn, began pushing prices lower. Initial Trigger: A wave of selling in Bitcoin and major altcoins. Liquidation Wave: Falling prices triggered automatic liquidations of leveraged long positions. Feedback Loop: These forced sales created more selling pressure, pushing prices lower and triggering more liquidations. Liquidity Vacuum: Market makers widened spreads or pulled orders, reducing available buy-side liquidity. Network Congestion: Ethereum delays prevented arbitrageurs from efficiently balancing prices across venues. This created a perfect storm where automated systems, not human panic, drove the market into a precipitous decline within minutes. Historical data from similar events, such as the March 2020 COVID crash or the Luna/Terra collapse in May 2022, shows identical patterns of cascading liquidations overwhelming market structure. The Social Media Backlash and CZ’s Response The period following the crash saw sustained criticism directed at Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), on social media. Traders shared screenshots, debated timelines, and questioned the stability of the exchange’s infrastructure. In response to this growing discourse, CZ announced he would host an Ask-Me-Anything (AMA) session to address community concerns directly. This move is consistent with his long-standing approach of engaging with the user base during periods of controversy. The January 31 blog post served as the formal, technical prelude to that more conversational AMA, providing a data-driven foundation for the discussion. Regulatory and Industry Context for Exchange Accountability The event occurs within an evolving global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency exchanges. Authorities in jurisdictions like the European Union, with its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, and the United States are increasingly focused on market integrity, investor protection, and operational resilience. Incidents like flash crashes prompt scrutiny into whether exchanges have adequate risk controls, liquidity safeguards, and transparent incident reporting. Binance’s detailed public explanation can be viewed as part of an industry-wide effort to demonstrate operational maturity and preempt regulatory concerns. Other major exchanges have issued similar post-mortem analyses following market disruptions, setting a precedent for transparency. Key Factors in the October 10 Flash Crash Factor Description Impact Macro Downturn Broad sell-off in global risk assets (stocks, crypto). Created negative initial sentiment and selling pressure. Market Maker Actions Withdrawal of liquidity due to high volatility. Reduced ability to absorb sell orders, increasing price slippage. Ethereum Congestion Network delays slowing transactions. Prevented efficient arbitrage, fragmenting liquidity across markets. Excessive Leverage High levels of borrowed capital in derivatives positions. Fueled the cascade of automatic, forced liquidations. Binance Technical Issues Transfer delays and index deviations. Potentially exacerbated user experience but not the root cause per exchange. Conclusion Binance’s comprehensive statement on the October 10 flash crash provides a critical, evidence-based counterpoint to simplified narratives of technical failure. The exchange successfully argues that the event was a systemic market breakdown, fueled by macroeconomic anxiety, structural liquidity flaws, and the inherent dangers of excessive leverage, rather than a direct result of its platform’s performance. This analysis underscores a fundamental truth about modern digital asset markets: their interconnectedness and reliance on automated systems can transform a correction into a cascade with breathtaking speed. The Binance flash crash incident serves as a stark reminder for traders about the risks of leverage and for the entire industry about the continuous need for robust, resilient market infrastructure. FAQs Q1: What exactly does Binance claim caused the October 10 flash crash? Binance attributes the crash to a combination of factors: a broad downturn in risk assets, risk-averse actions by market makers, liquidity disruptions from Ethereum network congestion, and a cascade of liquidations from over-leveraged trading positions. Q2: Did Binance have any technical problems that day? Yes, Binance acknowledged two issues: a 33-minute slowdown in its internal asset transfer system and inaccuracies (deviations) in the index prices for USDe, WBETH, and BNSOL. However, the exchange states these were not the direct cause of the market crash. Q3: What is a “liquidation cascade” in cryptocurrency trading? A liquidation cascade occurs when falling prices force the automatic closure (liquidation) of leveraged positions. These forced sales create more downward pressure on the price, triggering further liquidations in a self-reinforcing, rapid downward spiral. Q4: How did social media reaction influence Binance’s response? Growing criticism on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) prompted Binance founder Changpeng Zhao to announce an AMA session. The detailed January 31 blog post served as the official, technical response to these public concerns. Q5: Why is the Ethereum network’s congestion relevant to a crash on Binance? Many crypto assets, including wrapped tokens and DeFi collateral, exist on the Ethereum blockchain. Network congestion can delay transactions needed for arbitrage (buying low on one exchange, selling high on another). This prevents the efficient flow of capital and can trap liquidity, worsening price discrepancies during volatile events.

Physical Intelligence, a two-year-old startup now valued at $5.6 billion, is building what its founders call “ChatGPT for robots”—general-purpose AI brains that could transform everything from home kitchens to industrial warehouses. Led by Stripe veteran Lachy Groom and top AI researchers, the company represents one of Silicon Valley’s most significant and well-funded bets on the future of embodied intelligence. Inside Physical Intelligence’s Robotic Test Kitchen The company’s headquarters reveals its unique approach. The space functions as a massive test kitchen for robotic learning. Engineers use off-the-shelf robotic arms, each costing roughly $3,500, to perform mundane tasks. During a recent visit, one arm struggled to fold black pants while another attempted to turn a shirt inside out. A third successfully peeled a zucchini, its shavings piling neatly into a container. This deliberate use of inexpensive, unglamorous hardware underscores a core thesis: superior artificial intelligence can compensate for basic mechanics. Co-founder Sergey Levine, an associate professor at UC Berkeley, explains the process. “Think of it like ChatGPT, but for robots,” he says, gesturing to the motorized activity. The company operates a continuous data collection loop. Robots in this lab, in warehouses, and even in people’s homes gather information. This diverse data then trains large foundation models for physical intelligence. New model iterations return to these stations for evaluation, creating a tight feedback cycle for improvement. The $1 Billion Backing for a Long-Term Vision Physical Intelligence has raised over $1 billion from top-tier investors including Khosla Ventures, Sequoia Capital, and Thrive Capital. Notably, CEO Lachy Groom does not provide these backers with a concrete timeline for commercialization. “I don’t give investors answers on commercialization,” Groom states. “That’s sort of a weird thing, that people tolerate that.” This tolerance stems from immense belief in the team and the foundational nature of the research. The capital primarily fuels massive computing power, which Groom describes as having no upper limit for this problem. Groom, a 31-year-old former early Stripe employee and successful angel investor, spent five years searching for the right company to lead post-Stripe. He was drawn to the academic work of Levine and Chelsea Finn, now a Stanford professor. After meeting with Google DeepMind researcher and co-founder Karol Hausman, Groom was convinced. “It was just one of those meetings where you walk out and it’s like, This is it.” The Strategy: Cross-Embodiment Learning The company’s technical strategy hinges on cross-embodiment learning . Co-founder Quan Vuong, also from Google DeepMind, explains that the goal is to create intelligence transferable across any hardware platform. If a new robot is built tomorrow, the model’s existing knowledge—learned from arms folding pants or peeling vegetables—should transfer, drastically reducing the marginal cost of adding autonomy. This “any platform, any task” philosophy aims to create a universal robotic brain. Physical Intelligence is already testing its systems with early partners in logistics, grocery, and even a local chocolate maker. Vuong claims that for some specific tasks, their technology is already viable for real-world automation. The broad approach allows them to identify and solve tasks ready for automation today while continuing foundational research. The Heated Race for Robotic Foundation Models Physical Intelligence is not operating in a vacuum. The race to build general-purpose robotic intelligence is intensifying rapidly. A key competitor is Pittsburgh-based Skild AI . Founded in 2023, Skild recently raised $1.4 billion at a $14 billion valuation and is pursuing a starkly different path. Skild has already deployed its “Skild Brain” commercially, reporting $30 million in revenue within months across security and manufacturing sectors. The philosophical divide is sharp. Skild argues on its blog that many so-called robotics foundation models are merely vision-language models “in disguise,” lacking true physical common sense due to over-reliance on internet data instead of physics-based simulation. Skild bets that commercial deployment creates a superior data flywheel. Conversely, Physical Intelligence bets that resisting near-term commercial pressure will yield a more robust, general intelligence. This core strategic difference will likely define the competitive landscape for years. Competitive Landscape: Physical Intelligence vs. Skild AI Company Valuation Funding Core Strategy Commercial Status Physical Intelligence $5.6B >$1B Pure research for general intelligence Early testing with partners Skild AI $14B $1.4B Commercial deployment for data flywheel Generating revenue Execution Challenges and Unusual Clarity Despite the software-centric AI, Groom identifies hardware as the most significant challenge. “Hardware is just really hard. Everything we do is so much harder than a software company,” he notes. Hardware breaks, arrives slowly, and introduces complex safety considerations that pure software ventures avoid. Yet, the company operates with what Groom calls “unusual clarity.” The roadmap is research-driven, not externally dictated by market demands. “A researcher has a need, we go and collect data to support that need – or new hardware or whatever it is – and then we do it.” This focus allowed them to blow through a 5-to-10-year research roadmap in just 18 months. With about 80 employees, the plan is to grow “as slowly as possible” to preserve culture and focus. The Broader Implications and Open Questions The work raises fundamental questions about the future of automation. Will consumers want robots in their kitchens? How will safety be guaranteed around children or pets? Does solving general physical intelligence address economically significant problems? Outsiders also question the viability of the general intelligence approach versus solving specific, high-value applications first. Groom exhibits no visible doubt. He is betting on a team that has studied this problem for decades and believes the convergence of AI advances, data, and compute has finally made the timing right. This faith mirrors a classic Silicon Valley pattern: backing exceptional teams on long-term, uncertain journeys, knowing that a few monumental successes can justify many failures. Conclusion Physical Intelligence stands at the forefront of a pivotal shift in robotics, moving from single-purpose machines to systems with adaptable, general-purpose robot brains . Backed by unprecedented capital and a belief in pure research, the company’s journey from a San Francisco warehouse to potentially world-changing technology will test whether foundational AI models can master the physical world as they have the digital one. The outcome will not only determine the company’s fate but also shape the next decade of automation and artificial intelligence. FAQs Q1: What is Physical Intelligence building? Physical Intelligence is developing general-purpose AI foundation models for robotics—often described as “ChatGPT for robots.” These models aim to give robots adaptable intelligence to perform a wide variety of physical tasks across different hardware platforms. Q2: Who is leading and funding Physical Intelligence? The company is led by CEO Lachy Groom, a former early Stripe employee, and co-founded by top AI researchers including Sergey Levine (UC Berkeley) and Quan Vuong (ex-Google DeepMind). It is backed by over $1 billion from investors like Khosla Ventures, Sequoia Capital, and Thrive Capital. Q3: How does Physical Intelligence differ from its competitor Skild AI? Physical Intelligence focuses on pure research to build superior general intelligence before commercialization. Skild AI prioritizes early commercial deployment to create a data feedback loop. This represents a major philosophical and strategic divide in the field. Q4: What is “cross-embodiment learning”? Cross-embodiment learning is the ability for an AI model to transfer knowledge and skills learned on one type of robotic hardware (e.g., a specific arm) to a completely different hardware platform, reducing the cost and time needed to automate new machines. Q5: What are the main challenges facing Physical Intelligence? The primary challenges are the inherent difficulties of hardware integration—including breakage, supply delays, and safety—and the long-term, uncertain research path toward creating truly general physical intelligence without a near-term revenue model.

A decade after the hack that led to Ethereum’s historic hard fork, the project now pledges over $220 million to bolster the very network it once threatened. This extraordinary move, revealed by spokesperson Griff Green, aims to transform dormant assets from the past into a powerful security fund for Ethereum’s future. The initiative seeks to establish Ethereum as a resilient cornerstone of global finance. The DAO’s Return and Its $220M Security Mission According to reports from DL News, crypto entrepreneur Griff Green officially announced the return of The DAO. Significantly, the project now operates as The DAO Security Fund. This fund controls a substantial treasury of over 75,000 ETH, valued at approximately $220 million. These assets originate from a unique and poignant source: unclaimed funds belonging to investors who never recovered their Ethereum after the 2016 exploit. Consequently, the fund’s custodians have devised a forward-thinking strategy. They plan to stake this massive ETH holding to generate consistent yield. Subsequently, they will reinvest the returns directly into projects and initiatives that enhance the overall security of the Ethereum ecosystem. This plan represents a profound shift in narrative. Essentially, resources frozen in time by one of crypto’s greatest crises will now actively fund its defense. The stated goal is unambiguous. The DAO Security Fund intends to help fortify Ethereum against future threats. Moreover, it aims to support the network’s maturation into reliable, global financial infrastructure. This move has immediately sparked intense discussion across blockchain forums and social media. Many veterans recall the original saga with vivid clarity. Ethereum’s Defining Crisis: The 2016 Hack and Hard Fork To understand the magnitude of this return, one must revisit the pivotal summer of 2016. The DAO launched as a groundbreaking experiment in decentralized venture capital. It quickly raised an unprecedented 12.7 million ETH, worth about $150 million at the time. However, a critical vulnerability in its smart contract code allowed an attacker to drain roughly one-third of its funds. This event triggered a monumental crisis for the fledgling Ethereum community. The community faced a brutal dilemma. Leaders could accept the theft and allow the attacker to keep the funds, upholding the “code is law” principle. Alternatively, they could intervene by rewriting the blockchain’s history. After a fierce and divisive debate, the majority chose intervention. Therefore, in July 2016, Ethereum executed a contentious hard fork. This technical maneuver effectively reversed the hack and returned the stolen ETH to original investors. Nonetheless, a minority faction rejected this fork, arguing it violated blockchain immutability. They continued on the original chain, creating Ethereum Classic (ETC). This schism remains a foundational chapter in crypto history. The Hard Fork: Created two separate blockchains: Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). Immutability Debate: Forced the ecosystem to confront the tension between principle and pragmatism. Investor Aftermath: Many investors received refunds, but a portion of ETH remained unclaimed in recovery contracts. From Crisis to Catalyst: Ethereum’s Post-DAO Evolution The hard fork, while controversial, ultimately allowed Ethereum to survive and thrive. The returned capital helped fuel the subsequent Initial Coin Offering (ICO) boom of 2017. Furthermore, the crisis served as a brutal but effective lesson in smart contract security. It spurred the creation of more rigorous auditing practices and formal verification tools. Over the following decade, Ethereum evolved from a simple smart contract platform into the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Its market capitalization soared into the hundreds of billions. Now, The DAO’s return with a security-focused mandate brings the story full circle. The funds that once caused instability are being mobilized to prevent it. Mechanics of the DAO Security Fund: Staking and Reinvestment The operational plan for The DAO Security Fund leverages Ethereum’s modern proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Staking involves locking up ETH to help validate transactions and secure the network. In return, stakers earn rewards, typically ranging from 3-5% annually. For a fund of 75,000 ETH, this generates a substantial yearly yield—potentially thousands of ETH worth millions of dollars. Projected Annual Yield from The DAO Security Fund (Approximate) Total ETH ETH Value (Approx.) Annual Staking Reward (at 4%) Annual Value (Approx.) 75,000 ETH $220 Million 3,000 ETH $8.8 Million Griff Green’s announcement specifies that these rewards will not be distributed to individuals. Instead, they will be systematically reinvested. Potential recipients include security auditing firms, bug bounty programs, core protocol development teams, and educational initiatives. This creates a sustainable, self-funding engine for ecosystem security. Importantly, the fund’s governance will likely involve a decentralized structure, though specific details remain forthcoming. This approach aligns with the broader trend of decentralized autonomous organizations funding public goods within the crypto space. Expert Perspectives on the Fund’s Potential Impact Blockchain security experts note the strategic timing of this announcement. Ethereum continues to face sophisticated threats from hackers and exploiters. In 2023 alone, DeFi protocols lost over $1 billion to hacks and scams. A dedicated, well-funded security initiative is therefore a welcome development. Analysts suggest the fund could prioritize several key areas: Smart Contract Audits: Funding for comprehensive, multi-firm audits of major DeFi protocols. Client Diversity: Supporting the development of alternative execution and consensus clients to reduce systemic risk. Research Grants: Financing academic and practical research into novel cryptographic security solutions. Education: Creating resources to help developers write more secure code from the start. By providing non-dilutive funding, The DAO Security Fund can address market gaps that venture capital often overlooks. Its enduring, yield-generating model offers a promising template for long-term ecosystem stewardship. Conclusion The return of The DAO marks a remarkable moment of redemption and strategic foresight in cryptocurrency history. A decade after its collapse triggered Ethereum’s great schism, the project re-emerges not as a venture fund but as a guardian. Its pledge of $220 million to bolster Ethereum security represents a powerful commitment to the network’s resilience. By staking dormant assets and reinvesting the yields, The DAO Security Fund aims to create a perpetual engine for protection and innovation. This initiative underscores Ethereum’s continued evolution and the community’s capacity to transform past crises into future strength. Ultimately, the fund’s success will be measured by its tangible contributions to making the Ethereum network safer, more robust, and truly ready for global adoption. FAQs Q1: What exactly was The DAO in 2016? The DAO was a pioneering decentralized autonomous organization launched on Ethereum. It functioned as a investor-directed venture capital fund. Unfortunately, a vulnerability in its code led to a massive hack, resulting in the loss of millions of dollars worth of Ethereum and forcing a historic network split. Q2: Where is the $220 million for the new security fund coming from? The funds originate from unclaimed Ethereum that belonged to investors in the original 2016 DAO. After the hard fork refund process, a significant amount of ETH was never reclaimed. These dormant assets now form the treasury of the new DAO Security Fund. Q3: How will the DAO Security Fund actually improve Ethereum’s security? The fund plans to stake its 75,000 ETH to earn rewards. It will then reinvest those rewards (estimated at several million dollars annually) into security-focused initiatives. This includes funding for audits, bug bounties, core development, client diversity, and security research. Q4: What is the difference between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic? Ethereum (ETH) is the blockchain that resulted from the 2016 hard fork, which reversed the DAO hack. Ethereum Classic (ETC) is the original chain that continued without the fork, upholding the principle of “code is law.” They are now two separate cryptocurrencies with independent development paths. Q5: Who is managing the DAO Security Fund and how is it governed? Crypto entrepreneur Griff Green is the official spokesperson who announced the fund. While specific governance details are still emerging, such funds typically use a decentralized governance model. This likely involves token-based voting by fund participants or a designated multi-signature council of trusted community figures to decide on funding allocations.

While both precious metals recorded new all-time highs in 2026, many altcoins failed to reach similar milestones. Bitcoin, by contrast, did achieve an ATH in 2025; however, following that peak, its price retraced sharply to new lows. With this in mind, analysts argue that the strength of gold and silver does not pose a threat to digital assets. Instead, they interpret the divergence as a major bullish signal for Bitcoin and altcoins. Gold And Silver ATH Signals Bitcoin And Altcoins Upside Crypto market expert Mark Chadwick delivered a detailed analysis of precious metals and cryptocurrencies on X this week, pointing to what he calls “the biggest price divergence” ever recorded between gold and Bitcoin. His chart and analysis suggest that a strong performance in gold could be a major indicator for a potential rally in cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could Continue To Decline If This Doesn’t Happen; Analyst Chadwick noted that gold has surged aggressively, reaching an ATH of over $5,600 in January 2026. This price rally has pushed the metal into extreme overbought levels on higher timeframes. In contrast, Bitcoin is facing prolonged weakness and negative sentiment in 2026, despite reaching an all-time high above $126,000 in October 2025. The analyst suggested that this performance imbalance has reached levels that typically signal a major market shift. Gold and silver have been boosted by factors such as central bank accumulation, inflation hedging, and geopolitical pressures. At the same time, Bitcoin has been weighed down by tighter liquidity, reduced investor interest, and risk-off conditions. As a result, traditional safe-haven assets have entered overbought territory, leaving BTC and altcoins largely overlooked. Chadwick argues that markets move in cycles driven by sentiment and positioning. When one asset becomes excessively overbought, returns diminish, and capital seeks higher upside elsewhere. In past macro cycles, periods of strong performance in gold and silver have often been followed by capital rotating into higher-risk assets once fear subsides. Based on his analysis, Bitcoin’s current positioning reflects exhaustion rather than structural weakness. Chadwick believes that when manipulation ends and capital starts flowing out of gold and silver into BTC, it could set the stage for a sharp rebound in the leading cryptocurrency. Since altcoins typically follow Bitcoin’s performance, the analyst expects that once Bitcoin regains momentum, some of that profit could also rotate into select altcoins, fueling a price rally. Related Reading: XRP Prints Bullish Divergence On The Weekly Chart, But Is ATHs Still Possible? How High Bitcoin And Altcoins Could Rally Chadwick has stated that Bitcoin’s price could easily surge 10x as capital flows back into it and market sentiment and liquidity improve. However, the chart outlines a short-term rally, projecting a 91.60% rise to $170,000 from the $82,000 region. The analyst also predicted that altcoins could rise 50-100x, reflecting a staggering potential for gains in the crypto market. He concluded his analysis by emphasizing that smart money knows massive returns often come from diversification. From this perspective, the current ATHs of gold and silver do not undermine cryptocurrencies but signal an upcoming shift in capital.
