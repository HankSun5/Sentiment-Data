Related Reading: Upcoming Crypto Market Structure Bill Markup Likely Pushed To Post-Holiday As traders react to mixed Federal Reserve messaging, institutional flows, and rising caution across risk markets, analysts remain split on whether Bitcoin’s latest consolidation represents stability, or a deeper shift in how the asset behaves. Analysts Question Whether the Cycle Has Ended A growing number of major firms now argue that Bitcoin may be moving beyond its historic halving-driven rhythm. Investment firm Bernstein said in a recent note that the asset is in an “elongated bull cycle,” pointing to minimal ETF outflows despite a nearly 30% correction. The firm has raised its 2026 price target to $150,000, projecting a potential cycle peak of $200,000 in 2027 and maintaining a $1 million long-term estimate for 2033. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood echoed this view, saying that institutional adoption is reducing the likelihood of the steep 75–90% drawdowns seen in previous cycles. Grayscale has also suggested Bitcoin could break the four-year pattern, forecasting renewed strength in 2026. Bitcoin is currently trading near $90,000–$93,000 depending on the venue, with recent intraday swings highlighting a lack of strong directional conviction. Fed Signals Keep Markets Cautious The Federal Reserve’s 25 bps rate cut initially lifted risk sentiment, but a shift toward cautious, data-dependent language quickly reversed momentum. Bitcoin and Ethereum slipped after the announcement, with BTC falling below $90,000 at one point as traders reassessed the macro backdrop. Liquidity remains thin, contributing to choppy movements across major crypto assets. Analysts note that Bitcoin’s inability to sustain gains, despite the weaker dollar and softer Fed stance, reflects persistent uncertainty. Several commentators say BTC must hold above $90,000 to avoid strengthening bearish pressure, while a break above $94,500 could reopen a path toward $100,000 if inflows improve. Derivatives and On-Chain Data Flag Rising Bearish Sentiment Options and on-chain indicators are also signaling caution. Traders have increased bearish option positions, with the put/call ratio turning positive ahead of a significant expiry window. More than $500 million in crypto liquidations occurred within 24 hours, reflecting heightened volatility. On-chain data shows declining bullish momentum. The Bitcoin Bull Score Index has fallen back to zero, and realized losses suggest further downside could be possible. Analysts warn that despite past buy-the-dip patterns, current readings do not yet reflect the levels typically associated with market bottoms.

The project’s initial phase sold out its allotment of 10 million tokens and secured $500,000 in funding. This early success has only grown, with total sales now climbing past 23 million tokens and funds raised exceeding $1 million from a strong community of over 2,400 investors . As a fully-featured non-custodial ecosystem, GeeFi is proving its utility, and analysts forecast that Phase 3 will be fully subscribed in under 10 days due to ongoing talk of major exchange listings. An Answer to Avalanche’s Congestion Problems While Avalanche (AVAX) faces challenges with network congestion and performance during periods of high activity, investors are shifting their attention to more reliable and user-centric platforms. This search has led many to discover GeeFi , a project that a growing chorus of experts is labeling 2026’s 100x gem . It offers a single, cohesive dashboard for overseeing digital funds across more than 14 networks , letting users swap tokens and move between chains without the usual technical difficulties. This comprehensive system solves a major fragmentation issue for crypto holders. The GeeFi Team , which started development in 2023, prioritized having a working product ready for its 2024 public launch. In contrast to many projects that debut with only a concept, GeeFi presented a functional platform before asking for public funds. Its architecture guarantees users maintain full authority over their private keys, putting security first. With the Android app live and an iOS version on the horizon, GeeFi is demonstrating its dedication to real-world progress, which strengthens the forecast that it is 2026’s 100x gem . The Strategic Power of the GeeFi Presale GeeFi is currently in the second phase of its presale, with tokens offered at the accessible price of $0.06 . This price point ensures early investors a guaranteed 667% return , based on the established $0.40 listing price . The potential for financial growth is massive; a $1,800 investment at this stage could become $90,000 if the token achieves the analysts’ $3 valuation target, representing an astonishing 4,900% ROI . The market’s reaction to the presale has been exceptionally positive. The quick completion of Phase 1 has fueled Phase 2, which is now more than 80% sold out . This stage alone has drawn over $750K from the sale of 13 million tokens . Industry specialists predict Phase 3 will begin next week and conclude swiftly as excitement builds around GeeFi’s expected debut on leading exchanges. This powerful demand reinforces its standing as 2026’s 100x gem . Earn High Returns via Staking and Community Referrals A key element drawing investors to GeeFi is its rewarding staking program. Participants can generate significant passive income through various flexible options. By locking their tokens, users can secure 15% APR for one month , 22% APR for three months , or a top-tier 55% APR for a 12-month period . For those who need constant access to their capital, a liquid option provides returns up to 10% with no lock-up requirement . To further amplify community growth, GeeFi includes a valuable referral system. By sharing a personal link, users get a 5% bonus in GEE tokens on every purchase made through their network. This structure incentivizes organic expansion and helps early backers multiply their holdings efficiently. These income-generating tools make the project a compelling choice for investors focused on portfolio optimization. A Final Opportunity for a Ground-Floor Investment Chances to invest in a project with such strong utility before it gains mainstream recognition are often brief. GeeFi’s presale is a limited-time event to get involved before the general market takes notice. With its deflationary tokenomics, a working product, and a development plan that includes a crypto debit card, GeeFi is positioned to become a key player in the industry. The rapid sales rate is a clear indicator of strong market belief. As the industry gets ready for its next growth cycle, projects with solid fundamentals are expected to outperform. Overlooking GeeFi now could lead to major regret when the token is listed on major exchanges, validating the prediction that it is 2026’s 100x gem . The time to act is now. Securing your allocation is the best way to leverage the extraordinary growth that experts are forecasting.

Early reactions are emerging, but momentum remains weak, raising the big question: Is SOL preparing for one more leg down, or could a surprise bottom quietly be forming beneath the surface? Solana Slides Into A Critical Support Zone Crypto analyst More Crypto Online, in an update shared on X, revealed that SOL has recently dropped into a major support band. This crucial zone stretches from $118 up to roughly $138.30. The analyst emphasizes that this is the exact region where the market must definitively prove that robust demand is still present to prevent further structural decline. Related Reading: Solana Price Faces Critical Test Near $140 While Analysts Track KOL Indicators and Liquidity Shifts While examining the smallest timeframes, the analyst noted that there are indeed early attempts at a reaction developing within this broad support band. However, the expert warns that these reactions currently lack conviction and do not yet display the sustained buying strength necessary to signal a durable reversal. More Crypto Online includes a more bullish possibility, which he labels the “white scenario,” where the broader B-wave correction could finish at any point within this current support region. If successfully confirmed, it would effectively establish a definitive low and open the door for Solana to rechallenge its previous cycle highs by initiating a powerful C-wave rally. However, the core problem preventing a definitive bullish call is that the recovery observed from the recent swing low has not exhibited the characteristics of an impulsive advance. As long as that remains the case, the analyst concludes that a deeper dip is the more realistic path, cautioning traders to prepare for a potential test of levels below the current support range. A–B–C Correction Still In Play For Solana According to More Crypto Online, Solana’s price action continues to mirror the broader structure seen on Bitcoin. The ongoing decline can still be viewed as an A–B–C corrective pattern within the orange scenario, with the final C wave unfolding as a five-legged move. If this interpretation holds, the last leg of the correction still has room to extend further, potentially reaching the $81 to $90 zone. Related Reading: Reversal Loading? Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Build Powerful High-Time-Frame Structures The analyst noted that the current upswing resembles an internal wave 4 rally. Under this outlook, the market could still produce one more low, completing the final leg of the corrective wave before a more reliable reversal structure begins to form. Solana now sits at a key decision point, but the Elliott Wave framework indicates that bearish pressure may not be fully exhausted. Until the structure confirms a shift with impulsive upward movement, the chart still allows for another push lower before a durable trend change can develop.

Manche has pledged $100 million to support blockchain founders. Founders familiar with and trusted by the Nyx Group are the only individuals eligible for Rushi Manche’s $100 million support initiative. He indicated that additional information about the partners would be shared soon. What is Rushi Manche doing now? Former Movement Labs co-founder Rushi Manche has made a reappearance in the crypto industry with Nyx Group, a multi-strategy investment initiative. Nyx Group announced in an official statement that it plans to deploy up to $100 million into liquid markets while offering operational support to token-launching project founders. The initiative brings together multiple partners and family offices, but Manche has not yet disclosed the specific backers. The investment group aims to address what Manche describes as a critical gap in the current crypto landscape, where founders have limited access to capital during challenging market conditions. Nyx Group will also offer hands-on support to help founders secure capital, attract investors, set up their foundations, and connect with key partners. “Crypto is entering a new chapter rife with opportunity and uncertainty,” Manche said in the announcement. “Nyx Group aims to match founders we know and trust with the funds and hands-on counsel they need to bring important, transformative tokens and projects to life.” How will Nyx Group invest its $100M fund? Nyx Group explained that investments will be limited to founders the team knows personally and deeply trusts. The group will also only back founders building projects that add value through community-oriented initiatives or technological innovation. Manche claims that Nyx Group has already been operating for a few months and has made some initial investments, but he didn’t provide specific details. Investment decisions are made by committee, and the group is reportedly focusing on founders backed by reputable funds or showing traction in areas like revenue, active users, and community strength. Manche emphasized this approach reflects the type of support he wished he had during his own entrepreneurial journey. Nyx Group is also considering taking governance positions, foundation roles, or board seats in supported projects. Before Nyx Group, Manche was booted from Movement Labs, the blockchain infrastructure startup he co-founded with fellow Vanderbilt University dropout, Cooper Scanlon. Movement Labs suspended co-founder Rushi Manche while it investigated allegations of organizational governance in May 2025 after Coinbase delisted the MOVE token. The scandal involved 66 million MOVE tokens that were dumped on the market in December 2024, which resulted in $38 million in profits for a market maker called Rentech. Coinbase suspended trading of the MOVE token after it was reported that a market maker had been involved in a token dump. At the time, CoinDesk reported that it had seen evidence that shadow advisers received large token allocations as part of questionable agreements with Movement Labs, citing internal documents it reviewed. Cryptopolitan previously reported that the scandal exposed chaotic internal operations and raised questions about governance and oversight. Movement Labs hired blockchain intelligence firm Groom Lake to conduct a third-party review of the situation. The fallout damaged Movement Labs’ reputation significantly, and the company’s MOVE token saw its price tumble by 23% to an all-time low of $0.18 at the time, following the Coinbase delisting announcement. The token has since lost over 70% of its value from its all-time high. Movement Labs first suspended Manche in May before it eventually let him go on May 7. The company announced it would continue under different leadership, rebranding as Move Industries with Torab Torabi as CEO and Will Gaines as president.

Speaking on Bloomberg’s The Mishal Husain Show, Mustafa vowed that Microsoft’s focus is building super intelligence aligned with human interests, not chasing raw power at any cost. “We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” Mustafa said during the interview. He added that this stance should not be controversial, calling it an obvious position, even though he believes it is still rare across the AI industry. Microsoft regains freedom to build advanced AI systems Mustafa joined Microsoft early last year after the company acquired the intellectual property and much of the team behind his startup, Inflection AI after abandoning OpenAI for consumer-facing AI tools. After the acquisition, Mustafa was tasked with building products that could compete directly with the strongest models already on the market. For much of that time, his work came with limits. Contractual terms tied to Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI blocked the company from developing artificial general intelligence, defined as systems that can perform at human level, as well as superintelligence, which would surpass human abilities. Mustafa said Microsoft gave up those rights in exchange for access to OpenAI’s latest models. That arrangement also involved Microsoft building and equipping data centers for OpenAI over several years. That structure changed in October.A new deal reshaped the relationship and returned development rights to Microsoft. Mustafa said OpenAI now has infrastructure agreements with other partners, including SoftBank and Oracle, to build more data centers than Microsoft was willing to commit. “They now have deals with SoftBank and many others – Oracle – to build more data centers than Microsoft wanted to build for them,” he said. “And so, in return, we then have the right to go develop our own AI.” He said Microsoft has remained a general-purpose AI developer over the past 18 months but is now moving into work that could exceed human performance across tasks. “We’ve still been a general-purpose AI development shop over the last 18 months, but now we can work on some techniques and methodologies that have the potential to exceed human performance at all tasks,” Mustafa said . “And so, it is a shift for us.” Suleyman outlines cautious approach as tools remain unfinished Last month, Mustafa had formally announced the superintelligence effort in a blog post that laid out Microsoft’s position that such systems must be designed to serve people. Other major players, including OpenAI and Anthropic PBC, often make similar claims about safety and human benefit. “Everybody has to decide what they stand for and how they operate, and I don’t want to judge how they’re operating right now,” he said. “I don’t see any evidence of large-scale mass harm.” Despite the long-term focus on superintelligence, Mustafa said the current debate remains academic. Consumers expect assistants that can handle tasks like booking tickets or organizing shopping plans. Executives expect productivity gains. Neither group is fully there yet. Mustafa pointed to Microsoft’s Copilot consumer assistant as proof.He said its agent-like features are still being tested and do not always perform as intended. “We’re still experimenting with it,” said Mustafa. “But when it does work, it is the most magical thing you’ve ever seen.” Don’t just read crypto news.

With U.S. 401(k) plans holding approximately $12.5 trillion, even modest crypto allocations could propel the Bitcoin price prediction into unprecedented bullish territory. U.S Congress Pushes for Bitcoin In Retirement Portfolio In a formal December 11 letter addressed to SEC Chairman Paul Atkins, Congress expressed support for President Trump’s August 2025 executive order directing the Department of Labor and SEC to revise regulations currently restricting 401(k) investment options. BREAKING Congress is urging SEC Chair Atkins to allow Bitcoin and crypto in 401(k) accounts pic.twitter.com/UMUScJaJ5x — Quinten | 048.eth (@QuintenFrancois) December 11, 2025 The initiative aims to provide ordinary workers with investment choices comparable to those available to large pension funds. According to White House data , total U.S. retirement assets reached $43.4 trillion as of March 31, 2025, yet most savers remain blocked from accessing alternative investments. Lawmakers contend that permitting measured allocations into these assets could improve risk-adjusted returns and bring retirement investment strategies into the modern era. Industry experts view this policy evolution as a pivotal moment for Bitcoin’s integration into traditional finance. Analysts calculate that even minimal allocations, ranging from 1–3%, from retirement funds could generate tens of billions in fresh buying pressure, potentially driving BTC to record highs. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Technical Setup Shows Mid-Cycle Correction The weekly chart reveals Bitcoin retreating from the substantial $100,000–$108,000 resistance zone after failing to maintain support above it, creating a distinct mid-cycle pullback. Price currently hovers around $90,000, positioned just above the critical long-term weekly support near $76,000, which represents the essential structural foundation for preserving the broader uptrend. The MACD remains deep in bearish territory but is starting to flatten, suggesting downside momentum may be weakening after months of selling pressure. Source: TradingView If Bitcoin can recapture the $100,000–$108,000 region and subsequently break through the next major pivot at $116,000 , the chart structure supports continuation of the bull run toward the projected target around $131,000. This Presale Raised $2.3M – Is Pepenode the Next PEPE? If Bitcoin starts going up again and people begin putting their retirement money into crypto, meme coins like Pepenode (PEPENODE) could see big price jumps. Pepenode is a new crypto project that’s already raised over $2.3 million, even though the market has been tough. It’s a game where you can “mine” coins without needing any expensive computer equipment.

DOGE’s current price means that it’s now down by 7.5% in a week and by 22% in a month, while the meme token – the tenth-biggest coin in the market – has suffered a 65% decline in a year. However, while the past couple of months have been negative for DOGE and for the wider market, Dogecoin has plenty of things to look forward to on a more fundamental level, including the arrival of a bridge with Solana. Psy Protocol will unveil this bridge for the first time at this week’s DogeCon, an event which has very positive implications for the Dogecoin Price Prediction , in the short- and long-term. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Dogecoin–Solana Integration Announced – Is This the Biggest Partnership of 2025? First announced in May, Psy Protocol’s Solana-Dogecoin bridge will use DOGE’s proof-of-work consensus as its underlying validation layer, something which Psy Protocol says will make it one of the most secure bridges in crypto. (2/4) Bridge hacks have cost crypto users over $2.8B. Psy’s solution? Trustlessly validating Dogecoin's PoW consensus on Solana and leveraging the @wormhole guardian network to ensure safe, fast and user friendly bridging between chains. — Psy Protocol (@PsyProtocol) May 22, 2025 At the same time, the bridge will enable Dogecoin holders to deploy their DOGE on Solana, making use of the latter’s speed and DeFi ecosystem. While it hasn’t yet launched, Psy Protocol will show it off for the first time at DogeCon, and its eventual launch could be a massive boost for the Dogecoin price going forward. It would certainly benefit from a boost right about now, given how much the market has oversold in recent weeks and months. As we see from its chart, October, November, and the start of December have been largely negative for the token, making a rebound likelier. This is what its relative strength index (yellow) tells us, since its recovery above 50 is now long overdue. Source: TradingView At the same time, we see that the Dogecoin price has been trading within an increasingly narrow pennant, and that this pennant is about to converge. This could mean that we’re about to see a breakout, potentially one that may come in time for the traditional festive-season bull rally. Not only is the market overdue for a big rally, but Dogecoin has lots to recommend it, and not just the forthcoming bridge with Solana. Recent weeks have also welcomed the launch of several DOGE ETFs , widening potential institutional investment in the token. As such, the coin could be in for a massive 2026, ending the year at around $0.20 and reaching $0.40 by Q1 of next year. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Reaches $29.3 Million: Is This L2 the Next Big Thing? Traders wanting to move beyond major tokens may also want to check out some of the more promising presale coins, since these can often rally hard when they list. The biggest presale happening at the moment belongs to Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a new layer-two network for Bitcoin . $HYPER is Unstoppable. 29M Raised! https://t.co/VNG0P4GuDo pic.twitter.com/51TU5mrGJK — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) December 5, 2025 It has raised a hugely impressive $29.3 million in its ongoing sale, which continues to grow from strength to strength. This is a massive sign of confidence in the new project, which is aiming to tap into the enormous value of Bitcoin, enabling BTC holders to use their coins for DeFi and other purposes. On a technical level, it makes use of Solana’s Virtual Machine, providing superior speed and scalability. On top of this, it also employs zero-knowledge proofs, which offer a high level of privacy and security. This makes it one of the most technically capable L2s in crypto, explaining why its presale has taken off so quickly. Its native token HYPER will be necessary to pay for transaction fees, which will be competitively low. Even so, the need for HYPER could see the coin’s price rise steadily over time, especially as adoption of the L2 grows. Investors can join its sale by going to the official Bitcoin Hyper website , where the token is currently selling at $0.013405. This price will rise again later today, so newcomers should move quickly if they want to buy this intriguing new token at the lowest possible price.

The U.S. Senate is advancing comprehensive legislation to govern cryptocurrency law, as well as other pieces of legislation, to clarify regulatory oversight and address gaps in current regulations, including the GENIUS Act . Rapid developments in the field of digital assets, particularly stablecoins and decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, have put investors at risk, and lawmakers are determining which cryptocurrencies fall under the jurisdiction of the SEC versus the CFTC. The Senate is making progress on a major crypto bill On Thursday, the South Carolina Republican met with Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, Citi CEO Jane Fraser, and Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf. The team discussed the landmark legislation , which aims to establish comprehensive rules for the digital asset industry and assign regulatory authority to bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. “We are making real progress toward passing digital asset market structure legislation that will help cement America’s role as the crypto capital of the world,” Scott said in a statement on Thursday. “For months, my colleagues and I on the Senate Banking Committee have received valuable feedback from across the banking and crypto industries.” The three banking CEOs were scheduled to meet with senators this week to discuss proposed legislation regarding cryptocurrencies. According to a source familiar with the meetings, two separate meetings, one with Democrats and another with Republicans, were called “cordial.” The discussions covered topics including yield, decentralised finance, and anti-money laundering concerns, among others, according to the person familiar. Banks raise concerns about gaps in the GENIUS Act Yield-generating crypto assets, particularly stablecoins, have been a significant obstacle to passing a comprehensive crypto market structure bill. Banking associations argue that the stablecoin bill passed last summer, known as the GENIUS Act, has gaps that need to be addressed. They argue that the law’s limits on stablecoin issuers paying interest to holders are too weak, which could make these assets more attractive as stores of value and credit instruments than as payment tools, potentially creating “distorting market incentives” for banks, they said. The groups also contend that the GENIUS Act’s restrictions can be easily circumvented by exchanges, brokers, and other affiliated entities. Lawmakers are rushing to pass a bill regulating the crypto industry into law. Over the summer, the House passed its version of a market structure bill, known as the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, or Clarity for short, with bipartisan support. The Senate has since begun efforts to pass a comparable bill. Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott’s panel has drafted legislation that aims to divide regulatory authority between the SEC and the CFTC, introducing a new category called “ancillary assets” to clarify which cryptocurrencies are not considered securities. Meanwhile, the Senate Agriculture Committee released its own bill last month, which would expand the CFTC’s authority. Both committee drafts would need to be reconciled before moving forward. In the past few days, Democratic and Republican senators have met to negotiate certain provisions of the bill, but the talks appear shaky. Some lawmakers are seeking to advance the bill and move it through the Senate Banking Committee before the end of the year, but it remains unclear whether this will happen.

Since XRP is priced near $2, acquiring 1,000 units requires an investment of roughly $2,000. The question many investors ask is what price level XRP would need to reach for such a position to be worth $1 million, and whether any realistic long-term pathway makes that outcome achievable. Understanding the Required Price Level For a portfolio of 1,000 XRP to reach a value of $1 million, the asset would need to appreciate to $1,000 per coin. This figure forms the basis of several long-range forecasts shared by well-known community commentators such as BarriC and JackTheRippler . Their arguments typically reference the possibility of XRP becoming a core instrument for settlement operations, large-scale liquidity management, and global value transfer mechanisms. At this price point, a $2,000 investment today would experience gains exceeding 49,000 percent. While critics associate such projections with unrealistic expectations, supporters argue that other digital assets have produced outcomes that seemed unlikely in their early years. Long-Term Forecasts That Outline a Possible Path Multiple research groups and market analysts have issued long-term estimates that, while not uniform, indicate a consistent upward trajectory for XRP. Data-driven projections from Changelly position the asset near the $115 range between 2033 and 2034. This level remains well below the $1,000 threshold, but it suggests ongoing positive momentum over the next decade. Other forecasts extend beyond that period. Telegaon’s previous long-term model estimated that XRP could approach $285 around 2050. Under such circumstances, 1,000 XRP would be valued at $285,000, a considerable increase despite falling short of the million-dollar mark. Some analysts offer more ambitious scenarios. Matthew Brienen, the Chief Operating Officer at CryptoGuard, has outlined a model in which XRP could reach $1,000 by 2035. His position centers on the expectation that the asset may become integrated into large-scale financial infrastructure, particularly in areas related to institutional settlement channels and tokenized liquidity frameworks. If such integration occurs, the value of 1,000 XRP would exceed $1 million. These projections depend heavily on adoption trends, regulatory developments, and broader market conditions. They do not function as guarantees, but they outline potential outcomes based on long-term structural assumptions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Historical Comparisons and Their Limitations Supporters of the $1,000 target often compare XRP’s potential to earlier growth patterns observed in other major crypto assets. Bitcoin advanced from fractions of a cent to above $126,000. Ethereum moved from below $1 to nearly $5,000, and Solana rose from under $1 to approximately $260 during peak periods. These increases were driven by expanding use cases, structural improvements, and rising demand. Advocates contend that XRP could experience a similar rise if it becomes widely adopted for institutional transactions and large-scale digital value transfer. Ripple’s corporate initiatives, including multibillion-dollar investments in 2025, are frequently cited as supportive factors. However, critics raise supply concerns. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, which have significantly smaller circulating supplies, XRP has a maximum supply close to 100 billion tokens. A price of $1,000 per XRP would imply a market capitalization nearing $100 trillion. For comparison, Bitcoin’s market cap at its peak remained below $4 trillion. Even at $1 million per Bitcoin, its projected market cap would be under $21 trillion. This contrast forms the core objection to the $1,000 XRP scenario . The possibility of turning 1,000 XRP into $1 million depends on whether XRP can reach a four-digit valuation. Analysts remain divided, with some highlighting long-term structural strengths and others noting significant supply-based limitations. While future adoption and regulatory clarity will play critical roles in determining the asset’s trajectory, the debate underscores the broader uncertainty surrounding long-term valuation models in the digital asset sector.

Bitcoin is also down by 2% today, while Ethereum has declined by 3.5%, Solana by 4.5%, and Cardano by a hefty 10%. These are disappointing falls, yet the market remains as strong fundamentally as it was in January, suggesting that a rebound must be imminent. We’ve therefore chosen our best new meme coin to buy today under $0.01, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , which has the potential to outpace the market when it lists in under a month. Best New Meme Coin to Buy Today Under $0.01 – 11 December PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) is an Ethereum-based token that opened its presale in late September and has since gone on to raise over $2.3 million . This sale has proven increasingly popular in recent weeks, yet it has now entered its home stretch, with only 28 days until it ends and the coin lists. Even the pickaxe is festive. This season the best present is a levelled up virtual mining rig. https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/BRg3lVom3u — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) December 11, 2025 It has attracted investors for one simple reason: it’s launching an innovative mining platform that will make mining more accessible to average investors. Instead of requiring investment in expensive mining hardware (not to mention the large facilities to house such hardware), it enables users to build virtual mining rigs. Users can run their virtual rigs to earn mining rewards in external tokens such as Fartcoin and Pepe, while they can use PEPENODE tokens to buy more nodes. And by acquiring and upgrading more nodes, they can increase their rewards, while users also have the option to sell their nodes when they no longer need them. Because the PEPENODE token is necessary to grow mining rigs, it could attract substantial demand, pushing its price up massively over time. Holders can also stake it for a passive income, with its protocol currently providing a yield of 558% APY . This means that PEPENODE could be one of the most lucrative new coins to own once it launches in just under a month. PEPENODE Launch Could Coincide with Xmas and New Year Rally While there isn’t long left until the PEPENODE sale ends, investors can still join it by going to the project’s official website. There, they can connect a compatible wallet (e.g., Best Wallet) and use ETH, USDT, BNB, or fiat to buy any desired amount of the token. It’s selling at its final presale price of $0.001192, although its popularity would suggest that it could eclipse this level once it lists on exchanges. It has a max supply of 210 billion PEPENODE, with 5% of this total reserved for node rewards. And while the market remains subdued today, a festive rally could coincide nicely with the coin’s launch, helping it to surge on trading platforms.

The decision opens the door for the exchange to begin offering regulated prediction markets in the United States. Gemini Titan Debuts in Prediction Markets The launch marks Gemini’s first entry into the fast-growing event-contracts sector, where traders buy and sell binary “yes or no” positions tied to future outcomes. Gemini, which first filed for a DCM license in March 2020, had not previously disclosed that the application would form the basis of a standalone prediction-market platform. US customers will initially access the contracts through Gemini’s website using existing USD balances, and mobile access is expected to follow. The move places Gemini in a competitive field led by Kalshi and Polymarket, platforms that saw trading volumes surge during last year’s US election cycle and continue climbing since President Donald Trump took office. The sector has been shaped by years of cautious CFTC oversight, including enforcement actions such as the earlier ban on Polymarket and tight restrictions on political-themed markets. A recent legal win by Kalshi against the CFTC over event-contract listings has widened the regulatory pathway for platforms seeking to expand into categories such as sports and economic forecasting. Gemini’s CEO, Tyler Winklevoss, thanked Trump for “ending the Biden Administration’s war” on the sector and added that “it’s incredibly refreshing and invigorating to have a President and a financial regulator who are pro crypto, pro innovation, and pro America.” Meanwhile, the exchange’s President Cameron Winklevoss said, “Prediction markets have the potential to be as big or bigger than traditional capital markets. Acting Chairman Pham understands this vision and its importance. Unlike her predecessor, Acting Chairman Pham has positioned the CFTC as a pro-business, pro-innovation regulator that will allow America to lead in these new and exciting markets.” The official press release also revealed that Gemini Titan may later broaden its derivatives offerings to include crypto futures, options, and perpetual contracts, products widely traded in Asia but historically limited in the United States due to regulatory hurdles. CFTC Warms Up to Prediction Markets Prediction markets are gaining momentum in Washington as the CFTC, now led by Acting Chair Caroline Pham under Trump’s second term, has taken a more welcoming approach to the sector. In October, CryptoPotato reported that Trump Media and Technology Group said it would launch a prediction market inside Truth Social through an exclusive partnership with Crypto.com. The new feature, called Truth Predict, will let users trade contracts on elections, inflation moves, commodity prices, and sports results. Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek said the industry could grow into a “multi-deca-billion-dollar” market.

Investors have widely written off the altcoin since system instability triggered a hyperinflation-driven collapse in 2022, but major reforms may put it past that era. The December 8 launch of the LUNA v2.18 upgrade introduced stronger security features, tighter Cosmos interoperability, and a reinforced link between LUNA and USTC. These changes created a fundamental backdrop for the surge, directly addressing issues that contributed to the original breakdown. And with, since the start of the month, LUNA is up 222%. Today’s court hearing for Terra co-founder Do Kwon has added a social catalyst, with headlines around a potential sentencing pushing fresh attention toward the coin. TODAY: Do Kwon faces sentencing in the US over the Terra/LUNA collapse. The court weighs a 12-year bid from prosecutors vs. a 5-year cap sought by the defense. pic.twitter.com/43sBzyqDn2 — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) December 11, 2025 Still, many market participants attribute the rally to short-term speculative flows rather than improving fundamentals, raising doubts about how durable the uptrend really is. Terra Luna Price Prediction: Can the Comeback Last? The rally affirms the lower boundary of a three-year descending channel pattern, a proven launchpad throughout LUNA’s post-crash consolidation. With that confirmation, eyes are turning back to a potential breakout as the upper resistance trendline comes into view and momentum indicators show room for further upside. LUNA USD 1-day chart, descending channel. Source: TradingView . The RSI sits at 63, yet to reach the 70 overbought threshold that often marks local tops, while the MACD strengthens its bullish posture with a widening gap above the signal line. The key breakout threshold sits at a past demand zone around the $0.357 0.382 Fib retracement. Flipping this level to support could open the door to a potential 1,000% rally toward $2. The interim $0.246 0.236 retracement remains immediate resistance, capping today’s advance. still, the sudden and sharp spike in both momentum indicators could commemorate a rally driven by speculation rather than a long-term positioning, opening the door to downside volatility. If long-term holders decide to take profit, a shakeout of weak hands could trigger a 70% slide back to the $0.0665 support and potentially expose lower lows. New PEPENODE Presale Lets Users Mine Meme Coins with No Hardware With volatile coins like Terra Luna swinging between rallies and crashes, timing the market can feel like a losing game, especially for meme coin investors.

Just log in, build your virtual mining rig, stack nodes, and start earning passive rewards that automatically diversify into top meme coins like PEPE and BONK. Momentum is climbing fast. The presale has already passed $2.3 million, while early stakers can still earn up to 559% APY. With just under a month left, the chance for an early entry is fleeting. And thanks to a built-in deflationary model, where 70% of all $PEPENODE spent on nodes and rigs is burned, scarcity supports long-term token value.

The collapse wiped out an estimated $50 billion in market value within three days and triggered a chain of events that reshaped the digital-asset sector. The sentence, issued by District Judge Paul Engelmeyer of the Southern District of New York, exceeded the 12-year term recommended by prosecutors and was higher than the five-year sentence sought by Kwon’s legal team. Under federal rules, Kwon must serve at least half of the imposed term before he may request a transfer to South Korea, where he faces additional charges. Court reviews evidence and impact of Terra’s failure The sentencing was the result of an extended hearing, which involved the testimony of the victims, face-to-face and by phone, explaining the financial impact on individuals and families as a result of the breakdown of Terra. Judge Engelmeyer considered those testimonies with the guilty pleas that Kwon had already signed. In August, Do Kwon was found guilty of one count of conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, securities fraud, and wire fraud, as well as one count of wire fraud, in connection with the business of Terraform Labs. At a hearing of his plea, he admitted to being involved in an active conspiracy to defraud buyers of the UST stablecoin. The collapse of Terraform Labs marked the first major event in the broader crypto meltdown of 2022. The collapse of the company led to a series of market tensions, including mass liquidations, that contributed to the November 2022 FTX implosion. Plea deal reduced charges but did not limit the judge’s decision Do Kwon was initially charged with nine counts and faced a maximum sentence of 135 years to serve if found guilty on all counts. In a plea bargain agreed upon in the summer, the prosecutors reduced the charges to two counts with a maximum aggregate sentence of 25 years. According to the agreement, prosecutors were required to consent to recommending a term of 12 years’ imprisonment and assist Kwon in seeking an international prison transfer to South Korea upon completion of half of his American jail term. Judge Engelmeyer enquired about what such a pre-sentencing transfer means. According to court documents, he enquired about what guarantees there should be that Kwon would not be released prematurely in case he was sent back to South Korea. He also inquired with the prosecutors and defence counsel whether Kwon was still being charged in South Korea and whether the time spent abroad should be counted against his federal sentence. In a written response submitted on Wednesday, the prosecutors said they did not have any specifics about the ongoing proceedings in South Korea but confirmed that authorities there had indicated that Kwon would disagree with the charges. In the filing, the Bureau of Prisons indicated that Kwon would receive credit for the time he had served in Montenegro after the four months related to a different conviction concerning a passport.

According to data from Artemis, Stellar operations spiked in early December, pointing to growing real-world adoption. With both projects sharing similar use cases and institutional interest rising, XRP may soon escape its range-bound pattern and reclaim upside momentum. TThe metric tracks the total volume of payments moving across the Stellar blockchain, which is designed to streamline cross-border transactions using its native XLM token and stablecoins like USDC. XRP directly competes in this space with a nearly identical mission, though it currently commands a much larger market cap. Ripple, the company behind XRP, has also made major strides in global expansion by securing key regulatory licenses in jurisdictions like Dubai, Singapore, and the US. These licenses allow Ripple to offer compliant off-ramp services to enterprises looking to move money internationally using blockchain infrastructure. XRP Price Prediction: Break Above $2.20 Will Signal the Beginning of XRP’s Next Leg Up In the past 24 hours, XRP has retreated by 2.4% but continues to stay above the critical $2 threshold following yesterday’s widely awaited interest rate decision by the Federal Reserve. Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that XRP has been trading relatively range-bound in the past few days, bouncing up and down between the $2 and $2.20 zone. If XRP decisively breaks out of this range, this could mean that XRP is getting ready to move to higher highs before the year ends. Positive on-chain metrics on Stellar could be a “canary in the coal mine” signal that altcoins are about to explode. While XRP battles it out in the highly regulated cross-border payments arena, a more accessible opportunity is quietly gaining momentum. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a fast-growing crypto presale , has already raised millions to build a next-gen Layer-2 network for Bitcoin using Solana-based tech. It’s an early-stage opportunity that anyone can join, with the potential to ride a wave of innovation across two of crypto’s most powerful ecosystems. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Nears $30 Million Raised to Launch Its Innovative Bitcoin L2 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is an ambitious project that taps into the efficiency of the Solana blockchain to bring faster transaction speeds and lower costs to Bitcoin transactions.

55664723,643792,1765497630,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55664723.jpeg,Dogecoin Barely Blinks As Musk Confirms X Money Is Running Internally,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-musk-confirms-x-money-internally/,"Elon Musk has confirmed that X’s long-promised payments layer, X Money, is already running inside the company — but Dogecoin, his on-again-off-again favorite meme coin, has barely twitched. Replying to developer and X feature-watcher Nima Owji on December 10, Musk dropped a characteristically terse update: “It has been launched internally.” Within hours, promoter Mario Nawfal was broadcasting that “X MONEY IS LIVE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, PUBLIC LAUNCH NEXT,” describing the system as “quietly tested by employees and early users while the rest of the world waits for access.” It has been launched internally — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 10, 2025 The market, however, did not exactly wait breathlessly. As of press time, Dogecoin traded around $0.137, down less than 0.1% on the day — essentially noise, given an intraday range between roughly $0.137 and $0.150. For a coin that once ripped 20–30% on a single Elon meme, this is… subdued. Why Is The Dogecoin Price Not Reacting? The contrast with earlier X Money headlines is stark. When Musk first framed the payments stack as part of a broader relaunch of XChat in mid-November, he boasted that X had “just rolled out an entire new communications stack with encrypted messages, audio/video calls and file transfer,” adding pointedly: “Money comes out soon… X will be the everything app.” Dogecoin and other high-beta names squeezed higher on that story, if only briefly. Back in May, when Musk confirmed that a beta version of X Money was coming, DOGE jumped from about $0.08 to $0.09 on the announcement — a double-digit percentage move triggered by one more hint that the dog might be wired into X’s rails. Today’s non-reaction lands against a deeper build-out of X Money in the background. According to a recent job posting, X Money is hiring a technical lead to design a payments platform “from the ground up” for more than 600 million monthly users, with an emphasis on distributed systems and secure transactions. The description notably does not mention crypto or Dogecoin at all. Notably, X Money already announced a partnership with Visa earlier this year for an “X Money Account” that would fund wallets and peer-to-peer payments, while Solana figures — including ecosystem advisor Nikita Bier, now at X — have publicly signaled they are eager to help. Crucially, Musk has not exactly gone quiet on Dogecoin in general. On November 3 he posted “It’s time” on X, reviving his old promise to “put a literal Dogecoin on the literal moon” via a SpaceX mission, as reported by Bitcoinist. In mid-October he waded into the “energy money” debate, backing Bitcoin as impossible to “fake” because it is grounded in energy and then replying with an approving emoji when a Dogecoin community account insisted that “Dogecoin is also based on energy” — his “first explicit nod toward DOGE in a while,” as reported on NewsBTC . Even more recently, on October 11 and again on November 15, Musk posted Doge-coded content — a Shiba Inu mascot image, then a meme of a Shiba playing a banjo — that historically would have lit up DOGE order books. However, this time, Dogecoin’s response was muted to outright negative. In other words, the last few times Musk has talked about or referenced Dogecoin on X, the market reaction has been steadily decaying. So when he now says X Money “has been launched internally,” the absence of a pump in DOGE looks less like a mystery and more like a trend. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.13765.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-12 00:00:30

Critical On-Chain Metric Explodes Higher,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/is-dogecoin-waking-up-critical-on-chain-metric-explodes-higher/,"Dogecoin rose 4% to trade at $0.14 Thursday, according to market reports. Market capitalization was about $21 billion while 24-hour trading volume hovered near $1.6 billion. The move followed renewed on-chain activity that has drawn attention from traders and analysts. Related Reading: Institutions Scoop Up 9,000 Ether, Fueling Bullish Signals Spike In Active Wallets Based on reports from BitInfoCharts, the number of daily active addresses on the Dogecoin network jumped to over 67,500 on December 3, marking the second-highest reading in the past three months. That earlier spike on September 15 came as DOGE briefly approached a local top near $0.30. At that time, network activity rose as prices climbed; today, rising wallet activity is being watched closely as prices test a familiar zone after a long slide. Support Holding Near $0.14 Dogecoin is sitting above an important area around $0.138–$0.14, which has been tested and defended multiple times. Reports show the token has bounced off that level before, and trading volume has more than doubled during the most recent uptick, a sign that buying interest is growing. Market feeds also report mixed short-term figures: one line shows the token down by 5% in a week while another notes a 7.5% decline over the last week; those numbers do not align and highlight some reporting inconsistencies. Longer-term data show the token has lost roughly 60% over the past year and is about 50% off its recent highs. Volume And Technical Targets Traders are eyeing $0.16 as the next meaningful resistance. Based on reports, a decisive move above that zone would be the first clear break in the short-term bearish pattern. Beyond that, the 200-day exponential moving average sits as a broader target, often watched for signals that medium-term momentum has shifted. A break above the 200-day EMA would be treated by many as confirmation that a recovery could gain traction, although history shows these signals sometimes reverse quickly. Signals Are Mixed Daily active address spikes can point to rising interest. They can also reflect simple transfers, bot traffic, or wallet reshuffles by large holders. Increased volume helps the case for buyers, but active-address readings alone are not foolproof. The current setup looks like a battleground: both bulls and bears are more active than they were a few weeks ago. That activity makes the coming days important for traders who favor short-term moves.

While many market participants had anticipated a significant rally earlier in the year, the token has instead shown continued volatility. According to market data, XRP has declined both on a quarterly scale and year-to-date, contributing to growing concerns within the community. Some commentators, including Zach Rector, have argued that several developments slowed XRP’s momentum. He pointed to the prolonged legal dispute with the U.S. SEC, delays surrounding the introduction of XRP exchange-traded products, and the absence of regulatory clarity as contributing factors. In his view, these issues prevented XRP from achieving price levels that were once expected for 2025. Despite these, not all analysts are discouraged. One of the more optimistic voices is The Block Bull, who recently outlined what he sees as a realistic upper boundary for XRP if the market enters a supercycle. His assessment places a potential top near $48, assuming XRP can regain key technical levels that previously shaped its long-term trajectory. Realistic height For $XRP for those that believe in the Super Cycle… Parallel Channel Gives you greater targets to obtain 20X~ in a super cycle $40.00+ pic.twitter.com/thb8IUCnwD — BLOCK BULL (@TheBlockBull) December 7, 2025 Long-Term Structure: The Parallel Channel Framework A major part of The Block Bull’s argument centers around a parallel ascending channel that he states has influenced XRP’s market structure for several years. This chart pattern came into focus in 2017, a period when XRP was still valued under one cent. The analyst highlights that the asset repeatedly interacted with the upper boundary of this channel at the time and consistently maintained support above it, leading into its 2018 surge toward all-time highs. Following the peak, XRP eventually fell back into the channel and continued trading within it for several years. Although its progression was slow, the structure suggested steady upward movement. That trend came under substantial pressure during the 2022 downturn, which was intensified by large-scale market failures involving major industry players. As a result, XRP fell below the lower boundary of the channel and has remained outside of it since then. Renewed optimism briefly surfaced in late 2024 when XRP approached $2, bringing it close to the channel’s lower line again. However, attempts to regain this technical level have repeatedly been rejected, indicating strong resistance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Price Targets in a Supercycle Scenario The Block Bull suggests that re-entering the multi-year channel is essential before XRP can attempt higher valuations. In his analysis, the upper boundary of the channel points to a potential high near $48 if a broad market expansion occurs. He views this level as ambitious yet still within the realm of possibility if XRP manages to reclaim its historical structure. At current prices, around $2, reaching the $48 region would represent an increase of more than 20 times from the present market value. Even so, the analyst acknowledges that many investors may choose to take profits much earlier, particularly around the $10 range, which he believes would trigger significant selling pressure. Although the $48 estimate is aggressive, it is not entirely isolated. Forecasts from research platforms such as Changelly have also placed XRP in that general range over the long term, projecting a potential move toward this level in the early 2030s. The outlook for XRP remains divided between ongoing skepticism and persistent long-term optimism. While the asset continues to face technical and regulatory challenges, some analysts argue that a return to its historical channel could open the door to substantial appreciation. Whether the conditions required for a supercycle will materialize is uncertain, but the discussion underscores the wide range of expectations surrounding XRP’s future trajectory.

This perspective highlights the potential for Pakistani officials to consider regulating the crypto market. This outlook was noted at the Bitcoin MENA Conference a few days after Saqib shared a statement dated Tuesday this week, declaring that the country can no longer rely on outdated economic models. Therefore, according to him, “a new engine”, which he referred to as digital assets, is needed to boost economic growth. Saqib refers to digital assets as essential aspects for Pakistan’s new financial system During a discussion in Abu Dhabi , the senior official argued that they do not view Bitcoin, digital assets, and blockchain as speculative tools, but as an important part of their infrastructure. Saqib further explained that they are not just distractions but play a significant role in establishing the basis for a new financial system for developing nations. Saqib, who was recently appointed Chairman of the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority ( PVARA ) and previously served as Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Blockchain and crypto matters, highlighted that he is working towards a major goal of transforming the largest unregulated cryptocurrency markets into a favourable investment environment. According to him, Pakistan has the potential to develop a regulated crypto ecosystem as soon as possible, given that 70% of the population belongs to the 30-year-old age group, rather than becoming a late adopter. “My message is straightforward,” he stated. “If El Salvador can achieve this with 6 million people, just think about what Pakistan could accomplish with a population 40 times larger and one of the fastest-growing digital sectors in Asia.” Following the senior official’s argument, analysts weighed in on the situation. They pointed out that Pakistan is increasingly becoming one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrency markets globally. Their remarks came after the country moved up six spots to solidify its top position as the third in Chainalysis’ 2025 Global Crypto Adoption Index . Pakistan positions itself as a hub for digital assets Earlier this month, Saqib informed reporters that the country is preparing to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. He also noted that Pakistan is working towards adopting more supportive policies specifically for cryptocurrency. This move sparked excitement among individuals who are advocates of cryptocurrencies. To further illustrate their commitment to exploring the crypto ecosystem, Pakistan reported allocating 2,000 megawatts of additional electricity to support Bitcoin mining activities and the construction and operation of AI data centres that same month. This time round, the country embraced national efforts essential to enable it to go digital. This move triggered reports to reach out to fi nancial leaders in the country to explain this plan further. Respondingly, they mentioned that this plan aims to attract significant foreign investment and create new high-tech jobs by diverting excess power supply to AI and crypto initiatives. To position itself as a hub for digital assets, Pakistan notified international crypto firms in September that they are accepting applications for licenses under the country’s new federal regulations. For leading exchanges and service providers interested in exploring the market, the PVARA advised them to begin submitting their interest.

The latest reading from the widely watched Crypto Fear & Greed Index confirms the mood: it’s holding steady at a score of 29. This firmly places current market sentiment in the ‘fear’ category. But what does this number really tell us, and more importantly, what should a savvy investor do about it? Let’s decode the signal from the noise. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Telling Us Right Now? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool that quantifies the emotional temperature of the cryptocurrency market. Think of it as a market mood ring. A score of 29, unchanged from the previous day, indicates that fear is the dominant emotion among traders and investors. This index ranges from 0, representing extreme fear , to 100, which signals extreme greed . The current stagnation at 29 suggests the market is in a cautious, wait-and-see phase, lacking the conviction for a strong move in either direction. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? This isn’t just a guess; it’s a data-driven snapshot. The index from Alternative.me compiles information from several key sources to create its daily score. Understanding the components helps explain why the sentiment is what it is. Volatility (25%): Sharp price swings, especially downward, feed fear. Market Volume (25%): Low or declining volume can indicate a lack of buyer interest. Social Media (15%): The tone and volume of conversations on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Direct polling of market participants. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): When Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap rises, it often signals a ‘flight to safety’. Google Trends (10%): Search volume for terms like ‘Bitcoin crash’ or ‘crypto bubble’. The current Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 29 means these factors collectively paint a picture of apprehension. Should You Be Afraid When the Index Shows Fear? Here’s where it gets interesting. While ‘fear’ sounds negative, experienced market participants often see it differently. A low Crypto Fear & Greed Index can present a strategic opportunity. Historically, periods of extreme fear have sometimes preceded market bottoms or buying opportunities, as weak hands sell and value investors step in. However, it’s crucial to remember that the index is a sentiment indicator, not a price predictor . It tells you how people feel, not necessarily where the price will go next. Actionable Insights in a Fearful Market So, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is flashing yellow. What’s your next move? First, avoid panic selling based on sentiment alone. Use this information as one piece of your broader research puzzle. This is an excellent time for due diligence—researching projects with strong fundamentals that may be undervalued. Consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to build positions gradually, reducing the risk of buying at a single high point. Most importantly, ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with your personal risk tolerance. The Bottom Line on Today’s Crypto Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index holding at 29 is a clear sign that uncertainty reigns. It reflects real concerns about volatility, macroeconomic factors, and regulatory headlines. However, by understanding what drives this index, you can move from reacting to emotion to making informed decisions. In the tumultuous world of crypto, sometimes the best action is informed patience. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Is a Fear & Greed Index score of 29 a good time to buy Bitcoin? A: It can be. Many contrarian investors view periods of fear as potential buying opportunities, as prices may be depressed. However, you should never base a buy decision solely on this index. Always conduct your own research and consider your financial goals. Q: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A: The index is updated daily, typically once per day. You can find it on websites like Alternative.me. Q: Does the index only measure sentiment for Bitcoin? A> While Bitcoin is the primary driver due to its dominance and data availability, the index aims to reflect sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market, as many altcoins move in correlation with Bitcoin. Q: Has the index been accurate in the past? A> The index has been effective at identifying periods of extreme market emotion, such as the euphoric highs near bull market peaks and the fearful lows during sharp corrections. It is a reliable gauge of prevailing mood, not a crystal ball for exact price movements. Q: Where can I check the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A> The most common source is the website Alternative.me. Many major crypto news and data platforms also display it on their market analysis pages. Q: Should I sell my crypto if the index is in ‘Extreme Fear’? A> Not necessarily. ‘Extreme Fear’ often coincides with market capitulation, which can mark a turning point. Selling during extreme fear can mean selling at a low. Review your investment thesis and long-term strategy instead of making emotional decisions. Did this breakdown of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index help you make sense of the market’s mood?

Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE Hits Key Support and Faces Make-Or-Break Moment Heading to the 12-hour chart, DOGE seems to be hitting a pivotal level at $0.13. In the past few weeks, it has bounced three times off this mark, increasing its technical relevance. If the price breaks above its dynamic trend line resistance, the odds of a move toward its point of control at $0.195 will be high. This confirms Bitconsensus’ view and further validates a bullish Dogecoin price prediction. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) would need to push above the 14-period moving average to confirm a bullish reversal for Dogecoin. Right now, it hovers around 40. Ideally, a breakout above the mid-line would signal that momentum is truly shifting in favor of the bulls.

This significant event, sourced from leading exchange Deribit, has the potential to inject volatility and shape short-term price action. But what does this actually mean for you, and how should savvy market participants interpret the key metrics? What Does Today’s Massive Bitcoin Options Expiration Mean? Today at 8:00 a.m. UTC, a critical financial instrument for sophisticated traders reaches its deadline. Bitcoin options are contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) Bitcoin at a predetermined price by a specific date. The expiration of $3.67 billion worth of these contracts forces traders to make decisions: exercise their rights, let them expire worthless, or roll them over. This concentrated activity often leads to increased trading volume and can cause price swings as market makers hedge their positions. Decoding the Key Metrics: Put/Call Ratio and Max Pain To gauge market sentiment, analysts look at two vital numbers provided by Deribit. First is the put/call ratio of 1.1 for Bitcoin options . A ratio above 1 indicates more put (bearish) contracts exist than call (bullish) ones, suggesting a cautious or hedging sentiment among traders. However, at 1.1, the bias is only slightly negative. The second crucial figure is the “max pain” price of $90,000. This is the strike price at which the maximum number of options would expire worthless, causing the most financial loss to option buyers and maximum gain to sellers. Market forces often, but not always, gravitate toward this price at expiration to minimize payouts. Put/Call Ratio (1.1): Slight bearish hedging bias. Max Pain Price ($90,000): The price point that would cause maximum loss to option holders. Ethereum Joins the Expiry Frenzy: A $770 Million Event It’s not just Bitcoin in the spotlight. A substantial batch of Ethereum options worth $770 million is set to expire simultaneously. The metrics here show an even stronger defensive posture. With a put/call ratio of 1.22 and a max pain price of $3,100, Ethereum traders appear to be exhibiting more pronounced caution or protection against downside moves. This dual expiration creates a compounded event that could amplify market-wide volatility. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders and Investors So, how should you navigate this? For active traders, expect potential volatility around the expiration time. Price may experience pinning near the max pain levels as the deadline approaches. Long-term investors, however, should view this as a routine market mechanism. While these expiries can cause short-term noise, they rarely alter the fundamental long-term trajectory. The key is not to panic but to understand the mechanics at play. Conclusion: Navigating the Options Expiry Landscape In summary, today’s expiration of $3.67 billion in Bitcoin options is a major market event that highlights the growing sophistication of the crypto derivatives space. The slightly bearish put/call ratio and the $90,000 max pain price provide a snapshot of current trader sentiment and potential pressure points. By understanding these concepts, you can better interpret market movements and avoid being swayed by temporary volatility. Remember, knowledge is your most powerful tool in a dynamic market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What happens when Bitcoin options expire? At expiration, traders must decide to exercise their right to buy/sell Bitcoin at the strike price or let the contract expire worthless. This flurry of activity can increase market volatility. What is a put/call ratio? It’s the number of put (sell) options divided by call (buy) options. A ratio above 1 suggests more traders are betting on or hedging against a price decrease. What is the “max pain” price? It’s the price at which the total financial loss for all option buyers is maximized (and seller gain is maximized). The market sometimes moves toward this price at expiry. Should I change my investment strategy because of options expiry? For long-term holders, typically no. These are short-term technical events. For active traders, it’s a factor to consider for timing entries/exits due to potential volatility. Where does this options data come from? The data is primarily reported by major crypto options exchanges like Deribit, which is the leader in this market segment. Do options expiries always move the market price? Not always, but they often create conditions ripe for volatility due to the hedging activity of large market makers. Found this breakdown of today’s crucial Bitcoin options expiry helpful?

This transaction, spotted by blockchain analysts, adds to a pattern of substantial movements from the prominent financial services firm. What does this mean for the market, and why would a major player shift such a large sum into an unknown wallet? Let’s explore the details and potential implications. What Does This Major Bitcoin Transfer Reveal? According to a report from Onchain Lens shared on X, the recipient address (bc1qp8…) has been receiving Bitcoin transfer batches from Galaxy Digital since December 9th. Therefore, this is not an isolated event but part of a coordinated accumulation strategy. The wallet’s total holdings have now ballooned to 1,900 BTC, valued at approximately $176 million. This scale of movement from a known institutional entity into an opaque destination naturally fuels speculation and analysis. For context, Galaxy Digital, founded by billionaire Mike Novogratz, is a heavyweight in crypto finance. Their actions are closely watched as a barometer for institutional sentiment. A Bitcoin transfer of this magnitude out of their known custody solutions could signal several strategic shifts. Why Would an Institution Use an Anonymous Wallet? Understanding the ‘why’ behind this Bitcoin transfer requires looking at common institutional practices. Moving assets to a new, private address isn’t necessarily alarming. However, it does raise important questions about strategy and security. Enhanced Security & Custody: The primary reason is often operational security. Institutions may rotate funds between wallets or migrate to new, more secure custody solutions. A fresh address with no transaction history can be harder to track and target. Preparing for a Transaction: This could be a preparatory move for a larger over-the-counter (OTC) trade, a collateralization event, or an allocation to a new fund or product. The anonymity prevents front-running in the markets. Internal Treasury Management: Large firms manage assets across multiple entities and balance sheets. This Bitcoin transfer might simply reflect an internal reallocation of assets between different subsidiaries or investment vehicles. What Are the Market Implications of This Move? While the exact purpose remains private, the market impact is tangible. Firstly, such visible movements can influence trader psychology. A large outflow from a known entity might be misinterpreted as a sell-off, causing short-term anxiety. Conversely, understanding it as a custody shift or strategic hold can reinforce beliefs in long-term Bitcoin accumulation by institutions. Moreover, this event highlights the transparency of blockchain. Every major Bitcoin transfer is public, allowing for real-time analysis. This transparency is a double-edged sword—it builds trust in the network’s integrity but also requires sophisticated interpretation to avoid misreading institutional intent. Key Takeaways for Crypto Observers This development offers several actionable insights for anyone following the crypto space. It underscores that institutional activity is multifaceted and not solely about buying or selling on public exchanges. The use of anonymous wallets is a standard practice for security and operational efficiency, not inherently secretive in a negative sense. Furthermore, tracking these flows is crucial. The pattern shows sustained accumulation into one address since December, suggesting a deliberate, long-term position is being built. For investors, this reinforces the narrative of continued institutional faith in Bitcoin as a core digital asset, regardless of short-term price volatility. Conclusion: Decoding the Signal in the Noise Galaxy Digital’s latest $64.8 million Bitcoin transfer is a powerful reminder of the dynamic and complex nature of institutional crypto management. While the destination wallet is anonymous, the action itself speaks volumes about ongoing strategic asset deployment. It reflects sophisticated custody practices and a potential commitment to holding substantial Bitcoin reserves off the public radar. For the market, the key lesson is to look beyond the headline and understand the common operational reasons behind such moves, which often signify long-term planning rather than imminent selling pressure. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is a large Bitcoin transfer to an anonymous wallet a sign of selling? A: Not necessarily. While it could precede a sale, it’s more commonly linked to security upgrades, internal treasury management, or preparing assets for other financial operations like collateralization. Q2: Why can we see this Bitcoin transfer if the wallet is anonymous? A: The Bitcoin blockchain is transparent; all transactions are public. We can see the amount, timestamp, and sending/receiving addresses. “Anonymous” means the owner of the address is not publicly known, not that the transaction is hidden. Q3: What is Galaxy Digital’s role in cryptocurrency? A: Galaxy Digital is a full-service financial services firm operating in the digital asset sector. It provides trading, asset management, investment banking, and mining services for institutions. Q4: How does this transfer affect Bitcoin’s price? A: The direct impact is often minimal if the coins are not sent to an exchange for sale. However, the news can influence market sentiment. Perceived as accumulation, it can be bullish; perceived as preparation to sell, it can be bearish. Q5: Should retail investors be concerned about such transfers? A: Retail investors should monitor them as part of overall market analysis but not overreact. Institutional moves are part of normal operations and should be considered within the broader context of market trends and fundamentals. Q6: What tools can track these Bitcoin transfers? A: Blockchain explorers like Blockchain.com, Etherscan (for wrapped BTC), and analytics platforms like Arkham Intelligence or Nansen are commonly used to track large wallet movements and cluster addresses.

This strategic timing signals an intensifying battle for supremacy in the foundational models that will power the next generation of decentralized applications, smart contracts, and automated crypto analysis tools. For investors and builders in the Web3 space, the capabilities of these agents to synthesize vast data sets could revolutionize due diligence, tokenomics research, and on-chain analytics. What is Google’s New Gemini Deep Research AI Agent? Google’s newly “reimagined” Gemini Deep Research is built on its flagship Gemini 3 Pro model. This isn’t just another chatbot. It’s an autonomous agent engineered for deep, complex reasoning tasks. Its core function is to ingest and synthesize “mountains of information” from large context prompts, producing comprehensive research outputs. Crucially, Google is now offering this capability to developers through its new Interactions API, allowing them to embed these advanced research functions directly into their own applications. This move is pivotal for the AI research agent ecosystem, enabling bespoke tools for crypto portfolio analysis, whitepaper summarization, and regulatory tracking. Why the Fight Against AI Hallucinations Matters for Crypto For any financial or technical analysis, accuracy is non-negotiable. Google emphasizes that Gemini 3 Pro is its “most factual” model, specifically trained to minimize hallucinations—those instances where an AI confidently invents false information. In the context of long, multi-step agentic tasks (like analyzing a project’s entire codebase or audit history), a single hallucination can corrupt the entire analysis. This focus on reliability is a direct response to a major pain point in deploying Google AI and other models for serious financial or technical work, where errors have real monetary consequences. Key Features of Gemini Deep Research vs. Traditional AI Models Feature Gemini Deep Research Standard LLM Primary Function Autonomous, multi-step research synthesis Single-turn Q&A or content generation Context Handling Massive context windows for deep dives Limited context, often summarized Output Structured reports, due diligence summaries Conversational responses, paragraphs Integration Via Interactions API for custom apps Often limited to chat interfaces Target Use Case Drug research, financial due diligence, technical analysis Customer service, content creation, brainstorming The Benchmark Wars: DeepSearchQA and Humanity’s Last Exam To prove its prowess, Google introduced a new benchmark, DeepSearchQA, designed to test agents on complex, multi-step information tasks. It has open-sourced this benchmark. More intriguingly, it tested its agent on “Humanity’s Last Exam,” an independent benchmark filled with niche general knowledge tasks. Google’s agent topped these charts. However, the released data showed OpenAI’s ChatGPT 5 Pro was a very close second, even slightly outperforming Google on the BrowserComp benchmark for browser-based tasks. This data was instantly overshadowed by the release of OpenAI GPT-5.2 (codenamed Garlic), which OpenAI claims now leads on key benchmarks. This relentless one-upmanship on AI benchmarks drives rapid iteration but also creates confusion in the market. OpenAI GPT-5.2: The Same-Day Counterpunch The narrative took another dramatic turn with OpenAI’s release of GPT-5.2 . The timing was unmistakably strategic. While the world awaited “Garlic,” Google seized the news cycle with its Deep Research announcement. OpenAI then fired back, claiming its new model now leads the pack. This tit-for-tat launch day highlights the fierce, real-time competition between the two giants. For the crypto and tech industry, this competition accelerates innovation but also presents a dilemma: which platform’s evolving capabilities should developers bet their next project on? Strategic Timing: Google’s announcement was clearly timed to blunt OpenAI’s news momentum. Performance Claims: Each company now claims benchmark leadership, making direct comparison difficult for users. Developer Mindshare: The battle is as much for developer adoption and ecosystem building as it is for raw model performance. What This Means for the Future of Search and Crypto Research Google plans to integrate Deep Research into Google Search, Finance, the Gemini App, and NotebookLM. This is a step toward a world where AI agents conduct research on our behalf. For crypto, this could manifest as: Automated Due Diligence: Agents scanning whitepapers, audit reports, GitHub activity, and team history to generate risk profiles. Real-time Sentiment & News Synthesis: Parsing thousands of news articles, social media posts, and forum discussions to gauge market sentiment. On-Chain Analysis Tools: Building custom agents that monitor wallet activity, liquidity pool changes, and smart contract interactions for actionable insights. The race between Google AI and OpenAI GPT-5.2 is no longer just about better chat. It’s about which company can provide the most reliable, powerful, and integratable brain for the autonomous agents that will increasingly manage our digital and financial lives. The launch-day clash proves both are all-in on this agentic future. Conclusion: An Accelerating Arms Race with High Stakes The dual launch of Google’s Gemini Deep Research and OpenAI’s GPT-5.2 marks a pivotal escalation in the AI war. It’s a transition from conversational AI to functional, autonomous research agents. The focus on combating hallucinations and handling deep, multi-step tasks shows the industry is maturing, targeting enterprise and high-stakes applications like finance and crypto. While benchmark claims will fly, the real test will be in production—which platform enables developers to build the most transformative and reliable tools first. For the crypto community, these advancements promise a new tier of analytical power, but they also demand heightened scrutiny of the underlying models’ accuracy and bias.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Gemini Deep Research? It is Google’s advanced autonomous AI agent, built on Gemini 3 Pro, designed to perform deep, multi-step research and synthesis tasks, moving beyond simple Q&A. What is GPT-5.2? GPT-5.2, codenamed “Garlic,” is OpenAI’s latest model release, announced the same day as Google’s agent. It claims improvements across standard benchmarks. Who leads in AI benchmarks now? Both companies claim leadership. Google’s agent led on its new DeepSearchQA and Humanity’s Last Exam benchmarks, while OpenAI claims GPT-5.2 now leads on a suite of standard tests. The landscape is highly dynamic. How can developers use Gemini Deep Research? Through Google’s new Interactions API, allowing the deep research capabilities to be embedded into third-party applications for customized use cases. Why is reducing AI hallucinations important? For long, complex tasks involving many autonomous decisions (like financial analysis), a single fabricated fact (hallucination) can invalidate the entire output, leading to faulty conclusions and potential losses.

For crypto investors scanning the horizon for the next big opportunity, a key metric just flashed a stagnant signal. The Altcoin Season Index is holding firm at 17, unchanged from the previous day. This low reading tells a clear story about the current market dynamic, but what does it mean for your portfolio? Let’s decode this crucial indicator and explore the actionable insights it provides. What Exactly Is the Altcoin Season Index? CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index is a vital tool for gauging market sentiment. It measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. The calculation is straightforward but powerful. The index asks one simple question: are altcoins outperforming the king of crypto? An official altcoin season is declared when 75% of these top coins beat Bitcoin’s returns over the preceding three months. Conversely, a Bitcoin season occurs when BTC outshines the majority of altcoins. The index score itself ranges from 0 to 100. Therefore, a reading closer to 100 signals a stronger, more pervasive altcoin season. Why Is a Score of 17 Significant for the Altcoin Season Index? A score of 17 on the Altcoin Season Index is far from the 75 threshold needed to declare a season. This low and steady number indicates we are firmly in a Bitcoin-dominant market phase. Here’s what this current reading typically means for investors: Bitcoin Leadership: Capital and attention are primarily flowing into Bitcoin, often driven by macro factors like ETF approvals or institutional interest. Altcoin Patience: Most alternative cryptocurrencies are struggling to keep pace, waiting for a broader risk-on sentiment to return to the crypto market. Consolidation Phase: This period can be a time of accumulation for strong altcoin projects, building a base for their next move. This index is not a crystal ball, but a diagnostic tool. It confirms the prevailing trend, helping you align your strategy with the market’s current rhythm. How Can You Use the Altcoin Season Index in Your Strategy? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index is one thing; applying it is another. With the index stuck at 17, consider these actionable insights for your crypto investment approach. First, manage your expectations. A low index suggests chasing quick, massive gains in random altcoins is a high-risk strategy. The wind is not at their backs. Second, this is an ideal time for research. Use this quieter period to deeply analyze fundamental projects without the noise of a frenzied bull market. Finally, consider a phased approach. You might: Maintain a core position in Bitcoin while the trend is clear. Dollar-cost average into high-conviction altcoin picks at lower prices. Set alerts for when the Altcoin Season Index begins a sustained climb above 50, signaling a potential shift. What Triggers a Shift in the Altcoin Season Index? The index doesn’t move on its own. It reacts to market forces. For the Altcoin Season Index to rise from 17 towards 75, specific catalysts are usually required. Historically, a sustained Bitcoin rally often comes first, bringing new capital and confidence into the entire crypto ecosystem. Once Bitcoin’s price stabilizes at a higher level, that confidence and capital begin to ‘rotate’ into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. This rotation is what powers the index upward. Other triggers can include breakthrough developments in major altcoin sectors like DeFi or NFTs, or a significant reduction in macroeconomic uncertainty that boosts risk appetite. Conclusion: Navigating the Calm Before the Storm The Altcoin Season Index holding at 17 is a snapshot of a patient market. It signals a period of Bitcoin strength and altcoin consolidation, not a period of altcoin opportunity. For the savvy investor, this is not a time for disappointment, but for preparation. Use this data to fortify your portfolio’s foundation, conduct rigorous research, and develop a clear plan for when the index’s needle finally starts to swing. By understanding this metric, you move from reacting to market noise to responding to market structure. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Where can I find the current Altcoin Season Index reading? A1: The index is published and tracked by CoinMarketCap. You can typically find it on their website or data platforms that aggregate market metrics. Q2: Does a low index mean I should sell all my altcoins? A2: Not necessarily. A low index indicates a trend, not an absolute rule. It suggests caution and selective investment rather than a wholesale exit, especially for projects with strong fundamentals. Q3: How often does the Altcoin Season Index update? A3: The index is typically updated daily, reflecting the rolling 90-day performance data of the top cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin. Q4: Has an altcoin season ever started from a low index like 17? A4: Yes, altcoin seasons often begin from periods of Bitcoin dominance. The key is to watch for a sustained, multi-week upward trend in the index value, not just a single-day spike. Q5: Are all altcoins included in the index calculation? A5: No. The index specifically analyzes the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like WBTC) to give a pure performance comparison.

While ETH stabilizes under familiar resistance levels, a new altcoin priced at $0.035 has surged 250% and is moving through its final allocation window. With attention shifting toward early-stage assets that still offer meaningful room to grow, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now being compared to Ethereum as traders evaluate what may deliver stronger performance in 2026. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum remains one of the most important assets in the entire market. It holds a massive market cap, supports the majority of decentralized applications and serves as the foundation for major sectors such as DeFi, NFTs and layer-2 networks. ETH has produced major returns since launch and played a key role in building the crypto landscape. But the same size that made Ethereum strong is now one of its biggest obstacles. Large-cap assets move more slowly because they require heavy liquidity to break through price barriers. ETH faces repeated resistance near the $3,100 to $3,400 zone. Many traders say the next top crypto cycle may give ETH a modest boost rather than a breakout. A common view is that Ethereum may deliver small gains, but not the kind of high-multiple returns early-cycle investors are looking for. This has shifted attention toward lower-priced tokens with earlier positioning and stronger upside potential, especially those backed by meaningful utility rather than speculation alone. That is where Mutuum Finance is beginning to stand out. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized lending protocol built on structured borrowing and lending mechanics. The system uses two connected markets to give lenders and borrowers clear financial environments. In the Peer to Contract market, users lend assets such as ETH or USDT into the protocol. They receive mtTokens. mtTokens increase in value as borrowers repay interest. For example, someone lending $500 of USDT may watch mtTokens grow as the protocol gains users. This creates a natural APY based on real activity inside the system. The Peer to Peer market allows borrowers to form direct agreements with lenders. Borrowing rates shift with liquidity. When liquidity is strong, borrowing stays affordable. When liquidity weakens, borrowing becomes more expensive. Loan-to-value rules help protect users by setting boundaries for collateral. If collateral falls too far, liquidation may occur. Liquidators repay part of the debt and receive discounted collateral. This approach keeps the system predictable when market prices move fast. These mechanics give Mutuum Finance a functional DeFi structure that operates very differently from ETH. Ethereum’s value comes from ecosystem demand, while MUTM’s value comes from protocol activity, interest repayment, mtToken performance and revenue-driven buy pressure. Presale Progress and Expanding Participation Mutuum Finance began its presale in early 2025 at $0.01. Since then it has surged to $0.035, reflecting a 250% increase during development. The project has now raised $19.250M and grown to 18,500 holders. More than 815M tokens have been purchased so far. Out of the total 4B MUTM supply, 1.82B tokens, equal to 45.5%, were allocated for the presale. Phase 6 is now over 96% allocated, and the next stage will introduce a nearly 20% price increase as the project moves toward the final pre-launch structure. The official listing price is set at $0.06, which positions Phase 1 participants for a 500% appreciation at launch. Community participation remains high due to the 24-hour leaderboard, where the top buyer each day receives $500 in MUTM. This has kept daily traffic strong and improved visibility. Mutuum Finance also supports card payment, which has helped onboard new users quickly. Security has been one of the project’s most emphasized areas. Mutuum Finance completed a CertiK audit, scoring 90/100, and Halborn Security is currently reviewing the protocol’s borrowing, liquidation and repayment logic. A $50,000 bug bounty is active as well. These steps have helped build confidence as the project prepares for its first public version. V1 Testnet, Development and Why These Matter for 2026 Mutuum Finance confirmed through its official X account that the V1 testnet will launch in Q4 2025. V1 introduces the liquidity pool, mtTokens, the liquidation engine and the debt module. ETH and USDT will be the first supported assets. This will be the first time users can interact with the protocol in a live environment. The project is also preparing a USD-pegged stablecoin supported by borrower interest. Stablecoins are important for lending systems because they create predictable borrowing conditions and reduce exposure to volatility. They also expand liquidity, which increases borrowing and lending volume. Analysts expect that stablecoin integration will play a major role in Mutuum Finance’s growth curve once V1 is active. Mutuum Finance plans to expand across several layer-2 networks. L2 deployment helps lower transaction fees and improve processing speed. Lending platforms rely on frequent updates to collateral levels, interest rates and liquidations. Faster settlement is essential for a smooth user experience. Why Ethereum’s Outlook Looks Slower Ethereum’s growth expectations for 2026 show limited upside. Many traders expect ETH to rise only modestly due to its size, resistance zones and slowing momentum. Mutuum Finance sits on the opposite side of the spectrum. It is early, priced low, backed by functional lending mechanics, supported by a buy-and-distribute engine, tied to mtToken yield and preparing for a fully audited V1 launch. The early structural combination gives MUTM the kind of setup analysts typically associate with high-multiple moves. Mutuum Finance, by contrast, has the foundational elements that historically supported early breakouts in prior cycles. The demand surge in Phase 6, the high number of holders, the $19.250M raised, and the upcoming price increase in Phase 7 all add pressure as the project approaches its next crypto stage.

While rate cuts typically support risk assets, Jerome Powell’s comments added a new layer of uncertainty to the market. Related Reading: The Whale Who Can’t Stop Buying: BitcoinOG Scales Ethereum Long To $280M After Price Surge By openly acknowledging the risks of weaker growth paired with persistent inflation, Powell introduced the possibility of stagflation—a scenario that historically challenges both equities and crypto. As a result, sentiment across the market remains fragile, and investors are struggling to interpret what this macro shift could mean for Ethereum’s next move. Despite the volatility surrounding the decision, one major whale continues to act with conviction. According to Lookonchain, the Bitcoin OG who famously shorted the market during the October 10 crash is once again doubling down on his bullish Ethereum position. Instead of taking profits or reducing exposure after the recent rally, he has continued accumulating aggressively, signaling a strong belief in ETH’s medium-term trajectory even as broader sentiment turns cautious. Whale Position Ramps Up, But Risk Is Rising According to Lookonchain, the whale’s position has now surged to 120,094 ETH, valued at approximately $392.5 million. With a liquidation price at $2,234.69, this has become one of the largest and most aggressive long positions currently tracked on-chain. Such a massive allocation signals extreme conviction, especially coming from the same Bitcoin OG who successfully shorted the market during the October 10 crash. However, the scale of this bet also highlights how much risk is now concentrated in a single directional position. The liquidation price is a key concern. At $2,234, it sits nearly $1,000 below current levels, but in highly leveraged environments—especially during macro uncertainty—prices can retrace violently. Ethereum has already shown a tendency toward sharp intraday moves, and with funding rates rising and leverage across the market stretching to historical highs, even a moderate correction could trigger cascading liquidations. If ETH experiences a sudden spike in volatility due to shifting macro conditions, a negative reaction to the latest FOMC decision, or a broader market unwind, the whale’s position could come under significant pressure. While large whales often influence market sentiment, this setup illustrates how thin the margin for error has become. Related Reading: Why Ethereum’s Rally Isn’t Overheated – And Where Demand Must Grow Next ETH Testing Resistance While Momentum Weakens Ethereum has retraced to the $3,196 level after failing to hold above the $3,300 zone, signaling that bullish momentum is beginning to weaken. The daily chart shows ETH rejecting the red 200-day moving average, a key long-term trend indicator that has acted as resistance throughout the recent downtrend. Until ETH breaks and closes decisively above this level, the broader structure remains vulnerable. The 50-day moving average is still sloping downward, reflecting persistent selling pressure despite last week’s rebound. Meanwhile, the 100-day moving average sits well above the current price, reinforcing the heavy overhead resistance ETH must overcome to reestablish a bullish trend. Volume has also declined compared to the early December bounce, suggesting buyers are losing strength as price approaches major resistance levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Fall To Lowest Levels on Record: The Bullish Signal Most Traders Are Missing Structurally, ETH remains in a mid-term downtrend, forming lower highs and lower lows since September. Although the recent push from the $2,800 region shows buyers defending key support, the rejection at $3,350 highlights that sellers are still in control at higher levels. If ETH fails to regain the 200-day moving average soon, a retest of the $3,050–$3,100 support range becomes likely. Conversely, a strong reclaim above $3,350 could open the door for a move toward $3,500, but the market will need renewed momentum to get there.

Next week, the US Senate will hold a crucial vote to confirm the chairs of two powerful financial watchdogs—the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). This decision will directly shape the rules of the game for the entire cryptocurrency sector. Why is this US Senate vote on CFTC and FDIC chairs so important? The US Senate vote on CFTC and FDIC chairs is not just routine Washington procedure. It’s a decision with profound consequences for market stability and innovation. The CFTC oversees derivatives markets, including crypto futures and swaps, while the FDIC insures bank deposits and influences how traditional banks interact with crypto firms. Their leadership sets the regulatory tone. If confirmed, Michael Selig will lead the CFTC and acting Chair Travis Hill will officially head the FDIC. Their approaches to enforcement, rule-making, and industry guidance will either foster a clear, supportive environment or create new hurdles for crypto businesses and investors. What does this mean for the future of cryptocurrency? The outcome of this US Senate vote on CFTC and FDIC chairs will send immediate signals to the market. Regulatory clarity is the single biggest request from institutional investors. Confirmation of these nominees could accelerate progress on several fronts: Market Structure: Clearer rules for crypto exchanges and trading platforms. Consumer Protection: Enhanced safeguards against fraud and manipulation. Banking Access: Improved relationships between crypto companies and FDIC-insured banks. Innovation Pathways: Defined frameworks for new products like spot Bitcoin ETFs and tokenized assets. However, challenges remain. The division of authority between the CFTC and the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) over different crypto assets is still a complex issue. The leadership confirmed by this US Senate vote will need to navigate this jurisdictional overlap carefully. Actionable insights for the crypto community While the US Senate vote on CFTC and FDIC chairs happens in Washington, its effects ripple out to every participant in the crypto ecosystem. Here’s what you should watch for in the coming weeks: Post-Confirmation Statements: Listen for the first public remarks from the confirmed chairs regarding their regulatory priorities for digital assets. Enforcement Trends: Monitor whether the CFTC under new leadership increases or refines its enforcement actions against unregistered crypto derivatives platforms. Banking Guidance: Watch for any new FDIC bulletins that clarify risk management for banks dealing with crypto asset custodianship. Legislative Momentum: This vote could catalyze movement on broader crypto legislation, such as market structure bills, that have been stalled in Congress. The key takeaway? Regulatory uncertainty is a major market risk. A smooth confirmation process and the installation of permanent leadership can help reduce that risk, potentially leading to greater institutional capital inflows and mainstream adoption. The bottom line for investors and builders This upcoming US Senate vote on CFTC and FDIC chairs represents a critical inflection point. For years, the crypto industry has operated in a patchwork regulatory environment. The individuals leading these agencies will be responsible for interpreting and enforcing rules that are still being written. A stable, predictable regulatory framework is the foundation for sustainable growth. It protects consumers, deters bad actors, and gives legitimate projects the confidence to build and innovate. The vote next week is a significant step toward establishing that framework. Therefore, the entire sector has a vested interest in its outcome. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who are the nominees for the CFTC and FDIC chairs? A1: The nominee for CFTC Chair is Michael Selig. The nominee for FDIC Chair is the current acting chair, Travis Hill. Q2: When exactly is the US Senate vote scheduled? A2: The confirmation votes are scheduled for early next week, according to reports from CoinDesk. Q3: How does the CFTC regulate cryptocurrency? A3: The CFTC regulates cryptocurrency derivatives, such as futures and swaps contracts, treating Bitcoin and Ether as commodities under its jurisdiction. Q4: What is the FDIC’s role in crypto? A4: The FDIC insures deposits at US banks. Its policies influence whether and how traditional banks can provide services to cryptocurrency companies, which is crucial for crypto banking and custody solutions. Q5: Will this vote immediately change crypto regulations? A5: Not immediately. The vote confirms the leaders. Regulatory change is a slower process involving proposed rules, public comments, and final rulings. However, leadership sets the agenda and enforcement priorities. Q6: Why should an average crypto investor care about this? A6: Clear regulation reduces systemic risk, deters fraud, and can lead to more investment products (like ETFs) becoming available, ultimately creating a safer and more robust market for all participants.

According to live data from Binance’s USDT trading pair, BTC is currently trading around $91,960.31. This sudden move has left many investors wondering: is this a minor correction or the start of a deeper trend? Let’s unpack the situation. What’s Driving the Current Bitcoin Price Action? Market movements rarely happen in a vacuum. While the immediate Bitcoin price drop is clear, several underlying factors often contribute to such shifts. Understanding these can provide much-needed context for traders and long-term holders alike. Firstly, broader market sentiment plays a huge role. When traditional markets like stocks experience volatility, cryptocurrency often follows. Secondly, on-chain data, such as exchange inflows and outflows, can signal whether large holders are accumulating or distributing their coins. Finally, technical analysis levels, like the $92,000 mark, act as psychological barriers for traders. How Should Investors React to BTC Volatility? Seeing the Bitcoin price dip can trigger emotional decisions. However, a strategic approach is far more effective. Here are three actionable insights for navigating this volatility: Review Your Strategy: Does this dip align with your buying targets, or was your plan to hold regardless of short-term noise? Assess Risk: Ensure your portfolio allocation to crypto still matches your personal risk tolerance. Look for Context: Check if this drop is isolated to Bitcoin or if the entire crypto market is moving in sync. Remember, Bitcoin’s history is defined by cycles of dramatic peaks and troughs. Short-term price action, while important, is just one piece of the long-term puzzle. Is This a Buying Opportunity or a Warning Sign? This is the million-dollar question every investor is asking. The answer depends entirely on your perspective and goals. For some, a pullback in the Bitcoin price presents a chance to ‘buy the dip’ at a more attractive entry point. For others, especially short-term traders, it may signal a shift in momentum that warrants caution. Key indicators to watch now include whether Bitcoin can reclaim the $92,000 level as support and the trading volume accompanying the move. High volume on a down day can suggest stronger selling pressure. Conversely, stabilizing at a new level with lower volume might indicate the sell-off is exhausting itself. Conclusion: Navigating the Waves of Crypto Markets Today’s Bitcoin price movement below $92,000 serves as a potent reminder of the asset’s inherent volatility. While headlines focus on the number, savvy participants look deeper at the ‘why’ and the ‘what next.’ Whether you view this as a temporary setback or a significant shift, informed decisions based on data and a clear personal strategy will always outperform reactive, emotion-driven trading. The market’s next move is uncertain, but your preparedness doesn’t have to be. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why did the Bitcoin price fall below $92,000? The price drop is likely due to a combination of factors including broader market sentiment, profit-taking by short-term traders, and a break below a key technical support level that triggered automated sell orders. Should I sell my Bitcoin now? This is a personal decision based on your investment strategy. If you are a long-term holder believing in Bitcoin’s fundamentals, short-term dips may be less relevant. Always consult your financial plan. How low could the Bitcoin price go? Predicting exact price floors is impossible. Analysts watch other support levels, like $90,000 or $88,000, but market conditions can change rapidly. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? For investors using a ‘Dollar-Cost Averaging’ (DCA) strategy, any price can be a good time to buy a small, scheduled amount. For others, it may present a lower entry point than yesterday, but there are no guarantees. What is the best platform to track the Bitcoin price? Reputable cryptocurrency data aggregators and major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken provide real-time price data. Always use multiple sources for verification. Will this affect other cryptocurrencies? Typically, yes. Bitcoin often sets the trend for the wider crypto market. When BTC experiences significant volatility, altcoins frequently follow suit, often with greater intensity. Found this analysis helpful? Understanding market moves empowers the entire community.
