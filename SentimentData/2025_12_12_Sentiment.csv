Related Reading: Upcoming Crypto Market Structure Bill Markup Likely Pushed To Post-Holiday As traders react to mixed Federal Reserve messaging, institutional flows, and rising caution across risk markets, analysts remain split on whether Bitcoin’s latest consolidation represents stability, or a deeper shift in how the asset behaves. Analysts Question Whether the Cycle Has Ended A growing number of major firms now argue that Bitcoin may be moving beyond its historic halving-driven rhythm. Investment firm Bernstein said in a recent note that the asset is in an “elongated bull cycle,” pointing to minimal ETF outflows despite a nearly 30% correction. The firm has raised its 2026 price target to $150,000, projecting a potential cycle peak of $200,000 in 2027 and maintaining a $1 million long-term estimate for 2033. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood echoed this view, saying that institutional adoption is reducing the likelihood of the steep 75–90% drawdowns seen in previous cycles. Grayscale has also suggested Bitcoin could break the four-year pattern, forecasting renewed strength in 2026. Bitcoin is currently trading near $90,000–$93,000 depending on the venue, with recent intraday swings highlighting a lack of strong directional conviction. Fed Signals Keep Markets Cautious The Federal Reserve’s 25 bps rate cut initially lifted risk sentiment, but a shift toward cautious, data-dependent language quickly reversed momentum. Bitcoin and Ethereum slipped after the announcement, with BTC falling below $90,000 at one point as traders reassessed the macro backdrop. Liquidity remains thin, contributing to choppy movements across major crypto assets. Analysts note that Bitcoin’s inability to sustain gains, despite the weaker dollar and softer Fed stance, reflects persistent uncertainty. Several commentators say BTC must hold above $90,000 to avoid strengthening bearish pressure, while a break above $94,500 could reopen a path toward $100,000 if inflows improve. Derivatives and On-Chain Data Flag Rising Bearish Sentiment Options and on-chain indicators are also signaling caution. Traders have increased bearish option positions, with the put/call ratio turning positive ahead of a significant expiry window. More than $500 million in crypto liquidations occurred within 24 hours, reflecting heightened volatility. On-chain data shows declining bullish momentum. The Bitcoin Bull Score Index has fallen back to zero, and realized losses suggest further downside could be possible. Analysts warn that despite past buy-the-dip patterns, current readings do not yet reflect the levels typically associated with market bottoms.

The project’s initial phase sold out its allotment of 10 million tokens and secured $500,000 in funding. This early success has only grown, with total sales now climbing past 23 million tokens and funds raised exceeding $1 million from a strong community of over 2,400 investors . As a fully-featured non-custodial ecosystem, GeeFi is proving its utility, and analysts forecast that Phase 3 will be fully subscribed in under 10 days due to ongoing talk of major exchange listings. An Answer to Avalanche’s Congestion Problems While Avalanche (AVAX) faces challenges with network congestion and performance during periods of high activity, investors are shifting their attention to more reliable and user-centric platforms. This search has led many to discover GeeFi , a project that a growing chorus of experts is labeling 2026’s 100x gem . It offers a single, cohesive dashboard for overseeing digital funds across more than 14 networks , letting users swap tokens and move between chains without the usual technical difficulties. This comprehensive system solves a major fragmentation issue for crypto holders. The GeeFi Team , which started development in 2023, prioritized having a working product ready for its 2024 public launch. In contrast to many projects that debut with only a concept, GeeFi presented a functional platform before asking for public funds. Its architecture guarantees users maintain full authority over their private keys, putting security first. With the Android app live and an iOS version on the horizon, GeeFi is demonstrating its dedication to real-world progress, which strengthens the forecast that it is 2026’s 100x gem . The Strategic Power of the GeeFi Presale GeeFi is currently in the second phase of its presale, with tokens offered at the accessible price of $0.06 . This price point ensures early investors a guaranteed 667% return , based on the established $0.40 listing price . The potential for financial growth is massive; a $1,800 investment at this stage could become $90,000 if the token achieves the analysts’ $3 valuation target, representing an astonishing 4,900% ROI . The market’s reaction to the presale has been exceptionally positive. The quick completion of Phase 1 has fueled Phase 2, which is now more than 80% sold out . This stage alone has drawn over $750K from the sale of 13 million tokens . Industry specialists predict Phase 3 will begin next week and conclude swiftly as excitement builds around GeeFi’s expected debut on leading exchanges. This powerful demand reinforces its standing as 2026’s 100x gem . Earn High Returns via Staking and Community Referrals A key element drawing investors to GeeFi is its rewarding staking program. Participants can generate significant passive income through various flexible options. By locking their tokens, users can secure 15% APR for one month , 22% APR for three months , or a top-tier 55% APR for a 12-month period . For those who need constant access to their capital, a liquid option provides returns up to 10% with no lock-up requirement . To further amplify community growth, GeeFi includes a valuable referral system. By sharing a personal link, users get a 5% bonus in GEE tokens on every purchase made through their network. This structure incentivizes organic expansion and helps early backers multiply their holdings efficiently. These income-generating tools make the project a compelling choice for investors focused on portfolio optimization. A Final Opportunity for a Ground-Floor Investment Chances to invest in a project with such strong utility before it gains mainstream recognition are often brief. GeeFi’s presale is a limited-time event to get involved before the general market takes notice. With its deflationary tokenomics, a working product, and a development plan that includes a crypto debit card, GeeFi is positioned to become a key player in the industry. The rapid sales rate is a clear indicator of strong market belief. As the industry gets ready for its next growth cycle, projects with solid fundamentals are expected to outperform. Overlooking GeeFi now could lead to major regret when the token is listed on major exchanges, validating the prediction that it is 2026’s 100x gem . The time to act is now. Securing your allocation is the best way to leverage the extraordinary growth that experts are forecasting.

Early reactions are emerging, but momentum remains weak, raising the big question: Is SOL preparing for one more leg down, or could a surprise bottom quietly be forming beneath the surface? Solana Slides Into A Critical Support Zone Crypto analyst More Crypto Online, in an update shared on X, revealed that SOL has recently dropped into a major support band. This crucial zone stretches from $118 up to roughly $138.30. The analyst emphasizes that this is the exact region where the market must definitively prove that robust demand is still present to prevent further structural decline. Related Reading: Solana Price Faces Critical Test Near $140 While Analysts Track KOL Indicators and Liquidity Shifts While examining the smallest timeframes, the analyst noted that there are indeed early attempts at a reaction developing within this broad support band. However, the expert warns that these reactions currently lack conviction and do not yet display the sustained buying strength necessary to signal a durable reversal. More Crypto Online includes a more bullish possibility, which he labels the “white scenario,” where the broader B-wave correction could finish at any point within this current support region. If successfully confirmed, it would effectively establish a definitive low and open the door for Solana to rechallenge its previous cycle highs by initiating a powerful C-wave rally. However, the core problem preventing a definitive bullish call is that the recovery observed from the recent swing low has not exhibited the characteristics of an impulsive advance. As long as that remains the case, the analyst concludes that a deeper dip is the more realistic path, cautioning traders to prepare for a potential test of levels below the current support range. A–B–C Correction Still In Play For Solana According to More Crypto Online, Solana’s price action continues to mirror the broader structure seen on Bitcoin. The ongoing decline can still be viewed as an A–B–C corrective pattern within the orange scenario, with the final C wave unfolding as a five-legged move. If this interpretation holds, the last leg of the correction still has room to extend further, potentially reaching the $81 to $90 zone. Related Reading: Reversal Loading? Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Build Powerful High-Time-Frame Structures The analyst noted that the current upswing resembles an internal wave 4 rally. Under this outlook, the market could still produce one more low, completing the final leg of the corrective wave before a more reliable reversal structure begins to form. Solana now sits at a key decision point, but the Elliott Wave framework indicates that bearish pressure may not be fully exhausted. Until the structure confirms a shift with impulsive upward movement, the chart still allows for another push lower before a durable trend change can develop.

Manche has pledged $100 million to support blockchain founders. Founders familiar with and trusted by the Nyx Group are the only individuals eligible for Rushi Manche’s $100 million support initiative. He indicated that additional information about the partners would be shared soon. What is Rushi Manche doing now? Former Movement Labs co-founder Rushi Manche has made a reappearance in the crypto industry with Nyx Group, a multi-strategy investment initiative. Nyx Group announced in an official statement that it plans to deploy up to $100 million into liquid markets while offering operational support to token-launching project founders. The initiative brings together multiple partners and family offices, but Manche has not yet disclosed the specific backers. The investment group aims to address what Manche describes as a critical gap in the current crypto landscape, where founders have limited access to capital during challenging market conditions. Nyx Group will also offer hands-on support to help founders secure capital, attract investors, set up their foundations, and connect with key partners. “Crypto is entering a new chapter rife with opportunity and uncertainty,” Manche said in the announcement. “Nyx Group aims to match founders we know and trust with the funds and hands-on counsel they need to bring important, transformative tokens and projects to life.” How will Nyx Group invest its $100M fund? Nyx Group explained that investments will be limited to founders the team knows personally and deeply trusts. The group will also only back founders building projects that add value through community-oriented initiatives or technological innovation. Manche claims that Nyx Group has already been operating for a few months and has made some initial investments, but he didn’t provide specific details. Investment decisions are made by committee, and the group is reportedly focusing on founders backed by reputable funds or showing traction in areas like revenue, active users, and community strength. Manche emphasized this approach reflects the type of support he wished he had during his own entrepreneurial journey. Nyx Group is also considering taking governance positions, foundation roles, or board seats in supported projects. Before Nyx Group, Manche was booted from Movement Labs, the blockchain infrastructure startup he co-founded with fellow Vanderbilt University dropout, Cooper Scanlon. Movement Labs suspended co-founder Rushi Manche while it investigated allegations of organizational governance in May 2025 after Coinbase delisted the MOVE token. The scandal involved 66 million MOVE tokens that were dumped on the market in December 2024, which resulted in $38 million in profits for a market maker called Rentech. Coinbase suspended trading of the MOVE token after it was reported that a market maker had been involved in a token dump. At the time, CoinDesk reported that it had seen evidence that shadow advisers received large token allocations as part of questionable agreements with Movement Labs, citing internal documents it reviewed. Cryptopolitan previously reported that the scandal exposed chaotic internal operations and raised questions about governance and oversight. Movement Labs hired blockchain intelligence firm Groom Lake to conduct a third-party review of the situation. The fallout damaged Movement Labs’ reputation significantly, and the company’s MOVE token saw its price tumble by 23% to an all-time low of $0.18 at the time, following the Coinbase delisting announcement. The token has since lost over 70% of its value from its all-time high. Movement Labs first suspended Manche in May before it eventually let him go on May 7. The company announced it would continue under different leadership, rebranding as Move Industries with Torab Torabi as CEO and Will Gaines as president.

Speaking on Bloomberg’s The Mishal Husain Show, Mustafa vowed that Microsoft’s focus is building super intelligence aligned with human interests, not chasing raw power at any cost. “We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” Mustafa said during the interview. He added that this stance should not be controversial, calling it an obvious position, even though he believes it is still rare across the AI industry. Microsoft regains freedom to build advanced AI systems Mustafa joined Microsoft early last year after the company acquired the intellectual property and much of the team behind his startup, Inflection AI after abandoning OpenAI for consumer-facing AI tools. After the acquisition, Mustafa was tasked with building products that could compete directly with the strongest models already on the market. For much of that time, his work came with limits. Contractual terms tied to Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI blocked the company from developing artificial general intelligence, defined as systems that can perform at human level, as well as superintelligence, which would surpass human abilities. Mustafa said Microsoft gave up those rights in exchange for access to OpenAI’s latest models. That arrangement also involved Microsoft building and equipping data centers for OpenAI over several years. That structure changed in October.A new deal reshaped the relationship and returned development rights to Microsoft. Mustafa said OpenAI now has infrastructure agreements with other partners, including SoftBank and Oracle, to build more data centers than Microsoft was willing to commit. “They now have deals with SoftBank and many others – Oracle – to build more data centers than Microsoft wanted to build for them,” he said. “And so, in return, we then have the right to go develop our own AI.” He said Microsoft has remained a general-purpose AI developer over the past 18 months but is now moving into work that could exceed human performance across tasks. “We’ve still been a general-purpose AI development shop over the last 18 months, but now we can work on some techniques and methodologies that have the potential to exceed human performance at all tasks,” Mustafa said . “And so, it is a shift for us.” Suleyman outlines cautious approach as tools remain unfinished Last month, Mustafa had formally announced the superintelligence effort in a blog post that laid out Microsoft’s position that such systems must be designed to serve people. Other major players, including OpenAI and Anthropic PBC, often make similar claims about safety and human benefit. “Everybody has to decide what they stand for and how they operate, and I don’t want to judge how they’re operating right now,” he said. “I don’t see any evidence of large-scale mass harm.” Despite the long-term focus on superintelligence, Mustafa said the current debate remains academic. Consumers expect assistants that can handle tasks like booking tickets or organizing shopping plans. Executives expect productivity gains. Neither group is fully there yet. Mustafa pointed to Microsoft’s Copilot consumer assistant as proof.He said its agent-like features are still being tested and do not always perform as intended. “We’re still experimenting with it,” said Mustafa. “But when it does work, it is the most magical thing you’ve ever seen.” Don’t just read crypto news.

With U.S. 401(k) plans holding approximately $12.5 trillion, even modest crypto allocations could propel the Bitcoin price prediction into unprecedented bullish territory. U.S Congress Pushes for Bitcoin In Retirement Portfolio In a formal December 11 letter addressed to SEC Chairman Paul Atkins, Congress expressed support for President Trump’s August 2025 executive order directing the Department of Labor and SEC to revise regulations currently restricting 401(k) investment options. BREAKING Congress is urging SEC Chair Atkins to allow Bitcoin and crypto in 401(k) accounts pic.twitter.com/UMUScJaJ5x — Quinten | 048.eth (@QuintenFrancois) December 11, 2025 The initiative aims to provide ordinary workers with investment choices comparable to those available to large pension funds. According to White House data , total U.S. retirement assets reached $43.4 trillion as of March 31, 2025, yet most savers remain blocked from accessing alternative investments. Lawmakers contend that permitting measured allocations into these assets could improve risk-adjusted returns and bring retirement investment strategies into the modern era. Industry experts view this policy evolution as a pivotal moment for Bitcoin’s integration into traditional finance. Analysts calculate that even minimal allocations, ranging from 1–3%, from retirement funds could generate tens of billions in fresh buying pressure, potentially driving BTC to record highs. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Technical Setup Shows Mid-Cycle Correction The weekly chart reveals Bitcoin retreating from the substantial $100,000–$108,000 resistance zone after failing to maintain support above it, creating a distinct mid-cycle pullback. Price currently hovers around $90,000, positioned just above the critical long-term weekly support near $76,000, which represents the essential structural foundation for preserving the broader uptrend. The MACD remains deep in bearish territory but is starting to flatten, suggesting downside momentum may be weakening after months of selling pressure. Source: TradingView If Bitcoin can recapture the $100,000–$108,000 region and subsequently break through the next major pivot at $116,000 , the chart structure supports continuation of the bull run toward the projected target around $131,000. This Presale Raised $2.3M – Is Pepenode the Next PEPE? If Bitcoin starts going up again and people begin putting their retirement money into crypto, meme coins like Pepenode (PEPENODE) could see big price jumps. Pepenode is a new crypto project that’s already raised over $2.3 million, even though the market has been tough. It’s a game where you can “mine” coins without needing any expensive computer equipment.

DOGE’s current price means that it’s now down by 7.5% in a week and by 22% in a month, while the meme token – the tenth-biggest coin in the market – has suffered a 65% decline in a year. However, while the past couple of months have been negative for DOGE and for the wider market, Dogecoin has plenty of things to look forward to on a more fundamental level, including the arrival of a bridge with Solana. Psy Protocol will unveil this bridge for the first time at this week’s DogeCon, an event which has very positive implications for the Dogecoin Price Prediction , in the short- and long-term. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Dogecoin–Solana Integration Announced – Is This the Biggest Partnership of 2025? First announced in May, Psy Protocol’s Solana-Dogecoin bridge will use DOGE’s proof-of-work consensus as its underlying validation layer, something which Psy Protocol says will make it one of the most secure bridges in crypto. (2/4) Bridge hacks have cost crypto users over $2.8B. Psy’s solution? Trustlessly validating Dogecoin's PoW consensus on Solana and leveraging the @wormhole guardian network to ensure safe, fast and user friendly bridging between chains. — Psy Protocol (@PsyProtocol) May 22, 2025 At the same time, the bridge will enable Dogecoin holders to deploy their DOGE on Solana, making use of the latter’s speed and DeFi ecosystem. While it hasn’t yet launched, Psy Protocol will show it off for the first time at DogeCon, and its eventual launch could be a massive boost for the Dogecoin price going forward. It would certainly benefit from a boost right about now, given how much the market has oversold in recent weeks and months. As we see from its chart, October, November, and the start of December have been largely negative for the token, making a rebound likelier. This is what its relative strength index (yellow) tells us, since its recovery above 50 is now long overdue. Source: TradingView At the same time, we see that the Dogecoin price has been trading within an increasingly narrow pennant, and that this pennant is about to converge. This could mean that we’re about to see a breakout, potentially one that may come in time for the traditional festive-season bull rally. Not only is the market overdue for a big rally, but Dogecoin has lots to recommend it, and not just the forthcoming bridge with Solana. Recent weeks have also welcomed the launch of several DOGE ETFs , widening potential institutional investment in the token. As such, the coin could be in for a massive 2026, ending the year at around $0.20 and reaching $0.40 by Q1 of next year. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Reaches $29.3 Million: Is This L2 the Next Big Thing? Traders wanting to move beyond major tokens may also want to check out some of the more promising presale coins, since these can often rally hard when they list. The biggest presale happening at the moment belongs to Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a new layer-two network for Bitcoin . $HYPER is Unstoppable. 29M Raised! https://t.co/VNG0P4GuDo pic.twitter.com/51TU5mrGJK — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) December 5, 2025 It has raised a hugely impressive $29.3 million in its ongoing sale, which continues to grow from strength to strength. This is a massive sign of confidence in the new project, which is aiming to tap into the enormous value of Bitcoin, enabling BTC holders to use their coins for DeFi and other purposes. On a technical level, it makes use of Solana’s Virtual Machine, providing superior speed and scalability. On top of this, it also employs zero-knowledge proofs, which offer a high level of privacy and security. This makes it one of the most technically capable L2s in crypto, explaining why its presale has taken off so quickly. Its native token HYPER will be necessary to pay for transaction fees, which will be competitively low. Even so, the need for HYPER could see the coin’s price rise steadily over time, especially as adoption of the L2 grows. Investors can join its sale by going to the official Bitcoin Hyper website , where the token is currently selling at $0.013405. This price will rise again later today, so newcomers should move quickly if they want to buy this intriguing new token at the lowest possible price.

The U.S. Senate is advancing comprehensive legislation to govern cryptocurrency law, as well as other pieces of legislation, to clarify regulatory oversight and address gaps in current regulations, including the GENIUS Act . Rapid developments in the field of digital assets, particularly stablecoins and decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, have put investors at risk, and lawmakers are determining which cryptocurrencies fall under the jurisdiction of the SEC versus the CFTC. The Senate is making progress on a major crypto bill On Thursday, the South Carolina Republican met with Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, Citi CEO Jane Fraser, and Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf. The team discussed the landmark legislation , which aims to establish comprehensive rules for the digital asset industry and assign regulatory authority to bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. “We are making real progress toward passing digital asset market structure legislation that will help cement America’s role as the crypto capital of the world,” Scott said in a statement on Thursday. “For months, my colleagues and I on the Senate Banking Committee have received valuable feedback from across the banking and crypto industries.” The three banking CEOs were scheduled to meet with senators this week to discuss proposed legislation regarding cryptocurrencies. According to a source familiar with the meetings, two separate meetings, one with Democrats and another with Republicans, were called “cordial.” The discussions covered topics including yield, decentralised finance, and anti-money laundering concerns, among others, according to the person familiar. Banks raise concerns about gaps in the GENIUS Act Yield-generating crypto assets, particularly stablecoins, have been a significant obstacle to passing a comprehensive crypto market structure bill. Banking associations argue that the stablecoin bill passed last summer, known as the GENIUS Act, has gaps that need to be addressed. They argue that the law’s limits on stablecoin issuers paying interest to holders are too weak, which could make these assets more attractive as stores of value and credit instruments than as payment tools, potentially creating “distorting market incentives” for banks, they said. The groups also contend that the GENIUS Act’s restrictions can be easily circumvented by exchanges, brokers, and other affiliated entities. Lawmakers are rushing to pass a bill regulating the crypto industry into law. Over the summer, the House passed its version of a market structure bill, known as the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, or Clarity for short, with bipartisan support. The Senate has since begun efforts to pass a comparable bill. Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott’s panel has drafted legislation that aims to divide regulatory authority between the SEC and the CFTC, introducing a new category called “ancillary assets” to clarify which cryptocurrencies are not considered securities. Meanwhile, the Senate Agriculture Committee released its own bill last month, which would expand the CFTC’s authority. Both committee drafts would need to be reconciled before moving forward. In the past few days, Democratic and Republican senators have met to negotiate certain provisions of the bill, but the talks appear shaky. Some lawmakers are seeking to advance the bill and move it through the Senate Banking Committee before the end of the year, but it remains unclear whether this will happen.

Since XRP is priced near $2, acquiring 1,000 units requires an investment of roughly $2,000. The question many investors ask is what price level XRP would need to reach for such a position to be worth $1 million, and whether any realistic long-term pathway makes that outcome achievable. Understanding the Required Price Level For a portfolio of 1,000 XRP to reach a value of $1 million, the asset would need to appreciate to $1,000 per coin. This figure forms the basis of several long-range forecasts shared by well-known community commentators such as BarriC and JackTheRippler . Their arguments typically reference the possibility of XRP becoming a core instrument for settlement operations, large-scale liquidity management, and global value transfer mechanisms. At this price point, a $2,000 investment today would experience gains exceeding 49,000 percent. While critics associate such projections with unrealistic expectations, supporters argue that other digital assets have produced outcomes that seemed unlikely in their early years. Long-Term Forecasts That Outline a Possible Path Multiple research groups and market analysts have issued long-term estimates that, while not uniform, indicate a consistent upward trajectory for XRP. Data-driven projections from Changelly position the asset near the $115 range between 2033 and 2034. This level remains well below the $1,000 threshold, but it suggests ongoing positive momentum over the next decade. Other forecasts extend beyond that period. Telegaon’s previous long-term model estimated that XRP could approach $285 around 2050. Under such circumstances, 1,000 XRP would be valued at $285,000, a considerable increase despite falling short of the million-dollar mark. Some analysts offer more ambitious scenarios. Matthew Brienen, the Chief Operating Officer at CryptoGuard, has outlined a model in which XRP could reach $1,000 by 2035. His position centers on the expectation that the asset may become integrated into large-scale financial infrastructure, particularly in areas related to institutional settlement channels and tokenized liquidity frameworks. If such integration occurs, the value of 1,000 XRP would exceed $1 million. These projections depend heavily on adoption trends, regulatory developments, and broader market conditions. They do not function as guarantees, but they outline potential outcomes based on long-term structural assumptions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Historical Comparisons and Their Limitations Supporters of the $1,000 target often compare XRP’s potential to earlier growth patterns observed in other major crypto assets. Bitcoin advanced from fractions of a cent to above $126,000. Ethereum moved from below $1 to nearly $5,000, and Solana rose from under $1 to approximately $260 during peak periods. These increases were driven by expanding use cases, structural improvements, and rising demand. Advocates contend that XRP could experience a similar rise if it becomes widely adopted for institutional transactions and large-scale digital value transfer. Ripple’s corporate initiatives, including multibillion-dollar investments in 2025, are frequently cited as supportive factors. However, critics raise supply concerns. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, which have significantly smaller circulating supplies, XRP has a maximum supply close to 100 billion tokens. A price of $1,000 per XRP would imply a market capitalization nearing $100 trillion. For comparison, Bitcoin’s market cap at its peak remained below $4 trillion. Even at $1 million per Bitcoin, its projected market cap would be under $21 trillion. This contrast forms the core objection to the $1,000 XRP scenario . The possibility of turning 1,000 XRP into $1 million depends on whether XRP can reach a four-digit valuation. Analysts remain divided, with some highlighting long-term structural strengths and others noting significant supply-based limitations. While future adoption and regulatory clarity will play critical roles in determining the asset’s trajectory, the debate underscores the broader uncertainty surrounding long-term valuation models in the digital asset sector.

Bitcoin is also down by 2% today, while Ethereum has declined by 3.5%, Solana by 4.5%, and Cardano by a hefty 10%. These are disappointing falls, yet the market remains as strong fundamentally as it was in January, suggesting that a rebound must be imminent. We’ve therefore chosen our best new meme coin to buy today under $0.01, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , which has the potential to outpace the market when it lists in under a month. Best New Meme Coin to Buy Today Under $0.01 – 11 December PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) is an Ethereum-based token that opened its presale in late September and has since gone on to raise over $2.3 million . This sale has proven increasingly popular in recent weeks, yet it has now entered its home stretch, with only 28 days until it ends and the coin lists. Even the pickaxe is festive. This season the best present is a levelled up virtual mining rig. https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/BRg3lVom3u — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) December 11, 2025 It has attracted investors for one simple reason: it’s launching an innovative mining platform that will make mining more accessible to average investors. Instead of requiring investment in expensive mining hardware (not to mention the large facilities to house such hardware), it enables users to build virtual mining rigs. Users can run their virtual rigs to earn mining rewards in external tokens such as Fartcoin and Pepe, while they can use PEPENODE tokens to buy more nodes. And by acquiring and upgrading more nodes, they can increase their rewards, while users also have the option to sell their nodes when they no longer need them. Because the PEPENODE token is necessary to grow mining rigs, it could attract substantial demand, pushing its price up massively over time. Holders can also stake it for a passive income, with its protocol currently providing a yield of 558% APY . This means that PEPENODE could be one of the most lucrative new coins to own once it launches in just under a month. PEPENODE Launch Could Coincide with Xmas and New Year Rally While there isn’t long left until the PEPENODE sale ends, investors can still join it by going to the project’s official website. There, they can connect a compatible wallet (e.g., Best Wallet) and use ETH, USDT, BNB, or fiat to buy any desired amount of the token. It’s selling at its final presale price of $0.001192, although its popularity would suggest that it could eclipse this level once it lists on exchanges. It has a max supply of 210 billion PEPENODE, with 5% of this total reserved for node rewards. And while the market remains subdued today, a festive rally could coincide nicely with the coin’s launch, helping it to surge on trading platforms.

The decision opens the door for the exchange to begin offering regulated prediction markets in the United States. Gemini Titan Debuts in Prediction Markets The launch marks Gemini’s first entry into the fast-growing event-contracts sector, where traders buy and sell binary “yes or no” positions tied to future outcomes. Gemini, which first filed for a DCM license in March 2020, had not previously disclosed that the application would form the basis of a standalone prediction-market platform. US customers will initially access the contracts through Gemini’s website using existing USD balances, and mobile access is expected to follow. The move places Gemini in a competitive field led by Kalshi and Polymarket, platforms that saw trading volumes surge during last year’s US election cycle and continue climbing since President Donald Trump took office. The sector has been shaped by years of cautious CFTC oversight, including enforcement actions such as the earlier ban on Polymarket and tight restrictions on political-themed markets. A recent legal win by Kalshi against the CFTC over event-contract listings has widened the regulatory pathway for platforms seeking to expand into categories such as sports and economic forecasting. Gemini’s CEO, Tyler Winklevoss, thanked Trump for “ending the Biden Administration’s war” on the sector and added that “it’s incredibly refreshing and invigorating to have a President and a financial regulator who are pro crypto, pro innovation, and pro America.” Meanwhile, the exchange’s President Cameron Winklevoss said, “Prediction markets have the potential to be as big or bigger than traditional capital markets. Acting Chairman Pham understands this vision and its importance. Unlike her predecessor, Acting Chairman Pham has positioned the CFTC as a pro-business, pro-innovation regulator that will allow America to lead in these new and exciting markets.” The official press release also revealed that Gemini Titan may later broaden its derivatives offerings to include crypto futures, options, and perpetual contracts, products widely traded in Asia but historically limited in the United States due to regulatory hurdles. CFTC Warms Up to Prediction Markets Prediction markets are gaining momentum in Washington as the CFTC, now led by Acting Chair Caroline Pham under Trump’s second term, has taken a more welcoming approach to the sector. In October, CryptoPotato reported that Trump Media and Technology Group said it would launch a prediction market inside Truth Social through an exclusive partnership with Crypto.com. The new feature, called Truth Predict, will let users trade contracts on elections, inflation moves, commodity prices, and sports results. Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek said the industry could grow into a “multi-deca-billion-dollar” market.

Investors have widely written off the altcoin since system instability triggered a hyperinflation-driven collapse in 2022, but major reforms may put it past that era. The December 8 launch of the LUNA v2.18 upgrade introduced stronger security features, tighter Cosmos interoperability, and a reinforced link between LUNA and USTC. These changes created a fundamental backdrop for the surge, directly addressing issues that contributed to the original breakdown. And with, since the start of the month, LUNA is up 222%. Today’s court hearing for Terra co-founder Do Kwon has added a social catalyst, with headlines around a potential sentencing pushing fresh attention toward the coin. TODAY: Do Kwon faces sentencing in the US over the Terra/LUNA collapse. The court weighs a 12-year bid from prosecutors vs. a 5-year cap sought by the defense. pic.twitter.com/43sBzyqDn2 — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) December 11, 2025 Still, many market participants attribute the rally to short-term speculative flows rather than improving fundamentals, raising doubts about how durable the uptrend really is. Terra Luna Price Prediction: Can the Comeback Last? The rally affirms the lower boundary of a three-year descending channel pattern, a proven launchpad throughout LUNA’s post-crash consolidation. With that confirmation, eyes are turning back to a potential breakout as the upper resistance trendline comes into view and momentum indicators show room for further upside. LUNA USD 1-day chart, descending channel. Source: TradingView . The RSI sits at 63, yet to reach the 70 overbought threshold that often marks local tops, while the MACD strengthens its bullish posture with a widening gap above the signal line. The key breakout threshold sits at a past demand zone around the $0.357 0.382 Fib retracement. Flipping this level to support could open the door to a potential 1,000% rally toward $2. The interim $0.246 0.236 retracement remains immediate resistance, capping today’s advance. still, the sudden and sharp spike in both momentum indicators could commemorate a rally driven by speculation rather than a long-term positioning, opening the door to downside volatility. If long-term holders decide to take profit, a shakeout of weak hands could trigger a 70% slide back to the $0.0665 support and potentially expose lower lows. New PEPENODE Presale Lets Users Mine Meme Coins with No Hardware With volatile coins like Terra Luna swinging between rallies and crashes, timing the market can feel like a losing game, especially for meme coin investors.

Just log in, build your virtual mining rig, stack nodes, and start earning passive rewards that automatically diversify into top meme coins like PEPE and BONK. Momentum is climbing fast. The presale has already passed $2.3 million, while early stakers can still earn up to 559% APY. With just under a month left, the chance for an early entry is fleeting. And thanks to a built-in deflationary model, where 70% of all $PEPENODE spent on nodes and rigs is burned, scarcity supports long-term token value.

The collapse wiped out an estimated $50 billion in market value within three days and triggered a chain of events that reshaped the digital-asset sector. The sentence, issued by District Judge Paul Engelmeyer of the Southern District of New York, exceeded the 12-year term recommended by prosecutors and was higher than the five-year sentence sought by Kwon’s legal team. Under federal rules, Kwon must serve at least half of the imposed term before he may request a transfer to South Korea, where he faces additional charges. Court reviews evidence and impact of Terra’s failure The sentencing was the result of an extended hearing, which involved the testimony of the victims, face-to-face and by phone, explaining the financial impact on individuals and families as a result of the breakdown of Terra. Judge Engelmeyer considered those testimonies with the guilty pleas that Kwon had already signed. In August, Do Kwon was found guilty of one count of conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, securities fraud, and wire fraud, as well as one count of wire fraud, in connection with the business of Terraform Labs. At a hearing of his plea, he admitted to being involved in an active conspiracy to defraud buyers of the UST stablecoin. The collapse of Terraform Labs marked the first major event in the broader crypto meltdown of 2022. The collapse of the company led to a series of market tensions, including mass liquidations, that contributed to the November 2022 FTX implosion. Plea deal reduced charges but did not limit the judge’s decision Do Kwon was initially charged with nine counts and faced a maximum sentence of 135 years to serve if found guilty on all counts. In a plea bargain agreed upon in the summer, the prosecutors reduced the charges to two counts with a maximum aggregate sentence of 25 years. According to the agreement, prosecutors were required to consent to recommending a term of 12 years’ imprisonment and assist Kwon in seeking an international prison transfer to South Korea upon completion of half of his American jail term. Judge Engelmeyer enquired about what such a pre-sentencing transfer means. According to court documents, he enquired about what guarantees there should be that Kwon would not be released prematurely in case he was sent back to South Korea. He also inquired with the prosecutors and defence counsel whether Kwon was still being charged in South Korea and whether the time spent abroad should be counted against his federal sentence. In a written response submitted on Wednesday, the prosecutors said they did not have any specifics about the ongoing proceedings in South Korea but confirmed that authorities there had indicated that Kwon would disagree with the charges. In the filing, the Bureau of Prisons indicated that Kwon would receive credit for the time he had served in Montenegro after the four months related to a different conviction concerning a passport.

According to data from Artemis, Stellar operations spiked in early December, pointing to growing real-world adoption. With both projects sharing similar use cases and institutional interest rising, XRP may soon escape its range-bound pattern and reclaim upside momentum. TThe metric tracks the total volume of payments moving across the Stellar blockchain, which is designed to streamline cross-border transactions using its native XLM token and stablecoins like USDC. XRP directly competes in this space with a nearly identical mission, though it currently commands a much larger market cap. Ripple, the company behind XRP, has also made major strides in global expansion by securing key regulatory licenses in jurisdictions like Dubai, Singapore, and the US. These licenses allow Ripple to offer compliant off-ramp services to enterprises looking to move money internationally using blockchain infrastructure. XRP Price Prediction: Break Above $2.20 Will Signal the Beginning of XRP’s Next Leg Up In the past 24 hours, XRP has retreated by 2.4% but continues to stay above the critical $2 threshold following yesterday’s widely awaited interest rate decision by the Federal Reserve. Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that XRP has been trading relatively range-bound in the past few days, bouncing up and down between the $2 and $2.20 zone. If XRP decisively breaks out of this range, this could mean that XRP is getting ready to move to higher highs before the year ends. Positive on-chain metrics on Stellar could be a “canary in the coal mine” signal that altcoins are about to explode. While XRP battles it out in the highly regulated cross-border payments arena, a more accessible opportunity is quietly gaining momentum. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a fast-growing crypto presale , has already raised millions to build a next-gen Layer-2 network for Bitcoin using Solana-based tech. It’s an early-stage opportunity that anyone can join, with the potential to ride a wave of innovation across two of crypto’s most powerful ecosystems. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Nears $30 Million Raised to Launch Its Innovative Bitcoin L2 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is an ambitious project that taps into the efficiency of the Solana blockchain to bring faster transaction speeds and lower costs to Bitcoin transactions.

55664723,643792,1765497630,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55664723.jpeg,Dogecoin Barely Blinks As Musk Confirms X Money Is Running Internally,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-musk-confirms-x-money-internally/,"Elon Musk has confirmed that X’s long-promised payments layer, X Money, is already running inside the company — but Dogecoin, his on-again-off-again favorite meme coin, has barely twitched. Replying to developer and X feature-watcher Nima Owji on December 10, Musk dropped a characteristically terse update: “It has been launched internally.” Within hours, promoter Mario Nawfal was broadcasting that “X MONEY IS LIVE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, PUBLIC LAUNCH NEXT,” describing the system as “quietly tested by employees and early users while the rest of the world waits for access.” It has been launched internally — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 10, 2025 The market, however, did not exactly wait breathlessly. As of press time, Dogecoin traded around $0.137, down less than 0.1% on the day — essentially noise, given an intraday range between roughly $0.137 and $0.150. For a coin that once ripped 20–30% on a single Elon meme, this is… subdued. Why Is The Dogecoin Price Not Reacting? The contrast with earlier X Money headlines is stark. When Musk first framed the payments stack as part of a broader relaunch of XChat in mid-November, he boasted that X had “just rolled out an entire new communications stack with encrypted messages, audio/video calls and file transfer,” adding pointedly: “Money comes out soon… X will be the everything app.” Dogecoin and other high-beta names squeezed higher on that story, if only briefly. Back in May, when Musk confirmed that a beta version of X Money was coming, DOGE jumped from about $0.08 to $0.09 on the announcement — a double-digit percentage move triggered by one more hint that the dog might be wired into X’s rails. Today’s non-reaction lands against a deeper build-out of X Money in the background. According to a recent job posting, X Money is hiring a technical lead to design a payments platform “from the ground up” for more than 600 million monthly users, with an emphasis on distributed systems and secure transactions. The description notably does not mention crypto or Dogecoin at all. Notably, X Money already announced a partnership with Visa earlier this year for an “X Money Account” that would fund wallets and peer-to-peer payments, while Solana figures — including ecosystem advisor Nikita Bier, now at X — have publicly signaled they are eager to help. Crucially, Musk has not exactly gone quiet on Dogecoin in general. On November 3 he posted “It’s time” on X, reviving his old promise to “put a literal Dogecoin on the literal moon” via a SpaceX mission, as reported by Bitcoinist. In mid-October he waded into the “energy money” debate, backing Bitcoin as impossible to “fake” because it is grounded in energy and then replying with an approving emoji when a Dogecoin community account insisted that “Dogecoin is also based on energy” — his “first explicit nod toward DOGE in a while,” as reported on NewsBTC . Even more recently, on October 11 and again on November 15, Musk posted Doge-coded content — a Shiba Inu mascot image, then a meme of a Shiba playing a banjo — that historically would have lit up DOGE order books. However, this time, Dogecoin’s response was muted to outright negative. In other words, the last few times Musk has talked about or referenced Dogecoin on X, the market reaction has been steadily decaying. So when he now says X Money “has been launched internally,” the absence of a pump in DOGE looks less like a mystery and more like a trend. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.13765.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-12 00:00:30

Critical On-Chain Metric Explodes Higher,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/is-dogecoin-waking-up-critical-on-chain-metric-explodes-higher/,"Dogecoin rose 4% to trade at $0.14 Thursday, according to market reports. Market capitalization was about $21 billion while 24-hour trading volume hovered near $1.6 billion. The move followed renewed on-chain activity that has drawn attention from traders and analysts. Related Reading: Institutions Scoop Up 9,000 Ether, Fueling Bullish Signals Spike In Active Wallets Based on reports from BitInfoCharts, the number of daily active addresses on the Dogecoin network jumped to over 67,500 on December 3, marking the second-highest reading in the past three months. That earlier spike on September 15 came as DOGE briefly approached a local top near $0.30. At that time, network activity rose as prices climbed; today, rising wallet activity is being watched closely as prices test a familiar zone after a long slide. Support Holding Near $0.14 Dogecoin is sitting above an important area around $0.138–$0.14, which has been tested and defended multiple times. Reports show the token has bounced off that level before, and trading volume has more than doubled during the most recent uptick, a sign that buying interest is growing. Market feeds also report mixed short-term figures: one line shows the token down by 5% in a week while another notes a 7.5% decline over the last week; those numbers do not align and highlight some reporting inconsistencies. Longer-term data show the token has lost roughly 60% over the past year and is about 50% off its recent highs. Volume And Technical Targets Traders are eyeing $0.16 as the next meaningful resistance. Based on reports, a decisive move above that zone would be the first clear break in the short-term bearish pattern. Beyond that, the 200-day exponential moving average sits as a broader target, often watched for signals that medium-term momentum has shifted. A break above the 200-day EMA would be treated by many as confirmation that a recovery could gain traction, although history shows these signals sometimes reverse quickly. Signals Are Mixed Daily active address spikes can point to rising interest. They can also reflect simple transfers, bot traffic, or wallet reshuffles by large holders. Increased volume helps the case for buyers, but active-address readings alone are not foolproof. The current setup looks like a battleground: both bulls and bears are more active than they were a few weeks ago. That activity makes the coming days important for traders who favor short-term moves.

While many market participants had anticipated a significant rally earlier in the year, the token has instead shown continued volatility. According to market data, XRP has declined both on a quarterly scale and year-to-date, contributing to growing concerns within the community. Some commentators, including Zach Rector, have argued that several developments slowed XRP’s momentum. He pointed to the prolonged legal dispute with the U.S. SEC, delays surrounding the introduction of XRP exchange-traded products, and the absence of regulatory clarity as contributing factors. In his view, these issues prevented XRP from achieving price levels that were once expected for 2025. Despite these, not all analysts are discouraged. One of the more optimistic voices is The Block Bull, who recently outlined what he sees as a realistic upper boundary for XRP if the market enters a supercycle. His assessment places a potential top near $48, assuming XRP can regain key technical levels that previously shaped its long-term trajectory. Realistic height For $XRP for those that believe in the Super Cycle… Parallel Channel Gives you greater targets to obtain 20X~ in a super cycle $40.00+ pic.twitter.com/thb8IUCnwD — BLOCK BULL (@TheBlockBull) December 7, 2025 Long-Term Structure: The Parallel Channel Framework A major part of The Block Bull’s argument centers around a parallel ascending channel that he states has influenced XRP’s market structure for several years. This chart pattern came into focus in 2017, a period when XRP was still valued under one cent. The analyst highlights that the asset repeatedly interacted with the upper boundary of this channel at the time and consistently maintained support above it, leading into its 2018 surge toward all-time highs. Following the peak, XRP eventually fell back into the channel and continued trading within it for several years. Although its progression was slow, the structure suggested steady upward movement. That trend came under substantial pressure during the 2022 downturn, which was intensified by large-scale market failures involving major industry players. As a result, XRP fell below the lower boundary of the channel and has remained outside of it since then. Renewed optimism briefly surfaced in late 2024 when XRP approached $2, bringing it close to the channel’s lower line again. However, attempts to regain this technical level have repeatedly been rejected, indicating strong resistance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Price Targets in a Supercycle Scenario The Block Bull suggests that re-entering the multi-year channel is essential before XRP can attempt higher valuations. In his analysis, the upper boundary of the channel points to a potential high near $48 if a broad market expansion occurs. He views this level as ambitious yet still within the realm of possibility if XRP manages to reclaim its historical structure. At current prices, around $2, reaching the $48 region would represent an increase of more than 20 times from the present market value. Even so, the analyst acknowledges that many investors may choose to take profits much earlier, particularly around the $10 range, which he believes would trigger significant selling pressure. Although the $48 estimate is aggressive, it is not entirely isolated. Forecasts from research platforms such as Changelly have also placed XRP in that general range over the long term, projecting a potential move toward this level in the early 2030s. The outlook for XRP remains divided between ongoing skepticism and persistent long-term optimism. While the asset continues to face technical and regulatory challenges, some analysts argue that a return to its historical channel could open the door to substantial appreciation. Whether the conditions required for a supercycle will materialize is uncertain, but the discussion underscores the wide range of expectations surrounding XRP’s future trajectory.

This perspective highlights the potential for Pakistani officials to consider regulating the crypto market. This outlook was noted at the Bitcoin MENA Conference a few days after Saqib shared a statement dated Tuesday this week, declaring that the country can no longer rely on outdated economic models. Therefore, according to him, “a new engine”, which he referred to as digital assets, is needed to boost economic growth. Saqib refers to digital assets as essential aspects for Pakistan’s new financial system During a discussion in Abu Dhabi , the senior official argued that they do not view Bitcoin, digital assets, and blockchain as speculative tools, but as an important part of their infrastructure. Saqib further explained that they are not just distractions but play a significant role in establishing the basis for a new financial system for developing nations. Saqib, who was recently appointed Chairman of the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority ( PVARA ) and previously served as Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Blockchain and crypto matters, highlighted that he is working towards a major goal of transforming the largest unregulated cryptocurrency markets into a favourable investment environment. According to him, Pakistan has the potential to develop a regulated crypto ecosystem as soon as possible, given that 70% of the population belongs to the 30-year-old age group, rather than becoming a late adopter. “My message is straightforward,” he stated. “If El Salvador can achieve this with 6 million people, just think about what Pakistan could accomplish with a population 40 times larger and one of the fastest-growing digital sectors in Asia.” Following the senior official’s argument, analysts weighed in on the situation. They pointed out that Pakistan is increasingly becoming one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrency markets globally. Their remarks came after the country moved up six spots to solidify its top position as the third in Chainalysis’ 2025 Global Crypto Adoption Index . Pakistan positions itself as a hub for digital assets Earlier this month, Saqib informed reporters that the country is preparing to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. He also noted that Pakistan is working towards adopting more supportive policies specifically for cryptocurrency. This move sparked excitement among individuals who are advocates of cryptocurrencies. To further illustrate their commitment to exploring the crypto ecosystem, Pakistan reported allocating 2,000 megawatts of additional electricity to support Bitcoin mining activities and the construction and operation of AI data centres that same month. This time round, the country embraced national efforts essential to enable it to go digital. This move triggered reports to reach out to fi nancial leaders in the country to explain this plan further. Respondingly, they mentioned that this plan aims to attract significant foreign investment and create new high-tech jobs by diverting excess power supply to AI and crypto initiatives. To position itself as a hub for digital assets, Pakistan notified international crypto firms in September that they are accepting applications for licenses under the country’s new federal regulations. For leading exchanges and service providers interested in exploring the market, the PVARA advised them to begin submitting their interest.

The latest reading from the widely watched Crypto Fear & Greed Index confirms the mood: it’s holding steady at a score of 29. This firmly places current market sentiment in the ‘fear’ category. But what does this number really tell us, and more importantly, what should a savvy investor do about it? Let’s decode the signal from the noise. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Telling Us Right Now? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool that quantifies the emotional temperature of the cryptocurrency market. Think of it as a market mood ring. A score of 29, unchanged from the previous day, indicates that fear is the dominant emotion among traders and investors. This index ranges from 0, representing extreme fear , to 100, which signals extreme greed . The current stagnation at 29 suggests the market is in a cautious, wait-and-see phase, lacking the conviction for a strong move in either direction. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? This isn’t just a guess; it’s a data-driven snapshot. The index from Alternative.me compiles information from several key sources to create its daily score. Understanding the components helps explain why the sentiment is what it is. Volatility (25%): Sharp price swings, especially downward, feed fear. Market Volume (25%): Low or declining volume can indicate a lack of buyer interest. Social Media (15%): The tone and volume of conversations on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Direct polling of market participants. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): When Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap rises, it often signals a ‘flight to safety’. Google Trends (10%): Search volume for terms like ‘Bitcoin crash’ or ‘crypto bubble’. The current Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 29 means these factors collectively paint a picture of apprehension. Should You Be Afraid When the Index Shows Fear? Here’s where it gets interesting. While ‘fear’ sounds negative, experienced market participants often see it differently. A low Crypto Fear & Greed Index can present a strategic opportunity. Historically, periods of extreme fear have sometimes preceded market bottoms or buying opportunities, as weak hands sell and value investors step in. However, it’s crucial to remember that the index is a sentiment indicator, not a price predictor . It tells you how people feel, not necessarily where the price will go next. Actionable Insights in a Fearful Market So, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is flashing yellow. What’s your next move? First, avoid panic selling based on sentiment alone. Use this information as one piece of your broader research puzzle. This is an excellent time for due diligence—researching projects with strong fundamentals that may be undervalued. Consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to build positions gradually, reducing the risk of buying at a single high point. Most importantly, ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with your personal risk tolerance. The Bottom Line on Today’s Crypto Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index holding at 29 is a clear sign that uncertainty reigns. It reflects real concerns about volatility, macroeconomic factors, and regulatory headlines. However, by understanding what drives this index, you can move from reacting to emotion to making informed decisions. In the tumultuous world of crypto, sometimes the best action is informed patience. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Is a Fear & Greed Index score of 29 a good time to buy Bitcoin? A: It can be. Many contrarian investors view periods of fear as potential buying opportunities, as prices may be depressed. However, you should never base a buy decision solely on this index. Always conduct your own research and consider your financial goals. Q: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A: The index is updated daily, typically once per day. You can find it on websites like Alternative.me. Q: Does the index only measure sentiment for Bitcoin? A> While Bitcoin is the primary driver due to its dominance and data availability, the index aims to reflect sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market, as many altcoins move in correlation with Bitcoin. Q: Has the index been accurate in the past? A> The index has been effective at identifying periods of extreme market emotion, such as the euphoric highs near bull market peaks and the fearful lows during sharp corrections. It is a reliable gauge of prevailing mood, not a crystal ball for exact price movements. Q: Where can I check the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A> The most common source is the website Alternative.me. Many major crypto news and data platforms also display it on their market analysis pages. Q: Should I sell my crypto if the index is in ‘Extreme Fear’? A> Not necessarily. ‘Extreme Fear’ often coincides with market capitulation, which can mark a turning point. Selling during extreme fear can mean selling at a low. Review your investment thesis and long-term strategy instead of making emotional decisions. Did this breakdown of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index help you make sense of the market’s mood?

Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE Hits Key Support and Faces Make-Or-Break Moment Heading to the 12-hour chart, DOGE seems to be hitting a pivotal level at $0.13. In the past few weeks, it has bounced three times off this mark, increasing its technical relevance. If the price breaks above its dynamic trend line resistance, the odds of a move toward its point of control at $0.195 will be high. This confirms Bitconsensus’ view and further validates a bullish Dogecoin price prediction. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) would need to push above the 14-period moving average to confirm a bullish reversal for Dogecoin. Right now, it hovers around 40. Ideally, a breakout above the mid-line would signal that momentum is truly shifting in favor of the bulls.

This significant event, sourced from leading exchange Deribit, has the potential to inject volatility and shape short-term price action. But what does this actually mean for you, and how should savvy market participants interpret the key metrics? What Does Today’s Massive Bitcoin Options Expiration Mean? Today at 8:00 a.m. UTC, a critical financial instrument for sophisticated traders reaches its deadline. Bitcoin options are contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) Bitcoin at a predetermined price by a specific date. The expiration of $3.67 billion worth of these contracts forces traders to make decisions: exercise their rights, let them expire worthless, or roll them over. This concentrated activity often leads to increased trading volume and can cause price swings as market makers hedge their positions. Decoding the Key Metrics: Put/Call Ratio and Max Pain To gauge market sentiment, analysts look at two vital numbers provided by Deribit. First is the put/call ratio of 1.1 for Bitcoin options . A ratio above 1 indicates more put (bearish) contracts exist than call (bullish) ones, suggesting a cautious or hedging sentiment among traders. However, at 1.1, the bias is only slightly negative. The second crucial figure is the “max pain” price of $90,000. This is the strike price at which the maximum number of options would expire worthless, causing the most financial loss to option buyers and maximum gain to sellers. Market forces often, but not always, gravitate toward this price at expiration to minimize payouts. Put/Call Ratio (1.1): Slight bearish hedging bias. Max Pain Price ($90,000): The price point that would cause maximum loss to option holders. Ethereum Joins the Expiry Frenzy: A $770 Million Event It’s not just Bitcoin in the spotlight. A substantial batch of Ethereum options worth $770 million is set to expire simultaneously. The metrics here show an even stronger defensive posture. With a put/call ratio of 1.22 and a max pain price of $3,100, Ethereum traders appear to be exhibiting more pronounced caution or protection against downside moves. This dual expiration creates a compounded event that could amplify market-wide volatility. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders and Investors So, how should you navigate this? For active traders, expect potential volatility around the expiration time. Price may experience pinning near the max pain levels as the deadline approaches. Long-term investors, however, should view this as a routine market mechanism. While these expiries can cause short-term noise, they rarely alter the fundamental long-term trajectory. The key is not to panic but to understand the mechanics at play. Conclusion: Navigating the Options Expiry Landscape In summary, today’s expiration of $3.67 billion in Bitcoin options is a major market event that highlights the growing sophistication of the crypto derivatives space. The slightly bearish put/call ratio and the $90,000 max pain price provide a snapshot of current trader sentiment and potential pressure points. By understanding these concepts, you can better interpret market movements and avoid being swayed by temporary volatility. Remember, knowledge is your most powerful tool in a dynamic market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What happens when Bitcoin options expire? At expiration, traders must decide to exercise their right to buy/sell Bitcoin at the strike price or let the contract expire worthless. This flurry of activity can increase market volatility. What is a put/call ratio? It’s the number of put (sell) options divided by call (buy) options. A ratio above 1 suggests more traders are betting on or hedging against a price decrease. What is the “max pain” price? It’s the price at which the total financial loss for all option buyers is maximized (and seller gain is maximized). The market sometimes moves toward this price at expiry. Should I change my investment strategy because of options expiry? For long-term holders, typically no. These are short-term technical events. For active traders, it’s a factor to consider for timing entries/exits due to potential volatility. Where does this options data come from? The data is primarily reported by major crypto options exchanges like Deribit, which is the leader in this market segment. Do options expiries always move the market price? Not always, but they often create conditions ripe for volatility due to the hedging activity of large market makers. Found this breakdown of today’s crucial Bitcoin options expiry helpful?

This transaction, spotted by blockchain analysts, adds to a pattern of substantial movements from the prominent financial services firm. What does this mean for the market, and why would a major player shift such a large sum into an unknown wallet? Let’s explore the details and potential implications. What Does This Major Bitcoin Transfer Reveal? According to a report from Onchain Lens shared on X, the recipient address (bc1qp8…) has been receiving Bitcoin transfer batches from Galaxy Digital since December 9th. Therefore, this is not an isolated event but part of a coordinated accumulation strategy. The wallet’s total holdings have now ballooned to 1,900 BTC, valued at approximately $176 million. This scale of movement from a known institutional entity into an opaque destination naturally fuels speculation and analysis. For context, Galaxy Digital, founded by billionaire Mike Novogratz, is a heavyweight in crypto finance. Their actions are closely watched as a barometer for institutional sentiment. A Bitcoin transfer of this magnitude out of their known custody solutions could signal several strategic shifts. Why Would an Institution Use an Anonymous Wallet? Understanding the ‘why’ behind this Bitcoin transfer requires looking at common institutional practices. Moving assets to a new, private address isn’t necessarily alarming. However, it does raise important questions about strategy and security. Enhanced Security & Custody: The primary reason is often operational security. Institutions may rotate funds between wallets or migrate to new, more secure custody solutions. A fresh address with no transaction history can be harder to track and target. Preparing for a Transaction: This could be a preparatory move for a larger over-the-counter (OTC) trade, a collateralization event, or an allocation to a new fund or product. The anonymity prevents front-running in the markets. Internal Treasury Management: Large firms manage assets across multiple entities and balance sheets. This Bitcoin transfer might simply reflect an internal reallocation of assets between different subsidiaries or investment vehicles. What Are the Market Implications of This Move? While the exact purpose remains private, the market impact is tangible. Firstly, such visible movements can influence trader psychology. A large outflow from a known entity might be misinterpreted as a sell-off, causing short-term anxiety. Conversely, understanding it as a custody shift or strategic hold can reinforce beliefs in long-term Bitcoin accumulation by institutions. Moreover, this event highlights the transparency of blockchain. Every major Bitcoin transfer is public, allowing for real-time analysis. This transparency is a double-edged sword—it builds trust in the network’s integrity but also requires sophisticated interpretation to avoid misreading institutional intent. Key Takeaways for Crypto Observers This development offers several actionable insights for anyone following the crypto space. It underscores that institutional activity is multifaceted and not solely about buying or selling on public exchanges. The use of anonymous wallets is a standard practice for security and operational efficiency, not inherently secretive in a negative sense. Furthermore, tracking these flows is crucial. The pattern shows sustained accumulation into one address since December, suggesting a deliberate, long-term position is being built. For investors, this reinforces the narrative of continued institutional faith in Bitcoin as a core digital asset, regardless of short-term price volatility. Conclusion: Decoding the Signal in the Noise Galaxy Digital’s latest $64.8 million Bitcoin transfer is a powerful reminder of the dynamic and complex nature of institutional crypto management. While the destination wallet is anonymous, the action itself speaks volumes about ongoing strategic asset deployment. It reflects sophisticated custody practices and a potential commitment to holding substantial Bitcoin reserves off the public radar. For the market, the key lesson is to look beyond the headline and understand the common operational reasons behind such moves, which often signify long-term planning rather than imminent selling pressure. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is a large Bitcoin transfer to an anonymous wallet a sign of selling? A: Not necessarily. While it could precede a sale, it’s more commonly linked to security upgrades, internal treasury management, or preparing assets for other financial operations like collateralization. Q2: Why can we see this Bitcoin transfer if the wallet is anonymous? A: The Bitcoin blockchain is transparent; all transactions are public. We can see the amount, timestamp, and sending/receiving addresses. “Anonymous” means the owner of the address is not publicly known, not that the transaction is hidden. Q3: What is Galaxy Digital’s role in cryptocurrency? A: Galaxy Digital is a full-service financial services firm operating in the digital asset sector. It provides trading, asset management, investment banking, and mining services for institutions. Q4: How does this transfer affect Bitcoin’s price? A: The direct impact is often minimal if the coins are not sent to an exchange for sale. However, the news can influence market sentiment. Perceived as accumulation, it can be bullish; perceived as preparation to sell, it can be bearish. Q5: Should retail investors be concerned about such transfers? A: Retail investors should monitor them as part of overall market analysis but not overreact. Institutional moves are part of normal operations and should be considered within the broader context of market trends and fundamentals. Q6: What tools can track these Bitcoin transfers? A: Blockchain explorers like Blockchain.com, Etherscan (for wrapped BTC), and analytics platforms like Arkham Intelligence or Nansen are commonly used to track large wallet movements and cluster addresses.

This strategic timing signals an intensifying battle for supremacy in the foundational models that will power the next generation of decentralized applications, smart contracts, and automated crypto analysis tools. For investors and builders in the Web3 space, the capabilities of these agents to synthesize vast data sets could revolutionize due diligence, tokenomics research, and on-chain analytics. What is Google’s New Gemini Deep Research AI Agent? Google’s newly “reimagined” Gemini Deep Research is built on its flagship Gemini 3 Pro model. This isn’t just another chatbot. It’s an autonomous agent engineered for deep, complex reasoning tasks. Its core function is to ingest and synthesize “mountains of information” from large context prompts, producing comprehensive research outputs. Crucially, Google is now offering this capability to developers through its new Interactions API, allowing them to embed these advanced research functions directly into their own applications. This move is pivotal for the AI research agent ecosystem, enabling bespoke tools for crypto portfolio analysis, whitepaper summarization, and regulatory tracking. Why the Fight Against AI Hallucinations Matters for Crypto For any financial or technical analysis, accuracy is non-negotiable. Google emphasizes that Gemini 3 Pro is its “most factual” model, specifically trained to minimize hallucinations—those instances where an AI confidently invents false information. In the context of long, multi-step agentic tasks (like analyzing a project’s entire codebase or audit history), a single hallucination can corrupt the entire analysis. This focus on reliability is a direct response to a major pain point in deploying Google AI and other models for serious financial or technical work, where errors have real monetary consequences. Key Features of Gemini Deep Research vs. Traditional AI Models Feature Gemini Deep Research Standard LLM Primary Function Autonomous, multi-step research synthesis Single-turn Q&A or content generation Context Handling Massive context windows for deep dives Limited context, often summarized Output Structured reports, due diligence summaries Conversational responses, paragraphs Integration Via Interactions API for custom apps Often limited to chat interfaces Target Use Case Drug research, financial due diligence, technical analysis Customer service, content creation, brainstorming The Benchmark Wars: DeepSearchQA and Humanity’s Last Exam To prove its prowess, Google introduced a new benchmark, DeepSearchQA, designed to test agents on complex, multi-step information tasks. It has open-sourced this benchmark. More intriguingly, it tested its agent on “Humanity’s Last Exam,” an independent benchmark filled with niche general knowledge tasks. Google’s agent topped these charts. However, the released data showed OpenAI’s ChatGPT 5 Pro was a very close second, even slightly outperforming Google on the BrowserComp benchmark for browser-based tasks. This data was instantly overshadowed by the release of OpenAI GPT-5.2 (codenamed Garlic), which OpenAI claims now leads on key benchmarks. This relentless one-upmanship on AI benchmarks drives rapid iteration but also creates confusion in the market. OpenAI GPT-5.2: The Same-Day Counterpunch The narrative took another dramatic turn with OpenAI’s release of GPT-5.2 . The timing was unmistakably strategic. While the world awaited “Garlic,” Google seized the news cycle with its Deep Research announcement. OpenAI then fired back, claiming its new model now leads the pack. This tit-for-tat launch day highlights the fierce, real-time competition between the two giants. For the crypto and tech industry, this competition accelerates innovation but also presents a dilemma: which platform’s evolving capabilities should developers bet their next project on? Strategic Timing: Google’s announcement was clearly timed to blunt OpenAI’s news momentum. Performance Claims: Each company now claims benchmark leadership, making direct comparison difficult for users. Developer Mindshare: The battle is as much for developer adoption and ecosystem building as it is for raw model performance. What This Means for the Future of Search and Crypto Research Google plans to integrate Deep Research into Google Search, Finance, the Gemini App, and NotebookLM. This is a step toward a world where AI agents conduct research on our behalf. For crypto, this could manifest as: Automated Due Diligence: Agents scanning whitepapers, audit reports, GitHub activity, and team history to generate risk profiles. Real-time Sentiment & News Synthesis: Parsing thousands of news articles, social media posts, and forum discussions to gauge market sentiment. On-Chain Analysis Tools: Building custom agents that monitor wallet activity, liquidity pool changes, and smart contract interactions for actionable insights. The race between Google AI and OpenAI GPT-5.2 is no longer just about better chat. It’s about which company can provide the most reliable, powerful, and integratable brain for the autonomous agents that will increasingly manage our digital and financial lives. The launch-day clash proves both are all-in on this agentic future. Conclusion: An Accelerating Arms Race with High Stakes The dual launch of Google’s Gemini Deep Research and OpenAI’s GPT-5.2 marks a pivotal escalation in the AI war. It’s a transition from conversational AI to functional, autonomous research agents. The focus on combating hallucinations and handling deep, multi-step tasks shows the industry is maturing, targeting enterprise and high-stakes applications like finance and crypto. While benchmark claims will fly, the real test will be in production—which platform enables developers to build the most transformative and reliable tools first. For the crypto community, these advancements promise a new tier of analytical power, but they also demand heightened scrutiny of the underlying models’ accuracy and bias.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Gemini Deep Research? It is Google’s advanced autonomous AI agent, built on Gemini 3 Pro, designed to perform deep, multi-step research and synthesis tasks, moving beyond simple Q&A. What is GPT-5.2? GPT-5.2, codenamed “Garlic,” is OpenAI’s latest model release, announced the same day as Google’s agent. It claims improvements across standard benchmarks. Who leads in AI benchmarks now? Both companies claim leadership. Google’s agent led on its new DeepSearchQA and Humanity’s Last Exam benchmarks, while OpenAI claims GPT-5.2 now leads on a suite of standard tests. The landscape is highly dynamic. How can developers use Gemini Deep Research? Through Google’s new Interactions API, allowing the deep research capabilities to be embedded into third-party applications for customized use cases. Why is reducing AI hallucinations important? For long, complex tasks involving many autonomous decisions (like financial analysis), a single fabricated fact (hallucination) can invalidate the entire output, leading to faulty conclusions and potential losses.

For crypto investors scanning the horizon for the next big opportunity, a key metric just flashed a stagnant signal. The Altcoin Season Index is holding firm at 17, unchanged from the previous day. This low reading tells a clear story about the current market dynamic, but what does it mean for your portfolio? Let’s decode this crucial indicator and explore the actionable insights it provides. What Exactly Is the Altcoin Season Index? CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index is a vital tool for gauging market sentiment. It measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. The calculation is straightforward but powerful. The index asks one simple question: are altcoins outperforming the king of crypto? An official altcoin season is declared when 75% of these top coins beat Bitcoin’s returns over the preceding three months. Conversely, a Bitcoin season occurs when BTC outshines the majority of altcoins. The index score itself ranges from 0 to 100. Therefore, a reading closer to 100 signals a stronger, more pervasive altcoin season. Why Is a Score of 17 Significant for the Altcoin Season Index? A score of 17 on the Altcoin Season Index is far from the 75 threshold needed to declare a season. This low and steady number indicates we are firmly in a Bitcoin-dominant market phase. Here’s what this current reading typically means for investors: Bitcoin Leadership: Capital and attention are primarily flowing into Bitcoin, often driven by macro factors like ETF approvals or institutional interest. Altcoin Patience: Most alternative cryptocurrencies are struggling to keep pace, waiting for a broader risk-on sentiment to return to the crypto market. Consolidation Phase: This period can be a time of accumulation for strong altcoin projects, building a base for their next move. This index is not a crystal ball, but a diagnostic tool. It confirms the prevailing trend, helping you align your strategy with the market’s current rhythm. How Can You Use the Altcoin Season Index in Your Strategy? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index is one thing; applying it is another. With the index stuck at 17, consider these actionable insights for your crypto investment approach. First, manage your expectations. A low index suggests chasing quick, massive gains in random altcoins is a high-risk strategy. The wind is not at their backs. Second, this is an ideal time for research. Use this quieter period to deeply analyze fundamental projects without the noise of a frenzied bull market. Finally, consider a phased approach. You might: Maintain a core position in Bitcoin while the trend is clear. Dollar-cost average into high-conviction altcoin picks at lower prices. Set alerts for when the Altcoin Season Index begins a sustained climb above 50, signaling a potential shift. What Triggers a Shift in the Altcoin Season Index? The index doesn’t move on its own. It reacts to market forces. For the Altcoin Season Index to rise from 17 towards 75, specific catalysts are usually required. Historically, a sustained Bitcoin rally often comes first, bringing new capital and confidence into the entire crypto ecosystem. Once Bitcoin’s price stabilizes at a higher level, that confidence and capital begin to ‘rotate’ into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. This rotation is what powers the index upward. Other triggers can include breakthrough developments in major altcoin sectors like DeFi or NFTs, or a significant reduction in macroeconomic uncertainty that boosts risk appetite. Conclusion: Navigating the Calm Before the Storm The Altcoin Season Index holding at 17 is a snapshot of a patient market. It signals a period of Bitcoin strength and altcoin consolidation, not a period of altcoin opportunity. For the savvy investor, this is not a time for disappointment, but for preparation. Use this data to fortify your portfolio’s foundation, conduct rigorous research, and develop a clear plan for when the index’s needle finally starts to swing. By understanding this metric, you move from reacting to market noise to responding to market structure. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Where can I find the current Altcoin Season Index reading? A1: The index is published and tracked by CoinMarketCap. You can typically find it on their website or data platforms that aggregate market metrics. Q2: Does a low index mean I should sell all my altcoins? A2: Not necessarily. A low index indicates a trend, not an absolute rule. It suggests caution and selective investment rather than a wholesale exit, especially for projects with strong fundamentals. Q3: How often does the Altcoin Season Index update? A3: The index is typically updated daily, reflecting the rolling 90-day performance data of the top cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin. Q4: Has an altcoin season ever started from a low index like 17? A4: Yes, altcoin seasons often begin from periods of Bitcoin dominance. The key is to watch for a sustained, multi-week upward trend in the index value, not just a single-day spike. Q5: Are all altcoins included in the index calculation? A5: No. The index specifically analyzes the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like WBTC) to give a pure performance comparison.

While ETH stabilizes under familiar resistance levels, a new altcoin priced at $0.035 has surged 250% and is moving through its final allocation window. With attention shifting toward early-stage assets that still offer meaningful room to grow, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now being compared to Ethereum as traders evaluate what may deliver stronger performance in 2026. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum remains one of the most important assets in the entire market. It holds a massive market cap, supports the majority of decentralized applications and serves as the foundation for major sectors such as DeFi, NFTs and layer-2 networks. ETH has produced major returns since launch and played a key role in building the crypto landscape. But the same size that made Ethereum strong is now one of its biggest obstacles. Large-cap assets move more slowly because they require heavy liquidity to break through price barriers. ETH faces repeated resistance near the $3,100 to $3,400 zone. Many traders say the next top crypto cycle may give ETH a modest boost rather than a breakout. A common view is that Ethereum may deliver small gains, but not the kind of high-multiple returns early-cycle investors are looking for. This has shifted attention toward lower-priced tokens with earlier positioning and stronger upside potential, especially those backed by meaningful utility rather than speculation alone. That is where Mutuum Finance is beginning to stand out. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized lending protocol built on structured borrowing and lending mechanics. The system uses two connected markets to give lenders and borrowers clear financial environments. In the Peer to Contract market, users lend assets such as ETH or USDT into the protocol. They receive mtTokens. mtTokens increase in value as borrowers repay interest. For example, someone lending $500 of USDT may watch mtTokens grow as the protocol gains users. This creates a natural APY based on real activity inside the system. The Peer to Peer market allows borrowers to form direct agreements with lenders. Borrowing rates shift with liquidity. When liquidity is strong, borrowing stays affordable. When liquidity weakens, borrowing becomes more expensive. Loan-to-value rules help protect users by setting boundaries for collateral. If collateral falls too far, liquidation may occur. Liquidators repay part of the debt and receive discounted collateral. This approach keeps the system predictable when market prices move fast. These mechanics give Mutuum Finance a functional DeFi structure that operates very differently from ETH. Ethereum’s value comes from ecosystem demand, while MUTM’s value comes from protocol activity, interest repayment, mtToken performance and revenue-driven buy pressure. Presale Progress and Expanding Participation Mutuum Finance began its presale in early 2025 at $0.01. Since then it has surged to $0.035, reflecting a 250% increase during development. The project has now raised $19.250M and grown to 18,500 holders. More than 815M tokens have been purchased so far. Out of the total 4B MUTM supply, 1.82B tokens, equal to 45.5%, were allocated for the presale. Phase 6 is now over 96% allocated, and the next stage will introduce a nearly 20% price increase as the project moves toward the final pre-launch structure. The official listing price is set at $0.06, which positions Phase 1 participants for a 500% appreciation at launch. Community participation remains high due to the 24-hour leaderboard, where the top buyer each day receives $500 in MUTM. This has kept daily traffic strong and improved visibility. Mutuum Finance also supports card payment, which has helped onboard new users quickly. Security has been one of the project’s most emphasized areas. Mutuum Finance completed a CertiK audit, scoring 90/100, and Halborn Security is currently reviewing the protocol’s borrowing, liquidation and repayment logic. A $50,000 bug bounty is active as well. These steps have helped build confidence as the project prepares for its first public version. V1 Testnet, Development and Why These Matter for 2026 Mutuum Finance confirmed through its official X account that the V1 testnet will launch in Q4 2025. V1 introduces the liquidity pool, mtTokens, the liquidation engine and the debt module. ETH and USDT will be the first supported assets. This will be the first time users can interact with the protocol in a live environment. The project is also preparing a USD-pegged stablecoin supported by borrower interest. Stablecoins are important for lending systems because they create predictable borrowing conditions and reduce exposure to volatility. They also expand liquidity, which increases borrowing and lending volume. Analysts expect that stablecoin integration will play a major role in Mutuum Finance’s growth curve once V1 is active. Mutuum Finance plans to expand across several layer-2 networks. L2 deployment helps lower transaction fees and improve processing speed. Lending platforms rely on frequent updates to collateral levels, interest rates and liquidations. Faster settlement is essential for a smooth user experience. Why Ethereum’s Outlook Looks Slower Ethereum’s growth expectations for 2026 show limited upside. Many traders expect ETH to rise only modestly due to its size, resistance zones and slowing momentum. Mutuum Finance sits on the opposite side of the spectrum. It is early, priced low, backed by functional lending mechanics, supported by a buy-and-distribute engine, tied to mtToken yield and preparing for a fully audited V1 launch. The early structural combination gives MUTM the kind of setup analysts typically associate with high-multiple moves. Mutuum Finance, by contrast, has the foundational elements that historically supported early breakouts in prior cycles. The demand surge in Phase 6, the high number of holders, the $19.250M raised, and the upcoming price increase in Phase 7 all add pressure as the project approaches its next crypto stage.

While rate cuts typically support risk assets, Jerome Powell’s comments added a new layer of uncertainty to the market. Related Reading: The Whale Who Can’t Stop Buying: BitcoinOG Scales Ethereum Long To $280M After Price Surge By openly acknowledging the risks of weaker growth paired with persistent inflation, Powell introduced the possibility of stagflation—a scenario that historically challenges both equities and crypto. As a result, sentiment across the market remains fragile, and investors are struggling to interpret what this macro shift could mean for Ethereum’s next move. Despite the volatility surrounding the decision, one major whale continues to act with conviction. According to Lookonchain, the Bitcoin OG who famously shorted the market during the October 10 crash is once again doubling down on his bullish Ethereum position. Instead of taking profits or reducing exposure after the recent rally, he has continued accumulating aggressively, signaling a strong belief in ETH’s medium-term trajectory even as broader sentiment turns cautious. Whale Position Ramps Up, But Risk Is Rising According to Lookonchain, the whale’s position has now surged to 120,094 ETH, valued at approximately $392.5 million. With a liquidation price at $2,234.69, this has become one of the largest and most aggressive long positions currently tracked on-chain. Such a massive allocation signals extreme conviction, especially coming from the same Bitcoin OG who successfully shorted the market during the October 10 crash. However, the scale of this bet also highlights how much risk is now concentrated in a single directional position. The liquidation price is a key concern. At $2,234, it sits nearly $1,000 below current levels, but in highly leveraged environments—especially during macro uncertainty—prices can retrace violently. Ethereum has already shown a tendency toward sharp intraday moves, and with funding rates rising and leverage across the market stretching to historical highs, even a moderate correction could trigger cascading liquidations. If ETH experiences a sudden spike in volatility due to shifting macro conditions, a negative reaction to the latest FOMC decision, or a broader market unwind, the whale’s position could come under significant pressure. While large whales often influence market sentiment, this setup illustrates how thin the margin for error has become. Related Reading: Why Ethereum’s Rally Isn’t Overheated – And Where Demand Must Grow Next ETH Testing Resistance While Momentum Weakens Ethereum has retraced to the $3,196 level after failing to hold above the $3,300 zone, signaling that bullish momentum is beginning to weaken. The daily chart shows ETH rejecting the red 200-day moving average, a key long-term trend indicator that has acted as resistance throughout the recent downtrend. Until ETH breaks and closes decisively above this level, the broader structure remains vulnerable. The 50-day moving average is still sloping downward, reflecting persistent selling pressure despite last week’s rebound. Meanwhile, the 100-day moving average sits well above the current price, reinforcing the heavy overhead resistance ETH must overcome to reestablish a bullish trend. Volume has also declined compared to the early December bounce, suggesting buyers are losing strength as price approaches major resistance levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Fall To Lowest Levels on Record: The Bullish Signal Most Traders Are Missing Structurally, ETH remains in a mid-term downtrend, forming lower highs and lower lows since September. Although the recent push from the $2,800 region shows buyers defending key support, the rejection at $3,350 highlights that sellers are still in control at higher levels. If ETH fails to regain the 200-day moving average soon, a retest of the $3,050–$3,100 support range becomes likely. Conversely, a strong reclaim above $3,350 could open the door for a move toward $3,500, but the market will need renewed momentum to get there.

Next week, the US Senate will hold a crucial vote to confirm the chairs of two powerful financial watchdogs—the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). This decision will directly shape the rules of the game for the entire cryptocurrency sector. Why is this US Senate vote on CFTC and FDIC chairs so important? The US Senate vote on CFTC and FDIC chairs is not just routine Washington procedure. It’s a decision with profound consequences for market stability and innovation. The CFTC oversees derivatives markets, including crypto futures and swaps, while the FDIC insures bank deposits and influences how traditional banks interact with crypto firms. Their leadership sets the regulatory tone. If confirmed, Michael Selig will lead the CFTC and acting Chair Travis Hill will officially head the FDIC. Their approaches to enforcement, rule-making, and industry guidance will either foster a clear, supportive environment or create new hurdles for crypto businesses and investors. What does this mean for the future of cryptocurrency? The outcome of this US Senate vote on CFTC and FDIC chairs will send immediate signals to the market. Regulatory clarity is the single biggest request from institutional investors. Confirmation of these nominees could accelerate progress on several fronts: Market Structure: Clearer rules for crypto exchanges and trading platforms. Consumer Protection: Enhanced safeguards against fraud and manipulation. Banking Access: Improved relationships between crypto companies and FDIC-insured banks. Innovation Pathways: Defined frameworks for new products like spot Bitcoin ETFs and tokenized assets. However, challenges remain. The division of authority between the CFTC and the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) over different crypto assets is still a complex issue. The leadership confirmed by this US Senate vote will need to navigate this jurisdictional overlap carefully. Actionable insights for the crypto community While the US Senate vote on CFTC and FDIC chairs happens in Washington, its effects ripple out to every participant in the crypto ecosystem. Here’s what you should watch for in the coming weeks: Post-Confirmation Statements: Listen for the first public remarks from the confirmed chairs regarding their regulatory priorities for digital assets. Enforcement Trends: Monitor whether the CFTC under new leadership increases or refines its enforcement actions against unregistered crypto derivatives platforms. Banking Guidance: Watch for any new FDIC bulletins that clarify risk management for banks dealing with crypto asset custodianship. Legislative Momentum: This vote could catalyze movement on broader crypto legislation, such as market structure bills, that have been stalled in Congress. The key takeaway? Regulatory uncertainty is a major market risk. A smooth confirmation process and the installation of permanent leadership can help reduce that risk, potentially leading to greater institutional capital inflows and mainstream adoption. The bottom line for investors and builders This upcoming US Senate vote on CFTC and FDIC chairs represents a critical inflection point. For years, the crypto industry has operated in a patchwork regulatory environment. The individuals leading these agencies will be responsible for interpreting and enforcing rules that are still being written. A stable, predictable regulatory framework is the foundation for sustainable growth. It protects consumers, deters bad actors, and gives legitimate projects the confidence to build and innovate. The vote next week is a significant step toward establishing that framework. Therefore, the entire sector has a vested interest in its outcome. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who are the nominees for the CFTC and FDIC chairs? A1: The nominee for CFTC Chair is Michael Selig. The nominee for FDIC Chair is the current acting chair, Travis Hill. Q2: When exactly is the US Senate vote scheduled? A2: The confirmation votes are scheduled for early next week, according to reports from CoinDesk. Q3: How does the CFTC regulate cryptocurrency? A3: The CFTC regulates cryptocurrency derivatives, such as futures and swaps contracts, treating Bitcoin and Ether as commodities under its jurisdiction. Q4: What is the FDIC’s role in crypto? A4: The FDIC insures deposits at US banks. Its policies influence whether and how traditional banks can provide services to cryptocurrency companies, which is crucial for crypto banking and custody solutions. Q5: Will this vote immediately change crypto regulations? A5: Not immediately. The vote confirms the leaders. Regulatory change is a slower process involving proposed rules, public comments, and final rulings. However, leadership sets the agenda and enforcement priorities. Q6: Why should an average crypto investor care about this? A6: Clear regulation reduces systemic risk, deters fraud, and can lead to more investment products (like ETFs) becoming available, ultimately creating a safer and more robust market for all participants.

The transfer was sent to wallets tied to Coinbase Prime, raising questions about whether the company is reshaping part of its treasury while attention grows around its potential public listing. Ledger Shuffle Raises Questions Reports have disclosed that this move is only the latest in a series of large bitcoin transfers involving wallets believed to be linked to SpaceX. Analysts tracking the transactions say the pattern looks more like a shift into institutional custody rather than an immediate market sale, since Coinbase Prime is commonly used for storage and structured trades by large companies. SpaceX is estimated to hold around 8,285 BTC, a stash worth roughly $770 million based on recent market prices. That amount places the company among the biggest private holders of bitcoin. Records show the balance was once higher during 2022, though part of it has been reduced over time as transfers continued. SpaceX( @SpaceX ) just transferred out another 1,021 $BTC ($94.48M), to possibly Coinbase Prime for custody. https://t.co/zW62EKM2RD pic.twitter.com/PwBIvD5RaR — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 10, 2025 SpaceX: IPO Talk Adds Pressure At the same time, reports from major outlets say SpaceX is preparing for an initial public offering that could take place in 2026. Coverage has suggested the fundraising round may target tens of billions of dollars, and estimates of the company’s possible valuation range from $800 billion to more than $1.5 trillion. Elon Musk reacted on social media to one of the reports, saying the information was accurate, which added more weight to expectations that a listing is being planned. Because companies often adjust their balance sheets ahead of a public offering, analysts say moving crypto into institutional platforms would not be unusual. It can be done for audits, custody needs, or overall treasury preparation before large financial transactions. What The Move Might Signal A transfer into Coinbase Prime does not automatically mean a bitcoin sale is underway. Institutional accounts can hold assets for long periods without sending them directly to the open market. Traders watching the activity say that only an actual sale — not a custody transfer — would create immediate pressure on Bitcoin prices. Still, the timing stands out. The latest 1,021 BTC move comes during a period where SpaceX’s on-chain activity has increased. More transfers may follow if the company continues preparing documents and financial disclosures linked to a potential public listing. The main question now is whether the recent shift was routine treasury work or part of a larger strategy connected to the IPO. SpaceX has not issued a public statement on the transaction, leaving analysts to rely on blockchain data and regulatory reporting to understand what comes next.

According to live data from Binance’s USDT trading pair, BTC is currently trading around $91,960.31. This sudden move has left many investors wondering: is this a minor correction or the start of a deeper trend? Let’s unpack the situation. What’s Driving the Current Bitcoin Price Action? Market movements rarely happen in a vacuum. While the immediate Bitcoin price drop is clear, several underlying factors often contribute to such shifts. Understanding these can provide much-needed context for traders and long-term holders alike. Firstly, broader market sentiment plays a huge role. When traditional markets like stocks experience volatility, cryptocurrency often follows. Secondly, on-chain data, such as exchange inflows and outflows, can signal whether large holders are accumulating or distributing their coins. Finally, technical analysis levels, like the $92,000 mark, act as psychological barriers for traders. How Should Investors React to BTC Volatility? Seeing the Bitcoin price dip can trigger emotional decisions. However, a strategic approach is far more effective. Here are three actionable insights for navigating this volatility: Review Your Strategy: Does this dip align with your buying targets, or was your plan to hold regardless of short-term noise? Assess Risk: Ensure your portfolio allocation to crypto still matches your personal risk tolerance. Look for Context: Check if this drop is isolated to Bitcoin or if the entire crypto market is moving in sync. Remember, Bitcoin’s history is defined by cycles of dramatic peaks and troughs. Short-term price action, while important, is just one piece of the long-term puzzle. Is This a Buying Opportunity or a Warning Sign? This is the million-dollar question every investor is asking. The answer depends entirely on your perspective and goals. For some, a pullback in the Bitcoin price presents a chance to ‘buy the dip’ at a more attractive entry point. For others, especially short-term traders, it may signal a shift in momentum that warrants caution. Key indicators to watch now include whether Bitcoin can reclaim the $92,000 level as support and the trading volume accompanying the move. High volume on a down day can suggest stronger selling pressure. Conversely, stabilizing at a new level with lower volume might indicate the sell-off is exhausting itself. Conclusion: Navigating the Waves of Crypto Markets Today’s Bitcoin price movement below $92,000 serves as a potent reminder of the asset’s inherent volatility. While headlines focus on the number, savvy participants look deeper at the ‘why’ and the ‘what next.’ Whether you view this as a temporary setback or a significant shift, informed decisions based on data and a clear personal strategy will always outperform reactive, emotion-driven trading. The market’s next move is uncertain, but your preparedness doesn’t have to be. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why did the Bitcoin price fall below $92,000? The price drop is likely due to a combination of factors including broader market sentiment, profit-taking by short-term traders, and a break below a key technical support level that triggered automated sell orders. Should I sell my Bitcoin now? This is a personal decision based on your investment strategy. If you are a long-term holder believing in Bitcoin’s fundamentals, short-term dips may be less relevant. Always consult your financial plan. How low could the Bitcoin price go? Predicting exact price floors is impossible. Analysts watch other support levels, like $90,000 or $88,000, but market conditions can change rapidly. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? For investors using a ‘Dollar-Cost Averaging’ (DCA) strategy, any price can be a good time to buy a small, scheduled amount. For others, it may present a lower entry point than yesterday, but there are no guarantees. What is the best platform to track the Bitcoin price? Reputable cryptocurrency data aggregators and major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken provide real-time price data. Always use multiple sources for verification. Will this affect other cryptocurrencies? Typically, yes. Bitcoin often sets the trend for the wider crypto market. When BTC experiences significant volatility, altcoins frequently follow suit, often with greater intensity. Found this analysis helpful? Understanding market moves empowers the entire community.

However, a new partnership is changing the game. Swiss hardware wallet leader Tangem has integrated with the powerhouse DeFi lending protocol, Aave. This move directly allows users to earn stablecoin yield on assets like USDT and USDC with unprecedented simplicity and security. Let’s explore how this integration works and why it’s a significant step for mainstream DeFi adoption. What Does the Tangem and Aave Integration Mean for You? This partnership bridges the gap between secure cold storage and decentralized finance (DeFi) earning potential. Previously, to earn a stablecoin yield on Aave, you typically needed to connect a software wallet, manage private keys on an internet-connected device, and navigate multiple steps. Tangem’s integration streamlines this process. Now, you can deposit your stablecoins directly from your Tangem card—a physical, self-custody wallet—into Aave’s liquidity pools. The transaction is signed offline on the card, keeping your keys secure, while you seamlessly access DeFi’s earning power. How to Start Earning Stablecoin Yield with Tangem The process is designed for user-friendliness. If you own a Tangem wallet and some stablecoins, getting started is straightforward. First, ensure your Tangem app is updated to the latest version. Then, within the app’s interface, you will find the new Aave integration module. From there, you can select which stablecoin to deposit (USDC or USDT), review the projected stablecoin yield rate, and confirm the transaction by tapping your Tangem card. Your assets are now supplied to the Aave protocol, and you will begin accruing interest in real-time, all without exposing your private keys online. Why This Partnership is a Game-Changer for DeFi This collaboration addresses two critical pillars of crypto: security and accessibility. Tangem provides bank-grade security through its offline transaction signing. Aave offers one of the most trusted and liquid platforms for earning yield. Together, they create a powerful and safe on-ramp for everyday users into DeFi. The benefits are clear: Enhanced Security: Private keys never leave the Tangem card. Simplified Access: Earn yield directly from a user-friendly mobile app. Reduced Risk: Combines the safety of cold storage with DeFi opportunities. Stable Earnings: Focus on stablecoin yield minimizes exposure to crypto volatility. What Are the Potential Challenges to Consider? While this integration is a leap forward, users should remain informed. The stablecoin yield rates on Aave are variable and depend on market supply and demand; they are not fixed. Furthermore, as with any DeFi protocol, there are inherent smart contract risks, though Aave is one of the most audited and time-tested platforms. It’s also crucial to understand that you are interacting with a decentralized protocol; the integration is a gateway, not a custodial service. Therefore, doing your own research (DYOR) on both Tangem and Aave remains essential. Conclusion: A Secure Step Toward Mainstream DeFi Earnings The Tangem and Aave integration marks a pivotal moment where high-security custody meets user-friendly DeFi yield generation. It demystifies the process of earning a stablecoin yield , making it accessible to anyone who prioritizes the safety of their assets. By removing technical barriers and leveraging Tangem’s intuitive hardware, this partnership paves the way for the next wave of users to confidently explore and benefit from decentralized finance. It’s a compelling blend of innovation, security, and practical utility. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Do I need to move my crypto to a new wallet to use this? A: No. If you already use a Tangem wallet, you can use it directly. If not, you would need to purchase one and transfer your stablecoins to it. Q: Is the stablecoin yield paid daily? A: Yield accrues continuously in real-time. You can see your growing balance within the Tangem app whenever you check it. Q: Are my funds locked when supplying to Aave? A: No, they are not locked in a traditional sense. You can withdraw your supplied stablecoins and accrued yield back to your Tangem wallet at any time, subject to Aave’s protocol liquidity. Q: What are the fees involved? A: You will pay standard Ethereum network gas fees to initiate the deposit and later for withdrawal. Aave also takes a small percentage of the yield generated as a protocol fee. Q: Is this service available worldwide? A: Availability may depend on local regulations. It’s best to check Tangem’s and Aave’s official resources for any geographic restrictions. Q: How does this differ from a centralized exchange (CEX) savings product? A: With Tangem and Aave, you retain full self-custody of your assets. On a CEX, you typically lend your coins to the exchange itself. This integration uses a decentralized, non-custodial protocol.

This development unlocks a new realm of decentralized finance (DeFi) possibilities for XRP holders, who can now securely explore applications on other blockchains without selling their original assets. Let’s break down what this means for the ecosystem. What is Wrapped XRP and Why Does It Matter? Wrapped tokens are essentially blockchain bridges. They represent a token from one blockchain, like XRP from the XRP Ledger, on a completely different network, such as Ethereum or Polygon. Each wrapped XRP token is pegged 1:1 to the value of a real XRP held securely in reserve by a custodian like Hex Trust. Therefore, this mechanism allows the value and utility of XRP to travel to ecosystems where it wasn’t natively available before. How Does Hex Trust’s Service Empower Users? Hex Trust’s entry into the wrapped XRP space brings a critical element: institutional-grade security and trust. As a licensed and regulated custodian, they manage the complex process of wrapping and unwrapping tokens. For users, this translates to a simplified and secure experience. Secure Custody: The underlying XRP backing the wXRP tokens is held in Hex Trust’s bank-grade, insured custody solutions. Seamless Issuance: Users can convert their XRP into wXRP (and vice-versa) through Hex Trust’s platform, ensuring the peg is maintained. DeFi Gateway: With wXRP in hand, users can finally leverage their XRP holdings across hundreds of DeFi protocols for lending, borrowing, yield farming, and more on other chains. What Are the Broader Implications for Crypto? This launch is more than just a new service; it’s a signal of maturation for the entire digital asset space. Firstly, it addresses a long-standing demand from the XRP community for greater utility. Secondly, it demonstrates how regulated institutions are building the necessary infrastructure to connect siloed blockchain economies safely. This kind of trusted interoperability is crucial for mainstream adoption, as it reduces technical barriers and counterparty risk for investors. Are There Any Challenges to Consider? While promising, using wrapped XRP and wrapped assets, in general, does introduce considerations. Users must trust the custodian (in this case, Hex Trust) to hold the reserves correctly. There’s also smart contract risk associated with the wXRP token on its destination chain. However, partnering with an established, audited custodian like Hex Trust significantly mitigates the first concern, making this a compelling option for cautious investors. In conclusion, Hex Trust’s launch of wrapped XRP custody and issuance is a pivotal step. It securely bridges the XRP ecosystem with the expansive world of DeFi, providing holders with new avenues for growth and utility. This move not only empowers individual users but also strengthens the interconnected fabric of the blockchain industry, paving the way for a more fluid and functional digital asset landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is the main benefit of using wrapped XRP (wXRP)? A: The primary benefit is accessing DeFi applications on other blockchains (like Ethereum) using the value of your XRP holdings without having to sell them. Q: Is my XRP safe when it’s wrapped by Hex Trust? A: Hex Trust is a regulated, institutional custodian. Your original XRP is held in their secure, insured custody while you use the wXRP representation on other chains. Q: Can I unwrap my wXRP back to native XRP? A: Yes. A key function of Hex Trust’s service is allowing you to redeem your wXRP tokens to receive your native XRP back at a 1:1 ratio. Q: On which blockchains will wXRP be available? A> While the initial report doesn’t specify, wrapped assets typically target EVM-compatible chains like Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche to access their large DeFi ecosystems. Q: Do I need a Hex Trust account to use wXRP? A> To mint or redeem wXRP through their official service, yes. However, once wXRP is in circulation on other chains, you may trade or use it in DeFi protocols like any other ERC-20 token. Q: Are there fees for wrapping or unwrapping XRP? A> Custody and issuance services typically involve fees. You should check Hex Trust’s official platform for their specific fee structure for the wXRP service.

This development follows the expansion of Prediction markets’ presence throughout the U.S., offering “event contracts” on sports, elections, news, entertainment, and other topics. Coinbase prepares to launch tokenized stocks and prediction markets Coinbase, the U.S.’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, will unveil its products at a showcase on December 17, according to the person, who asked not to be named because the information had not yet been made public. Its tokenized stocks will be launched in-house, not through partners, they said. Initially, Coinbase executives said that they intend to enter these businesses, but they have not yet officially announced their plans. Still, screenshots of apps have been circulating on social network X, hinting at the functionality for several weeks. When contacted for feedback, a Coinbase spokesperson declined to comment specifically on the company’s plans but said, “Tune in to the livestream on Dec. 17 to find out what new products Coinbase is shipping.” The development is part of the company’s push to become an “everything app,” enabling traders to access multiple assets and markets, and to keep pace with competitors who are also diversifying. Earlier this year, Robinhood Markets released prediction market products from Kalshi Inc. Additionally, Robinhood and the crypto exchange Kraken have tokenized U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds, although only outside the U.S. Data from tracker rwa.xyz shows that trading in tokenized equities, which are digital stocks tied to blockchain, has been rising, with monthly transfer volume up 32% in the last month to $1.45 billion. Rising popularity of prediction markets attracts crypto and retail platforms Prediction markets, where users can bet on events such as sports and elections, have experienced a surge in popularity over the past year, attracting attention from both traditional financial exchanges and cryptocurrency platforms. This week, Gemini, the crypto exchange co-founded by billionaire twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, received approval to launch its own prediction markets. Crypto.com, another exchange, has partnered with the likes of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. to help them launch prediction markets. Coinbase is announcing the new products as the crypto market continues to teeter after a sharp October selloff. The company’s shares are still up 8.3% this year. In related development, Kalshi and Crypto.com have also established a national alliance of prediction market operators, which includes cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, retail trading platform Robinhood, and sports gaming operator Underdog. The group, the Coalition for Prediction Markets (CPM), has followed the boom in U.S. prediction markets since the start of the year. A federal court’s dismissal last year of a prohibition on election betting has also fueled the sector’s surge. “This was the catalyst for growing investor interest, and this new coalition will further legitimize the sector, strengthening operating rules and setting a higher bar for integrity standards,” said Nick Jones, founder of crypto firm Zumo. Prediction market platforms enable users to trade binary contracts on various outcomes, including politics, sports, economics, and entertainment.

Caroline Pham, the acting Chair and commissioner of CFTC, hinted at this decision. In a statement dated Thursday, December 11, Pham mentioned that the CFTC will reverse guidelines from 2020 that follow the Dodd-Frank Act, a federal regulation established in 2010 to address issues raised from the 2008 financial crisis. Notably, these guidelines, set to be withdrawn, concentrate on the “actual delivery” of digital assets. The move follows the recent publication of a list comprising the first members of its CEO Innovation Council. Sources close to the situation revealed that this council was established to review transformations in the derivatives market, with a specific focus on cryptocurrency, tokenization, and blockchain technology. Notably, some of the major crypto industry CEOs joining this council include Shayne Coplan from Polymarket , Tyler Winklevoss from Gemini, and Arjun Sethi from Kraken. Leaders from prominent companies, including Nasdaq, Intercontinental Exchange, CME Group, and Cboe Global Markets, will accompany them. This team of CEOs was formed over a period of just two weeks. According to Pham, the focus will primarily be on advancements in sectors such as derivatives markets connected to tokenization, crypto assets, 24/7 trading, perpetual contracts, prediction markets, and blockchain infrastructure. The White House issues an order mandating the CFTC to oversee digital assets The CFTC’s sudden decision has ignited heated debates in the crypto ecosystem. In an attempt to address this controversy, Pham alleged that this move aligns with US President Donald Trump’s earlier proposals, as presented in a report by his Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. Following these suggestions, sources close to the situation highlighted that the White House released a detailed report on cryptocurrency over the summer. This report addressed topics such as illicit finance and tax evasion. It also mandated that the CFTC be granted the opportunity to oversee digital assets. Responding to this announcement, Pham noted, “Today’s announcement demonstrates that we can make real progress to protect Americans by ensuring access to safe U.S. markets.” Meanwhile, reports have noted that since Trump assumed the presidency of the United States, Pham has led several projects at the CFTC focused on supporting the crypto ecosystem. Some of these initiatives include the introduction of the “Crypto Sprint,” which was designed to establish clear regulations for cryptocurrencies. To further demonstrate the commission’s efforts to back the crypto industry, the acting chair unveiled last week that Bitnomial positioned itself as the first exchange to successfully list spot crypto products after securing approval from regulators. Additionally, a major, regulated cryptocurrency exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, Gemini, received clearance from the CFTC on Wednesday, December 10, allowing it to provide users with classic binary event contracts. As cryptocurrencies become increasingly adopted among individuals, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency declared this week that national banks are granted permission to directly engage in “riskless principal” transactions involving digital assets. Trump’s pro-crypto stance encourages more exposure to the crypto industry Regarding Bitnomial’s move to provide spot cryptocurrency products approved by regulators, analysts acknowledge that this practice demonstrates the Trump administration and federal agencies’ efforts to encourage a more positive attitude towards the crypto industry. Pham, on the other hand, mentioned that such a moment illustrates “a new golden age for innovation in America.” At this time, Bitnomial was about to introduce its services officially. “The CFTC has a strong tradition of encouraging responsible innovation on futures exchanges while balancing regulatory flexibility with essential principles that protect both institutional and retail traders,” the acting chair said. She added that this administration has developed a comprehensive plan, under the guidance of the U.S. president, to purposefully ensure the country reclaims its position as a leader in digital asset markets globally. In this plan, Pham asserted that the CFTC will play a key role. Following the “Crypto Sprint” initiative, sources stated that this move came after the SEC and CFTC released a joint statement in September, clarifying that registered exchanges are allowed to promote the trading of certain spot commodity products, including crypto assets.

55665995,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=244077,1765503611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Sui Blockchain: The Revolutionary Car Leaving Ethereum’s Carriage Behind,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sui-blockchain-ethereum-comparison-future/,"BitcoinWorld Sui Blockchain: The Revolutionary Car Leaving Ethereum’s Carriage Behind Imagine a world where blockchain technology evolves from horse-drawn carriages to high-speed vehicles. That’s exactly the powerful analogy Christian Thompson, Managing Director of the Sui Foundation, uses to describe the Sui blockchain versus Ethereum. In a recent interview, Thompson made bold claims about Sui’s position in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, suggesting we’re witnessing a fundamental shift in how blockchains operate. Why is the Sui Blockchain Considered a Modern Vehicle? Christian Thompson’s carriage versus car comparison isn’t just marketing hype. It represents a fundamental difference in architectural philosophy. While Ethereum pioneered smart contracts and decentralized applications, its design faces scalability challenges. The Sui blockchain , however, was engineered from the ground up with different priorities. Thompson explains that Sui started as a Layer 1 solution specifically to create what he calls “a fast and efficient network.” This means the team didn’t simply copy existing blockchain designs. Instead, they reimagined core components like transaction processing and data storage. The result? A blockchain that promises to handle significantly more transactions per second while maintaining security and decentralization. What Makes Sui a Top-Tier Layer 1 Solution? According to Thompson, the Sui blockchain has moved beyond comparing itself to other chains. He asserts it has firmly established itself among elite Layer 1 blockchains. This confidence comes from several technical advantages: Parallel transaction processing that eliminates bottlenecks Object-centric architecture that differs from account-based models Built-in scalability that grows with network demand Enhanced interoperability with other blockchain ecosystems These features address pain points that have plagued earlier blockchain generations. For example, parallel processing means multiple transactions can occur simultaneously rather than waiting in line. This approach fundamentally changes how networks handle increased activity. How Does Sui Enable Institutional Blockchain Adoption? Thompson emphasizes a crucial point about the Sui blockchain : its design directly supports institutional adoption. Traditional financial institutions and large enterprises have specific requirements that many blockchains struggle to meet. These include predictable transaction costs, guaranteed finality times, and enterprise-grade security. The Sui Foundation director argues that high-performance Layer 1 solutions like Sui provide the necessary foundation for serious institutional involvement. When transaction speeds resemble traditional digital systems and costs remain stable even during peak demand, blockchain technology becomes viable for mainstream business applications. This represents a significant step beyond speculative trading and into practical utility. What Challenges Does the Sui Blockchain Face? Despite its technical advantages, the Sui blockchain confronts substantial hurdles. The most significant challenge isn’t technological but rather ecosystem development. Ethereum boasts a massive network effect with thousands of developers, applications, and users. Building comparable community engagement takes time and strategic effort. Additionally, the blockchain space has seen numerous “Ethereum killers” come and go. Each promised revolutionary improvements but struggled to gain lasting traction. Sui must demonstrate not just technical superiority but also sustainable growth in real-world usage. The project needs compelling applications that drive genuine user adoption beyond speculative interest. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts For those following blockchain development, the evolution of the Sui blockchain offers valuable lessons. First, technological innovation continues at a rapid pace in cryptocurrency. Second, architectural decisions made during a blockchain’s creation have long-lasting implications. Third, institutional adoption requires specific technical characteristics that newer blockchains are specifically designing for. Thompson’s perspective suggests we’re entering a new phase of blockchain development where performance and practicality take priority over being first to market. As the technology matures, the focus shifts from what’s possible to what’s practical for widespread use. The Future Road for Sui and Blockchain Technology The carriage versus car analogy powerfully captures blockchain’s evolution. Early systems like Ethereum proved the concept worked, much like carriages proved wheeled transportation worked. Now, projects like the Sui blockchain aim to optimize that concept for mass adoption, similar to how cars transformed personal transportation. Thompson’s vision positions Sui not as an Ethereum replacement but as part of blockchain’s natural progression. Different solutions will serve different needs, with high-performance options like Sui potentially dominating applications requiring speed and efficiency. The ultimate test will be whether developers and users embrace this new architecture for their decentralized applications. Frequently Asked Questions What is the main difference between Sui and Ethereum? Sui uses a parallel transaction processing model and object-centric architecture, while Ethereum uses sequential processing and an account-based model. This fundamental difference allows Sui to potentially handle more transactions simultaneously. Is Sui really faster than Ethereum? Based on its architecture, Sui is designed for higher throughput and lower latency. However, real-world performance depends on network conditions, application design, and adoption levels. Laboratory tests show promising results, but widespread usage will provide the true test. Can Sui applications interact with Ethereum applications? Yes, Sui was designed with interoperability in mind. While direct interaction requires bridging solutions or cross-chain protocols, the blockchain includes features to facilitate communication with other networks including Ethereum. What types of applications benefit most from Sui’s architecture? Applications requiring high transaction volumes with low fees benefit most. This includes gaming platforms, decentralized exchanges, social media applications, and any system expecting frequent user interactions. How does Sui achieve its scalability? Sui uses several techniques including parallel transaction execution, efficient data storage methods, and a consensus mechanism optimized for its architecture. These combine to allow the network to scale with increased demand. Is Sui secure despite being newer than Ethereum? Sui employs robust cryptographic techniques and has undergone multiple security audits. However, as with any newer blockchain, it has less battle-tested history than Ethereum. The team prioritizes security in its development process. Found this comparison between Sui and Ethereum enlightening?

What Is the Vision for a Crypto-AI Economy? This is more than just a technical project; it’s an economic blueprint. The ultimate goal is to foster a vibrant crypto-AI economy. In this new economy, autonomous AI agents could operate seamlessly. They could license data and models directly on-chain and, crucially, automatically pay or receive royalties based on actual usage. This creates a self-sustaining ecosystem for innovation. Consider this actionable insight: For developers, this means a new revenue model where their AI creations can generate continuous, micro-transaction-based income. For enterprises, it offers a verifiable audit trail for compliance and ethical AI sourcing. The potential is transformative. What Are the Challenges Ahead? Building this future is not without obstacles. The technology for scalable, cost-effective verifiable computation is still maturing. Furthermore, achieving widespread adoption requires convincing developers and companies to migrate to a new paradigm. However, the partnership between Story Protocol and EigenCloud represents a significant step toward overcoming these hurdles. Their combined expertise in IP management and decentralized infrastructure is a powerful combination. In summary, the collaboration to build a verifiable AI infrastructure is a pivotal development at the intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence. By proving data origin and automating IP royalties on-chain, it lays the foundation for a more transparent, fair, and innovative AI-driven future. This initiative could very well redefine how we create, share, and monetize intelligence in the digital age. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is verifiable AI infrastructure?

While many expected a stronger reaction from Ethereum, the asset instead slipped lower as traders reassessed the macro environment and the implications of a potential shift toward stagflation. Despite this pullback, on-chain data suggests that the underlying market structure may be quietly improving. According to new insights from CryptoQuant, Ethereum’s Net Taker Volume (30-day moving average) is showing a clear upward trend in its lows. This metric tracks the balance between aggressive buyers and sellers in the derivatives market . Although ETH remains under selling pressure, the data reveals that the intensity of aggressive selling has been weakening steadily over the past several weeks. Each subsequent negative low is forming higher than the previous one, signaling that sellers are losing dominance. While the broader sentiment remains cautious, subtle improvements in Net Taker Volume suggest that ETH’s current weakness may be masking the early stage of a larger structural shift. Net Taker Volume Signals a Potential Structural Shift According to CryptoQuant’s CoinCare, Ethereum may once again be approaching a pivotal turning point. The report highlights that a similar Net Taker Volume structure appeared earlier this year. After forming a clear bottom in January 2025, the metric began to trend upward—even while remaining in the negative zone—indicating that aggressive sellers were gradually losing strength. By April, Net Taker Volume flipped decisively into positive territory. From that exact moment, Ethereum entered one of its strongest rallies of the cycle, surging more than 3x and printing a new all-time high. Current conditions echo that same pattern. Since the peak of selling pressure in September, the market has continuously absorbed sell flows for nearly three months. Each negative low in Net Taker Volume has formed higher than the previous one, revealing improving market resilience despite the broader downtrend. If this trajectory holds, CoinCare estimates that a positive flip in Net Taker Volume may be only about a month away. Historically, this transition from negative to positive has marked the beginning of Ethereum’s most explosive breakout phases. A confirmed move into positive territory would represent a high-probability trigger for the next expansion toward new all-time highs, signaling that momentum is quietly rebuilding beneath the surface. ETH Weekly Structure Attempts a Recovery Ethereum’s weekly chart shows the market attempting to stabilize after several weeks of volatility, with price currently trading near $3,195 following a strong rebound from the $2,800 zone. This area acted as a key demand region in mid-2024 and has once again provided support, preventing a deeper breakdown. The recent weekly candle reflects renewed buying interest, closing firmly above the 50-week moving average, a level that often defines medium-term trend direction. Despite this rebound, ETH still faces structural challenges. The 100-week moving average — now overhead — has acted as resistance throughout the current downtrend, and the price rejected it again on the latest push toward $3,447. Until Ethereum can reclaim this dynamic resistance with conviction, the broader trend remains neutral to slightly bearish. Volume also shows a notable shift: sell-side activity has been declining over the past month, while buyers are beginning to step in more aggressively at key support levels. This aligns with the improvement in on-chain metrics, suggesting weakening selling pressure. For bulls, the next major objective is a weekly close above $3,400, which would signal a potential trend reversal. A failure to break this level, however, risks another retest of $2,900–$2,800, where market sentiment would again be tested.

Some analysts have suggested that the cryptocurrency is setting the stage for a massive short-term and mid-term rally if the retests of current levels hold. Related Reading: Cathie Wood Says Bitcoin Is ‘Climbing Another Wall Of Worry’– Here’s Why Dogecoin Prepares For $1 Milestone On Thursday, Dogecoin followed the rest of the crypto market and retraced to the $0.136-$0.138 levels. The cryptocurrency has retraced around 50% following the Q4 market downturn, trading within the $0.130-$0.155 price range over the past few weeks. Amid this week’s recovery, DOGE’s price briefly tested the local range highs, trying to break out of this area for the second time this month. However, Wednesday’s volatility, driven by the expectations of the Federal Reserve’s rate cut announcement, led to a 4.6% intraday drop before continuing its descent to the current levels. Market observer Trader Tardigrade highlighted the cryptocurrency’s performance, noting that Dogecoin is holding strong at a key support area despite the pullback, which could “potentially set the stage for a massive surge to $1” next year. According to the chart, DOGE is retesting an ascending support zone that has preceded major moves over the past two years. Since late 2023, this support has been retested three times, marking the bottom of each major corrective phase and serving as a “launchpad” to new highs. Notably, the subsequent rally’s size and duration have seen an increasing trend, with the bounces lasting longer and reaching higher levels after each retest of the two-year trendline. During the first rebound, Dogecoin rallied 87% in eight weeks. Meanwhile, DOGE surged by over 210% in ten weeks after retesting this crucial level. Lastly, it registered a 14-week 442% run between Q3 and Q4, 2024, to its multi-year high of $0.48. With the price currently retesting this level once again, the analyst suggested that a rally to the $1 mark could be brewing if the current levels hold. A bounce from this area could kick off a 610% jump at the start of 2026. DOGE’s Rally To September Highs Imminent? The trader also pointed out that DOGE’s MACD Bullish Crossover “is now happening.” He explained that the cryptocurrency’s trend began shifting from a downtrend to an uptrend on Wednesday, suggesting a significant price move is to follow. He previously affirmed that this setup has preceded previous breakouts this year, with the price surging to new local highs in Q2 and Q3 after each MACD bullish cross. As this setup begins to unfold, the analyst’s chart suggests that the price could bounce to the October levels. Similarly, other market observers hinted that Dogecoin could be preparing for a 60%-120% surge in the short term. Analyst Bitcoinsensus highlighted a classic bullish reversal pattern, a falling wedge pattern, that has been forming since October in DOGE’s chart.

If we get a decent breakout above the upper yellow line, we could be targeting the 0.20$ area (+60%),” the analyst stated. Meanwhile, AltCryptoTalk recently noted that Dogecoin is retesting “the same weekly demand zone that sparked every major rally in the past,” which could spark a 115% rally to the $0.30 September high if the area holds. As of this writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.137, an 8% decline in the weekly timeframe.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs and Macquarie Securities both told the trading floor this week that Kunlunxin, Baidu’s chip unit, will unlock serious value if it goes public, advising investors to start considering it. Hong Kong-listed shares of Baidu have now had their average price target boosted by around 60% since late August, which was just a little over 3 months ago, and the third-largest rally across the Hang Seng Tech Index entire history. China’s state regulator has approved the public listing of Kunlunxin in Hong Kong, meaning an AI chip unit ran by the CCP is going to have its own stock by this time next year. It’s all so serious. Baidu’s chip unit pulls in big orders and bigger bets Since China Mobile, a state-owned telecom giant, handed Kunlunxin its first big chip order, Baidu’s stock has surged 45%, and that was before the IPO talk even started. Ellie Jiang, an analyst at Macquarie, said Kunlunxin is now worth around $16.5 billion based on Baidu’s 59% ownership, which is about 30% of her total valuation for the company. Ellie is predicting that Kunlunxin’s revenue will double to $1.4 billion next year, putting it neck and neck with Cambricon Technologies, the domestic chipmaker that global retail investors love to call “China’s Nvidia.” But hey, Cambricon is dealing with capacity bottlenecks, and Huawei is still dealing with foreign tech restrictions, so they’re not really ready to face Nvidia right now. Kunlunxin, on the other hand, already has a real customer base and is deeply integrated across Baidu’s cloud platform, powering its AI models, infrastructure, and applications. Goldman Sachs argued that Baidu’s edge is growing as demand shifts toward inference chips. “Baidu Cloud can offer alternative options for AI models inference and even training tasks, at competitive pricing,” said the bank in a research note Thursday. “As chip demand moves towards inference usage over time, Baidu’s Kunlun could be a good fit for users given its high inference efficiency.” Nvidia hits a wall as China boosts local players While Donald Trump just approved restricted access to Nvidia’s H200 chips for China after nearly a year of delays, that green light didn’t go very far. Xi Jinping immediately responded that he would still limit imports of Nvidia’s chips. His priority, he said, was pushing domestic firms like Kunlunxin instead. It wasn’t expected, but also kind of was. This is the AI Wars after all, and as much as Trump likes to say it, Jinping isn’t actually his friend. For China, the priority remains global tech dominance. They’ve been saying that for at least a decade now. ANyway, this leaves Nvidia more exposed, because as Jensen Huang has said time and time again, his company still needs the Chinese market. Without it, all of the company’s plans kind of come to a bit of a halt. We can prove it too. In Q3, Nvidia’s accounts receivable (money customers owe) jumped $16 billion to $33 billion. But accounts payable, the money Nvidia owes, only climbed $3 billion to $8 billion. That massive gap now has to be funded while Nvidia waits to get paid. And oh boy, things aren’t going smoothly in the markets either. Invesco’s SPHQ ETF, which dumped Nvidia in June, had been beating iShares’ QUAL fund all year… until now. Over the past six months, SPHQ has underperformed by the biggest margin since 2013, except for QUAL’s launch period. Even among so-called “quality” stocks, Nvidia’s current financial setup is triggering volatility that’s throwing off traditional fund strategies. Meanwhile, institutional investors are loading up on Chinese tech. Vanguard, BlackRock, and Fidelity have all been quietly increasing their holdings in Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares. That’s not all. Tencent and Baidu, both building out large-language models for generative AI, have seen their stocks rise by nearly 50%. The trend isn’t slowing. Amundi, BNP Paribas, Fidelity International, and Man Group all expect Chinese equities to keep climbing into 2026. JPMorgan Chase just raised its rating on the market to overweight. And Gary Tan, a fund manager at Allspring Global Investments, called the asset class “indispensable” for foreign money managers now chasing growth outside the US.

Lack of firm dip buying kept Bitcoin’s gains limited. Samer Hasn, senior market analyst at XS.com, said the market still lacks committed buyers, which leaves prices vulnerable. He noted that more than $220M in long liquidations today show leveraged traders pulling back rather than positioning for a rebound. Those liquidations added to the sense that speculative leverage is being flushed out rather than rebuilt, a pattern that often leaves spot moves choppy even when broader risk sentiment improves. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $92,331, up 2.4% Ether : $3,248, up 0.7% XRP : $2.04, up 1.6% Total crypto market cap: $3.23 trillion, up 1.9% Asia Traders Watch Positioning Shifts As ETF Inflows Offer Brief Support For traders in Asia, that backdrop keeps the focus on positioning data and funding rates as much as on the headline price. One support pillar came from US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Data provider SoSo Value reported more than $223M of net inflows on Thursday, the strongest reading in twenty days. In the current environment, however, these flows may reflect short-term positioning rather than sticky institutional demand, and could reverse quickly if equity markets wobble again. Bitfinex analysts said the next moves will hinge on Fed signals, Treasury market reactions, ETF flows and the behaviour of ETH relative to BTC. They noted that the steady rise in ETH/BTC, even with low network fees, suggests capital is rotating back into Ethereum’s longer-term story, making the pair a useful gauge of risk appetite in crypto. Global Benchmarks Hit New Highs As Traders Position For Gentler Fed Settings Global markets have been recalibrating since the Federal Reserve delivered a third consecutive interest rate cut this week while sounding less hawkish than many feared. The move helped lift the MSCI All Country World Index to a new closing high and pushed the dollar index down to a two-month low near 98.30, as traders leaned into the idea that policy is slowly shifting toward easier settings.

Traders are still betting on two cuts in 2026 even though the Fed’s latest projections point to only one. In equity markets, MSCI’s broad index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan rose about 0.7%, tracking Thursday’s mostly higher close in the US, where the Dow and Russell 2000 both notched new highs while the Nasdaq dipped. The move extended a global rally that has favoured cyclicals and small caps, a backdrop that often helps sentiment in higher beta assets such as crypto. Japan Outperforms As Softbank Jumps, While Wall Street Futures Turn Cautious Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 outperformed in morning trade, climbing around 1%. Shares in SoftBank Group jumped about 6% after a Bloomberg News report said the conglomerate is considering an acquisition of the US data centre company Switch Inc, a deal that investors see as another way to capitalise on rising demand for AI infrastructure. Futures pointed to a more cautious open for Wall Street. S&P 500 e-mini contracts were little changed in Asian hours, while Nasdaq futures slipped about 0.2% after Oracle shares plunged 13% overnight. The company’s heavy spending plans and weak forecasts fanned doubts over how quickly large AI investments will translate into profit, triggering a fresh round of tech selling. Tech sentiment was mixed even within the AI complex. Broadcom projected first-quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates, offering some reassurance, but its shares fell about 5% in late trading after it warned that margins would narrow because a higher share of sales is coming from AI.

That future just took a giant leap forward. Ant Group, the Chinese fintech titan, has successfully completed a landmark test for cross-border tokenized deposits in partnership with banking behemoth HSBC and the global messaging network SWIFT. This trial isn’t just another tech experiment; it’s a potential blueprint for the next generation of international finance. What Exactly Is a Cross-Border Tokenized Deposit? Let’s break down this complex-sounding term. A tokenized deposit is a digital representation of money held in a bank. Think of it as a secure, digital twin of your traditional bank balance. This ‘token’ can be programmed and moved on a blockchain or similar digital ledger. Therefore, a cross-border tokenized deposit test involves moving these digital representations of money between banks in different countries. The recent trial by Ant International, HSBC, and SWIFT proved this concept works using established global standards, signaling a major shift in how value might travel in the future. Why Does This Ant Group Test Matter for Global Finance? This collaboration is a powerful signal from major financial players. Here’s why this test is a game-changer: Speed and Efficiency: Traditional cross-border payments can be slow, taking days to settle. Tokenization could slash this time to minutes or even seconds. Transparency and Cost: Every step of a tokenized transaction is recorded. This transparency can reduce errors, cut down on intermediary fees, and lower costs for businesses and consumers. Programmable Money: Tokenized deposits can have rules attached. This opens doors for automated payments, smart contracts in trade finance, and more complex financial products. Interoperability is Key: The test used the ISO 20022 standard through SWIFT. This is crucial because it shows a path where new tokenized systems can work alongside the existing global financial infrastructure, not replace it overnight. What Were the Key Components of the Trial? The success of this cross-border tokenized deposit pilot hinged on three pillars. First, Ant International provided the technological expertise and platform from the fintech world. Second, HSBC brought the deep institutional banking knowledge and global reach. Finally, SWIFT and the ISO 20022 standard acted as the universal translator, ensuring the new tokenized messages could be understood across different financial institutions and borders. This powerful trio demonstrates a practical model for future industry-wide adoption. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Tokenized Deposits? Despite the exciting progress, the road to widespread use of cross-border tokenized deposits has hurdles. Regulatory frameworks vary wildly between countries, and creating a harmonized global approach will be complex. Furthermore, banks must invest significantly in new technology and security systems to handle digital assets. Widespread public and corporate trust in these new digital instruments also needs to be built. However, tests like this one are essential for identifying and solving these challenges in a controlled environment. A Compelling Summary: The Future is Tokenizing The Ant Group, HSBC, and SWIFT trial is more than a technical proof-of-concept. It is a bold statement about the future direction of money. By successfully testing a cross-border tokenized deposit , these giants have shown that the immense efficiency of blockchain technology can be integrated into the trusted, regulated world of traditional banking. This paves the way for a financial system that is faster, cheaper, and more transparent for everyone. The era of programmable, digital money moving across borders is no longer a distant dream—it’s being built today. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is Ant Group’s role in this test? A: Ant Group, through its global arm Ant International, provided the technological platform and expertise for the tokenization and transfer of the digital deposits. Q: Does this mean cryptocurrencies are being used? A: Not exactly. This test involved tokenized deposits , which are digital representations of traditional currency (like USD or EUR) held in regulated banks. It’s different from volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Q: How does SWIFT fit into a blockchain-based test? A> SWIFT acted as the secure messaging layer. It carried the standardized data (using ISO 20022) about the tokenized transaction between the participating banks, proving that new token networks can work with existing financial messaging systems. Q: When will I be able to use tokenized deposits? A> Widespread consumer use is still years away. This was a pilot test. Broader adoption depends on regulatory development, further industry testing, and technological integration by banks worldwide. Q: What are the main benefits for an average person? A> In the future, you could see much faster international money transfers (like remittances), significantly lower fees for sending money abroad, and greater transparency in tracking your cross-border payments. Did you find this deep dive into the future of cross-border finance insightful? This move by Ant Group, HSBC, and SWIFT could reshape how the world moves money.

The latest update introduces two powerful features: seamless cryptocurrency transfers and an encrypted chat function. This evolution signals Worldcoin’s ambition to create a comprehensive, user-centric ecosystem built around its unique proof-of-personhood technology. What’s New in the Worldcoin App? According to a report from Bitcoin World, the updated Worldcoin app now allows users to send and receive WLD tokens directly. Moreover, it includes a built-in messaging platform called World Chat. This dual enhancement transforms the app from a verification tool into a functional hub for digital interaction and finance. Therefore, users have more reasons to engage with the platform daily. How Do the New Crypto Transfers Work? The transfer feature is designed for practicality. It supports virtual accounts, which opens up several real-world use cases. For instance, users can now receive salaries in cryptocurrency or easily deposit and withdraw cash. This functionality lowers the barrier to using crypto for everyday transactions, moving Worldcoin closer to its vision of a global financial network. Send/Receive WLD: Instantly transfer the native WLD token. Virtual Accounts: Facilitate salaries and cash operations. User-Friendly: Simplifies the process for mainstream adoption. Is World Chat a Game-Changer for Privacy? World Chat is not just another messaging feature. It includes a crucial tool that verifies if the person you’re chatting with is a unique, authenticated human. This built-in verification leverages Worldcoin’s core iris-scanning technology to combat bots and spam. Consequently, it promises a more secure and trustworthy communication environment within the Worldcoin app ecosystem. What Does This Mean for User Adoption? A project representative stated the update aims to increase user interaction. By bundling finance, communication, and identity, the Worldcoin app becomes a more sticky product. Furthermore, the company plans to simplify its iris authentication process in the future. This planned simplification is key to lowering the verification barrier and onboarding millions more users globally. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities? While the features are promising, Worldcoin faces ongoing scrutiny regarding data privacy and the centralization of biometric data. However, if it can navigate these concerns while delivering tangible utility, the Worldcoin app could set a new standard for verified digital ecosystems. The integration of chat and payments creates a powerful network effect that could drive unprecedented growth. In conclusion, Worldcoin’s latest update is a strategic leap forward. By adding crypto transfers and encrypted chat, the Worldcoin app is no longer just about proving ‘you are you’—it’s about what you can do once that’s established. This shift towards a multi-functional platform could be the catalyst that propels Worldcoin from a controversial project to a widely used tool in the digital economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Can I transfer any cryptocurrency in the Worldcoin app? A: Currently, the transfer function supports the native WLD token. The feature is designed for WLD transactions, salaries, and cash operations via virtual accounts. Q: How does World Chat verify the other user? A: World Chat includes a tool that checks if the other party has been authenticated through Worldcoin’s iris-scanning Orb. This aims to confirm they are a unique human, not a bot. Q: Is the chat feature completely private? A: The report describes it as an ‘encrypted chat feature,’ which suggests a focus on security. However, users should review the app’s specific privacy policy for details on encryption standards and data handling. Q: Will the iris verification process change? A: Yes. A project representative confirmed plans to simplify the iris authentication process in the future to make verification easier and more accessible. Q: What is the main goal of this update? A: The primary goal is to increase user interaction and engagement by making the Worldcoin app a more versatile platform for both finance and communication. Q: Where can I download the updated Worldcoin app? A: The app is available through official mobile app stores. Always ensure you are downloading the genuine application from the official Worldcoin project channels. Found this breakdown of the new Worldcoin app features helpful?

Right now, a fascinating shift is happening behind the scenes. While corporate buyers slow their roll, Bitcoin miners are seizing a golden opportunity. They’re strategically accumulating BTC at prices below the market average, giving them a unique advantage in the current landscape. Let’s explore why this trend matters and what it reveals about market dynamics. Why Are Bitcoin Miners Buying Cheap BTC Now? A recent report from BitcoinTreasuries, highlighted by Cointelegraph, reveals a clear trend. Bitcoin miners are in an enviable position. They can acquire new Bitcoin through their mining operations at a cost often below the open market price. This allows them to build their reserves without competing directly with other buyers. Meanwhile, the usual heavyweights—corporate Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) companies—are taking a breather. This creates a perfect storm for accumulation. Miners are essentially getting a discount on their primary asset. Therefore, they can strengthen their balance sheets during a period of relative market calm. This strategic move highlights their long-term confidence in the Bitcoin network. What’s Causing the Corporate Slowdown? On the other side of the equation, corporate buying has noticeably cooled. DAT companies are projected to purchase only 40,000 BTC in the fourth quarter. This represents the lowest volume since Q3 of last year. So, what’s behind this hesitation? Portfolio Digestion: Many firms are still processing their recent, large-scale acquisitions. Risk Assessment: The recent price volatility, with BTC dipping below $90,000, has prompted a more cautious approach. Unrealized Losses: The report states about two-thirds of the 100 companies holding BTC are currently sitting on unrealized losses, which may discourage further immediate investment. This corporate pause is not necessarily a sign of lost faith. Instead, it indicates a period of consolidation and strategic review. How Does This Impact the Broader Bitcoin Market? This divergence between miner and corporate activity has several implications. First, it shows a healthy, multi-faceted market. Not all participants move in lockstep. Miners, with their direct connection to the network’s security, often have a different investment horizon than public corporations. Second, sustained buying from miners can act as a stabilizing force. They provide consistent, below-market demand that isn’t solely driven by short-term price speculation. Moreover, their actions signal a strong belief in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition, regardless of quarterly price fluctuations. What Can We Learn From This Trend? This situation offers valuable insights for any crypto observer. It demonstrates that smart money looks for opportunities during periods of uncertainty. While headlines might focus on price drops or corporate pauses, savvy players like Bitcoin miners are actively building their positions. For the average investor, it’s a reminder of the importance of a long-term perspective and cost-averaging strategies. The entities closest to Bitcoin’s core infrastructure are choosing to accumulate, not retreat. Conclusion: A Strategic Shift in Bitcoin Accumulation In summary, the current market phase highlights a strategic divergence. Bitcoin miners are capitalizing on their operational advantage to buy cheap BTC, fortifying their holdings for the future. Concurrently, corporate treasuries are in a temporary holding pattern, reassessing their strategies. This dynamic underscores the resilience and complexity of the Bitcoin ecosystem. It proves that even when one group of buyers steps back, others see a compelling opportunity to step forward and strengthen the network from within. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Why can Bitcoin miners buy BTC cheaper than the market price? A: Miners earn new Bitcoin as a block reward for securing the network. Their cost is primarily their operational expense (electricity, hardware). If this cost is lower than the market price, they effectively acquire BTC at a discount. Q: Is the corporate slowdown in buying BTC a bad sign? A: Not necessarily. It often indicates digestion of past purchases and prudent risk management. It’s a pause, not necessarily a permanent exit. Q: What does ‘unrealized loss’ mean for corporate BTC holders? A: It means the current market price of the Bitcoin they hold is below the price they paid for it. The loss is “unrealized” because they haven’t sold the asset. Q: Could miner accumulation drive the Bitcoin price up? A> While miners add consistent demand, price is influenced by many factors. However, reduced selling pressure from miners (if they hold) and steady accumulation can be supportive for the market over time. Q: How long might this trend of Bitcoin miners buying cheap BTC last? A> It’s tied to market conditions and mining economics. If the price falls further relative to mining costs, their advantage grows. The trend may last as long as corporate demand remains subdued and mining remains profitable. Q: Should retail investors follow the miners’ lead? A> Investors should never follow any single group blindly. However, understanding the strategic moves of key network participants like miners can provide valuable context for making informed personal investment decisions.

Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon, the central figure behind one of crypto’s most catastrophic failures, stood before a judge and the world to deliver a long-awaited statement. Do Kwon apologizes to victims , offering remorse for the immense financial ruin stemming from the $40 billion Terra-Luna ecosystem collapse. This sentencing marks a significant chapter in holding crypto leaders accountable. What Did Do Kwon Say in Court During His Sentencing? Wearing a yellow prison jumpsuit, Do Kwon addressed the court directly. He stated that the stories from hundreds of victims were heartbreaking. These victims had sent letters detailing their devastating losses following his extradition to the United States in 2024. His words served as a stark reminder of the profound damage caused by the project’s failure. Following the hearing, his defense team emphasized his genuine remorse and his commitment to working toward compensating those who lost funds. Why Was Do Kwon Sentenced to 15 Years in Prison? The court handed down a 15-year prison sentence after convicting Kwon on nine criminal charges. These charges were directly related to the fraud that led to the implosion of the Terra (LUNA) and TerraUSD (UST) tokens in May 2022. The collapse erased nearly $40 billion in market value almost overnight. Key factors in the sentencing included: The massive scale of investor losses. The hundreds of victim impact statements submitted to the court. The determination that Kwon’s actions constituted serious financial fraud. This case sets a crucial precedent for regulatory action within the cryptocurrency industry. What Was the Plea Deal for Do Kwon? Prior to the sentencing, Do Kwon reached an agreement with U.S. prosecutors. He pleaded guilty to select charges in exchange for a potential reduction in his prison location. The arrangement could allow him to serve half of his 15-year sentence in another country, such as his home nation of South Korea. However, this transfer is not guaranteed and depends on international agreements. Therefore, while he expressed remorse, the legal process ensures significant consequences for his role in the collapse. What Does This Mean for Crypto Regulation and Victims? The sentencing of Do Kwon sends a powerful message. It demonstrates that authorities will pursue legal action against individuals responsible for large-scale crypto fraud. For the victims, the statement that Do Kwon apologizes to victims is a small step. The real test will be the follow-through on compensation efforts promised by his defense team. This case highlights several critical points for the industry: Accountability: Founders can be held personally liable. Investor Caution: The importance of due diligence in decentralized finance. Regulatory Focus: Increased scrutiny on algorithmic stablecoins and tokenomics. The aftermath continues to shape how new projects are built and marketed. Conclusion: A Landmark Moment of Accountability The image of Do Kwon in court, stating that he wanted to apologize to all his victims, closes a painful chapter for many investors. His 15-year sentence represents one of the most substantial penalties ever given to a cryptocurrency executive. It underscores a new era of enforcement and the human cost behind market crashes. While the apology is noted, the industry and victims now watch to see if actions will match words in the long journey toward restitution. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What was Do Kwon found guilty of? Do Kwon was found guilty on nine charges, including fraud, related to the $40 billion collapse of the Terra-Luna ecosystem in 2022. Will Do Kwon serve his entire sentence in the US? Not necessarily. He has a deal to potentially serve half of his 15-year sentence in another country, like South Korea, subject to international approval. Did Do Kwon admit fault? Yes. In court, he apologized to victims, calling their stories heartbreaking, and his defense stated he is genuinely remorseful. What happens to Terraform Labs now? The company is defunct following the collapse. The legal focus has been on holding its leadership, namely Do Kwon, accountable. Are victims getting their money back? Kwon’s defense team says he will work toward compensating victims, but specific plans or a timeline have not been publicly detailed. Why is this case important for crypto? It sets a major precedent for prosecuting crypto fraud, showing founders can face severe prison time for misconduct that causes massive investor losses. This landmark case affects everyone in the crypto space.

This is precisely the concern raised by cryptocurrency asset manager Bitwise regarding MSCI’s potential move to exclude companies holding significant cryptocurrency reserves. The debate over the MSCI exclusion of crypto-holding firms has sparked a crucial conversation about market objectivity and institutional bias in the digital age. What’s Behind the MSCI Exclusion Controversy? Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI), one of the world’s leading index providers, has suggested it might remove companies like MicroStrategy from its indexes due to their substantial cryptocurrency holdings. Bitwise has responded forcefully, calling this potential action discriminatory. The firm argues that indexes should reflect the market as it exists, not as some might prefer it to be. This situation raises fundamental questions about how traditional financial institutions view the growing cryptocurrency sector. When an index provider considers excluding successful companies based on their asset choices, it creates a precedent that could limit investor access to innovative business models. Why Does This MSCI Exclusion Matter for Investors? The potential MSCI exclusion of crypto-holding firms isn’t just about a few companies—it’s about market access and representation. Index funds and ETFs tracking MSCI indexes manage trillions of dollars in assets. Exclusion from these indexes can significantly impact: Investment flows : Billions in passive investment dollars could bypass crypto-exposed companies Market legitimacy Investor choice : Limits options for investors seeking crypto exposure through traditional vehicles Price discovery : Reduces market efficiency by excluding relevant market participants Bitwise emphasizes that indexes should serve as neutral market mirrors, not as gatekeepers determining which business models deserve recognition. The Bigger Picture: Institutional Acceptance of Crypto This controversy arrives at a critical moment for cryptocurrency institutional adoption. As more traditional companies add digital assets to their balance sheets, the financial establishment faces a choice: adapt to include these developments or create artificial barriers. The MSCI exclusion of crypto-holding firms represents what many in the crypto space see as institutional resistance to innovation. MicroStrategy, for instance, has successfully leveraged Bitcoin holdings as part of its corporate treasury strategy. Excluding such companies from major indexes suggests that traditional finance hasn’t fully accepted cryptocurrency’s role in modern corporate finance. What Could This Mean for Future Crypto Adoption? If MSCI proceeds with excluding companies based on cryptocurrency holdings, several consequences could follow: Reduced institutional participation : Companies might hesitate to adopt crypto strategies Market fragmentation : Separate crypto-focused indexes could emerge, creating parallel markets Regulatory attention Innovation slowdown : Could discourage corporate innovation in digital asset management Bitwise’s strong stance highlights the growing confidence within the cryptocurrency industry. The firm believes that companies embracing digital assets represent forward-thinking business models that deserve equal market access. Conclusion: A Test of Market Objectivity The debate over the MSCI exclusion of crypto-holding firms ultimately tests whether traditional financial institutions can maintain objectivity as markets evolve. Bitwise’s criticism raises valid concerns about discrimination against an entire asset class and the companies that recognize its potential. As cryptocurrency continues its march toward mainstream acceptance, index providers like MSCI face a choice: reflect the market as it exists or risk becoming irrelevant in an increasingly digital financial landscape. The outcome of this controversy will signal how quickly traditional finance can adapt to technological innovation. Frequently Asked Questions What is MSCI proposing to do with crypto-holding companies? MSCI has suggested it might exclude companies holding significant cryptocurrency reserves from its indexes, potentially removing firms like MicroStrategy that have substantial Bitcoin holdings. Why does Bitwise consider this action discriminatory? Bitwise argues that excluding companies based on their cryptocurrency holdings represents discrimination against both the asset class and innovative business models, contradicting the purpose of indexes as neutral market reflections. How would MSCI exclusion affect crypto-holding companies? Exclusion could reduce investment flows from index-tracking funds, lower market visibility, and potentially decrease liquidity for affected companies while sending negative signals about cryptocurrency legitimacy. What companies would be affected by this MSCI policy? Primarily companies like MicroStrategy with substantial cryptocurrency treasury reserves, but potentially any company holding digital assets as part of their corporate strategy. Has MSCI made a final decision on this exclusion? As of now, MSCI has only suggested this possibility. No final decision has been announced, making this a developing situation that market participants are watching closely. What alternatives exist if MSCI excludes crypto-holding firms? Specialized crypto indexes, alternative index providers, or direct cryptocurrency investment vehicles could emerge to fill the gap, though they might not match MSCI’s market influence.

55668677,643944,1765508406,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55668677.jpeg,UAE Telecom Powerhouse Embraces Dirham Stablecoin In New Payment Trial,https://bitcoinist.com/uae-telecom-powerhouse-embraces-dirham-stablecoin-in-new-payment-trial/,"e& UAE, United Arab Emirates’ telecom giant, has signed a memorandum of understanding with Al Maryah Community Bank to trial AE Coin, a Central Bank-licensed stablecoin, as a payment option across the telco’s services. According to company statements, the plan would let customers use an AED-backed token to pay for mobile and home-service bills, prepaid and postpaid recharges, and purchases on e& digital platforms. Integration Across Consumer Touchpoints Reports have disclosed that e& Group aims to plug AE Coin into its existing payment systems. The move would add the stablecoin as an alternative to cards and bank transfers on e&’s mobile apps and at smart self-service kiosks. e& UAE’s CEO, Hatem Dowidar, said the partnership with Al Maryah Community Bank will allow “instant settlement, complete transparency, and frictionless access” — language that signals the operator expects quicker finality and clearer audit trails for transactions. For many users, that could mean fewer delays and simpler proof of payment when calling or browsing for services. What The Partners Say Based on reports, Al Maryah Community Bank’s chief executive, Mohammed Wassim Khayata, said the collaboration widens real-world uses for licensed virtual assets and opens the door to faster, more secure options for everyday payments. Ramez Rafeek, General Manager of AED Stablecoin LLC, described AE Coin as created to support regulated and transparent digital payments. Those comments frame the trial as an attempt to move a regulated token from niche experiments into mass consumer use. The pilot will start within selected e& channels; no national rollout timetable has been disclosed. Potential Impact On Users And The Market Analysts and payments experts say a telecom of e&’s size could quickly expose millions of customers to stablecoin payments if the test succeeds. According to the companies involved, integrating AE Coin would cover prepaid top-ups and postpaid billing, which are high-frequency transactions that could provide an immediate test bed for volume and reliability. Observers note that real adoption will hinge on how easy customers find the process, how wallets are managed, and whether merchants accept the token beyond e&’s own services. Alignment With National Goals Reports indicate the trial fits into the UAE’s push for regulated blockchain payments and a less cash-dependent economy. Regulators have been encouraging licensed solutions, and using a Central Bank-approved stablecoin inside a major consumer network sends a clear signal that authorities are open to controlled innovation. If adopted more widely, the token could serve as another regulated payment choice alongside existing systems.

While the market’s reaction has leaned bearish in the short term, on-chain data tells a very different story beneath the surface. Related Reading: The Whale Who Can’t Stop Buying: BitcoinOG Scales Ethereum Long To $280M After Price Surge According to new insights from CryptoQuant, one of the most striking signals comes from the Exchange Inflow Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric on Binance, which has fallen sharply to 380, its lowest reading since September 2017. CDD is one of the most important indicators for understanding long-term holder behavior because it assigns greater weight to older coins that have accumulated more “coin days.” Low values mean that the BTC moving onto exchanges is predominantly from short-term traders, not long-term holders. In other words, veteran holders — the investors who historically move markets — are refusing to sell, even as Bitcoin trades near cycle highs. Long-Term Holders Signal Strong Conviction CryptoOnchain highlights that the significance of this CDD collapse becomes far clearer when viewed against Bitcoin’s current price context. With BTC trading near $89,600, the market is witnessing an unusually large divergence between price action and long-term holder behavior. Historically, when Bitcoin approaches or surpasses all-time highs, long-held coins tend to move — triggering spikes in CDD as early investors and whales take profits. This pattern has repeated across past cycles, making elevated CDD a classic top-signal. But this time, the exact opposite is happening. Instead of old coins entering exchanges, Exchange Inflow CDD is collapsing, indicating that almost none of the BTC being deposited onto Binance comes from long-term wallets. CryptoOnchain explains that this phenomenon strongly suggests that Smart Money and long-term whales have zero interest in selling at these levels, even after a multi-month correction. This refusal to distribute supply removes a major source of overhead resistance and reflects a market dynamic driven increasingly by strong hands. The absence of long-term sell pressure reduces the available liquid supply, often preceding powerful bullish expansions. In simple terms, whales are signaling confidence — not caution — despite short-term volatility, reinforcing the narrative that Bitcoin may be preparing for its next major move. Related Reading: Why Ethereum’s Rally Isn’t Overheated – And Where Demand Must Grow Next Bitcoin Price Action: Testing Support Amid Weak Momentum Bitcoin’s 3-day chart shows the market stabilizing just above the $90,000 level after last week’s sharp post-FED decline. Price remains compressed between the 200-day moving average (red line)—currently acting as primary support—and the 100-day moving average (green line) overhead, which continues to cap upward momentum. This creates a classic squeeze structure where BTC is holding its ground but struggling to reclaim lost trend levels. The recent candle structure highlights a series of higher lows forming near the $89K–$90K region, suggesting buyers are defending this zone as a short-term floor. However, the rejection from the 100-day MA reinforces the broader bearish shift, as BTC remains below both key trend indicators and is yet to reclaim the breakdown level around $100K. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees Largest Binance Inflow Since 2023 – Warning Sign? Volume also tells an important story: despite the bounce, buy-side conviction appears weak. The rebound has not been accompanied by a spike in demand, indicating that market participants are cautious following the rate cut and macro uncertainty. If Bitcoin loses the 200-day MA, the next major support lies closer to $84K, which would open the door to a deeper retracement. Conversely, a decisive close above the 100-day MA near $98K would signal momentum returning to the bulls. For now, BTC remains in a fragile consolidation with limited directional strength.

This strategic move signals a significant step toward mainstream cryptocurrency adoption, offering creators a faster, more global way to access their earnings. The PYUSD stablecoin provides a bridge between traditional finance and the innovative world of digital assets. What Does YouTube’s PYUSD Stablecoin Integration Mean for Creators? According to an exclusive report by Fortune, YouTube now permits creators to opt for receiving their revenue share in PayPal’s dollar-pegged cryptocurrency. A Google spokesperson confirmed this addition, highlighting the platform’s ongoing partnership with PayPal. This integration leverages PayPal’s existing infrastructure, allowing YouTube to offer a crypto payment option without directly managing the digital assets, thereby simplifying the process for the tech giant. This partnership is not entirely new. YouTube has reportedly been a long-time client of PayPal, utilizing its services for operational expenses like employee salaries. However, extending this relationship to include PYUSD stablecoin payments for creators marks a pivotal expansion into the crypto economy. It demonstrates a growing institutional confidence in stablecoins as a viable medium for financial transactions. Why is the PYUSD Stablecoin a Game-Changer? The introduction of the PYUSD stablecoin as a payment method addresses several pain points for the global creator community. Firstly, it potentially reduces transaction times and costs associated with international bank transfers. Secondly, it offers an alternative in regions with volatile local currencies or restrictive banking systems. Speed and Efficiency: Crypto transactions can settle much faster than traditional cross-border bank transfers. Financial Inclusion: Creators in underserved banking regions gain a new avenue to access global revenue. Reduced Friction: PayPal’s handling of the crypto assets means creators get a seamless experience without needing deep technical knowledge. Moreover, this move by a platform as influential as YouTube lends immense credibility to the entire stablecoin sector. It acts as a powerful validation, encouraging other major platforms to explore similar integrations. What Are the Potential Challenges and Considerations? While the benefits are clear, creators must also navigate certain considerations. The volatility commonly associated with cryptocurrencies is mitigated by the stable nature of PYUSD , which is pegged 1:1 to the US Dollar. However, creators should be aware of regulatory landscapes in their respective countries regarding cryptocurrency earnings and taxation. Furthermore, the practical utility of receiving PYUSD stablecoin depends on one’s ability to easily convert it to local currency or use it for purchases. PayPal’s ecosystem supports holding, sending, spending, and converting PYUSD, which simplifies this process. Nonetheless, adoption is still in its early stages, and liquidity outside major platforms may vary. How Does This Shape the Future of Digital Payments? YouTube’s adoption of the PYUSD stablecoin is more than a new feature; it’s a bellwether for the future of digital work and finance. It represents a quiet but powerful shift where major tech corporations are not just accepting crypto but actively weaving it into their payment architectures. This could accelerate a domino effect across the social media and content creation landscape. For creators, this evolution means greater autonomy and flexibility over their finances. It empowers them with choices that align with a more digital-native, borderless way of living and working. The move underscores a broader trend where the lines between fintech, social platforms, and cryptocurrency continue to blur, creating a more interconnected digital economy. Conclusion: A Bold Step Toward a Crypto-Integrated Economy YouTube’s decision to offer PayPal’s PYUSD stablecoin is a landmark moment. It provides tangible, immediate benefits for creators seeking efficiency and global access while simultaneously pushing the entire industry toward broader cryptocurrency acceptance. This collaboration between a content titan and a payments pioneer sets a compelling precedent, proving that digital assets have a concrete and growing role in mainstream business operations. The future of creator payments is becoming more innovative, inclusive, and instantaneous. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the PYUSD stablecoin? A1: PYUSD is a stablecoin issued by PayPal. It is a digital currency pegged 1:1 to the US Dollar, designed to combine the stability of fiat currency with the digital efficiency of cryptocurrency. Q2: How can YouTube creators start receiving payments in PYUSD? A2: Eligible creators should check their YouTube Studio payment settings. If the option is available in their region, they can select PayPal’s PYUSD as their preferred payout method through the integrated PayPal infrastructure. Q3: Are there any fees associated with receiving PYUSD payments? A3> Specific fee structures are determined by PayPal’s policies for crypto transactions. Creators should review PayPal’s terms for receiving, holding, and converting PYUSD to understand any applicable fees. Q4: Is receiving payments in PYUSD available to all YouTube creators globally? A4> Availability may be subject to regional regulations and PayPal’s service coverage. YouTube and PayPal are likely rolling out this feature in phases, so creators should check for updates in their local payment settings. Q5: How is the value of PYUSD stablecoin maintained? A5> The PYUSD stablecoin is fully backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and similar cash equivalents. This reserve system ensures its value remains stable and pegged to the US dollar. Q6: Can I spend my PYUSD earnings directly? A6> Yes, you can use PYUSD to pay for goods and services at millions of online merchants that accept PayPal. You can also hold it in your PayPal account, send it to others, or convert it to other currencies within the PayPal ecosystem.

That’s the incredible reality for one anonymous solo miner who just earned a staggering 3.1 BTC, worth roughly $280,000, for mining an entire Bitcoin block alone. This rare event at block height 927,474 is a powerful reminder of Bitcoin’s decentralized dream. Let’s explore how this happened and why it’s causing such a stir. What Does a Solo Miner Actually Do? Unlike large mining pools where thousands combine computing power, a solo miner operates independently. They use their own hardware to try and solve the complex cryptographic puzzle required to add a new block to the Bitcoin blockchain. The odds are astronomically low, comparable to winning the lottery. Therefore, when a solo miner succeeds, it’s a monumental event that celebrates the core, permissionless principle of Bitcoin. How Did This Solo Miner Beat the Odds? According to data from Mempool.space, the block was mined on December 11th. The miner received the full 3.125 BTC block subsidy plus a small fee reward, totaling 3.1 BTC. This success highlights several key points: Proof of Decentralization: It proves individuals can still compete, even against industrial-scale operations. Sheer Luck: The solo miner likely had a very powerful setup, but luck was the dominant factor. Network Health: Such events are healthy for Bitcoin, demonstrating that mining isn’t entirely centralized. Is Solo Mining Bitcoin Realistic for You? While this story is inspiring, it’s crucial to be realistic. The challenges for a modern solo miner are immense. Extreme Competition: You’re competing against global mining pools with exahash-level power. High Costs: The electricity and hardware investment is significant with no guaranteed return. Statistical Long Shot: You could mine for years without ever finding a block. For most people, joining a mining pool provides smaller, more frequent payouts and is the practical choice. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Future? This event is more than a lucky break. It’s a symbolic victory. It reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin remains accessible to dedicated individuals. Furthermore, it may inspire more hobbyists to participate, however they choose, strengthening the network’s resilience and distributed nature. The story of this solo miner is a beacon of possibility in a landscape often dominated by large corporate players. Conclusion: A Testament to Bitcoin’s Core Promise The anonymous solo miner’s $280,000 windfall is a modern-day gold rush story. It encapsulates the hope, risk, and revolutionary potential of cryptocurrency. While not a practical strategy for most, it stands as a powerful testament to the decentralized ethos that made Bitcoin revolutionary. It reminds us that in the world of crypto, with enough perseverance and a bit of magic, anyone can theoretically strike digital gold. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: How much did the solo miner actually earn? A: The miner earned 3.1 BTC, which was valued at approximately $280,000 at the time of the block’s discovery. Q: What are the odds of a solo miner finding a block? A: The odds are extremely low, often compared to winning a major lottery. It requires immense computational power and a significant amount of luck. Q: Should I try solo mining Bitcoin? A: For the vast majority of people, solo mining is not financially viable due to high hardware and electricity costs with no guaranteed return. Joining a reputable mining pool is the recommended approach for consistent, smaller rewards. Q: Why is this solo miner event important? A: It’s important because it demonstrates that Bitcoin’s network is still decentralized enough for an individual to participate successfully, upholding its core foundational principle. Q: What hardware is needed for solo mining? A> It requires specialized, high-powered hardware called ASIC miners, which are expensive and consume large amounts of electricity. A basic home computer is not sufficient. Q: Was the solo miner’s identity revealed? A> No, the miner remains anonymous, as is common with Bitcoin mining. The achievement is visible on the public blockchain, but the individual’s identity is not linked to it. Did this story of incredible luck and perseverance inspire you?

The South Korean national pleaded guilty in August to conspiracy and wire fraud charges at Terraform Labs. US District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer handed down the sentence on Thursday at a hearing in Manhattan. Judge Dismisses 12-Year Jail Plea for Kwon, Calls it ‘Unreasonable’ Federal prosecutors already urged the court to impose the full 12 years permitted under Kwon’s plea agreement. Meanwhile, Kwon’s lawyers requested a 5-year sentence, so he can return to South Korea to face criminal charges. US prosecutors demand 12-year sentence for Do Kwon after Terra's $40B collapse that destabilized crypto markets and aided FTX implosion. #FTX #DoKwon #TerraForm https://t.co/LfzwEWH4XG — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 6, 2025 Per Inner City Press , which live-tweeted the proceedings of the lengthy hearing, Judge Engelmayer called the 12-year prison recommendation by US prosecutors “unreasonable.” He further said that a 5-year sentence “would be so implausible.” “15 years is the least I can impose,” the Judge said finally. “It is the judgment of the court that you are to serve a sentence of 15 years, with credit for time serviced in the US.” The Staggering $40B Crypto Debacle: Here’s What Happened Judge Engelmayer called the collapse an “epic” fraud. “This was a fraud on an epic, generational scale,” he said, per a BBC report . “In the history of federal prosecutions, there are few frauds that have caused as much harm as you have.” From 2018 to 2022, Kwon orchestrated schemes to defraud purchasers of cryptos created and issued by Terraform. The firm publicly announced the launch of its 1:1 USD-pegged stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST), and Luna coins. TerraUSD slipped below its $1 peg in May 2021, and Kwon made false statements about the stablecoin’s peg restoration mechanisms. He also concealed Jump Trading’s role in supporting the stablecoin during a 2021 depeg event. TerraUSD, which was designed to maintain a $1 peg, unraveled in May 2022, wiping out tens of billions in value, sparking a crypto sector-wide cascade of failures. “I made false and misleading statements about why it regained its peg by failing to disclose a trading firm’s role in restoring that peg,” Kwon admitted in August. “What I did was wrong.” The collapse led to criminal charges in the U.S. and South Korea, with both nations seeking Kwon’s extradition. In March 2023, Kwon was arrested in Montenegro for travelling with forged documents and was later extradited to the United States in December.

Bloomberg reported Friday that the the US-based exchange will announce the new offerings at an event on Dec. 17, a source told the outlet, adding that Coinbase intends to issue tokenized stocks in-house rather than through external partners. Executives at Coinbase have previously signalled interest in both businesses, but until now the company had not formally laid out a launch timeline. Traders Anticipate New Tools After Images Reveal Coinbase’s Expanding Roadmap In recent weeks, screenshots that appear to show prediction market and tokenized equity features inside Coinbase apps have circulated on X, fuelling speculation among traders.

The push fits with Coinbase’s ambition to become an “everything app” for digital assets, where customers can trade crypto, tokenized versions of traditional securities and, increasingly, event-based markets. It also helps the company keep pace with rivals that are adding similar tools as competition intensifies. Trading In Digital Stock Representations Surges As Adoption Spreads Robinhood Markets this year began offering prediction products from Kalshi Inc, giving its users a way to bet on economic and political outcomes. Robinhood and crypto exchange Kraken already list tokenized US stocks and exchange-traded funds in some jurisdictions, although these products remain unavailable in the US itself. Trading in tokenized equities, which are digital representations of stocks recorded on a blockchain, has been gaining traction. Monthly transfer volumes have risen about 32% in the past 30 days to roughly $1.45B, according to data provider rwa.xyz, as more platforms experiment with bringing traditional assets on chain. Demand For Event Contracts Climbs As Exchanges Embrace Prediction Tools Prediction markets, which allow users to wager on the outcomes of events such as elections, sports and macro data releases, have also grown quickly over the past year. They have attracted interest from both traditional exchanges and crypto native firms that see them as a new way to monetize information and order flow. Gemini, the exchange founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, recently secured a key approval from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission to launch its prediction platform, Gemini Titan, for American customers. The licence will allow it to offer event contracts structured as simple yes or no questions. Crypto.com has struck deals with partners including Trump Media & Technology Group to help them build prediction markets, while Robinhood and trading firm Susquehanna have agreed to buy 90% of regulated venue LedgerX , a move that deepens their exposure to event driven crypto derivatives.

ETH is now consolidating and might soon aim for a clear upside break above $3,350. Ethereum started a downside correction from the $3,450 zone. The price is trading above $3,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a new connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $3,180 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it settles below the $3,150 zone. Ethereum Price Holds Support Ethereum price managed to stay above $3,150 and started a fresh increase, beating Bitcoin . ETH price gained strength for a move above the $3,300 and $3,320 resistance levels. The bulls even pushed the price above $3,400. However, the bears were active below $3,450. A high was formed at $3,448 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below $3,250, and the price even spiked below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,914 swing low to the $3,448 low.

A clear move above the $3,350 resistance might send the price toward the $3,400 resistance. An upside break above the $3,400 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,450 resistance zone or even $3,500 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,320 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,200 level. The first major support sits near the $3,150 zone. A clear move below the $3,150 support might push the price toward the $3,040 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,020 region. The next key support sits at $3,000.

Over a single 24-hour period, a staggering $222 million vanished from the crypto futures market in a wave of forced liquidations. This dramatic event underscores the extreme volatility and high-stakes nature of leveraged trading, serving as a stark reminder for every market participant. What Are Crypto Futures Liquidations and Why Do They Matter? Before we dive into the numbers, let’s clarify what just happened. In futures trading, investors use leverage—borrowed funds—to amplify their positions. However, if the market moves against them and their collateral falls below a required level, exchanges automatically close their positions to prevent further loss. This process is called liquidation. When it happens on a large scale, it can accelerate price movements and create a cascade of selling or buying pressure, impacting the entire market. A Breakdown of the $222 Million Crypto Futures Bloodbath The recent crypto futures liquidations event was not evenly distributed. Let’s look at which assets were hit the hardest and what the data tells us about trader sentiment. Bitcoin (BTC): The king of cryptocurrency led the liquidation tally with a massive $120 million. Crucially, 71.09% of these were short positions. This suggests many traders were betting on a price drop, but the market moved against them, triggering their liquidations. Ethereum (ETH): Following closely, Ethereum saw $88.95 million in liquidations. Interestingly, the majority here (64.81%) were long positions. This indicates traders expecting a price rise were caught off guard by downward movement. Solana (SOL): The altcoin recorded $13.10 million in liquidations, with 61.44% being short positions, mirroring Bitcoin’s pattern on a smaller scale. This split reveals a divided market. While leverage was heavily used on both sides of the trade, the dominant narrative was bears getting squeezed on Bitcoin and bulls getting liquidated on Ethereum. How Can Traders Navigate Future Volatility? Witnessing such significant crypto futures liquidations can be intimidating. However, it also provides valuable lessons for managing risk. First, always use stop-loss orders to define your maximum loss upfront. Second, be extremely cautious with high leverage; while it can magnify gains, it can also wipe out your capital instantly during swift market moves. Finally, never invest more than you can afford to lose, especially in the volatile crypto futures market. The Ripple Effect of Major Liquidations Large-scale liquidations don’t occur in a vacuum. They often create a feedback loop. For example, as long positions in Ethereum were forcibly closed (sold), it added selling pressure, potentially pushing the price down further and triggering more liquidations. Understanding this mechanism is key to reading market sentiment and anticipating potential short-term price swings following such events. In conclusion, the $222 million liquidation event is a powerful testament to the raw, unforgiving nature of cryptocurrency markets. It highlights the critical importance of risk management over speculative greed. For savvy traders, these periods of volatility are not just moments of danger but also opportunities to learn, adapt, and potentially identify the market’s next direction once the dust settles. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What causes a liquidation in crypto futures trading? A liquidation occurs when a trader’s position suffers losses that deplete their initial margin (collateral) below the maintenance margin requirement set by the exchange. To prevent the trader from owing more money, the exchange automatically closes the position. Why did most Bitcoin liquidations involve short positions? If the price of Bitcoin rose unexpectedly during this period, it would have moved against traders who had opened short positions (betting on a price drop). This price increase would have triggered their stop-losses or hit their liquidation prices, forcing the positions to close. Are large liquidations always bad for the market? Not necessarily. While painful for those liquidated, these events can help reset excessive leverage in the market. A “long squeeze” (where long positions are liquidated) can sometimes create a local price bottom, while a “short squeeze” can fuel a rapid price rally. How can I check current liquidation levels? Several data analytics websites like Coinglass or Bybit provide real-time liquidation heatmaps and charts, showing estimated liquidation prices across major cryptocurrencies to help traders gauge potential market stress points. What’s the difference between a partial and a full liquidation? A partial liquidation closes only enough of a position to bring the margin back above the required level. A full liquidation closes the entire position because the losses have completely wiped out the available margin. Do liquidations affect the spot market price of crypto? Yes, they can. Since liquidations involve the forced buying or selling of an asset, this activity on the futures market can create significant pressure that spills over and influences the price on regular spot exchanges.

The South Korean crypto exchange giant has announced a planned, temporary suspension of SCR deposits and withdrawals. This proactive move is due to an essential network upgrade for the Scroll blockchain. If you use Bithumb for your SCR transactions, here’s your complete, point-by-point guide to understand the timeline, reasons, and necessary steps. What Is the Bithumb SCR Suspension All About? Bithumb has officially notified its users that all deposit and withdrawal services for the Scroll (SCR) token will be temporarily paused. This Bithumb SCR suspension is scheduled to begin at 3:00 a.m. UTC on December 16. The primary reason cited is a mandatory network upgrade on the Scroll sidechain. Exchanges often implement these halts to ensure user funds remain secure during backend technical work, preventing any potential transaction errors or losses. Why Do Exchanges Like Bithumb Halt Transactions? You might wonder why a major platform would temporarily disable a core function. The answer is security and stability. During a blockchain network upgrade, the protocol’s rules change. If an exchange like Bithumb continued processing transactions, it could lead to: Failed Transactions: Deposits or withdrawals sent during the upgrade might get lost or stuck. Chain Splits: Incompatible software versions can cause confusion over the valid blockchain. Security Vulnerabilities: Temporary gaps could be exploited by bad actors. Therefore, this Bithumb SCR suspension is a standard, protective measure. It shows the exchange is following best practices for asset custody. Timeline and User Action Plan for the SCR Halt Mark your calendars. The suspension starts at 3:00 a.m. UTC, December 16 . Bithumb has not announced a specific end time, as it depends on the successful completion and stabilization of Scroll’s upgrade. Typically, such halts last a few hours but can extend if complications arise. Here’s your actionable checklist: Complete Pending Transactions: Initiate any SCR deposits or withdrawals well before the deadline. No Trading Halt: The suspension only affects moving SCR on and off the exchange. Trading SCR against other pairs on Bithumb’s spot market will likely continue as normal. Monitor Official Channels: Follow Bithumb’s official announcements for the resumption notice. Do not rely on third-party rumors. What Does This Mean for the Future of Scroll (SCR)? While a temporary service pause might seem inconvenient, it often signals positive, long-term development. Network upgrades usually aim to enhance scalability, security, or functionality. For Scroll, a zkEVM layer-2 solution for Ethereum, this upgrade could mean lower fees, faster transactions, or improved developer tools. This Bithumb SCR suspension is a short-term step for a potentially stronger network, which could benefit the token’s ecosystem and value proposition. Final Summary: Stay Calm and Prepared In summary, Bithumb’s decision to temporarily suspend SCR deposits and withdrawals is a planned, safety-first action. It is directly tied to Scroll’s network upgrade and is a common industry practice. For users, the path forward is clear: finalize any transfers before December 16, understand that trading may be unaffected, and wait for the official all-clear from Bithumb. This proactive management by a top-tier exchange ultimately contributes to a more secure and reliable crypto environment for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still trade my SCR on Bithumb during the suspension? A1: Yes, in most cases. The suspension typically applies only to depositing SCR into your Bithumb wallet or withdrawing it out to an external wallet. Trading SCR for other cryptocurrencies on the Bithumb exchange platform should continue normally. Q2: How long will the Bithumb SCR suspension last? A2: Bithumb has not provided a specific end time. The duration depends on the Scroll network upgrade. It could be a few hours or longer. Users should monitor Bithumb’s official website and announcement page for the resumption notice. Q3: Are my SCR funds safe on Bithumb during this time? A3: Yes. The suspension is a security measure to protect your funds during the technical upgrade. Your SCR balance in your Bithumb account remains secure and unaffected. Q4: What happens if I try to send an SCR transaction during the suspension window? A4: Any attempt to deposit or withdraw SCR during the suspension period will likely fail or be automatically rejected by Bithumb’s system. It is crucial to complete all transfers before 3:00 a.m. UTC on December 16. Q5: Will other exchanges also suspend SCR services? A5: Possibly. Other exchanges that support Scroll (SCR) may announce similar temporary suspensions to perform their own network upgrades and ensure compatibility. Always check the announcements from your specific exchange. Found this guide on the Bithumb SCR suspension helpful? Navigating exchange updates can be tricky.

That’s the stark reality France is considering for holders of self-custodied crypto. A new legislative proposal could force individuals to report holdings exceeding €5,000, sparking a fierce debate about freedom, privacy, and the future of digital ownership. What Does France’s Proposed Crypto Law Mean for You? The French government is actively discussing Bill 1649AC. This legislation would introduce a mandatory declaration system for non-custodial cryptocurrency assets. If passed, any individual holding more than €5,000 (approximately $5,400) in a personal wallet—like a Ledger hardware wallet or a MetaMask software wallet—must report those holdings to the authorities. The proposal originates from recommendations by two key French bodies: the Court of Audit (Cour des Comptes) and the Public Finance Committee (CPO). Their goal is to increase transparency and oversight in a rapidly growing asset class that currently operates with significant anonymity. Why Is This Bill Sparking Such Intense Criticism? Despite its regulatory intentions, the bill faces a backlash. Critics argue it represents a severe overreach. The core concern is that mandatory reporting for self-custodied crypto fundamentally infringes on personal financial privacy and autonomy. Consider these key points of contention: Privacy Erosion: The law would break the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions for declared amounts. Enforcement Challenges: Tracking assets in truly private, self-custodied wallets is notoriously difficult, raising questions about practical implementation. Chilling Effect: It may discourage legitimate adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) and personal asset management. Global Precedent: Other nations could follow suit, creating a patchwork of invasive reporting requirements worldwide. How Would the Self-Custodied Crypto Reporting Work in Practice? The mechanics of the proposed system remain unclear, which adds to the anxiety. Would it be a one-time declaration or an ongoing obligation? How would the value be calculated in such a volatile market? These unanswered questions create uncertainty for every French crypto user. Furthermore, the bill specifically targets self-custodied crypto —assets you control directly via private keys. This contrasts with funds held on centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, which already operate under know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. The law creates a distinction between ‘hosted’ and ‘non-hosted’ assets, placing the reporting burden squarely on the individual for the latter. What Are the Potential Consequences of Non-Compliance? While the amendment has not yet been voted into law, its potential impact is significant. Failure to report qualifying self-custodied crypto holdings could likely result in penalties. This moves cryptocurrency further into the realm of traditional financial assets, subject to state surveillance and tax enforcement. However, this push for control clashes with the foundational ethos of cryptocurrency: decentralization and individual sovereignty. The debate in France is a microcosm of a global struggle between regulatory oversight and digital freedom. Navigating the Future of Crypto Regulation The outcome of Bill 1649AC will be closely watched internationally. It represents a bold attempt to bring self-custodied crypto into the regulatory fold. For users, the message is clear: the era of complete anonymity for substantial holdings may be ending in some jurisdictions. Staying informed is crucial. Regulatory landscapes are shifting rapidly. Whether this French proposal becomes law or not, it signals a growing trend of governments seeking visibility into all corners of the digital economy, including your personal wallet. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is self-custodied crypto? A1: Self-custodied crypto refers to digital assets you hold and control directly through a private key, without relying on a third-party exchange or custodian. Examples include funds in hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor) or software wallets (MetaMask). Q2: Has the French law for reporting crypto been passed? A2> No, it has not. As of now, Bill 1649AC is a proposed amendment under discussion. It must go through the parliamentary process before becoming law. Q3: Does this affect crypto held on exchanges like Binance? A3> The proposed law specifically targets self-custodied wallets. Crypto held on centralized, KYC-compliant exchanges is already subject to reporting by the exchange itself and may not require an additional individual declaration under this bill. Q4: What happens if I own less than €5,000 in self-custodied crypto? A4> Based on the current proposal, holdings valued below the €5,000 threshold would not require mandatory reporting. However, the total valuation method (e.g., peak value, year-end value) is not yet specified. Q5: Why are privacy advocates concerned about this law? A5> Critics argue it violates financial privacy principles and sets a dangerous precedent for government surveillance of personal assets. They believe it undermines a key benefit of blockchain technology: user sovereignty. Q6: Could other countries adopt similar rules? A6> Yes, absolutely. France’s approach could inspire similar legislation in other European Union nations and beyond, as governments worldwide grapple with regulating decentralized assets.

Valued at approximately $223 million, this single transaction highlights the immense scale at which major players, or ‘whales,’ operate within the digital asset space. But what does such a massive USDT transfer actually signal for the broader market? Let’s dive into the implications of this noteworthy event. What Does a $223 Million USDT Transfer Signify? When a transaction of this magnitude occurs, it naturally sparks speculation. A USDT transfer of over $200 million to a centralized exchange like OKX typically suggests one of a few potential scenarios. The sender, often called a ‘whale,’ could be preparing to convert their stablecoin holdings into other cryptocurrencies. Alternatively, they might be moving funds for safekeeping or to provide liquidity for large-scale trading operations. This movement underscores the critical role major exchanges play as liquidity hubs in the crypto ecosystem. Why Should Crypto Investors Pay Attention to Whale Alerts? Transactions flagged by services like Whale Alert are more than just blockchain curiosities; they are vital market signals. Large USDT transfers to exchanges can sometimes precede increased buying or selling pressure. For instance, if this USDT is used to purchase Bitcoin or Ethereum, it could contribute to upward price momentum. Therefore, monitoring these flows offers valuable, real-time insight into the potential actions of large-scale investors, providing context that charts alone cannot. However, it’s crucial to avoid jumping to conclusions. A single transaction does not dictate market direction. The motives behind a USDT transfer remain private. The funds could just as easily be moved for custody, over-the-counter (OTC) trade settlement, or simple portfolio rebalancing. The key takeaway is awareness, not assumption. How Does This Impact Tether (USDT) and Market Stability? Tether (USDT) maintains its peg to the US dollar through reserves and market mechanisms. A transfer of this size is a powerful demonstration of the stablecoin’s utility for moving vast sums quickly and with minimal friction. It reinforces USDT’s position as the dominant stablecoin for institutional and whale-level transactions. For market stability, such movements are a double-edged sword: Liquidity Injection: It brings substantial capital onto a trading platform, potentially increasing market depth. Volatility Catalyst: If deployed rapidly, it can cause significant price swings in other assets. Network Confidence: It tests and demonstrates the robustness of the Tron network (where this transfer likely occurred) in handling high-value settlements. What Are the Practical Takeaways for Everyday Traders? For the average crypto enthusiast, news of a major USDT transfer should inform your strategy, not define it. Use this information as one piece of a larger puzzle. Consider it alongside other metrics like exchange inflows/outflows, futures market data, and broader macroeconomic trends. Remember, whale moves are a feature of a maturing market, not an anomaly. They highlight the growing institutional footprint in crypto, which can lead to both greater liquidity and new forms of volatility. In conclusion, the 222 million USDT move to OKX is a striking example of the scale and efficiency of modern crypto finance. While its immediate purpose is unknown, it serves as a clear reminder of the market’s dynamic nature and the importance of on-chain data. By understanding the context behind such transfers, investors can make more informed decisions, separating meaningful signal from everyday market noise. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Whale Alert, and how does it track these transactions? A1: Whale Alert is a blockchain tracking service that monitors public ledgers for large cryptocurrency transactions. It uses predefined thresholds to identify and report significant movements, like this 222 million USDT transfer, providing transparency into whale activity. Q2: Could this large USDT transfer cause the price of Bitcoin to change? A2: It has the potential to. If the USDT is used to buy a large amount of Bitcoin on OKX, it could create buying pressure and push the price up. However, if the whale’s intent is different, the impact may be negligible. The transfer itself is a precursor to potential action. Q3: Why are the wallets often labeled ‘unknown’? A3: A wallet is labeled ‘unknown’ when its owner has not publicly identified themselves or associated the address with a known entity like an exchange, company, or individual. Blockchain transactions are transparent, but participant identities are pseudonymous by default. Q4: Is moving $223 million in USDT safe? A4: On a technical level, yes. Blockchain networks like Tron or Ethereum are designed to securely process transactions of any size. The primary risks are not technological but relate to human error, like sending to a wrong address, or exchange-related issues like temporary withdrawal halts. Q5: What’s the difference between USDT being ‘transferred’ and ‘minted’? A5: A USDT transfer moves existing tokens from one wallet to another. ‘Minting’ refers to the creation of new USDT tokens by Tether Ltd. This event was a transfer of already-circulating stablecoins. Q6: Should I buy or sell crypto because of this whale move? A6: You should never make trading decisions based solely on one data point. Treat whale movements as important context. Always conduct your own comprehensive research, consider your risk tolerance, and develop a strategy based on multiple factors. Found this analysis of the major USDT transfer insightful?

After a brief two-day rally of net inflows, these popular investment vehicles experienced a collective net outflow of $78.35 million. This shift highlights the ongoing volatility and nuanced investor sentiment shaping the crypto market, even for institutional-grade products. What Drove the Bitcoin Spot ETFs Net Outflow? Data reported by Trader T reveals a day of conflicting signals within the Bitcoin spot ETF landscape. The headline figure is a clear step back, but the story beneath the surface is more complex. A significant withdrawal from several major funds overpowered a strong single performance, creating the overall negative flow. This tug-of-war between different fund managers provides a real-time snapshot of shifting investor confidence. A Closer Look at the Winners and Losers Not all Bitcoin spot ETFs moved in the same direction. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) stood out as a beacon of strength, attracting a substantial $75.7 million in new investments. However, this positive momentum was decisively countered by outflows from other key players: Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) saw the largest exit, with $103 million flowing out. Ark Invest’s ARKB experienced a withdrawal of $16.38 million. VanEck’s Bitcoin Trust (HODL) also faced outflows totaling $19.38 million. This divergence shows that investor choices are becoming more selective, moving capital between funds rather than exiting the asset class entirely. Why Should Investors Care About ETF Flows? Tracking the daily flows of Bitcoin spot ETFs is more than just watching numbers change. It serves as a crucial barometer for institutional sentiment. Consistent inflows generally signal growing confidence and adoption, which can be a supportive factor for Bitcoin’s price. Conversely, sustained outflows may indicate profit-taking, risk aversion, or a broader wait-and-see approach. The December 11th data, therefore, acts as a cautionary note, reminding market participants that the path to mainstream adoption is rarely a straight line. What’s Next for Bitcoin Spot ETFs? A single day of outflows does not define a trend. The critical question is whether this marks the beginning of a longer period of redemption or merely a brief pause in accumulation. Market observers will watch closely to see if funds like IBIT can continue to attract capital to offset outflows elsewhere. Furthermore, broader macroeconomic factors and Bitcoin’s own price action will heavily influence future Bitcoin spot ETF flow patterns. The interplay between these funds is now a fundamental piece of the crypto market puzzle. Conclusion: A Market in Constant Motion The $78.35 million net outflow from U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs is a powerful reminder of the market’s dynamic nature. It underscores that investor appetite, even through regulated vehicles, remains sensitive and can shift rapidly. For anyone involved in cryptocurrency, understanding these flow trends is essential for grasping the undercurrents of supply, demand, and institutional behavior that drive the market forward. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are Bitcoin spot ETFs? Bitcoin spot ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Bitcoin. They allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through a traditional stock brokerage account without needing to directly buy, store, or secure the cryptocurrency themselves. What does ‘net outflow’ mean for an ETF? A net outflow occurs when the total amount of money withdrawn from an ETF by shareholders selling their shares exceeds the total amount of new money invested by buyers. It indicates more selling pressure than buying pressure for that day. Why did some Bitcoin ETFs have inflows while others had outflows? Investors may move money between different funds based on factors like the fund’s expense ratio (fees), the reputation of the issuer (e.g., BlackRock vs. a smaller firm), liquidity, or personal investment strategy. It shows selectivity within the asset class. Is a single day of outflows a bad sign for Bitcoin? Not necessarily. One day of data is a snapshot, not a trend. Market flows are volatile. It’s more important to watch for sustained patterns over weeks or months to gauge true institutional sentiment. Where can I find daily Bitcoin ETF flow data? Data is compiled by various analysts and financial data firms. It is often reported by major financial news outlets covering cryptocurrencies and ETFs, such as CoinDesk, Bloomberg, and The Block. How do ETF flows affect Bitcoin’s price? Large, sustained inflows can create buying pressure on the underlying Bitcoin held by the funds, which can be a supportive factor for the price. Large, sustained outflows can have the opposite effect, as the fund must sell Bitcoin to return cash to exiting shareholders. Found this breakdown of Bitcoin spot ETF flows helpful?

This comes after a major policy shift from the White House earlier this year. On December 11, members of the House Financial Services Committee sent a formal letter to SEC Chair Paul Atkins. They urged him to update securities rules so that digital assets can be treated like other alternative investments in retirement accounts. Lawmakers say Americans saving for retirement deserve more investment choices . They argue that current rules are outdated and too restrictive, blocking millions from accessing new asset classes. Lawmakers push SEC to act on Trump’s retirement order The House Financial Committee’s push follows directly on the heels of an executive order signed by U.S. President Donald Trump in August 2025. The order, titled “Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors,” requires federal agencies to expand the investable choices available to retirement planners. It emphasizes that every American should be able to invest in alternative assets when it makes financial sense. It also notes that fiduciaries must assess risks, managers’ experience, and suitability before such choices are included in retirement plans. Notably, cryptocurrencies were specifically listed alongside real estate and private equity. This marked one of the most significant federal acknowledgments of digital assets as legitimate investment choices. In their letter, lawmakers praised the White House directive. They said the SEC must now take parallel action to ensure the policy becomes reality. They also highlighted the need to redefine who qualifies as an “accredited investor.” Strict rules about investor qualification currently restrict involvement in certain private and alternative investment markets. This program is often only available to wealthy or high-net-worth individuals. And Congress now wants to expand those rules to people with professional licenses, related job experience, or those who can pass a competency exam. These changes would ensure that a wider spectrum of workers, including teachers, nurses, engineers, and skilled laborers, would have access to investments that were once only available to wealthy Americans. The lawmakers also said the SEC should coordinate with the Department of Labor, which oversees retirement plan fiduciaries, to agree on the rules. Both agencies, they said, needed to figure out a way to safely and responsibly add alternative assets into 401(k) menus. SEC signals a shift in how crypto will be regulated The SEC has been more open on digital assets already under Chair Paul Atkins. He has abandoned the previous aggressive enforcement approach and initiated additional initiatives to clarify regulations. One of his significant projects is “Project Crypto,” a program he has developed to establish the classification, trading, and storage of digital assets. Atkins has stated in recent public remarks that a significant percentage of the cryptocurrencies traded on the market today are not securities. This distinction matters especially because, not being classified as securities, assets are subject to fewer restrictions and can be more readily included in retirement plans. The SEC is also considering sweeping reforms that might update the review, approval, and oversight of investment products. The official guidance includes investor protections, as well as clear disclosures for investors who may buy cryptocurrencies, and safeguards for retirement savers, officials say. Supporters say that if the changes become official, crypto-investing retirement options could gain traction. Digital assets will be included in standard 401(k) lineups alongside mutual funds and ETFs , at least until they are fully integrated into the market. However, critics argue that this move is risky. They say cryptocurrencies are prone to extreme price fluctuations and could expose retirees to unpredictable losses. Skeptics have warned that many workers do not fully understand the fluctuation seen in crypto markets. Even so, momentum is emerging. Companies that provide retirement solutions have seen an uptick in interest among younger workers who want digital assets integrated into their long-term savings plans. The move to include Bitcoin in 401(k) plans may push the asset to new highs.

55670356,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=244103,1765511411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Massive 222,692,703 USDT Transfer from OKX Sparks Market Speculation",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/massive-usdt-transfer-okx-unknown-wallet/,"BitcoinWorld Massive 222,692,703 USDT Transfer from OKX Sparks Market Speculation In a move that has captured the attention of the entire cryptocurrency community, blockchain tracker Whale Alert reported a staggering transaction: 222,692,703 USDT, valued at approximately $223 million, was transferred from the major exchange OKX to an unknown wallet. This colossal USDT transfer immediately raises critical questions about market intent, whale behavior, and the underlying stability of the world’s largest stablecoin. For investors and analysts, understanding the potential implications of such a move is crucial. What Does This Massive USDT Transfer Actually Mean? When a transaction of this magnitude occurs, it’s rarely a simple portfolio adjustment. A USDT transfer involving hundreds of millions of dollars typically signals strategic positioning by a major market player, often called a ‘whale’. These entities can influence prices and sentiment. The destination—an ‘unknown wallet’—adds a layer of intrigue, as it suggests the funds are moving into cold storage or a private wallet, away from immediate exchange trading. This could indicate a few potential scenarios: Strategic Accumulation: The whale may be preparing to purchase another asset, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, in large quantities. Risk Management: Moving funds off an exchange is a common security practice to mitigate counterparty risk. Institutional Movement: This could be part of a treasury operation for a large corporation or investment fund. Why Should Crypto Traders Care About Whale Movements? Whale transactions serve as a leading indicator for market trends. A large USDT transfer to an exchange often precedes a buying spree, potentially driving up prices. Conversely, a transfer *from* an exchange to private custody, like this one, can signal a holding pattern or preparation for a future large-scale market entry. Therefore, monitoring these flows provides valuable, albeit not definitive, insight. It’s a piece of the larger puzzle that includes on-chain data, derivatives market activity, and macroeconomic factors. Could This USDT Transfer Impact Tether’s Stability? Tether (USDT) maintains its 1:1 peg to the US dollar through reserves and market mechanisms. A single large withdrawal does not inherently threaten this peg. However, the transaction highlights the concentration of USDT holdings and the potential for large actors to create temporary liquidity shifts. The stability of USDT is paramount for the entire crypto ecosystem, as it is the primary trading pair on most exchanges. Observers will watch for any follow-on movements that could signal broader changes in stablecoin demand or confidence. Actionable Insights: How to Interpret Major Blockchain Transactions For the average investor, reacting to every whale alert is impractical. However, you can develop a smarter strategy. First, use tools like Whale Alert as a sentiment gauge, not a trading signal. Second, look for corroborating evidence. Was there a similar USDT transfer before a major market move? Third, consider the context. Is this happening during a market rally, a downturn, or a period of stability? By asking these questions, you move from speculation to informed analysis. The Bottom Line on This $223 Million Crypto Move The movement of 222 million USDT is a powerful reminder of the scale and opacity within cryptocurrency markets. While its immediate impact may be muted, it underscores the importance of transparency and the influential role of major holders. This USDT transfer is a significant data point that reinforces the need for investors to prioritize fundamentals and long-term strategy over reacting to single transactions. The true meaning will likely unfold in the days and weeks to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an ‘unknown wallet’ in crypto? A: An ‘unknown wallet’ is a blockchain address not publicly linked to a known entity like an exchange, company, or individual. It typically refers to a private, user-controlled wallet. Q2: Does a large USDT transfer mean the price of Bitcoin will change? A: Not necessarily. It is a potential indicator. If the USDT is moved to an exchange and used to buy Bitcoin, it could increase buying pressure. This transfer to an unknown wallet suggests preparation, not immediate action. Q3: How reliable is Whale Alert’s data? A: Whale Alert sources its data directly from public blockchain ledgers, making it highly reliable for reporting on-chain transactions. Their reporting is a trusted standard in the industry. Q4: Why would someone move so much USDT off an exchange? A> Primary reasons include enhanced security (avoiding exchange hacks), long-term holding strategy, or preparing the stablecoin for use in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols that interact with private wallets. Q5: Is my USDT safe if whales are moving large amounts? A: Yes. Tether’s stability is managed at the protocol level through its reserves. Individual large withdrawals are a normal function of liquidity and do not directly affect other users’ holdings or the asset’s peg. Q6: Can I track whale wallets myself? A> Yes, to an extent. You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan or BscScan to follow the movement of large wallets if you have the address. However, identifying the owner is usually impossible.

55670517,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=244119,1765511710,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Reversal: ETH Spot ETFs See First Net Outflow in Four Days as $42 Million Exits,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/eth-spot-etfs-net-outflow/,"BitcoinWorld Shocking Reversal: ETH Spot ETFs See First Net Outflow in Four Days as $42 Million Exits In a surprising twist for crypto investors, U.S. spot ETH ETFs recorded their first day of net outflows in four trading sessions. On December 11th, a total of $42.38 million exited these funds, according to data from TraderT. This shift breaks a short streak of inflows and raises questions about short-term sentiment toward Ethereum. Let’s dive into what happened and why it matters for your portfolio. What Caused the ETH Spot ETFs Outflow? The outflow wasn’t uniform across all funds. Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) led the retreat, with investors pulling out $31.22 million. Its Mini ETH fund followed, seeing $10.03 million in outflows. However, the picture wasn’t entirely negative. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) recorded zero net outflows, showing remarkable stability. Meanwhile, 21Shares’ Core Ethereum ETF (CETH) bucked the trend entirely, attracting a net inflow of $2.08 million. This mixed activity suggests the outflow wasn’t a broad-based rejection of Ethereum. Instead, it may reflect profit-taking or a rotation between different ETF providers. The concentration of outflows in Grayscale’s products is particularly noteworthy for market watchers. Why Should You Care About ETF Flows? Spot ETF flows act as a real-time gauge of institutional and large-scale investor sentiment. When money flows into ETH spot ETFs, it represents direct buying pressure on the underlying asset. Conversely, outflows can indicate selling pressure or a shift in capital allocation. Therefore, monitoring these trends provides actionable insights beyond just price charts. Consider these key implications of the recent data: Short-Term Sentiment: The break in the inflow streak suggests a potential cooling of immediate bullish enthusiasm. Provider Preference: The divergence between Grayscale and BlackRock highlights that investors are making nuanced choices between fund managers. Market Liquidity: Large outflows can impact market liquidity, potentially leading to increased volatility. Is This a Warning Sign for Ethereum? A single day of outflows does not necessarily spell trouble for Ethereum’s long-term prospects. Market flows are inherently volatile. However, it serves as a crucial reminder that the path of adoption is not a straight line upward. The resilience of BlackRock’s fund and the inflow into 21Shares’ product show that demand still exists, just in different places. For context, this event occurred amidst a broader crypto market that often experiences end-of-year portfolio rebalancing. Some analysts suggest the outflows could be tied to this seasonal activity rather than a fundamental shift in Ethereum’s outlook. The key is to watch if this becomes a sustained trend or remains an isolated event. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors How should you interpret this news? First, avoid panic. One data point is not a trend. Instead, use this information to inform a more strategic view. Watch the flow data over the coming week to see if outflows continue or reverse. Pay close attention to which ETH spot ETFs are gaining or losing assets, as this can signal shifting confidence in different financial products. Furthermore, compare ETF flow data with other on-chain metrics and broader market news. This holistic approach will give you a clearer picture than any single metric alone. Remember, informed decisions are always better than reactive ones. In conclusion, the first net outflow from U.S. spot ETH ETFs in four days is a significant market event worthy of attention. It highlights the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of crypto investment vehicles. While Grayscale saw notable exits, the stability of BlackRock and the inflow into 21Shares present a nuanced story. The overall takeaway is clear: vigilance and context are your best tools in navigating the crypto landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are ETH spot ETFs? ETH spot ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Ethereum (ETH). They allow investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price without directly buying and storing the cryptocurrency. Why did Grayscale’s ETHE have the largest outflow? Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) has a different structure and fee history compared to newer spot ETFs. Investors may be rotating into newer, potentially lower-cost funds, or taking profits after a period of gains. Does a net outflow mean the price of ETH will drop? Not necessarily. While outflows can create selling pressure, many other factors influence price, including overall market sentiment, Bitcoin’s movement, and macroeconomic conditions. A single day’s flow is rarely decisive. How often should I check ETF flow data? For most investors, monitoring flow data weekly is sufficient. Daily fluctuations are normal. Look for sustained trends over a week or more to identify meaningful shifts in capital. Where can I find reliable data on ETF flows? Data is reported by the fund issuers and aggregated by financial data platforms like Bloomberg, Reuters, and specialized crypto analytics firms like TraderT, which provided this report. Are spot ETH ETFs a good long-term investment? Like any investment, it depends on your goals and risk tolerance. Spot ETFs offer a regulated, convenient way to hold Ethereum. Their long-term success will be tied to Ethereum’s adoption and the overall growth of the crypto market. Found this analysis of the ETH spot ETFs outflow helpful?

55670697,643899,1765512012,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55670697.jpeg,Ethereum Leverage Hits Highest Level Ever – Market Enters Critical Risk Zone,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-leverage-hit-highest-level-market-critical/,"Ethereum has retraced below the $3,200 level following the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points, a move that initially boosted risk assets but quickly shifted market sentiment into uncertainty. While the broader macro backdrop now leans toward looser monetary conditions, Ethereum’s reaction suggests that traders remain cautious, especially after the sharp rally from the $2,800 region earlier this month. According to fresh data from CryptoQuant, Binance’s Ethereum Estimated Leverage Ratio has climbed to an all-time high of nearly 0.579. This signals that the ETH market has entered a highly sensitive and potentially unstable phase, as open leveraged positions have grown faster than the underlying spot holdings on the exchange. Such extreme leverage typically reflects heightened risk appetite—and often precedes periods of sharp volatility. This dynamic implies that a large portion of Ethereum’s recent price action has been driven not by organic demand, but by leveraged speculation. With funding structures stretched and traders aggressively positioning for upside, even a modest price swing could trigger a cascade of liquidations, amplifying market movements in either direction. As Ethereum hovers near key support, the combination of elevated leverage and post-FED uncertainty sets the stage for a volatile and decisive period ahead. Ethereum’s Leverage Structure Signals Growing Fragility Arab Chain explains that Ethereum’s historically high leverage ratio indicates a structural imbalance in the market. When the volume of open contracts funded by leverage grows faster than the actual spot ETH held on the platform, the entire ecosystem becomes more sensitive to abrupt volatility. In such conditions, traders face a heightened risk of liquidation from even moderate price swings—whether the move is upward or downward. Historically, peaks in this indicator have aligned with periods of intense price pressure, as excessive leverage magnifies the market’s reaction to relatively small shifts in demand or sentiment. At the same time, Ethereum is currently trading near $3,300, creating a concerning confluence: rising prices supported not by strong inflows or genuine spot demand, but by leverage-driven speculation. This type of rally is inherently unstable. If leverage continues climbing at these extreme levels, the market becomes increasingly vulnerable to a sharp liquidation-driven sell-off should prices pull back. However, there is an alternative path. If ETH’s price continues to build momentum while the leverage ratio cools slightly, the market could regain a healthier structure—providing a more durable foundation for a sustained upward trend. For now, the estimated leverage ratio remains one of the most critical indicators for evaluating Ethereum’s short-term direction. ETH Price Action Details Ethereum’s latest rejection near the $3,350–$3,400 zone highlights the challenges bulls face as the broader trend remains pressured. The chart shows ETH pulling back toward the $3,200 area after a sharp attempt to break above the 100-day moving average (red line). This level continues to act as a major dynamic resistance, repeatedly capping upside momentum throughout November and December. Despite the recent recovery from sub-$2,900 lows, ETH has not yet reclaimed the 50-day moving average (blue line) with conviction. The inability to close decisively above it reinforces the idea that this bounce remains corrective rather than impulsive. Meanwhile, volume on the latest push upward has been modest, suggesting that buyers are not entering aggressively at these levels. On the downside, the $3,050–$3,100 region is emerging as short-term support. A daily close below this zone could open a path back toward $2,900, especially if risk sentiment deteriorates post-FOMC. Conversely, reclaiming and holding above $3,350 would be the first sign of renewed bullish strength, potentially targeting $3,550 next.

The findings revealed that the vast majority of these firms are now grappling with substantial unrealized losses, prompting many to sell off considerable amounts of their Bitcoin holdings. Market Struggles Continue In a sample analysis of 100 companies with reliable cost basis measurements, approximately 65% purchased Bitcoin at prices that now exceed the current market value, leaving a considerable number of these treasuries with substantial unrealized losses. Bitcoin’s market downturn in late November pushed spot prices down towards $90,000, leaving many buyers from 2025 at a financial disadvantage. Related Reading: Bitcoin Outlook Post Fed’s 0.25% Rate Cut: Historical Patterns And Predictions Now, the market’s leading crypto has retraced below this key level on Thursday, even despite the Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut announcement. Among the companies surveyed, about two-thirds are found to be sitting on unrealized losses based on current market values. But despite the volatility in pricing, some of the largest balance sheets continued to acquire Bitcoin. Notably, firms like Strategy (previously MicroStrategy) and Strive significantly contributed to net additions in November, with Strategy accounting for approximately 75% of all monthly purchases following their sell-offs. Mining companies remain steadfast as a cornerstone of public market Bitcoin holdings. In November, they represented about 5% of new additions to the market and around 12% of the total balances held by public companies. Bitcoin Demand Remains Strong Even as Bitcoin treasury stocks have shown softness compared to Bitcoin itself and broader equity benchmarks, many companies still pursued strategies to add BTC to their balance sheets while refining their capital-market approaches. BitcoinTreasury.Net’s analysis indicates that nearly 50 firms have managed to achieve gains of at least 10% over the last 6 to 12 months. Over time, losses have begun to soften for some. Currently, around 140 companies have experienced declines of at least 10% over a 1 to 3 month period, while about 105 companies have seen similar declines year-to-date. However, not all corporate holders opted to weather the storm of price fluctuations. In November alone, at least five companies decided to sell Bitcoin, with Sequans leading the charge by offloading roughly one-third of its holdings.

This figure is notably below the totals from each of the prior four quarters and aligns closely with the additions seen in the third quarter of 2024. The report concluded that despite a clear easing in the “summer buying frenzy,” demand for Bitcoin has not entirely diminished as public corporations are adapting to a more cautious and selective approach as they reassess their recent purchases. At the time of writing, BTC traded at $89,920, down over 2% in the previous 24 hours. This places the cryptocurrency 27% behind its all-time high of $126,000 set in October of this year.

Key Takeaways: The SEC granted DTC a rare no-action letter, clearing the way for tokenizing major US market assets. The tokenization service will launch in late 2026 and run on pre-approved blockchains for three years. The move signals a broader regulatory shift as the SEC shows greater openness to blockchain-based financial infrastructure. On Thursday, the DTCC confirmed that its subsidiary , the Depository Trust Company (DTC), received a rare “no-action” letter that allows it to begin tokenizing traditional securities in a controlled production setting. DTC to Tokenize Treasuries, ETFs and Russell 1000 Assets by 2026 Under the approval, the DTC plans to tokenize a basket of highly liquid instruments, including components of the Russell 1000 index, major index-tracking ETFs, and US Treasury bills, notes, and bonds. The service is scheduled for launch in the second half of 2026 and is designed to operate on pre-approved blockchains for a period of three years. The DTCC, which underpins much of the US securities market through its clearing and settlement operations, said the no-action letter confirms the agency will not pursue enforcement if the program is carried out as proposed. Market observers view the decision as a significant regulatory signal, as no-action letters are uncommon and typically reserved for projects with clear safeguards. DTCC CEO Frank La Salla welcomed the move, saying the tokenization effort could reshape how securities move across the financial system. He pointed to potential improvements such as faster collateral mobility, continuous market access, and new trading mechanisms enabled by programmable assets. In an historic milestone, DTC received a No‑Action Letter from the SEC to tokenize certain DTC‑custodied assets. By leveraging blockchain, DTCC aims to bridge TradFi and DeFi, advancing a more resilient, inclusive and efficient global financial system. https://t.co/yYNaHfvjcS pic.twitter.com/E4W47rWBIc — DTCC (@The_DTCC) December 11, 2025 According to the company, tokenized versions of these assets will carry the same ownership rights, investor protections, and entitlements as their traditional counterparts, providing a bridge between legacy market structure and emerging blockchain rails. The service will be available to DTC participants and their clients. The SEC has taken a noticeably more open stance toward blockchain initiatives over the past year. Two decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) projects received similar no-action treatment , and in late September, the agency cleared investment advisers to work with state trust companies serving as crypto custodians. In August, the agency issued a similar letter to Double Zero , surprising many in the industry and fueling optimism that the SEC, now led by Chair Paul Atkins, is taking a more measured approach after years of tension under former chair Gary Gensler. RWA Tokenization Gains Momentum On Monday, Libeara, the blockchain infrastructure platform backed by Standard Chartered’s venture arm SC Ventures, rolled out a new tokenized gold investment fund in Singapore, bringing one of the world’s oldest safe-haven assets onto digital rails. The fund, launched in partnership with FundBridge Capital, allows professional investors to gain exposure to gold through blockchain-based tokens issued on Libeara’s ledger. In a recent research, Web3 digital property firm Animoca Brands said that tokenization of RWAs could unlock a $400 trillion traditional finance market. Animoca researchers Andrew Ho and Ming Ruan said the global market for private credit, treasury debt, commodities, stocks, alternative funds, and bonds represents a vast runway for growth. “The estimated $400 trillion addressable TradFi market underscores the potential growth runway for RWA tokenization,” they wrote. Meanwhile, according to the 2025 Skynet RWA Security Report, the market for tokenized RWAs could grow to $16 trillion by 2030 .

In a significant market shift, BNB overtakes XRP , reclaiming its position as the world’s fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This move highlights the ongoing battle for dominance among major altcoins and underscores the powerful influence of ecosystem utility. Let’s break down what happened and why it matters for your portfolio. How Did BNB Manage to Overtake XRP? According to data from CoinMarketCap, BNB’s market cap reached approximately $122.9 billion, edging past XRP’s $122.7 billion. This seemingly small margin represents a major psychological and financial milestone. The shift isn’t just about a price pump; it’s a reflection of sustained growth and utility. BNB’s rise is deeply tied to the expansive Binance ecosystem, which includes the world’s largest crypto exchange, the BNB Chain network, and numerous real-world applications. Meanwhile, XRP’s price has faced headwinds despite a major legal victory against the SEC. The market is now signaling that utility and active use within a thriving ecosystem may carry more weight in the long run than regulatory clarity alone. This is a crucial lesson for investors focusing on fundamentals. What Does This Ranking Shift Really Mean? When BNB overtakes XRP , it sends a clear message about value drivers in crypto. Market cap rankings are a popularity contest powered by real money and belief in a project’s future. This change suggests investors are prioritizing: Ecosystem Strength: BNB is the fuel for Binance Smart Chain, transaction fees, and hundreds of projects. Utility Over Speculation: Its use case is clear and constantly expanding. Exchange Backing: The direct support from the world’s leading crypto exchange provides unique stability. For XRP, the challenge is to translate its legal wins into accelerated adoption and developer activity to reclaim its position. Can BNB Hold Its Position Against XRP? The battle for fourth place is likely far from over. Both assets have passionate communities and strong fundamentals. However, BNB’s position seems fortified by continuous development. Key factors that could help BNB maintain its lead include: The ongoing growth of decentralized applications (dApps) on BNB Chain. Binance’s quarterly token burns, which reduce BNB supply. New use cases like decentralized storage and computing. Conversely, a surge in cross-border payment adoption using XRP or another favorable legal ruling could see the tables turn again. Therefore, investors should watch both ecosystems closely. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors This event is more than just news; it’s a data point for your strategy. When a major token like BNB overtakes XRP , it’s a reminder to assess your holdings based on utility and ecosystem health. Don’t just chase rankings. Instead, consider: Diversification: Exposure to both ecosystem tokens (like BNB) and payment-focused assets (like XRP) can balance a portfolio. Long-Term Vision: Rankings change monthly. Focus on projects solving real problems. Staying Informed: Follow development activity and partnership announcements, not just price charts. In conclusion, the fact that BNB overtakes XRP is a testament to the dynamic and competitive nature of the cryptocurrency market. It underscores the growing premium placed on tokens with deep utility and active, thriving ecosystems. While rankings will continue to fluctuate, this shift emphasizes a move towards fundamental value over narrative alone. For savvy investors, it’s a call to focus on use cases, adoption metrics, and technological progress when evaluating any digital asset’s long-term potential. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean that BNB overtook XRP in market cap? A: It means the total market value of all BNB in circulation (price per coin multiplied by supply) is now higher than that of XRP, making it the fourth most valuable cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT. Q2: Is BNB a better investment than XRP now? A: “Better” is subjective and depends on your strategy. BNB is tied to the Binance ecosystem’s growth, while XRP is focused on cross-border payments. Both have different risk and reward profiles. Q3: Could XRP reclaim the fourth spot from BNB? A> Absolutely. Cryptocurrency rankings are highly volatile. Increased adoption of Ripple’s payment solutions or another positive price swing could easily push XRP back above BNB. Q4: Why is BNB’s market cap so high? A: BNB’s value is supported by its multifaceted utility across the vast Binance universe—paying for trading fees, powering the BNB Smart Chain, and participating in token sales, among other uses. Q5: Does this change affect the price of Bitcoin or Ethereum? A> Not directly. This is a competition within the “altcoin” market. However, it signals where investor capital and confidence are flowing within the broader crypto ecosystem. Q6: How often do these top 5 cryptocurrency rankings change? A: Changes among the top 3 (BTC, ETH, USDT) are rare, but positions 4 and below have seen more frequent shifts, especially between assets like BNB, XRP, and SOL, reflecting market sentiment.

The price is now struggling and faces resistance near the $2.040 resistance level. XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.050 zone. The price is now trading below $2.050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.040 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it settles below $2.00. XRP Price Struggles Near Resistance XRP price attempted a recovery wave above $2.150 but failed to continue higher, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price started a fresh decline below $2.080 and $2.050. There was a move below the $2.00 support level. A low was formed at $1.993, and the price recently started an upside correction. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.177 swing high to the $1.993 low. However, the bears are active near $2.040 and $2.050. There is also a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.040 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.040 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.080 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.177 swing high to the $1.993 low. A close above $2.080 could send the price to $2.012. The next hurdle sits at $2.150. A clear move above the $2.150 resistance might send the price toward the $2.1850 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.220 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.250. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.040 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.00 level. The next major support is near the $1.9880 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $1.9880 level, the price might continue to decline toward $1.920. The next major support sits near the $1.880 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $1.820. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level.

PayPal crypto head, May Zabaneh, confirmed to Fortune that the feature is live and currently limited to US-based users. A Google spokesperson confirmed to the outlet that creator payouts in PayPal’s stablecoin are now supported, while declining to provide further detail. YouTube already uses PayPal’s mass payout infrastructure to pay creators, gig workers and contractors. Big Tech’s Push Into Tokenized Money Grows As YouTube Adopts PYUSD Earlier in the third quarter, PayPal added an option that lets payment recipients take their money in PYUSD instead of cash balances. YouTube then decided to extend that choice to creators who receive a share of revenue from the ads and subscriptions their videos generate. Zabaneh said the structure means PayPal handles the crypto piece end-to-end. In practice, YouTube continues to interact with PayPal in fiat terms, while PayPal converts payouts into PYUSD for creators who opt in, reducing the technical and regulatory lift for the video platform. The change lands as Big Tech leans further into stablecoins and tokenized money. Google and its peers have shown growing interest in crypto infrastructure during a fresh wave of digital asset hype in Silicon Valley. For YouTube, letting creators earn in stablecoins adds another toggle to its monetization toolkit without redesigning the core product. Trump Era Stablecoin Rules And Mega Deals Propel Tokens Into Broader Finance Stablecoins such as PYUSD track assets like the dollar and have long been a core building block of crypto trading. Over the past year, they have pushed further into mainstream finance, helped by President Donald Trump signing new federal legislation on stablecoin oversight and by a run of high-profile corporate deals. Payments giant Stripe, for example, closed a $1.1B acquisition of stablecoin firm Bridge in February. PayPal has been one of the earlier movers among large tech and payments companies. It enabled buying and selling of Bitcoin, Ethereum and a handful of other tokens in 2020, then launched PYUSD in 2023. The token now has a market value of nearly $4B, according to CoinGecko, and sits at the centre of the company’s on-chain strategy. PYUSD Gains Reach As PayPal Pushes Its Stablecoin Into Everyday Payments Since launch, PayPal has threaded PYUSD through its ecosystem. Users can hold the token in PayPal’s main wallet and in Venmo, spend it at supported merchants and, from this year, use it as a settlement asset for small and medium-sized businesses paying vendors. The YouTube integration effectively extends that reach to millions of potential creators who may prefer to hold a dollar stablecoin rather than receive traditional bank payouts. This is not the first time Google has interacted directly with PYUSD. An executive at Google Cloud previously told Fortune that the cloud division had accepted payments from two customers in the PayPal stablecoin, signalling that the company is willing to experiment with on chain settlement where it fits into existing contracts.

The 10,000 to 100,000 BTC cohort has sold or redistributed 36,500 BTC (approx. $3.4 billion) since December 1, according to Glassnode data . The distribution coincides with Bitcoin’s struggle to break the $94,000 resistance level following Wednesday’s Federal Reserve rate cut. BTC traded at $92,250 (-0.2%) during the early Asian session Friday. The Data Points The Cohort: Entities holding 10k-100k BTC (often institutional custodians or early miners). The Volume: ~$3.37 billion in selling pressure over 12 days. The Trend: This marks a shift from accumulation to distribution for this specific class, contrasting with retail sentiment which remains elevated. Liquidity Drought Market depth is thinning. Stablecoin liquidity, a proxy for buying power, has dropped significantly. Data cited by FX Leaders notes a 50% decline in stablecoin inflows since August, suggesting the current price levels lack the fresh capital support needed for a breakout above $100,000. “Bitcoin is trading steadily near $92,000 as markets digest the Fed’s rate cut alongside its plan to inject liquidity by purchasing $40 billion in Treasury bills each month. While this liquidity boost will have a stronger long-term impact, near-term sentiment is also improving, supported by renewed institutional flows,” noted Akshat Siddhant, Lead Quant Analyst at Mudrex. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs saw more than $610 million in inflows over the past two days, signalling growing confidence. For BTC to push toward the $100,000 mark, a daily close above $94,140 is key, with $90,000 acting as immediate support. BTC Faces $88K Support Test This divergence is the signal to watch. While retail chases the “Fed pivot” narrative, the smart money (10k-100k BTC tier) is using the liquidity to exit. The $3.4B outflow from this cohort, combined with the 50% drop in stablecoin reserves, indicates the current range ($88k-$94k) is being used for distribution, not accumulation. Expect volatility to increase if BTC loses the $88,000 support handle.

55672809,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=244143,1765516211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revealed: Galaxy Digital’s Stunning $175 Million Bitcoin Transfer to a Crypto Whale,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/galaxy-digital-bitcoin-whale-transfer/,"BitcoinWorld Revealed: Galaxy Digital’s Stunning $175 Million Bitcoin Transfer to a Crypto Whale In a move that has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency community, Galaxy Digital, a leading crypto financial services firm, has executed a staggering Bitcoin transfer worth $175 million to a single anonymous address. This colossal movement of 1,900 BTC, culminating in a final $64.8 million transaction, spotlights the growing influence of institutional players and mysterious ‘whales’ in shaping the digital asset landscape. What does this massive Galaxy Digital Bitcoin transfer signal for the market’s future? What Is the Galaxy Digital Bitcoin Transfer All About? According to data from The Data Nerd, Galaxy Digital initiated a series of transactions over three days. The firm moved a total of 1,900 BTC, valued at approximately $175 million, to a new wallet address beginning with ‘bc1qp8’. The most recent transaction, involving 700 BTC worth $64.8 million, occurred just eight hours before reports surfaced. This isn’t a simple trade; it’s a strategic, high-value Bitcoin transfer from a known institutional entity to an unknown counterparty, often called a ‘whale’ in crypto parlance. Why Should This Massive BTC Movement Matter to You? While large transactions happen daily, a Galaxy Digital Bitcoin transfer of this magnitude from a publicly traded company demands attention. It provides a clear window into institutional behavior. Here are the key implications for everyday investors and the broader market: Institutional Confidence: Moving such a large sum suggests a strategic long-term plan, potentially involving custody solutions, over-the-counter (OTC) deals, or preparations for a new financial product. Market Sentiment: Whales can influence prices. A concentrated buy or sell order from a wallet holding hundreds of millions in BTC can create significant volatility. Transparency vs. Anonymity: The transaction is transparent on the blockchain, but the recipient’s identity is hidden. This highlights Bitcoin’s core duality: a public ledger with private participants. Who Could Be Behind the Receiving Whale Address? The destination address, ‘bc1qp8’, is a complete mystery. This anonymity fuels speculation. Could this Bitcoin transfer be for another institution, a wealthy individual, or a fund? Several possibilities exist: A New Institutional Client: Galaxy Digital may be moving assets for a hedge fund, family office, or corporation entering the crypto space. An Internal Treasury Move: The firm could be shifting funds between its own wallets for security or operational reasons. Collateral for a Financial Product: The BTC might be earmarked as collateral for lending, derivatives, or a forthcoming ETF-related activity. Without more context, the true purpose remains unclear. However, the sheer scale confirms that high-stakes crypto finance is operating in the background, largely unseen by retail traders. What Are the Practical Takeaways from This Event? For investors watching this Galaxy Digital Bitcoin transfer , the event is less about immediate price action and more about understanding market structure. Here are actionable insights: Monitor Whale Activity: Use blockchain explorers to track large wallet movements. They often precede major market trends. Assess Institutional Trends: Actions by firms like Galaxy Digital often reflect broader institutional sentiment toward Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Focus on Fundamentals: While whale moves are notable, long-term investment decisions should still be based on Bitcoin’s technological fundamentals and adoption curve. Conclusion: Decoding the Signal in the Noise The $175 million Galaxy Digital Bitcoin transfer is a powerful testament to the maturation of cryptocurrency markets. It demonstrates that institutional capital flows are now a dominant force, capable of moving billions seamlessly on a public blockchain. For the astute observer, this isn’t just a transaction; it’s a signal. It underscores Bitcoin’s entrenched role in global finance and reminds us that the most significant market moves often happen off the public exchanges, in the quiet corridors of institutional strategy. The whale may be anonymous, but its impact on the market’s depth and future is very real. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Galaxy Digital? A1: Galaxy Digital is a leading financial services and investment management firm dedicated to the digital asset and cryptocurrency sector. It is publicly traded and provides services like trading, asset management, and investment banking for institutions. Q2: What is a ‘whale’ in cryptocurrency? A2: A ‘whale’ is an individual or entity that holds a large enough amount of a cryptocurrency that their buying or selling activity can significantly influence the market price. Q3: Are large Bitcoin transfers like this normal? A3: Yes, large transfers between institutional wallets and exchanges are common. However, a transfer of this size from a major firm like Galaxy Digital to a new, anonymous wallet is noteworthy and often analyzed for potential market implications. Q4: How can I track large Bitcoin transactions? A4: You can use blockchain explorers like Blockchain.com, BTC.com, or specialized analytics platforms like Arkham Intelligence or The Data Nerd to monitor large wallet movements and transactions. Q5: Does this transfer mean Galaxy Digital is selling its Bitcoin? A5: Not necessarily. A transfer to another wallet does not equate to a sale on the open market. It could be for custody, collateral, or an OTC deal with a specific counterparty. The Bitcoin remains in circulation. Q6: Should I change my investment strategy based on this news? A6: Single transactions, even large ones, should not dictate your core investment strategy. They are data points for understanding market dynamics. Always base long-term decisions on thorough research and risk assessment. Found this analysis of the major Galaxy Digital Bitcoin transfer insightful?

55672878,https://cryptonews.com/?p=463033,1765516333,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/55672878.jpeg,Binance Adds New Trading Pairs for Trump Family’s USD1 Stablecoin,https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-adds-new-trading-pairs-for-trump-familys-usd1-stablecoin/,"Binance has widened access to the Trump family–linked USD1 stablecoin, adding new fee-free trading pairs as the token gains a larger foothold on the exchange. Key Takeaways: Binance expanded USD1 trading with new zero-fee pairs and will fully replace BUSD collateral with USD1. USD1 has rapidly grown to a $2.7B market cap, backed by US Treasuries and supported by major Abu Dhabi investment flows. The token’s rise comes amid renewed political attention and Binance’s regulatory gains in Abu Dhabi. The company confirmed on Thursday that users can now trade USD1 against Ether, Solana and BNB, joining its existing Bitcoin pair. Binance Retires BUSD, Makes USD1 Its Primary Collateral Asset The move deepens Binance’s integration of USD1 and comes as the exchange will convert all remaining BUSD collateral into USD1 at a one-to-one rate within a week. The decision effectively retires BUSD from Binance’s internal structure and positions USD1 as its primary dollar-pegged asset for collateral use. Binance said the conversion reflects a broader update to its collateral framework, describing USD1 as “an integral part” of the exchange’s ecosystem going forward. World Liberty Financial CEO Zach Witkoff welcomed the expansion, calling it a milestone for a stablecoin that launched only in March. USD1, backed by U.S. Treasury bills and issued on Ethereum and BNB Chain, has climbed to the seventh-largest stablecoin with a market value of $2.7 billion. Its rapid ascent was boosted in May when Abu Dhabi investment firm MGX deployed USD1 for a $2 billion investment on Binance. USD1 is integrating with the world’s largest exchange @binance to expand the global adoption of USD1 @worldlibertyfi See the press release below https://t.co/8INMRIH45d — Zach Witkoff (@ZachWitkoff) December 11, 2025 Despite early momentum, supply has dipped slightly from its $3 billion peak in late October, with no new tokens minted for several months, according to CoinGecko data. World Liberty Financial was co-founded by President Donald Trump and his sons, giving USD1 an unusually political profile in the stablecoin market. The involvement drew further attention after Trump pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao seven weeks ago. Zhao had been sentenced to four months in prison in April 2024 for failing to implement adequate anti-money laundering controls at the exchange. Trump later said he issued the pardon after hearing broad support for Zhao and insisting the offense “is not even a crime.” The move also comes as Binance has secured three new licences in Abu Dhabi , tightening its grip on one of the most ambitious digital asset hubs in the Middle East and giving the exchange a powerful regulatory base as it pushes to keep institutional money on side. The Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Abu Dhabi Global Market has approved Binance.com to operate through a trio of regulated entities that together cover exchange, clearing and broker dealer activities. Binance Eyes US Comeback After Trump Pardons Founder Changpeng Zhao Binance is reportedly exploring ways to re-enter the US market following Trump’s pardon of CZ. The exchange is weighing options such as merging its US affiliate with its global platform or allowing its main exchange to serve American users directly. Zhao’s pardon, granted after his 2023 guilty plea for anti–money laundering violations, has reignited scrutiny amid Binance’s $2 billion deal with Trump’s family-backed crypto venture, World Liberty Financial. The clemency removes prior legal barriers that had restricted his involvement in Binance operations. Legal experts say the move effectively reinstates Zhao’s ability to engage in business decisions, giving the company’s leadership a major boost as it eyes renewed US access. Zhao, whose net worth stands at $61.4 billion, remains one of the most powerful figures in crypto, overseeing an ecosystem with $8.7 billion in on-chain assets. The pardon comes as Trump continues to court the digital asset industry, with his family reportedly earning over $1 billion from crypto ventures .

This announcement, made on December 11th, marks a pivotal moment for SOLV, potentially unlocking new liquidity and visibility. But what does this strategic listing truly mean for investors and the broader DeFi landscape? Let’s dive into the details and implications. What is the Solv Protocol (SOLV)? Before understanding the impact of the listing, it’s crucial to grasp what Solv Protocol does. In simple terms, Solv Protocol is a decentralized platform focused on creating and managing financial instruments. Think of it as a toolkit for building complex DeFi products like bonds and vaults in a more efficient and liquid way. The SOLV token powers this ecosystem, used for governance, staking, and fee payments. Therefore, when Kraken lists Solv Protocol , it’s not just adding another token; it’s providing a gateway to a sophisticated segment of DeFi for its vast user base.

Kwon was openly remorseful and expressed a desire to serve part of his sentence in South Korea, where he could face additional charges and potentially decades more prison time. Do Kwon Sentenced to 15 Years Do Kwon, the co-founder of Terraform Labs, was sentenced to 15 years in a US federal prison after pleading guilty to wire fraud and conspiracy to defraud for his role in the catastrophic collapse of the Terra ecosystem. The 2022 implosion wiped out roughly $40 billion in market value and left thousands of investors financially devastated. During the sentencing hearing in the Southern District of New York, Judge Paul Engelmayer delivered a sharply worded rebuke of Kwon’s actions, and placed a lot of emphasis on the fact that the severity and duration of his deception required a substantial prison term. Kwon will receive credit for time served in the United States as well as 17 months spent in custody in Montenegro prior to extradition. Live court reporting from Inner City Press (Source: Bluesky ) Before the judge issued his decision, he heard from several victims who described in detail how Terra’s collapse upended their lives. Prosecutors said more than 16,500 people filed claims in Terraform’s bankruptcy proceedings. One victim, Tatiana Dontsova, recounted how she sold her apartment in Moscow and relocated to Tbilisi after investing in what she believed was a promising ecosystem. Her $81,000 investment collapsed to just $13, which left her homeless and without recourse. The judge mentioned these stories while pointing out that investor risk does not equate to accepting the possibility of fraud, and called Kwon’s conduct “unusually serious” and rooted in exploiting public trust. Do Kwon Kwon addressed the court by saying he spent years reflecting on the collapse and expressed a desire to serve his punishment in South Korea, where he has been separated from his family for three years. Engelmayer acknowledged his remorse but warned that leniency was not appropriate. He stated that without the guilty plea, the sentence would have been even harsher. Live court reporting from Inner City Press (Source: Bluesky ) The judge also dismissed both sides’ suggestions for shorter sentencing ranges, and found the prosecution’s recommended 12 years “unreasonable.” Under the terms of his sentence, Kwon may be extradited to South Korea after serving half of his US term, where he could face up to an additional 40 years in prison. His conviction is yet another major chapter in the legal reckoning facing high-profile crypto executives.

According to a compelling report from LD Capital, the evidence points toward genuine Ethereum long-term growth . The analysis highlights that solutions to scalability challenges and a maturing ecosystem are creating a powerful foundation for the future, attracting serious institutional interest in the process. What’s Driving Ethereum Long-Term Growth? LD Capital’s report makes a clear case. Blockchain technology is transforming industries, and Ethereum leads this charge with its unparalleled smart contract and decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem. However, the network’s journey hasn’t been without speed bumps. High transaction fees have been a persistent challenge, opening the door for competitors. The report argues that Ethereum’s strategic upgrades are directly addressing these issues to secure its future. The Merge: A Foundation for Efficiency A pivotal moment for Ethereum long-term growth was ‘The Merge.’ This transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) was more than a technical milestone. It fundamentally improved Ethereum’s framework in three key areas: Scalability: Laid the groundwork for future throughput enhancements. Security: Strengthened the network’s defenses. Energy Efficiency: Reduced its environmental footprint by over 99%, addressing a major concern for institutional investors. This upgrade demonstrated Ethereum’s capacity for evolution, a critical trait for any technology aiming for longevity. How Will Layer 2 Solutions and Sharding Unlock Potential? While The Merge set the stage, the report identifies Layer 2 solutions and the upcoming sharding upgrade as the main actors for solving scalability. Think of Layer 2s as express lanes built on top of the main Ethereum highway, processing transactions faster and cheaper. Sharding will then divide the network’s data into smaller, manageable pieces (shards), dramatically increasing its capacity. Together, these innovations are expected to resolve the fee issues that have hampered user experience. This technical roadmap is central to LD Capital’s bullish outlook on Ethereum long-term growth , as it directly tackles the network’s most significant barrier to mass adoption. Wall Street’s Growing Consensus on Ethereum The technical story is compelling, but the on-chain and financial data adds concrete evidence. LD Capital founder Jack Yi points to a shifting tide in traditional finance. He notes a growing Wall Street consensus for blockchain adoption, with Ethereum as a primary beneficiary. Several metrics support this shift: The EIP-1559 upgrade (“the Fusaka upgrade”) permanently removes ETH from circulation through transaction fee burning, increasing scarcity. Speculative leverage is at an all-time low, suggesting a healthier, less volatile market base. Exchange reserves hold only 10% of the supply, indicating strong holding sentiment rather than selling pressure. Yi concludes that in the current cycle of interest rate cuts, funds are flowing into ETH not for speculation, but for its tangible value as a productive technological asset. Conclusion: A Convergence of Factors The path to Ethereum long-term growth appears to be built on a powerful convergence. Technical upgrades are systematically solving scalability and efficiency problems. Meanwhile, a robust dApp ecosystem continues to drive real-world utility. Perhaps most tellingly, these fundamentals are now capturing the attention and capital of institutional investors, creating a new phase of maturation for Ethereum. The report from LD Capital suggests this isn’t mere optimism, but a trend grounded in measurable progress and financial logic. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What did LD Capital’s report say about Ethereum? The report states Ethereum is positioned for long-term growth due to its ongoing scalability solutions (like Layer 2s and sharding), efficiency gains from The Merge, and increasing institutional adoption. How did The Merge contribute to Ethereum’s growth? The Merge transitioned Ethereum to Proof-of-Stake, drastically improving its energy efficiency (over 99%), enhancing security, and providing a foundation for future scalability improvements. What are the main challenges for Ethereum mentioned? The primary challenge has been high transaction fees during periods of network congestion. The report states this is being addressed through Layer 2 scaling solutions and the planned sharding upgrade. What on-chain metrics support the growth thesis? Key metrics include a high ETH burn rate from EIP-1559, low speculative leverage, and only 10% of ETH supply held on exchanges, indicating strong holding sentiment. Is Wall Street interested in Ethereum? Yes. LD Capital’s founder highlighted a growing consensus on Wall Street for blockchain adoption, with funds flowing into Ethereum for its tangible value as a technological asset, especially during economic cycles favoring alternative investments. What is the role of Layer 2 solutions? Layer 2 solutions are secondary frameworks built on Ethereum that process transactions off the main chain. They are crucial for reducing fees and increasing transaction speed, solving key scalability issues in the short-to-medium term. Found this analysis on Ethereum’s future insightful?

A powerful signal just flashed across the Bitcoin network. In a stunning display of confidence, dedicated Bitcoin accumulation addresses scooped up a massive 75,000 BTC in just the first ten days of December. This isn’t casual trading; it’s a strategic, long-term bet on Bitcoin’s future. Let’s dive into what this means for the market and why you should pay attention. What Are Bitcoin Accumulation Addresses Telling Us? First, let’s clarify what we mean by Bitcoin accumulation addresses . These are not your average crypto wallets. According to analysis shared by CryptoQuant contributor DarkPost, these addresses have specific hallmarks that scream “diamond hands.” They have no history of withdrawals , only repeated deposits. Furthermore, analysts filter out wallets linked to exchanges, miners, or smart contracts. This leaves a pure sample of wallets held by entities buying Bitcoin to hold, not to trade. The recent activity from these wallets is nothing short of remarkable. The December Surge: A Closer Look at the Numbers The data reveals a compelling narrative. Between December 1st and 10th, these long-term focused Bitcoin accumulation addresses added 75,000 BTC to their coffers. To put that in perspective, that’s over $3.2 billion worth of Bitcoin at current prices. Even more striking is the pace of buying. A whopping 40,000 BTC of that total was purchased in just a 48-hour window between December 9th and 10th. This concentrated buying spree has pushed the total holdings of this tracked cohort to approximately 315,000 BTC, and the trend reportedly continues. This action highlights several key points: Institutional Confidence: Large, sustained purchases suggest deep-pocketed investors see current prices as a strategic entry point. Supply Shock Potential: When Bitcoin is moved off exchanges into these cold storage wallets, it reduces the liquid supply available for trading. Long-Term Horizon: The very definition of these addresses implies the buyers are in it for the long haul, not short-term gains. Why Does This Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Matter for Investors? For everyday investors, this trend is a crucial data point. While price charts show volatility, the behavior of Bitcoin accumulation addresses can reveal underlying strength. Think of it as the difference between weather and climate. Daily price swings are the weather—unpredictable and noisy. Accumulation patterns are part of the climate—a longer-term trend that shapes the landscape. When entities with proven holding discipline are buying aggressively, it often precedes periods of price appreciation. However, it’s not a guaranteed short-term signal. Markets are complex, and accumulation is just one piece of the puzzle. Other factors like macroeconomic conditions and regulatory news still play a dominant role. Actionable Insights: How to Use This Information So, what can you do with this knowledge? First, don’t panic sell based on short-term dips if the long-term accumulation trend is strong. Second, consider your own strategy. Are you trading or accumulating? If your goal is long-term growth, adopting a similar mindset to these Bitcoin accumulation addresses —consistent buying regardless of daily noise—can be a powerful strategy. Finally, always diversify and never invest more than you can afford to lose. On-chain data like this is a powerful tool, but it should inform your decisions, not dictate them entirely. The Bottom Line on Bitcoin’s Accumulation Phase The aggressive buying by Bitcoin accumulation addresses in early December is a potent vote of confidence. It suggests that sophisticated players are positioning themselves for the next market phase, potentially anticipating a reduction in sell-side pressure and future scarcity. While past performance never guarantees future results, understanding where the coins are flowing provides a clearer picture than price alone. The silent accumulation by these steadfast wallets may well be writing the prologue to Bitcoin’s next major chapter. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a Bitcoin accumulation address? A1: It’s a wallet address identified by analysts as belonging to a long-term holder. Key criteria include having no withdrawal history, a pattern of repeated deposits, and no links to exchanges, miners, or smart contracts. Q2: Does this mean the Bitcoin price will go up immediately? A2: Not necessarily. Accumulation is a long-term bullish indicator, but short-term price is influenced by many other factors like news, regulations, and overall market sentiment. Q3: Who is behind these accumulation addresses? A3: It’s typically impossible to know the exact identity, but they are likely large investors, institutions, funds, or extremely committed individuals with a long-term investment thesis. Q4: How can I track Bitcoin accumulation trends myself? A4: You can use on-chain analytics platforms like CryptoQuant or Glassnode, which provide data and charts on exchange flows, holder behavior, and wallet cohorts. Q5: Is 75,000 BTC a lot? A5: Absolutely. It represents over $3.2 billion at current prices and is about 0.35% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply, which is a significant amount for one cohort to absorb in just 10 days. Q6: Should I start accumulating Bitcoin too? A6> That’s a personal financial decision. This data shows what large, disciplined investors are doing. If it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals, a dollar-cost averaging strategy can be a sensible approach. Found this analysis of Bitcoin accumulation addresses insightful?

The cryptocurrency market has witnessed the explosive rise of political meme coins, and none has captured attention quite like the TRUMP meme coin. As investors speculate about its future, the burning question emerges: Can $TRUMP really reach $50 by 2030? This comprehensive analysis examines the factors that could propel this controversial digital asset to unprecedented heights or send it crashing back to earth. What is the TRUMP Meme Coin? The TRUMP meme coin represents a unique fusion of cryptocurrency and political sentiment. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that focus on technological innovation, meme coins like $TRUMP derive their value primarily from community engagement, social media trends, and cultural relevance. The coin’s connection to former President Donald Trump creates a volatile mix of political enthusiasm and speculative trading that has captured both crypto enthusiasts and political supporters. Current Market Analysis of $TRUMP Understanding the TRUMP meme coin’s potential requires examining its current market position. The coin operates within the highly speculative meme coin sector, where prices can fluctuate dramatically based on social media trends, celebrity endorsements, and political developments. Key factors influencing its current valuation include: Community size and engagement levels Trading volume and liquidity metrics Political events and election cycles Overall cryptocurrency market sentiment Regulatory developments affecting meme coins TRUMP Meme Coin Price Prediction 2026 Looking ahead to 2026, several scenarios could unfold for the $TRUMP cryptocurrency price prediction. The coin’s performance will likely depend on multiple converging factors: Scenario Price Range Key Drivers Bullish $8-$15 Political victory, mainstream adoption, crypto bull market Moderate $3-$7 Steady community growth, moderate political relevance Bearish $0.50-$2 Regulatory crackdown, political setbacks, crypto winter 2027 Cryptocurrency Price Prediction for $TRUMP The 2027 outlook for the TRUMP meme coin becomes increasingly complex as political cycles and cryptocurrency market maturity intersect. By this point, the coin will have established either a sustainable niche or faded into obscurity. Critical considerations include: Potential integration with political fundraising mechanisms Development of utility beyond pure speculation Competition from other political meme coins Broader acceptance of cryptocurrency in political ecosystems Will $TRUMP Price Hit $50 by 2030? The $50 target represents an ambitious milestone that would require extraordinary circumstances. For the TRUMP meme coin to achieve this valuation, several conditions must align perfectly: First, the cryptocurrency market would need to enter a massive bull cycle, potentially driven by institutional adoption and regulatory clarity. Second, political developments would need to maintain or increase the coin’s relevance through the 2028 election cycle and beyond. Third, the meme coin would need to develop genuine utility or become integrated into political ecosystems in meaningful ways. While mathematically possible given cryptocurrency’s history of explosive growth, the $50 target represents an extreme outcome that would require unprecedented convergence of political and crypto market factors. Key Factors Influencing Meme Coin Analysis Successful meme coin analysis requires understanding the unique dynamics that drive this sector. Unlike traditional cryptocurrency evaluation based on fundamentals, meme coins operate on different principles: Social Media Virality: Twitter, Reddit, and TikTok trends can create overnight sensations Celebrity Endorsements: Public figures can dramatically impact prices with single posts Community Strength: Dedicated holders often determine long-term viability Market Timing: Alignment with broader crypto cycles amplifies effects Political Events: Elections, speeches, and policy announcements create volatility Risks and Challenges for Trump Cryptocurrency Investors Investing in the Trump cryptocurrency carries significant risks that every potential buyer must consider: The regulatory environment remains uncertain, with potential crackdowns on meme coins that could dramatically impact liquidity and accessibility. Political volatility creates unpredictable price swings that can wipe out positions quickly. The coin’s value remains almost entirely speculative, lacking the fundamental technological foundations of more established cryptocurrencies. Additionally, competition within the political meme coin space could fragment attention and capital. Comparative Analysis with Other Political Meme Coins The TRUMP meme coin exists within a growing ecosystem of politically-themed cryptocurrencies. Understanding its position requires comparison with similar assets: Coin Key Differentiator Market Position Risk Profile $TRUMP Direct political figure association Market leader in political coins Extremely high Other political coins Party or ideology focused Niche positions High Traditional meme coins Cultural or internet meme based Established communities Moderate to high Actionable Insights for $TRUMP Investors For those considering investment in the TRUMP meme coin, several strategic approaches may improve outcomes: First, allocate only risk capital you can afford to lose completely. Second, develop clear entry and exit strategies based on political calendars and crypto market cycles. Third, diversify within the meme coin sector rather than concentrating solely on $TRUMP. Fourth, stay informed about regulatory developments that could impact trading. Finally, maintain realistic expectations about the speculative nature of this investment. FAQs About TRUMP Meme Coin What makes the TRUMP meme coin different from other cryptocurrencies? The TRUMP meme coin derives its value primarily from political sentiment and community engagement rather than technological innovation or utility, making it more susceptible to political events and social media trends. How does political news affect $TRUMP price? Political developments, especially those involving Donald Trump , can create immediate and dramatic price movements. Positive news typically boosts the coin, while negative developments can trigger selloffs. Is $TRUMP considered a security by regulators? The regulatory status remains unclear. The Securities and Exchange Commission has increased scrutiny of meme coins, and any classification as a security would significantly impact trading. Can the TRUMP meme coin develop real utility? While currently speculative, potential utility could emerge through political fundraising, merchandise purchases, or exclusive access to events, though such developments remain uncertain. What are the tax implications of trading $TRUMP? Like other cryptocurrencies, $TRUMP transactions are typically subject to capital gains tax. Investors should consult with tax professionals familiar with both crypto and political donation regulations. Conclusion: The High-Stakes Future of Political Meme Coins The TRUMP meme coin represents one of the most fascinating experiments at the intersection of cryptocurrency and politics. While the path to $50 by 2030 appears challenging, the coin’s future will undoubtedly provide valuable insights into how digital assets interact with political movements. Investors must navigate this landscape with eyes wide open to both extraordinary opportunities and significant risks. The coming years will reveal whether political meme coins represent a lasting innovation or a passing phenomenon in the evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem.

The message gained interest because it focused on routine actions that allow customers to earn XRP without additional complexity. The central point was that the system functions through straightforward utility rather than promotional activity. XRP Rewards Through Direct Use Of Uphold Services In the video referenced in the post, Nancy Beaton outlined how users can earn XRP by engaging with Uphold’s existing features. She stated that users who choose to direct deposit part of their paycheck into their Uphold account can decide whether to spend through the Uphold card or trade on the platform. According to her explanation, doing so can provide up to 4% back in XRP. Combined with other reward mechanisms, she noted that users could potentially earn up to 10% back in XRP each month. Beaton emphasized that a segment of Uphold’s community consistently expresses interest in earning more XRP . She described the group as composed of committed digital asset users who frequently ask how they can generate returns on the asset through practical means. NANCY JUST NAILED IT The @UpholdInc CRO & CMO just explained $XRP rewards in the simplest, most real way. You pay, you live your life, and the #XRP comes back. No hype, no script, just utility that works. Sometimes the truth doesn’t need noise. pic.twitter.com/beSIpkuJpv — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) December 9, 2025 Introduction Of A New Partnership Focused On Yield Beaton also shared that Uphold plans to launch a partnership in the fourth quarter with the EXA Protocol, also known as the Exactly Protocol. This collaboration will expand options for users who want to lend their digital assets or access credit using their holdings as collateral. Through this product, users will be able to lend assets to a pool and earn yield in a structure similar to traditional DeFi lending models. She explained that the arrangement will also allow users to secure a credit card backed by their collateralized assets. This enables spending without liquidating holdings, while still maintaining the ability to earn yield. Importantly, XRP will be included among the supported assets, and Uphold intends to begin testing the feature in the fourth quarter before expanding availability to a wider user base. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Expectations Around Yield Rates When asked about the potential rates users might earn, Beaton clarified that the rates are not fixed. Because the product is based on a DeFi lending pool, yields can vary over time depending on market conditions. However, she noted that the lending side remains a meaningful opportunity for users looking to generate returns in ways that were not previously accessible on the platform. Squire’s post highlighted Beaton’s clear explanation of how everyday financial activity within the Uphold ecosystem can translate into tangible XRP rewards. Her comments also pointed to upcoming developments that may broaden earning options for users seeking yield while retaining control of their assets.

But between 2021 and 2025, this trust was repeatedly tested as major cloud providers experienced some of the most disruptive outages in their history — events that exposed the risks of centralization and triggered a structural shift in how organizations think about storage and resilience. Over several years, a series of major cloud failures signaled a growing dependence risk: 2021 (AWS): Regional outage disrupted Disney+, Netflix, Coinbase, DoorDash, and Ring services. 2022 (AWS): Additional failures froze airline reservations, banking dashboards, and logistics networks across North America. 2023 (GCP & Azure): Google Cloud networking outage affected Spotify, Snapchat, and payment processors, while Azure authentication issues locked enterprises out of critical systems. 2024 (Azure & GCP): Microsoft cloud misconfigurations brought down Teams, Outlook, and Office365; Google Cloud outages disrupted major fintech apps; government portals in Europe and the Middle East experienced downtime. 2025 (AWS, GCP, Azure): Multi-region AWS banking API failures, GCP storage breakdowns that halted enterprise AI workloads, and Azure identity service outages that left thousands unable to access internal systems. Together, these incidents made it clear that relying on a single cloud provider had become an unacceptable and increasingly costly operational risk. A structural awakening, primarily on the enterprise IT teams, was triggered by these events. The premise upon which the enterprise IT operations were built was fundamentally reviewed; the realization was that a centralized cloud architecture did not equate to operational continuity. The new consideration was not which cloud; rather, how to ensure their ecosystem would function in the face of failures from the larger cloud service providers (CSPs). This resulted in a definite change in the industry where multi-cloud shifted from optional to a necessity. With this change came a new interest in a previously niche approach, namely decentralized cloud storage. Decentralized networks such as StorX came to relevance not due to the hype of crypto, but because their design architecture exactly solved the problems that hyperscaler outages created. StorX fragments and encrypts data before distributing it to a worldwide network of independent nodes. No single operator, single region, or single datacenter control complete files, so outages or failures in a region can’t compromise access. Decentralized storage created geographical redundancy that was not dependent on a single corporate cloud, and so enterprises began to funnel in large media archives, compliance records, backup snapshots, training datasets, and unstructured files that previously routed into zero-tier storage. The efficiency and ease of connection that StorX offered to Google Workspace, LucidLink, Acronis, Veeam, Cloudinary, and S3 integrations for decentralized storage made it relatively easy and frictionless. Many CIOs viewed it as the missing piece that completed their multi-cloud system. With 2026 around the corner, many analysts expect decentralized storage to move from an emerging idea to a standard layer in cloud strategy. Research firms like IDC estimate that the global volume of data will reach well over 160–180 zettabytes by the end of 2025, driven by AI workloads, connected devices, and always-on digital services. At the same time, Gartner forecasts that more than half of multinational organizations will adopt some form of digital sovereignty or data-residency strategy by 2029, up from less than 10% today, as regulations tighten and jurisdictional risk becomes harder to ignore. Combined with forecasts showing strong double-digit growth in both cloud storage and AI-powered storage markets through the next decade, this points to a 2026 in which enterprises no longer optimize purely for convenience, but for resilience, sovereignty, and distributed architectures—conditions under which decentralized storage networks such as StorX are increasingly well positioned. (Source: Seagate , Gartner , CDInsights , Research and Markets , DataM Intelligence ) The last five years have proved, fragility is the consequence of centralization. The future of multi-cloud storage will be seamlessly integrated, distributed, and decentralized. Networks such as storX are at the center of that paradigm shift.

55674278,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=866070,1765519200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/55674278.jpeg,"Crypto Market Dips: The Reasons Behind Bitcoin Plunge Below $90,000 Despite FOMC Optimism",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/crypto-market-dips-the-reasons-behind-bitcoin-plunge-below-90000-despite-fomc-optimism/,"On Thursday, Bitcoin (BTC) once again fell below the critical $90,000 mark, even after what many had anticipated to be a bullish event stemming from the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) decision to cut rates by a quarter point. Analysts from Bull Theory note several factors contributing to this unexpected downturn. Bitcoin Sell-Off Amid Market Unease The analysts pointed out that the rate cut itself was largely anticipated by investors weeks prior, with a 95% probability already priced into the market. Ahead of the announcement, they identified that many positioned themselves in expectation of some form of liquidity support from the Fed, leading to a rally in Bitcoin prices. However, when the actual cut and the accompanying plan for $40 billion in monthly T-bill purchases were confirmed, many of these “whales”—large investors in the market—began to take profits. Related Reading: Strategy Calls For Withdrawal Of MSCI’s Exclusion Plan For Digital Asset Treasury Companies Adding to the market’s unease was Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s post-announcement press conference, where he highlighted persistent weaknesses in the labor market and ongoing inflation concerns. Furthermore, the Fed’s dot plot projections indicated the likelihood of only one additional rate cut in 2026. The situation was compounded by disappointing earnings results from Oracle, which reported its second quarter’s financials after the market’s close. The tech giant missed its adjusted revenue estimates, and higher capital expenditure projections led the stock to plunge by more than 11% in after-hours trading. This drop also negatively impacted US stock futures, as concerns grew that the artificial intelligence (AI) boom may be peaking. The widespread fear from Oracle’s results quickly spread from equities into the cryptocurrency space. Ultimately, all three factors converged to create a significant sell-off: the rate cut was already factored into the market, liquidity trades had been preemptively enacted, and Powell’s remarks did not provide the strong easing signal that some traders had hoped for. Positive Liquidity Conditions Expected In 2026 Interestingly, Bull Theory analysts assert that the crypto market’s recent decline is not indicative of a fundamental shift towards bearish conditions but rather an overreaction based on high expectations leading up to the Fed’s announcement. The Fed has now enacted rate cuts three times in as many meetings, and their plans to purchase $40 billion in T-bills over the next month are designed to inject liquidity into the markets. Moreover, Powell indicated that further rate hikes are not on the horizon as a base case, and forecasts for solid economic growth next year remain intact.

The current market movements illustrate that the dumping of assets was largely driven by overly optimistic expectations rather than any deterioration in underlying fundamentals. Looking ahead, the analysts believe that next year is expected to be more favorable for Bitcoin and broader crypto prices in terms of liquidity, contrasting sharply with the conditions projected for 2025.

Members of the House of Lords have launched a fierce opposition to the Bank of England’s proposed stablecoin holding limits , warning the plan could backfire spectacularly. This internal debate puts the UK’s ambition to become a global crypto hub directly in the crosshairs. What Are the Proposed Stablecoin Holding Limits? The Bank of England, as the UK’s central bank and financial regulator, previously outlined a plan to impose strict caps on how much stablecoin individuals and businesses can hold. Their proposal includes: A limit of £20,000 (approximately $25,300) for individual investors. A much higher, but still restrictive, cap of £10 million (around $12.7 million) for corporate holdings. The central bank’s stated goal is to mitigate systemic risk. They argue that without limits, a sudden loss of confidence in a major stablecoin could trigger widespread financial instability. However, critics now argue this defensive move could itself become a source of instability. Why Are UK Lords Sounding the Alarm? In a significant intervention, prominent members of the House of Lords, including financier Peter Cruddas, have written directly to Chancellor Rachel Reeves. Their core argument is stark: the proposed stablecoin holding limits are more likely to cause capital flight than prevent risk. They contend that by imposing such restrictive caps, the UK would inadvertently push innovative companies, investment, and talent to more welcoming jurisdictions like the European Union or Singapore. This would undermine the government’s own strategy to attract crypto business. The Lords are urging the Chancellor to oppose the Bank’s plan, framing it as a critical decision for the UK’s economic future. Could Limits Actually Increase Risk? This debate goes beyond simple policy disagreement. It touches on a fundamental question in crypto regulation: does strict control foster safety or fragility? The Lords’ position suggests that overly rigid stablecoin holding limits could have several unintended consequences: Driving Activity Underground: Users might seek unregulated, offshore alternatives with no consumer protections. Stifling Legitimate Use: Businesses relying on stablecoins for efficient cross-border payments could be hampered. Erooding Competitiveness: The UK could lose its first-mover advantage in establishing clear crypto rules. The fear is that by trying to wall off risk, the Bank might simply export both the risk and the opportunity elsewhere. What’s Next for UK Stablecoin Regulation? The ball is now in the court of the Chancellor and the government. They must weigh the Bank of England’s caution against the Lords’ warnings of economic self-sabotage. This tension highlights the delicate balance regulators worldwide are trying to strike. The outcome will send a powerful signal. Will the UK embrace a pragmatic approach that fosters innovation within a guarded framework? Or will precautionary principles lead to rules that the industry views as unworkable? The decision on these stablecoin holding limits will be a landmark moment, defining the UK’s regulatory character for years to come. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Crypto in Britain The opposition from the House of Lords throws a major curveball into the UK’s crypto regulatory journey. It exposes a deep rift between the instinct to control and the desire to compete. The proposed stablecoin holding limits are no longer just a technical consultation point; they have become a political litmus test. The government’s response will reveal whether “innovation-friendly” is a genuine commitment or just a slogan, ultimately determining if the UK can truly become the digital finance hub it aspires to be. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a stablecoin? A: A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to have a stable value, typically pegged to a reserve asset like the US dollar or a basket of assets. They are widely used for trading and transfers in the crypto ecosystem. Q2: Why does the Bank of England want to limit stablecoin holdings? A: The Bank of England is concerned about financial stability. They worry that if a widely held stablecoin failed, it could cause a cascade of losses across the financial system, similar to a bank run. Q3: What is the main argument against the holding limits? A: Opponents, like the UK Lords, argue the limits are too low and will drive businesses, investment, and innovation out of the UK to countries with more favorable regulations, harming the UK’s economic competitiveness. Q4: Has this policy been finalized? A: No, it has not. The Bank’s proposal is part of an ongoing consultation. The letter from the House of Lords is a formal attempt to influence the government, specifically the Chancellor, to reject the plan before it becomes law. Q5: How do other countries handle stablecoin limits? A: Approaches vary. The EU’s MiCA regulation does not set specific holding caps but imposes strict reserve and governance requirements on stablecoin issuers. The US is still developing its federal regulatory framework. Q6: What can individuals do if the limits are enacted? A: If enacted, individuals holding over £20,000 in stablecoins would likely need to move excess funds to a different asset or use multiple wallets/entities, though the latter might be restricted. The rules would necessitate careful portfolio management. Found this analysis of the UK’s stablecoin debate insightful?

With Rail now fully integrated, Ripple Payments emerges as the industry’s most comprehensive end-to-end stablecoin solution, unifying issuance, movement, compliance, liquidity, and settlement in one seamless ecosystem. No other stablecoin issuer or blockchain firm offers a comparably powerful, vertically integrated stack. Ripple has spent years engineering a future where stablecoins move effortlessly across borders and institutions. With Rail now integrated, that vision is fully in motion. Rail brings advanced compliance automation, seamless on/off-ramps, deeper fiat connectivity, and real-time transaction intelligence, the critical infrastructure needed to scale stablecoin adoption at an institutional level. Ripple’s latest milestone “makes us the end-to-end stablecoin leader,” a bold claim backed by real infrastructure. By combining RLUSD, its enterprise-grade stablecoin, with XRP’s high-speed settlement rails, Ripple has created a dual-asset, dual-network system built for maximum flexibility. Banks can issue their own stablecoins, fintechs can execute instant global payouts, and enterprises can access transparent, compliant settlement, all within a single, unified ecosystem that Ripple now controls from start to finish. This isn’t just an upgrade to Ripple’s product suite, it’s a fundamental reshaping of the competitive landscape. While most stablecoin issuers depend on external partners, fragmented integrations, and third-party compliance layers, Ripple now owns the full value chain, from minting to movement to final settlement. That vertical integration boosts efficiency, minimizes risk, and delivers the seamless experience institutional clients increasingly expect. Notably, the global demand for stablecoin infrastructure is surging, and traditional finance is racing toward tokenization, interoperability, and real-time value movement. Ripple’s timing is perfect. By integrating Rail’s infrastructure with its own global payment network and strong regulatory footprint, Ripple positions itself as the premier provider for institutions seeking a seamless, compliant bridge between digital assets and fiat systems. Therefore, Ripple’s acquisition of Rail is more than expansion, it’s a statement of intent. Ripple isn’t just joining the stablecoin race; it’s positioning itself to lead it. With the deal now officially closed, Ripple stands firmly at the center of the next era of global payments. Conclusion Ripple’s acquisition of Rail is more than an upgrade, it’s a fundamental reset of the global payments landscape. By consolidating every essential layer of stablecoin infrastructure under one platform, Ripple moves beyond competition and steps into the role of industry standard-setter. The combined force of RLUSD, XRP’s instant settlement network, and Rail’s compliance and fiat-connectivity stack forms a unified, institution-ready ecosystem built for scale. As markets accelerate toward tokenization and real-time settlement, Ripple is now uniquely positioned to lead that evolution.

For hundreds of investors in Japan, this became a stark reality last year. The National Tax Agency (NTA) has just announced a record-breaking collection from individual crypto investors, signaling a major crackdown. This move highlights the critical importance of understanding crypto taxes Japan regulations, whether you’re a local trader or watching from abroad. What’s the Big Deal About Japan’s Record Crypto Tax Haul? Japan’s National Tax Agency collected a staggering ¥4.6 billion, which is about $29.7 million, in back taxes from individual cryptocurrency investors. This figure comes from 613 separate tax audits conducted last year. Therefore, this represents a massive 31.4% increase compared to the previous year’s collections. The sheer scale of this enforcement action sends a clear message: the authorities are paying close attention. Moreover, this record haul demonstrates the growing maturity and scrutiny of the cryptocurrency market within the country’s financial ecosystem. How Does Japan Currently Tax Cryptocurrency Profits? Currently, Japan treats profits from cryptocurrency trading and investing as “miscellaneous income.” This classification has significant implications for investors. Here are the key points of the current system: Progressive Tax Rates: Profits are added to your total annual income and taxed at progressive rates. High Top Bracket: The tax rate can soar as high as 55%, including national and local inhabitant taxes. Reporting Burden: Investors must self-declare all crypto gains on their annual tax returns. This system, while lucrative for the tax agency, is often criticized for being overly burdensome and potentially discouraging investment. The high rates apply regardless of whether the gains are short-term trades or long-term investments. Why Is Japan’s Crypto Tax System Poised for Change? The record collection has intensified an ongoing debate. The Japanese government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party are actively pursuing a plan to overhaul the system. Their goal is to move cryptocurrency profits out of the “miscellaneous income” bracket. Instead, they propose a separate taxation category, similar to how stocks are treated. This potential reform aims to create a more favorable environment. A separate, flat tax rate could simplify filing and make Japan a more competitive hub for crypto innovation and investment. This push for change reflects a global trend where nations are balancing the need for tax revenue with the desire to foster technological advancement in the digital asset space. What Are the Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors? Japan’s situation offers crucial lessons for crypto investors everywhere. First, regulatory clarity is advancing rapidly. Tax authorities worldwide are enhancing their tools to track crypto transactions. Consequently, maintaining detailed records of all your trades, purchases, and sales is no longer optional—it’s essential. Second, understanding your local tax obligations is paramount. The rules for crypto taxes Japan are specific, but every country has its own approach. Proactive compliance is always cheaper and less stressful than facing a back-tax bill, penalties, or an audit later. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Regulation Japan’s record $29.7 million tax collection is more than just a headline. It is a watershed moment that underscores the end of the “wild west” era for cryptocurrencies. As the market matures, so does governmental oversight. For Japan, this enforcement surge coincides with a promising move toward a more rational and potentially investor-friendly tax framework. The global crypto community will be watching closely as these reforms develop, offering a potential blueprint for other nations. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How does Japan define “cryptocurrency” for tax purposes? A1: Japan’s tax authorities define cryptocurrency broadly as property values recorded electronically on an electronic device, which can be used to pay unspecified persons. This includes major coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as altcoins and tokens. Q2: Do I have to pay taxes on crypto if I only hold it and don’t sell? A2: Under Japan’s current rules, you generally only incur a tax liability when you realize a profit, such as by selling crypto for yen, trading it for another crypto, or using it to purchase goods or services. Q3: What happens if a crypto investor in Japan doesn’t declare their profits? A3: Failure to declare can result in the NTA conducting an audit, issuing a bill for back taxes owed plus interest, and imposing additional penalties. The recent record collection shows the NTA is actively enforcing these rules. Q4: When might Japan’s proposed separate crypto tax system take effect? A4: While the ruling party is pushing for change, no official implementation date has been set. Tax reforms typically require legislative processes, so any new system would likely be announced well in advance of taking effect. Q5: Are losses on cryptocurrency investments deductible in Japan? A5: Currently, under the miscellaneous income classification, crypto losses cannot be deducted from other types of income (like salary). However, they can be carried forward for three years to offset future crypto profits. Q6: How can crypto investors in Japan ensure they are compliant? A6: Investors should keep meticulous, timestamped records of every transaction, use reputable exchanges that provide transaction histories, and consider consulting with a tax professional in Japan who understands cryptocurrency regulations.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-says-xrp-is-built-for-this-heres-why/,"XRP-focused Market Strategist Levi Rietveld used a recent video of the JPMorgan Chase CEO to emphasize that the financial system is moving toward technologies designed for efficient, high-volume transactions. The developments described by the banking executive align closely with the type of infrastructure XRP was created to support, and he highlighted this connection directly. $XRP is built for this!! pic.twitter.com/cuifMdg7xC — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) December 9, 2025 What the JPMorgan CEO Highlighted In the clip, the JPMorgan CEO discussed the scale at which the bank already operates. He explained that the institution recently moved sixteen trillion dollars in a single day through its compliance, fraud, sanctions, and risk systems. He described these systems as fast and cost-effective, emphasizing that the bank usually relies on technology to improve transaction efficiency for clients. From there, he turned to tokenization and blockchain. He stated that tokenization is real and becoming increasingly effective as the industry finds ways to make it faster and more cost-effective. He acknowledged that both permissioned and non-permissioned designs are now proving useful, and he said smart contracts are likely to become a practical component of future financial infrastructure. He also confirmed that JPMorgan is working on initiatives related to stablecoin. According to him, the bank already has a tokenized deposit model in place, which functions like a digital representation of a deposit.

He explained that if these tools allow the bank to deliver better, faster, and cheaper services, they will be used. How Levi Rietveld Interpreted the Remarks Rietveld framed these comments as evidence that major financial institutions are now openly embracing the type of technology that supports rapid settlement and high-volume processing. He pointed to the executive’s statements on speed, cost efficiency, and tokenized payment systems as a reflection of the direction the industry is taking. In his view, the characteristics described by the CEO align with the technical strengths of XRP . Rietveld emphasized that XRP is designed to handle fast, low-cost transactions and is built with the throughput required for modern settlement systems. By linking the CEO’s statements to XRP’s capabilities, he suggested that XRP fits naturally into the environment these institutions are moving toward, one with solutions that provide speed , efficiency, and scalability.

Key Takeaways: Binance froze only 17% of the stolen Upbit funds despite an urgent request from police and the exchange. Hackers used complex laundering tactics across multiple chains, with most funds eventually reaching Binance service wallets. Korean experts say faster, coordinated freeze mechanisms are needed to limit losses in future attacks. According to investigators, only 17% of the assets flagged for freezing were actually locked down, local news outlets reported on Friday . Security analysts tracking the breach say the hacking group behind the attack used an elaborate laundering strategy on the morning of November 27, quickly scattering the stolen assets across more than a thousand wallets. Binance Froze Only 17% of Upbit Hack Funds The attackers repeatedly broke the funds into smaller portions, moved them through multiple chains, and relied on token bridges and swaps to obscure the trail. Most of the laundered assets eventually landed in service wallets on Binance, authorities said. Upbit and police requested an immediate freeze on roughly 470 million won (about $370,000) worth of Solana confirmed to have hit Binance. However, the exchange froze only 80 million won (about $75,000), saying it needed additional verification before taking broader action. The freeze was confirmed around midnight on the day of the incident, roughly 15 hours after the original request. When questioned by Korean broadcaster KBS about the limited scope of the freeze and the delay, Binance declined to address specifics, citing its policy around active investigations. Upbit got hacked and paused withdrawals, but Koreans are pumping alts since arbitrage bots are no longer running. pic.twitter.com/Y1AnRDqrgz — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) November 27, 2025 The exchange said only that it “continues to cooperate with the relevant authorities and partners in accordance with appropriate procedures.” That explanation has not satisfied experts in South Korea. Cho Jae-woo, director of Hansung University’s Blockchain Research Institute, argued that rapid intervention is essential to minimize losses. “To prevent damage from hacking, a swift initial freeze is essential, but exchanges often cite litigation risks as an excuse for being hesitant,” he said. He added that the industry should consider establishing a global emergency hotline between exchanges or a coordinated body empowered to impose immediate freezes in crisis situations. Investigators say most of the stolen assets have since been converted from Solana to Ethereum, a move likely aimed at improving liquidity given Ethereum’s deep markets. Upbit Moves 99% of Customer Assets to Cold Storage After $30M Hack As reported, Upbit is shifting nearly all customer assets into cold storage after hackers stole 44.5 billion won (about $30 million) from its Solana hot wallet, marking one of the strongest security responses yet by a major exchange. Operator Dunamu said the platform will raise its cold wallet ratio to 99% and reduce hot wallet exposure to effectively zero, far above South Korea’s legal requirement that 80% of user funds be stored offline. The exchange already held 98.33% of assets in cold storage at the end of October, the highest among domestic platforms, but accelerated its overhaul following the breach. Meanwhile, South Korean authorities have launched an investigation, and local reports have cited early intelligence assessments that allegedly connect the intrusion to North Korea’s Lazarus Group.

The upgrade has enabled Venmo-like send, deposit and withdraw cryptocurrency within the World Wallet and virtual accounts. The new World App: secure chat, global payments and Mini Apps for everyone. pic.twitter.com/MzmwB8djjb — World (@worldcoin) December 11, 2025 The new App supports USDC, EURC and wrapped Bitcoin, Ethereum, and additionally supports 100+ cryptocurrency tokens, the Thursday announcement read. World ‘Super App’: End-to-End Encryption, Crypto Integration World formally launched its app in 2023 and said at the time that the mission is to provide tools to verify human identity in an era of AI manipulation. The app upgrade was revealed on Thursday at World’s headquarters in San Francisco, where Altman and World co-founder and CEO Alex Blania briefly spoke about the innovations. Developers termed the new upgrade a “super app” before the product team explained its features. “It’s really hard to identify unique people while preserving privacy,” said Altman, a Mezha report noted . To ensure conversation privacy, the chat messages display blue bubbles for “verified humans” and gray bubbles for those who haven’t verified. Further, profile photos are checked against the Orb image stored on the user’s device. World App Updates With Virtual Bank Accounts and Expanded Crypto Features In May, World launched its iris-scanning project to US customers . The process involves users scanning their face and iris in about 30 seconds, creating a unique “IrisCode” to verify their identity. Besides, the World already functions as a digital wallet; however, the new version introduces virtual bank accounts. “Users can receive their salary directly in the World App, make deposits from bank accounts, after which funds can be converted into cryptocurrency,” the report added. Besides swap and trade across more than 100 supported assets, World Chain native tokens and a RWA assets like tokenized gold are also available, the company said in the statement. The new version of the app underscores the firm’s intention to expand partnerships and build a more integrated ecosystem focused on the ease of crypto usage.

XRP Transaction Fee Has Dropped To 650 Tokens Per Day In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed the latest trend in the Total Transaction Fees indicator for XRP. This metric measures, as its name suggests, the amount of fees that senders on the XRP network attach to their transactions every day. On blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the transaction fee goes to the network validator who added the associated move to the next block. In the case of BTC, the network runs on a consensus mechanism called the proof-of-work (PoW) , with validators called miners competing against each other using computational resources to get the chance to add the next block to the chain. While for ETH, validators known as stakers handle consensus by locking in an ETH amount known as the “stake.” This mechanism is known as the proof-of-stake (PoS) . XRP takes an approach that differs from both digital asset giants. In the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol, network validators maintain a list of other validators that they trust. Validators propose and vote on transactions, with consensus being reached when more than 80% of trusted nodes agree on the validity of the transactions. The key difference is that in this system, there are no block/staking rewards, and validators aren’t compensated with transaction fees, either. Instead, the fee that users pay is destroyed. This means that every time a transaction occurs, a tiny part of the asset’s supply exits from circulation. While the destination of the transaction fees is different for XRP when compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, the network dynamics can still be similar. In other words, high traffic can push the Total Transaction Fees metric up, while low activity periods can lead to a drop in it. Now, here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the 90-day simple moving average (SMA) of the XRP Total Transaction Fees over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP Total Transaction Fees witnessed a surge to an extreme level in early 2025. Users were paying 5,900 tokens per day as transfer fees at the peak of this explosion in February. Since then, however, the blockchain has witnessed a rapid decline in the indicator. Today, the network is witnessing just 650 tokens per day in fees, reflecting a decrease of about 89% from the February high. The 90-day SMA Total Transaction Fees haven’t been this low for the asset since December 2020. XRP Price XRP has gone downhill during the last couple of days as its price has returned to the $2.00 level.",XRP|XRP Activity|XRP Fees|XRP Transaction Fees|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-12 07:00:49

His latest update ties together gold’s renewed monetary role, the weakening of traditional debt-based assets, and the growing importance of compliant digital assets such as XRP . The video shared includes commentary from a former BlackRock portfolio manager, explaining how these developments are shaping a new global financial structure. Former BlackRock portfolio manager says gold is money. I couldn't agree more. We’re moving toward a hybrid collateral model with gold as neutral collateral and XRP as the neutral settlement layer moving value across borders. Watch how it’s being done: https://t.co/hFnfkQxJxt pic.twitter.com/YfpXg8hMHu — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) December 10, 2025 Gold Reclaims a Central Role in Global Finance The update begins with the former BlackRock portfolio manager explaining that gold has effectively become money again after being restored as a tier-one asset under Basel III standards. He notes that this shift is now reflected in U.S. banks and has been underway globally for years. His view is that the world is nearing the end of a long economic cycle, and major institutions are preparing for the eventual transition to a new monetary system. Aljarrah builds on this by pointing out that gold crossing $4,000 is not a short-term event but part of a broader structural change. He highlights that banks now hold more gold than U.S. Treasuries, which signals a significant move away from paper-based debt instruments. He also notes that the U.S. dollar has already lost over 8% of its purchasing power this year, calling it a clear sign of ongoing erosion. According to Aljarrah, the bond market—once the foundation of global stability—is now under serious strain, and this is why regulators have repositioned gold as a zero-risk, tier-one asset. He argues that gold is being reintroduced into the monetary system as collateral rather than simply an investment. How Gold and Digital Assets Converge The core of Aljarrah’s message is that the world is shifting toward a hybrid financial model in which physical assets, such as gold, form the collateral base, as compliant digital assets provide the infrastructure for global settlement. He notes that institutions such as the World Gold Council, IMF, BIS, and World Bank have all acknowledged the same direction: a system where tokenized assets , stablecoins, and central bank reserves operate within an interoperable digital framework. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Aljarrah identifies XRP as the digital asset best positioned for this role. He describes XRP as the institutional layer of the new system, supporting fast and efficient cross-border settlement and enabling liquidity without the need for pre-funded accounts. He explains that RippleNet provides the infrastructure, while XRP acts as the settlement mechanism that moves value across borders. He also places XLM as the retail layer, designed for accessibility and global inclusion, and SHX as the infrastructure layer linking digital finance with regulated fiat on-ramps. Together, he says, they form a three-part structure capable of supporting a fully integrated financial ecosystem. Where the Transition Is Heading Aljarrah concludes that gold’s rise toward $5,000 is part of a long-term trend driven by structural pressures, not speculation. He maintains that the ongoing shift reflects a financial system that is moving back toward tangible value while adopting digital rails for global settlement. In this framework, gold serves as neutral collateral, and compliant digital assets provide the speed and interoperability needed for modern finance.

That’s the surprising reality on the Solana blockchain today. However, a revolutionary proposal aims to change everything. Anza, a core development firm for Solana, has put forward a plan to drastically reduce Solana account creation fees by a staggering 90%. This move could unlock a wave of dormant SOL and fundamentally improve network accessibility for everyone. What’s the Big Deal About Solana Account Creation Fees? To understand the impact, you first need to know how Solana works. Every program, token, or NFT on the network requires a dedicated data storage space called an “account.” Creating this account isn’t free; it costs a small fee in SOL. While these Solana account creation fees are designed to prevent spam and secure the network, they’ve created an unintended consequence. Brennan Watt, Vice President of Core Engineering at Anza, identified a critical issue. He proposed SIMD-0389, which suggests cutting the current fee from 0.0015 SOL to just 0.00015 SOL. Why such a drastic cut? The answer lies in dormant assets. How Can Lower Fees Unlock Dormant SOL? Here’s the clever part of the proposal. Many users have tiny amounts of SOL trapped in old or unused accounts. The current fee to create a new account and recover or move these funds is often higher than the value of the SOL itself. Therefore, it’s not worth the cost to reclaim them. This leaves SOL effectively lost forever. By slashing the Solana account creation fees by 10x, the economic barrier disappears. Suddenly, it becomes viable to: Recover lost or forgotten SOL from old wallets and accounts. Consolidate tiny balances into a single, usable amount. Encourage more experimentation with new dApps and tokens without a high upfront cost. Watt argues this change would enable the recovery of dormant SOL without compromising the network’s security—a true win-win scenario. What Are the Broader Benefits for the Solana Ecosystem? This proposal is about more than just cleaning up digital couch cushions. A significant reduction in Solana account creation fees has profound implications for the entire ecosystem’s health and growth. First, it dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for new users and developers. Building on Solana becomes cheaper and less risky. Second, it improves capital efficiency by bringing “dead” SOL back into circulation, increasing liquidity. Finally, it demonstrates responsive governance, where core developers listen to community pain points and propose practical, data-driven solutions. What’s Next for the Fee Reduction Proposal? The proposal, SIMD-0389, is now in the hands of the Solana community. Key stakeholders, including validators and major dApp developers, will review and debate it. The process highlights the decentralized nature of blockchain governance. If adopted, the change would be implemented in a future network upgrade, potentially unlocking value for countless users. This move could set a precedent for other blockchains struggling with similar issues of accessibility and dormant assets. It shows that sustainable growth often comes from fine-tuning economic parameters, not just chasing raw performance. Conclusion: A Small Fee Change with a Massive Impact Anza’s proposal to cut Solana account creation fees is a masterclass in pragmatic blockchain engineering. It addresses a real user problem, unlocks tangible economic value, and strengthens the network’s foundation—all with a single, well-calibrated adjustment. This isn’t just about saving a few cents; it’s about making the Solana ecosystem more inclusive, efficient, and resilient for its next chapter of growth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Anza’s role in the Solana ecosystem? A1: Anza is a key development and maintenance firm spun out from Solana Labs. It focuses on core engineering, client development (like the Agave validator client), and proposing improvements to the network’s protocol and economics. Q2: What is SIMD-0389? A2: SIMD-0389 is the formal proposal number for the suggested 10x reduction in the Solana account rent-exempt minimum fee. SIMD stands for Solana Improvement Document, which is the standard process for suggesting changes to the network. Q3: Will lowering fees make Solana less secure? A3: According to the proposal’s author, Brennan Watt, the reduction is carefully calculated to still deter spam and malicious account creation while removing the economic barrier for legitimate users. The core security model remains intact. Q4: How much dormant SOL could this unlock? A4: While an exact figure is hard to pinpoint, estimates suggest billions of dollars worth of SOL could be trapped in uneconomical accounts. This change would make recovering those funds feasible. Q5: When will this change happen? A5: There is no set timeline. The proposal must go through community discussion, technical review, and ultimately be voted on and adopted by network validators before being included in a scheduled upgrade. Q6: Do I need to do anything to recover my dormant SOL? A6: If the proposal passes, you would need to use a compatible wallet or tool that allows you to interact with the old account and pay the new, lower fee to create the necessary accounts to move your funds.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now on the radar of traders as a potentially spectacular player having already proved high early token appreciation and just behind the curtain of Phase 6. What Investors Are Watching Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum finance is developing a decentralized loaning protocol that has two interlocked markets. The Peer to Contract market is a market in which users provide their assets lent out in the form of either ETH or USDT and get issued with mtTokens. Repayment of interest by borrowers leads to an increment of these mtTokens. Peer to Peer market provides direct access to borrowers. The rates of borrowing vary with liquidity. Borrowing remains affordable when there is a high level of liquidity. Increased rates arise when the liquidity becomes weak. Loan to value regulations provide threshold limits of collateral security. Liquidation can take place in case of a large decline of collateral. Partial payment of debt is made by the liquidators who obtain discounted collateral. This is used to safeguard the system in a fast moving market. Price Performance and Lifting Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launched in early 2025 at a price of $0.01. The token currently has a price of $0.035, which is 250% token appreciation. The project has gathered $19.250M in the form of funds, which grew to 18,500 holders and sold 815M MUTM. The total supply is 4B, out of which 1.82B records are corresponding to 45.5% of the presale stages. Phase 6 already has above 96% allocated with 4% of the tokens remaining at the present price prior to the Phase 7 rise. The next crypto phase will increase the price of the token by close to 20%. Phase 1 purchasers are positioned for 500% MUTM appreciation on listing given the official launch valuation at $0.06. Everyday activity is also very high with a 24 hour leaderboard where the best contributor wins $500 in MUTM. This constant inflow of involvement makes this project observable and appeals to users who track trends of buying now in the cryptocurrency activities. V1 Testnet Mutuum Finance had confirmed in its official X account that V1 testnet would be operational in Q4 2025. V1 consists of the lending pool, mtTokens, liquidation and the debt engine. The initial supported assets will be Eth and USDT. This will be a point at which the development ends and live testing starts; this will also be the point at which the need is likely to go up as the users start to interact with the lending system. Security preparation is significant in the traction of the project. The CertiK audit of Mutuum Finance has a 90/100 score on the Token Scan. Halborn Security is considering contract behavior in various conditions of liquidity as well as collateral. There is a $50K bug bounty on third-party testing to identify code edge cases until V1. Due to this auditing depth and indications of a pre-emerging trend, some analysts assessing crypto predictions believe Mutuum Finance could be left with the basis of an excellent growth when borrowing commences. It has been estimated that the token might end up between 5x to 7x in case it is adopted as per expectations over the initial entire activity cycle of the token. Long-Term Upside Potential Mutuum Finance focuses on producing a USD-pegged stablecoin that uses the interest of borrowers according to the official roadmap. Stablecoins are beneficial in the lending market since they minimise volatility and the number of people who can take up loans. They also can enhance the liquidity that can enhance the mtToken yield system-wide. The project also intends to increase over layer-2 networks. L2 implementation reduces the costs and enhances processing speed. The lending policies should be updated rapidly on the collateral terms and liquidation instruments. Mutuum Finance has a competitive edge in the imminent scaling with wider integration in DeFi. The industry analysts who model the long-term performance are of the view that these upgrades could make a difference of an 8x to 10x MUTM growth by 2027 in case users activity increases with the adoption of stablecoins and expansion of lending volume. The project is in one of the critical stages. The window of early entry is narrowing with 4% of the tokens still at the current levels of $0.035. Mutuum Finance is capable of card payment which means onboarding is easy with new users. As V1 approaches, the growing popularity of the project, increased attention to the development and the review of the security, the project is taking leading positions in the list of the potential best crypto coins to buy in the next cycle. At the current rate, Mutuum Finance might not last beneath $0.04 pretty soon, with Phase 7 and the $0.06 launch price in proximity.

However, apart from a few cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, the crypto market, as a dollar-denominated offshore equity-like market, struggles to compete with precious metals and stock indices due to investors' limited risk appetite. Therefore, further reducing its allocation may be a better option. A Not-So-Dovish Decision Yesterday, the Federal Reserve announced the outcome of its final FOMC meeting of the year. Although officials delivered a rate cut for the third consecutive meeting, there is unusual discord within the ranks regarding whether inflation or the labour market poses the greater concern. Consequently, officials have signalled little appetite for further easing. Public comments from Fed officials in recent weeks reveal a committee so deeply divided that the final decision may well hinge on how Chair Powell chooses to steer the ship. With Powell's tenure set to expire next May, he will preside over only three more FOMC meetings. Sticky price pressures coupled with a cooling labour market present the Fed with an invidious trade-off—a dilemma not encountered in decades. During the ""stagflation"" era of the 1970s, when faced with a similar predicament, the Fed's ""stop-start"" response allowed high inflation to become entrenched. Against this backdrop, several Fed actions warrant close attention: firstly, the removal of the aggregate cap on the Standing Repo Facility (SRF); and secondly, the purchase of Treasury bills (T-bills)—and, if necessary, other US Treasuries with a remaining maturity of up to three years—to maintain ample reserves. The Fed's objective is crystal clear: it is not to provide premium liquidity for equity and crypto markets but to stabilise short-term liquidity levels within the banking system and alleviate market shortages. The projected purchase of $40 billion in T-bills this month, combined with the relaxation of the SRF, objectively helps to steady equity markets, yet is unlikely to fuel a broad-market rally comparable to that of 2021. Powell also emphasised that current T-bill purchases are solely for ""reserve management,"" implying the primary aim of the Fed's balance sheet expansion is to maintain stability, not to unleash further liquidity to stimulate the economy and asset prices. What is the Smart Money Thinking? In the rates market, traders are pricing in more conservative expectations than they were before the FOMC meeting. Markets now anticipate only two cuts in 2026, of 25bps each, with no further easing expected until January 2028, leaving the terminal rate hovering around 3.4%. Bond market pricing is even more explicit: since late October, only yields on Treasuries with maturities under three years have fallen, whilst the 10-year yield remains stubbornly above 4.1%, and T-bond yields have actually risen significantly. This implies that long-term financing costs remain elevated, and riskier markets and assets will continue to face a liquidity drought for the foreseeable future. Source: CME Group Source: ustreasuryyieldcurve.com In the crypto options market, traders' long-term bearish stance on BTC ( BTC-USD ) and ETH ( ETH-USD ) has not shifted; if anything, it has entrenched. Bullish sentiment is confined to short-term speculation in 0DTE options. Notably, the previously persistent far-month bullishness for ETH has evaporated, with sentiment shifting into ""neutral-to-bearish"" territory. This suggests that traders view ETH's short-term rebounds not as a reflection of improving fundamentals, but rather as a product of speculative flows. Given that ETH's implied forward yield sits at just 3.51%—compared to roughly 4.85% for BTC—current valuations do not represent a ""reasonable investment proposition"" for institutions, whilst BTC is viewed, at best, as a ""hold"". Source: Amberdata Derivatives So, What is the Trade? For the crypto market, the Fed's stance is hardly welcome news. In the current environment, sustained, large-scale rallies rely more on a deluge of long-term liquidity than on short-term relief measures. Meanwhile, elevated long-term rates will keep long-term investors cautious and on the sidelines, leaving price action to be dictated primarily by short-term speculators. Short-term rebounds and long-term bearish expectations will coexist. For assets where traditional institutional pricing power is dominant (BTC, XRP ( XRP-USD ), SOL ( SOL-USD )), long-term bearish expectations will continue to weigh on prices. However, for assets where institutional influence is weaker (such as ETH and altcoins), leverage-induced short-term rallies will drive price movements. Therefore, incorporating far-month put protection for crypto assets remains a prudent strategy. However, the cost of hedging warrants reconsideration. Yields from the crypto carry trade can no longer cover the cash flow requirements for put protection. Consequently, holding assets that are still in a robust uptrend (e.g., the ""Mag 7"") and using their gains to fund ""insurance premiums"" appears to be a sound approach. The beta of the Mag 7 is typically lower than that of BTC and ETH, meaning that when equities rise, their gains can offset option premiums. Conversely, if markets fall, the higher sensitivity of crypto assets means that far-month puts will generate superior returns. Of course, reducing exposure to crypto risk is also essential. With BTC's implied forward yield now virtually indistinguishable from T-bond yields, holding crypto assets per se offers little comparative advantage. If one must maintain long exposure, consider the following structures: Risk Reversal : Use a portion of previous profits to enter a risk reversal structure expiring in 30-60 days (i.e., sell a put and buy a call with the closest absolute delta), whilst retaining ample cash. Roll Over : Once the price rises significantly and appropriate gains are secured (at the investor's discretion), roll the position over. Capture the Skew : If price movement is muted, investors can still profit from the spread between the two options near expiry due to the significant negative skew before rolling over. Buy the Dip : If prices fall significantly, use the cash collateral to accumulate the underlying asset at lower levels. The implied forward yield of ETH has not been as good as that of T-bills. (Source: Amberdata Derivatives) Furthermore, considering the risk of USD depreciation, holding Euros as a cash reserve is a proper alternative. With the Fed still in a cutting cycle, the Euro's long-term outlook remains constructive. Simultaneously, as European inflation shows signs of a slight rebound, the ECB is likely to lean towards holding rates steady, whilst the Bank of Japan may intervene to sell USD to combat a weak Yen and inflation. This significantly increases the probability of the Euro appreciating in the near term. In summary, the rate cut has not fundamentally altered the crypto landscape. Any sharp rally lacking fundamental support should be viewed as a risk rather than an opportunity. Closely monitoring leverage indicators, such as open interest, and tightening risk parameters may be the optimal strategy for navigating this uncertain festive season. Adopting a defensive posture is also advisable. After all, in this market, ""survival"" takes precedence over betting on a ""Santa rally"".

At the Solana Breakpoint global conference, the team announced plans to bring XRP to Solana through Hex Trust and LayerZero. These partners will bridge and issue Wrapped XRP (wXRP), unlocking deep liquidity and expanding XRP’s role in decentralized finance. Integration with Solana promises faster transactions, lower costs, and access to a thriving DeFi ecosystem, creating new opportunities for investors and developers alike. Solana’s integration of XRP highlights a key trend in crypto: pairing established digital assets with high-performance blockchains to boost liquidity and utility. As a trusted settlement and bridge currency, XRP’s move to Solana could accelerate adoption across DeFi, including lending, staking, and decentralized trading. This major update follows Solana’s playful engagement with the XRP community earlier in the week, from a Monday post featuring the beloved “589” to nods at the iconic “flipping the switch” meme. These cultural touches underscore Solana’s strategy of merging technical innovation with community excitement. Beyond fun interactions, the collaboration signals a powerful convergence of two established networks: XRP’s proven reliability and deep liquidity combined with Solana’s high throughput and scalability. Analysts note that this synergy could boost transaction efficiency, unlock new DeFi opportunities, and draw both institutional and retail participants to the combined ecosystem. As wXRP launches on Solana, it will be important to track liquidity and DeFi adoption closely. By bringing XRP into Solana’s high-speed ecosystem, this cross-chain collaboration could redefine how digital assets move, settle, and interact across blockchains. Conclusion XRP landing on Solana is a watershed for cross-chain DeFi. Deploying wXRP on Solana marks a pivotal step in blockchain interoperability. By combining XRP’s long-standing liquidity and reliability with Solana’s low-latency, high-throughput architecture, this move unlocks new cross-chain utility, expands DeFi possibilities, and promises materially improved transaction efficiency, creating fertile ground for developers, investors, and the broader crypto ecosystem.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|SOL|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-12 07:31:44

This finalized deal, first announced in August, is far more than a simple purchase. It represents a strategic masterstroke, granting Ripple direct control over a network that processes a staggering 10% of all global B2B stablecoin payments. For anyone tracking the evolution of institutional crypto, this Ripple acquisition is a watershed moment. Why is the Ripple Acquisition of Rail Such a Big Deal? To understand the impact, you must look at what Rail brings to the table. The startup isn’t just another fintech player; it’s a critical piece of infrastructure. By specializing in B2B stablecoin payments, Rail provides the reliable, compliant rails that large companies need to move value. Therefore, this Ripple acquisition instantly plugs Ripple into a massive, existing flow of enterprise capital. It’s a classic case of buying market share and expertise, not just technology. Building an Empire: Ripple’s 2024 Acquisition Spree This is not an isolated event. The Rail deal is the latest in a series of strategic purchases by Ripple this year, each carefully chosen to build a comprehensive financial ecosystem. Let’s break down their acquisition strategy: Hidden Road (now Ripple Prime): Acquired to offer prime brokerage services, catering to institutional traders and funds. GTreasury: A corporate finance SaaS provider, bringing deep treasury management and risk tools into Ripple’s fold. Palisade: A crypto wallet and custody firm, securing the vital ‘last mile’ of asset storage for clients. When you connect these dots, a clear picture emerges. Ripple is systematically assembling a full-stack, institutional-grade platform for digital asset management and cross-border payments. The Ripple acquisition of Rail is the keystone, providing the high-volume payment network that makes the entire ecosystem viable. What Does This Mean for the Future of Enterprise Crypto? The implications are profound. For businesses, Ripple is now positioned to offer a one-stop-shop: from treasury management with GTreasury, to secure custody with Palisade, to prime brokerage services, all connected by Rail’s efficient B2B payment network and settled on Ripple’s ledger. This level of integration promises to reduce friction, cost, and complexity for corporations exploring digital assets. However, challenges remain. Regulatory clarity, especially in the U.S., continues to be a headwind for Ripple. Furthermore, integrating multiple acquired companies into a seamless culture and product suite is a monumental operational task. The success of this Ripple acquisition strategy hinges on execution. Conclusion: A Calculated Leap Towards Dominance Ripple’s finalized purchase of Rail is a powerful statement of intent. It moves the company beyond its origins as a cross-border payment protocol for banks and into the heart of global corporate finance. By acquiring Rail, Ripple doesn’t just add a service; it captures a significant portion of the existing stablecoin payment market. This strategic masterstroke, combined with its other 2024 acquisitions, positions Ripple as perhaps the most vertically integrated player serving institutional crypto needs. The race to build the foundational plumbing for the future of finance is intensifying, and Ripple has just laid down a formidable piece of track. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly did Ripple acquire in the Rail deal? A1: Ripple acquired Rail, a stablecoin startup that specializes in processing business-to-business (B2B) payments. Notably, Rail’s network handles about 10% of all global B2B stablecoin payment volume. Q2: How much did Ripple pay for Rail? A2: The acquisition was finalized for $200 million. The deal was first announced in August and has now been officially closed. Q3: Why is this acquisition important for Ripple’s business? A3: This acquisition gives Ripple direct access to a massive, existing stream of enterprise payments. It is a key piece in Ripple’s strategy to build a comprehensive platform for institutional crypto services, complementing its other recent acquisitions in custody, treasury management, and prime brokerage. Q4: What other companies has Ripple acquired recently? A4: In 2024, prior to Rail, Ripple acquired prime brokerage firm Hidden Road (renamed Ripple Prime), corporate finance SaaS provider GTreasury, and crypto custody firm Palisade. Q5: How does this affect XRP, Ripple’s native cryptocurrency? A5> While the acquisition focuses on stablecoin payments, a more robust and widely adopted Ripple enterprise network could increase overall utility and demand for its underlying infrastructure, potentially benefiting XRP’s long-term ecosystem value. However, the direct impact on XRP’s price is not immediately defined. Q6: Does this mean Ripple is moving away from XRP? A6> No, not necessarily. Ripple’s strategy appears to be expanding its offerings to serve enterprise clients with multiple tools. XRP remains a core part of its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution for cross-border payments. The new acquisitions add complementary services to its portfolio. Found this deep dive into Ripple’s strategic masterstroke insightful?

The CFTC opened the door for BTC, ETH, and USDC to serve as regulated collateral in derivatives markets. DTCC secured SEC approval to tokenize U.S. securities with full shareholder rights. Major financial institutions began introducing more specialized Bitcoin-linked products. The CFTC’s new pilot program allows select firms to use BTC ( BTC-USD ), ETH ( ETH-USD ), and USDC ( USDC-USD ) as regulated collateral in U.S. derivatives markets, a shift that is expected to create a new steady source of demand for BTC and ETH. The core financial infrastructure provider DTCC has received SEC approval to launch a tokenization service that will allow U.S. securities to be issued on approved blockchains with full legal rights and protections. Traditional finance firms are beginning to roll out more specialized Bitcoin-linked products, such as JPMorgan’s structured IBIT note and the proposed AfterDark ETF. CFTC Opens Door to Digital Asset Collateral in Derivatives Markets The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has launched a pilot program that, for the first time, allows bitcoin, ether, and certain stablecoins such as USDC to be posted as collateral in U.S. derivatives markets. The pilot is limited to futures commission merchants that meet specific eligibility standards. Participating firms may accept approved digital assets as margin for futures and swaps but must adhere to heightened operational requirements. For the first three months, weekly disclosures on digital asset holdings are mandatory, along with immediate notification to the CFTC if any custody or risk issues arise. In practice, this could mean a registered firm accepting bitcoin as collateral for a leveraged swap tied to commodities, while the CFTC monitors the operational risks and custody arrangements behind the scenes. Key Take In derivative markets, trading firms and institutions need to post collateral to back their positions in futures, swaps, or other derivative instruments. They normally maintain sizable reserves of assets that regulators deem safe and liquid enough to serve as collateral, typically U.S. Treasuries or cash-like instruments. Bitcoin can now be accepted as a margin for futures and swaps. This creates direct incentives for institutions, including hedge funds, market makers, and FCMs, to maintain meaningful BTC balances. They will need readily accessible Bitcoin reserves to maintain trading flexibility, like meeting margin calls and managing intraday exposure. As institutions begin using bitcoin as collateral, this could create a new source of steady demand, reduce available float in spot markets, and further entrench bitcoin’s position as a mainstream, regulated financial instrument rather than a purely trading asset. DTCC Receives SEC Approval to Tokenize U.S. Securities The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the core post-trade infrastructure behind U.S. securities markets, has received a No-Action Letter from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The No-Action Letter authorizes the company to launch a controlled production-level tokenization service beginning in the second half of 2026. The approval allows DTC, a subsidiary of DTCC, to create tokenized versions of assets it already custodies, including securities in the Russell 1000, major index-tracking ETFs, and U.S. Treasuries, on pre-approved blockchains over a three-year period. These digital representations will carry the same legal rights, investor protections, and ownership entitlements as their traditional counterparts, while operating within DTCC’s established standards for safety and resilience. This is the first time the SEC has permitted a systemically important market structure company to tokenize core U.S. securities in a live environment. DTCC positions the initiative as a foundation for improving collateral mobility, enabling around-the-clock access, and supporting programmable asset workflows. Key Take DTCC is the central post-trade infrastructure for U.S. securities markets, responsible for clearing, settlement, and custody for the majority of equities and bonds traded in the United States. It is one of the most systemically important financial institutions in global markets. Under today’s broker-mediated system, DTCC holds securities in centralized custody while shareholder rights, such as voting and corporate action participation, flow through brokers to investors; DTCC’s role ensures the integrity of ownership records and the proper transmission of these rights across the market infrastructure. Most tokenized stocks today offer only price exposure and do not grant shareholder rights, but DTCC’s new tokenization framework is designed to issue digital representations that carry the full entitlements, investor protections, and ownership rights of traditional securities. New Bitcoin-Linked Financial Products Emerge In recent weeks, several traditional finance firms have introduced new Bitcoin-linked products, signaling that interest is now moving beyond straightforward spot ETFs. JPMorgan has filed to issue a structured note tied to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ). The product outlines several predefined payout scenarios: investors receive a fixed return if the ETF reaches a target price by 2026, while a separate payoff structure offers upside participation through 2028 with partial downside protection. Separately, the Nicholas Bitcoin and Treasuries AfterDark ETF has been submitted for SEC review. The fund proposes a time-based allocation model: during daytime trading hours, it would hold U.S. Treasuries, shifting into Bitcoin exposure overnight. The structure aims to capture periods when Bitcoin historically shows higher volatility outside of U.S. market hours. These products show how traditional institutions are experimenting with different ways to package Bitcoin exposure, using structured payoffs and time-based allocation models to appeal to a wider range of investor preferences. Key Take For most investors, a straightforward spot ETF is sufficient to gain Bitcoin exposure. However, this does not meet the needs of many sophisticated market participants. The structured note market in the US has developed very rapidly in recent years, driven by investor demand for customized risk-reward profiles. These products can be designed to match specific market views, offering flexibility and risk mitigation strategies that align with sophisticated investment goals. The JPMorgan's IBIT-linked note is designed for investors who want exposure to Bitcoin’s upside but require guardrails around volatility and drawdowns. It delivers a structured, asymmetric payoff: modest guaranteed return in the near term, leveraged upside long term, and a defined drawdown risk in 2028. Bitcoin trades 24/7, but its performance is not uniform throughout the day; in this cycle, and one notable phenomenon is that most of the gains have occurred outside the U.S. market hours. The AfterDark ETF is designed for investors who want exposure specifically during the periods when Bitcoin has historically shown the most movement, rather than holding the asset around the clock. Weekly Market Chart: Hyperliquid Dominates Blockchain Fee Capture According to data from The Block, Hyperliquid now captures roughly 50% of all blockchain fees, a steep climb from about 10% at the beginning of the year. This growth has come largely at the expense of Ethereum and Solana. Together, those two networks now represent only about 20% of the total fee share, down from more than half at the start of 2025. As we mentioned in our recent article, Whale’s Digital Asset View: Top Two at a Crossroad , emerging top decentralized applications this cycle, including Hyperliquid for perps and Polymarket in prediction markets, are not built on Ethereum. While Ethereum is a more decentralized network, and that is more attractive for large capital store assets for safety reasons, its high TVL does not directly lead to more economic activity or fee generation, challenging the value accrual thesis for ETH as an asset.

BREAKING: XRP is coming to Solana pic.twitter.com/LabnKkLs71 — Solana (@solana) December 12, 2025 Launch Details Hex Trust will issue and custody wXRP, which matches XRP at a 1:1 ratio. The company stated that each unit is “1:1-backed” with native XRP held in segregated custody accounts. It will mint and redeem the asset through authorized merchants in a controlled environment. Hex Trust noted that users gain access to opportunities in DeFi while keeping redemption rights for native XRP. Hex Trust revealed that the launch has more than $100 million in Total Value Locked to support liquidity. This level of locked value aims to promote stable pricing across markets where wXRP trades. Hex Trust highlighted that the tokens remain redeemable for XRP held in its regulated custody, which provides auditability and insurance coverage. Will This Help XRP Grow? The introduction of wXRP can affect XRP’s market structure because every wrapped token requires native XRP to remain locked in custody. This process will reduce XRP’s rapidly shrinking circulating supply and can tighten liquidity during periods of active demand. While this does not guarantee price appreciation, supply conditions often influence how assets respond to market interest. The expansion of XRP’s utility across Solana and other supported chains may also attract new users who want a regulated way to participate in DeFi. Increased activity can boost transaction volumes on the XRP Ledger. Ripple executives have praised Solana , and this integration strengthens XRP’s role in cross-chain value transfer. These factors can support healthier market conditions for XRP.

Utility can influence market interest and price movements, and exposure to the Solana network supercharges XRP’s utility . DeFi participation may also create new demand for XRP as users shift assets across chains for swaps or liquidity opportunities. Solana benefits as well. Additional liquidity and asset diversity can support growth in activity across DeFi platforms. WXRP expands activity for both ecosystems and creates new routes for liquidity movement. The development signals a further step toward a more unified cross-chain utility for XRP. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The framework is expected to amend key laws related to digital financial assets and the securities market, while potentially prohibiting new digital asset purchases for most investors. New Crypto Framework Could Ban New Purchases On Thursday, Vladimir Chistyukhin told Russian news media outlet RIA Novosti that the Central Bank of Russia, the Ministry of Finance, Rosfinmonitoring, and other federal agencies have been discussing proposals to regulate the crypto market. The executive affirmed that the new framework will provide rules on how and through whom crypto transactions will be carried out. He detailed that these will likely be executed only by existing market participants under existing licenses. As reported by Bitcoinist, CBR’s First Deputy Chairman previously announced that local banks would be allowed to engage in limited crypto operations under strict regulatory conditions. Nonetheless, the executive has noted that they will need to consider whether exchanges should be included in a separate category that enables them to be eligible for a new license. In the case of investors, he informed that they are stepping away from their initial Experimental Legal Regime (EPR), introduced at the start of the year. The EPR proposed allowing only “highly qualified investors” to transact directly with digital assets. Currently, cryptocurrencies are used not only as an investment but also as a means of cross-border payments. This is a very important point that cannot be ignored. Of course, we want to protect Russian retail investors as much as possible from transactions with such a risky asset. On the other hand, we understand that in the current circumstances, in some cases, international payments can only be made using cryptocurrencies. Therefore, the discussion continues. Now, they are looking to allow qualified investors into the market after passing certain tests, although discussions are not final. There are only about one million qualified investors in Russia, Chistyukhin added, which could place millions of retail investors in the country in a “gray” zone. Unqualified investors who already acquired cryptocurrencies “will be able to either keep them, sell them, or exchange them for some fiat currency or other assets. There are no restrictions on exiting crypto assets – neither in terms of time nor volume. Only new purchase transactions will be restricted,” he stated. Russia To Adopt Regulations ‘As Quickly As Possible’ Chistyukhin affirmed that the Russian financial market has “all the necessary infrastructure to work with cryptocurrencies.” Although it will be “essential to amend the laws on digital financial assets, the securities market, and banking legislation.” Chistyukhin explained that the authorities believe it is “fundamentally important” to legitimize the crypto sector and ensure that it is compliant with the law. To achieve this, regulators are considering establishing strict restrictions and prohibitions. “Anything that falls outside this framework will be considered illegal activity.” Discussing why the financial authorities decided not to experiment with and test crypto rules, he noted that the country needs to adopt regulations quickly due to “international attention” and “scrutiny.” The issue of cryptocurrency regulation is attracting serious international attention, primarily from the FATF. (…) We need to adopt regulations as quickly as possible. (…) We simply do not have the time to experiment first and then spend several years analyzing it and launching something permanent. Therefore, the executive revealed that the legislation could be passed during the spring of 2026 and be enacted before the end of next year. However, Russian watchdogs are preparing transitional periods to give market participants time to move out of the regulatory “gray” zone and into the new legal framework. Liability for illegal operations is expected to come into effect in mid-2027.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Centra Bank of Russia|Crypto legislation|Crypto Market|crypto regulation|Russia crypto exchange|Russia Crypto legislation|Russian authorities|Russian crypto law,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-12 08:00:12

His comments emphasize the importance of RLUSD distribution, the involvement of prime brokers, and the increasing presence of major financial institutions in Ripple’s ecosystem. He presents these developments as signs that Ripple is moving into a more advanced phase, where large, established players become central to its progress rather than retail participation. RIPPLE IS GOING FULL INSTITUTIONAL RLUSD distribution + Prime brokers + Wall Street liquidity = A whole new era for crypto Big players don’t dance alone… they bring partners. $XRP is entering the big league https://t.co/TcWCcnrANJ pic.twitter.com/mRk9RLJ0OC — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) December 10, 2025 The Industry Transition In the video attached to the tweet, Christopher Perkin, president of CoinFund, explains that the broader crypto industry is going through a similar transition. He states that the market is shifting from a retail-driven environment toward one that is shaped by institutions. According to him, this transition includes RLUSD being distributed through prime brokers, reflecting practices that are already standard in traditional finance. Perkin stresses that institutional growth requires reliable partners who can supply liquidity, operational support, and large-scale participation. He says that major institutions are needed to help accelerate this move into the institutional space. He adds that RLUSD is positioned to become widely used and that many participants may adopt it sooner than expected. He also notes that Ripple Prime will play a key role by giving institutions a professional-grade execution and settlement channel. Throughout his remarks, Perkin outlines a vision centered on structure and readiness. He describes a business model that aims to support institutions at scale and believes the pieces are being assembled to meet that goal. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 How This Connects to XRP’s Position Xaif Crypto links these developments directly to XRP . He argues that as RLUSD distribution grows, with more prime brokerage involvement and stronger liquidity connections, XRP is entering what he calls a more competitive and institutionally focused environment. His view is that these elements create the foundation required for the asset to operate in larger financial settings where stability and efficiency matter most. He frames this shift as a combination of multiple ongoing steps rather than a single announcement. By pointing to the adoption of RLUSD, the importance of liquidity partners, and the role of Ripple Prime, he suggests that the overall direction is clear: Ripple is building an ecosystem designed for institutional use. Overall, the tweet and accompanying video present Ripple’s current direction as part of a broader industry movement.

Scaramucci’s Solana Prediction Not in the Twitter-war, zero-sum, “ETH is dead” kind of way. More like: same league, different growth curve, and Solana ends up with the bigger market cap. “I think it will flip Ethereum, but that doesn’t mean Ethereum’s going down or anything like that. I think there’s going to be market share for Ethereum. I think they could both grow, but I think from a market capitalization perspective, I think Solana will end up growing faster,” Scaramucci told CoinDesk Live on Dec. 11. That’s been his line for a while. This time it came with a prop: his new book, Solana Rising, which dropped Dec. 9 and — according to Scaramucci — quickly hit the top of Amazon’s “new releases” list for investment management/investment strategy. He framed the book as something for the skeptics, or at least for the friends of the believers. Related Reading: Solana Enters Bear Territory: Realized Loss Now Outweighs Profit The pitch is familiar if you’ve been anywhere near crypto conferences this year, but Scaramucci’s version is unusually blunt: Solana is the fastest-growing chain, it’s stacked with activity, it’s cheap to use, and it’s easy to build on. Then you add staking, and you’ve got what he keeps calling “great tokenomics.” And yes, he’s heavily aligned. “Full disclosure,” he said, “I have a large personal holding in Solana. I have it on the firm’s balance sheet.” How large? On SkyBridge’s balance sheet, he put it at “probably 60%,” with the firm sitting on “north of a nine figure balance sheet.” His personal portfolio allocation, he estimated, is around “6% 7%.” Big, but not “I sold the house for SOL” big. Notably, Scaramucci emphasized that he’s not “chain monogamous.” He likes Avalanche. He likes Ethereum. He’s not doing maximalism. He’s doing a portfolio. “In fact, who is chain monogamous?” he joked. Related Reading: Solana Hits Critical Demand Zone — Is A Surprise Bottom Loading? The Skybridge Capital founder added: “It’s not an amorous thing. It just has to do with the realities of investing. It’s like owning a lot of stocks in your portfolio. But to me, I just think that it is the fastest growing chain. That’s the most activity of like the top 50 chains combined. It’s got lots of use cases, lots of versatility. It’s easy to develop on and it’s very low fees to transact on and it’s got great tokenomics if you want to stake your Solana like I do.” He also pointed to the debut of the first spot Solana ETF in the United States — “first staking ETF,” in his words — as another signal that we’re still early. Then came the price talk, because of course it did. Could SOL hit $300–$400 by the end of next year? “Sure,” he said, tying it to a more constructive US regulatory backdrop — specifically his hope that the CLARITY Act gets passed and unlocks “the full utilization of tokenization.” Longer term, he went bigger: “Is Solana go to $1,000 over the next five years? I really do believe that.” He also revisited Bitcoin. Same vibe: right call, wrong calendar. “I’ve been right about Bitcoin, but I’ve been wrong about timing,” Scaramucci said, sticking with a $150,000–$200,000 target, and arguing a friendlier rate environment next year could help. At press time, SOL traded at $139.14.

This expiry event is pretty much the same as last week’s, which had no impact on spot markets. The US Federal Reserve dropped rates by a quarter percent this week in a move that was largely priced in by markets, hence the lack of reaction. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 1.1, meaning that the shorts slightly outnumber the longs.

Market activity tends to be subdued, limiting the near-term momentum for any sustained rally.” In addition to today’s batch of Bitcoin options, around 247,000 Ethereum contracts are also expiring, with a notional value of $768 million, max pain at $3,100, and a put/call ratio of 1.24. Total ETH options OI across all exchanges is around $12 billion. “Positioning has shifted into a more neutral distribution, yet call concentration hints that traders remain willing to price in larger ETH moves if volatility reawakens,” said Deribit. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $4.3 billion. Spot Market Outlook Markets have been mostly flat with a slight tick up in total capitalization over the past few hours, as it reached $3.2 trillion. Bitcoin topped $93,000 again, but hit resistance again, and fell back to the $92,000 level during early trading in Asia on Friday. Ether prices have traded in a tight range around the $3,200 level over the past day.

55677521,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=244197,1765527011,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Solana Decentralization: The Empowering Truth About Blockchain Leadership,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/solana-decentralization-leadership-truth/,"BitcoinWorld Solana Decentralization: The Empowering Truth About Blockchain Leadership At the recent Solana Breakpoint event, co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko dropped a revolutionary idea that challenges everything we thought we knew about blockchain governance. He didn’t just talk about technical specs or price predictions—he redefined what Solana decentralization truly means. Forget the old notion of leaderless chaos; Yakovenko envisions a future where every participant becomes a leader. This perspective could fundamentally change how we build and interact with decentralized networks. What Does Solana Decentralization Really Mean? When most people hear “decentralization,” they imagine a structure without any clear authority. However, Anatoly Yakovenko presents a more nuanced vision. He argues that true Solana decentralization doesn’t eliminate leadership but distributes it among all participants. Imagine a symphony where every musician leads their section while contributing to the harmony. This approach creates a resilient system where responsibility and initiative spread across the entire network. Yakovenko’s personal goal reveals the depth of this philosophy. He wants to reach a point where he can “blend into the audience” without special privileges like GitHub commit permissions. This isn’t about stepping away from responsibility but about building a system so robust that no single person’s access controls its destiny. The network matures when founders become ordinary participants. How Does Everyone Become a Leader in Practice? The concept of universal leadership might sound idealistic, but Solana’s architecture makes it achievable. Let’s break down what this looks like in real-world applications: Validator Independence: Anyone can run a node and participate in consensus Governance Participation: Token holders vote on proposals that shape the network’s future Development Contributions: Developers build applications without central approval Community Moderation: Users collectively maintain network standards and culture This distributed leadership model creates what economists call “anti-fragile” systems—networks that grow stronger under stress. When challenges emerge, multiple leaders can propose solutions simultaneously, creating a competitive environment for the best ideas. The recent Solana network upgrades demonstrate this perfectly, with various teams collaborating and competing to improve performance. What Challenges Does This Decentralization Model Face? While the vision is compelling, implementing universal leadership presents significant hurdles. First, coordination becomes more complex when everyone has agency. Decision-making can slow down without clear hierarchies. Second, quality control requires new mechanisms when anyone can contribute code or proposals. Finally, security concerns multiply with increased participation points. However, Solana’s approach addresses these challenges through technological design. The network’s high throughput allows for rapid consensus even with numerous participants. Smart contract audits and formal verification tools help maintain quality without central gatekeepers. Most importantly, the economic incentives align individual leadership with network health—validators earn more by acting honestly and efficiently. Why Does This Matter for Blockchain’s Future? Yakovenko’s perspective on Solana decentralization represents more than just technical philosophy—it’s a blueprint for the next generation of digital communities. Traditional organizations concentrate power at the top, creating single points of failure. Distributed leadership models like Solana’s create resilient networks that can adapt and evolve organically. Consider how this applies beyond cryptocurrency. Social media platforms struggle with content moderation because decisions come from distant corporate offices. A decentralized approach could empower communities to set their own standards while maintaining interoperability. The principles Yakovenko describes could reshape everything from supply chain management to democratic voting systems. How Can You Participate in This Decentralized Future? You don’t need to be a blockchain expert to contribute to Solana decentralization . The network welcomes various forms of participation: Run a validator node with modest hardware requirements Stake your SOL tokens to help secure the network Build applications using Solana’s developer tools Participate in governance discussions and votes Educate others about decentralized technologies Each contribution, no matter how small, strengthens the network’s distributed leadership. Remember Yakovenko’s goal of blending into the audience—the ultimate success metric is when no single person’s participation feels essential because everyone’s contribution matters equally. The Bottom Line on Solana’s Leadership Revolution Anatoly Yakovenko’s vision transforms decentralization from an abstract ideal into a practical framework for collective action. True Solana decentralization isn’t about removing leaders but about empowering everyone to lead in their domain. This approach creates networks that are more resilient, innovative, and equitable than traditional hierarchical systems. As blockchain technology matures, this distributed leadership model may become its most valuable export to other industries. The future belongs to networks where founders can disappear into the crowd because they’ve built systems that don’t depend on any individual. That’s the ultimate test of decentralization—and Solana is leading the charge toward that reality. Frequently Asked Questions What did Anatoly Yakovenko mean by “everyone is a leader”? He meant that in a truly decentralized system, every participant has agency and responsibility. Rather than having no leaders, the system distributes leadership roles across all network participants through validation, governance, and development contributions. How is Solana’s decentralization different from other blockchains? While many blockchains aim for decentralization, Solana emphasizes technical architecture that enables high participation rates. Its focus on scalability allows more users to run nodes and participate in consensus without compromising performance. Can anyone really contribute to Solana without permission? Yes, that’s the core principle. Anyone can run a validator node, build applications, or participate in governance without seeking approval from a central authority. The network’s rules are enforced by code rather than individuals. What are the risks of distributed leadership in blockchain? Primary risks include coordination challenges, potential for conflicting decisions, and slower response times in emergencies. However, Solana’s design uses economic incentives and fast consensus to mitigate these issues. How does Solana prevent bad actors in a leaderless system? The network uses proof-of-stake consensus where validators must stake SOL tokens. Malicious behavior leads to slashing (loss of staked tokens), creating strong economic disincentives for harmful actions. What’s the practical benefit of this decentralization model for users? Users benefit from increased network resilience, censorship resistance, and innovation diversity. When multiple teams can build without permission, they create more solutions to user problems than any single company could develop. Found this perspective on Solana decentralization enlightening? Share this article with your network to spread understanding about blockchain’s leadership revolution. The more people grasp these concepts, the faster we can build truly decentralized futures together.

Over 100 financial institutions worldwide are now using or testing XRP-powered solutions to make cross-border payments faster and more cost-efficient, signaling its rising appeal beyond crypto investors to traditional finance. Why Banks Are Exploring XRP Traditional cross‑border payments via legacy systems like SWIFT are often slow, costly, and opaque, taking days to settle and charging high fees. XRP’s blockchain‑based ledger offers a faster, cheaper alternative, with transactions completing in seconds at a fraction of the cost. Leading financial institutions are already exploring this potential: Santander has tested RippleNet and XRP corridors to reduce settlement times and cut operational costs. Bank of America is evaluating XRP technology, signaling interest in modernizing its global payments infrastructure. SBI Holdings leverages XRP through its subsidiary SBI Remit, enabling rapid, low‑cost remittances from Japan to countries like the Philippines and Vietnam. XRP’s adoption by major banks underscores a growing shift toward efficient, blockchain‑powered cross‑border payments. What This Means for Cross‑Border Finance The adoption of XRP by major financial institutions underscores blockchain’s tangible utility beyond speculation. By leveraging XRP for settlements, banks can reduce pre-funded foreign accounts, lower liquidity costs, and accelerate payment finality, tackling major inefficiencies in global finance. As more institutions pilot XRP-powered services, the payments ecosystem is poised for a shift toward faster, more transparent, and digitally native transactions, bridging traditional banking and next-gen blockchain networks. Therefore, Santander, Bank of America, and SBI Holdings’ adoption of XRP-powered infrastructure signals rising institutional confidence in crypto settlements, poised to transform cross-border payments. Conclusion The adoption of XRP-powered infrastructure by financial giants like Santander, Bank of America, and SBI Holdings marks a turning point in cross-border payments.

That’s the promise of prediction markets, and a major new alliance just brought this future a giant leap closer. In a landmark move, decentralized prediction market platform Kalshi has announced the formation of the Coalition for Prediction Markets (CPM), uniting industry titans like Coinbase , Robinhood , Crypto.com, and Underdog. This powerful coalition signals a pivotal moment for the adoption and legitimacy of prediction markets within the mainstream financial and crypto ecosystems. What Are Prediction Markets and Why Do They Matter? Before diving into the coalition, let’s clarify what prediction markets are. In simple terms, they are exchange-traded platforms where people can buy and sell shares based on the outcome of future events. The price of a share reflects the crowd’s collective wisdom on the probability of that event happening. For example, a share priced at $0.70 for “Will the Fed raise rates?” suggests a 70% perceived chance. Therefore, these markets are powerful tools for aggregating information and forecasting . The formation of this coalition is a direct response to the regulatory and public perception hurdles these markets face. By banding together, these companies aim to advocate for clear rules and demonstrate the legitimate utility of prediction markets beyond simple gambling. Who’s Who in the Prediction Markets Coalition? The CPM’s membership roster reads like a who’s who of modern finance. Each member brings a unique strength to the table: Kalshi : The initiator and a leading regulated platform focused on event-based trading. Coinbase : A cryptocurrency exchange giant with immense regulatory experience and user trust. Robinhood : A pioneer in retail investing, known for its massive, engaged user base. Crypto.com : A major global crypto platform with a strong brand and international reach. Underdog : A prominent player in the fantasy sports and betting space, connecting to a related audience. This diverse alliance combines expertise in crypto, traditional brokerage, retail engagement, and sports betting. Their collective goal is to shape a future where prediction markets are seen as a valuable source of economic and social insight. What Are the Potential Benefits of This Alliance? The collaboration could unlock several transformative benefits for users and the market as a whole. First, it could lead to increased liquidity and more accurate pricing across platforms as user bases potentially interconnect. Second, a unified voice is far stronger when engaging with regulators like the CFTC and SEC to establish a clear legal framework. Moreover, for the average person, this could mean access to sophisticated hedging tools. Imagine a farmer using a prediction market to hedge against drought or a business owner hedging against supply chain disruptions. The coalition aims to move these markets from niche curiosities to mainstream financial instruments. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Prediction Markets? Despite the excitement, the path forward isn’t without obstacles. The primary challenge remains regulatory uncertainty . U.S. regulators have historically viewed event-based markets with skepticism, often associating them with gambling. The coalition’s success hinges on its ability to reframe this narrative towards one of information aggregation and risk management. Another hurdle is public perception and education. Many people are unfamiliar with how prediction markets work. The coalition members will need to invest in clear communication to build trust and demonstrate the practical utility of these platforms to a broad audience. The Future Forecast: What Could This Coalition Change? If successful, the Coalition for Prediction Markets could fundamentally alter how we interact with uncertainty. We might see these markets used to forecast corporate earnings, gauge the impact of climate policies, or even provide real-time sentiment on geopolitical events. The integration with major platforms like Coinbase and Robinhood could introduce millions of users to this concept seamlessly. This isn’t just about creating a new trading product; it’s about building a more informed and resilient economy. The collective data from these markets could serve as a powerful, decentralized oracle for various blockchain applications and traditional decision-making processes. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Collective Intelligence The formation of the Coalition for Prediction Markets, spearheaded by Kalshi and backed by giants like Coinbase and Robinhood, is a watershed moment. It represents a coordinated push to bring the power of crowd-sourced forecasting into the financial mainstream. While regulatory battles and educational efforts lie ahead, the alliance has the firepower and credibility to potentially reshape how we understand and manage future risk. The ultimate prediction? That this coalition will make the once-niche world of prediction markets impossible to ignore. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Coalition for Prediction Markets (CPM)? The CPM is an advocacy group formed by Kalshi, Coinbase, Robinhood, Crypto.com, and Underdog. Its primary goal is to promote the responsible development and regulatory clarity for prediction markets in the United States. Are prediction markets legal? The legality is complex and varies by jurisdiction. In the U.S., most prediction markets operate in a regulatory gray area. The CPM aims to work with regulators like the CFTC to establish clear, legal frameworks for markets based on economic events, distinguishing them from sports gambling. How are prediction markets different from sports betting? While both involve wagering on outcomes, prediction markets are often framed as tools for information aggregation and hedging on real-world events (e.g., inflation rates, election results), not just sports entertainment. The trading and pricing mechanisms also function more like a financial market. Can I trade on Kalshi’s prediction markets now? Yes, Kalshi is a currently operating, regulated platform (with CFTC approval as a designated contract market) where eligible U.S. residents can trade on event outcomes. The coalition aims to expand access and product offerings. What does Coinbase gain from joining this coalition? Coinbase gains a strategic position in an emerging financial technology sector. It allows them to explore new product categories, engage with forward-looking regulation, and potentially offer novel financial tools to its vast user base in the future. Will this make cryptocurrency prices more volatile? Not directly. The coalition focuses on event-based prediction markets, not direct crypto trading. However, the data from these markets could provide valuable sentiment indicators that traders across all asset classes, including crypto, might consider.

Routing even a fraction of that through stablecoins changes everything,” commented ‘ChainIsle’. Earlier this year, PayPal added the capability for payment recipients to receive their pay in PYUSD, the centralized stablecoin it launched in 2023. PYUSD has grown since then to become the world’s sixth-largest stablecoin with a market capitalization of $3.9 billion. Its supply is more than a billion dollars, more than the Trump family’s World Liberty Finance stablecoin, USD1. The fintech firm has been integrating the stablecoin across its products, including Venmo, merchant payments, and vendor payouts. Google Cloud has also previously accepted PYUSD payments from customers. In July, PayPal launched “Pay with Crypto,” allowing merchants to accept payments in over 100 cryptocurrencies with automatic conversion to stablecoins or fiat currency. PayPal also rolled out peer-to-peer crypto transfers in September, allowing users to send Bitcoin, Ethereum, and PYUSD to friends, family, and external wallets using shareable links. Stablecoin Ecosystem Outlook The total market capitalization for stablecoins is at record highs of over $300 billion, according to crypto analytics platforms. It represents around 10% of the entire crypto market capitalization, according to CoinGecko, and there has been huge growth in 2025, following the passage of the GENIUS Act in the US. Tether remains the dominant industry player with 60% market share, while PayPal’s PYUSD is just 1.2% despite recent growth .

XRP is at a key technical juncture, testing critical support and resistance zones. A reclaim of $2.12 could fuel a bullish push toward $2.26, where the downtrend line offers a prime target, signaling renewed buyer control and attracting momentum traders and institutional attention. Conversely, failure to hold $1.98 may trigger a slide toward lower channel support, with $1.61 as the next key level. Such a move would mark a short-term bearish phase, prompting traders and investors to reassess risk and positioning. Therefore, XRP is at a pivotal juncture. Breaking above $2.12 could ignite short-term buying interest, while slipping below $1.98 may trigger profit-taking or defensive repositioning. XRP Weekly Charts Show Potential Bottom: Inverted Hammer Signals Possible Reversal Renowned market expert EGRAG CRYPTO highlights that XRP may be forming a bottom after weeks of decline. The weekly $1.94 candle produced a classic inverted hammer, a strong bullish reversal signal, indicating easing selling pressure and potential buyer momentum after a multi-week downtrend. The inverted hammer is a bullish signal, but confirmation is crucial before declaring a trend reversal. EGRAG CRYPTO identifies key conditions for XRP to validate a potential bottom: Strong Green Weekly Close: A follow-up bullish candle signals growing buyer momentum. Higher Low Formation: Establishing a higher low confirms stronger support and reduced downside risk. Break Above Key Resistance: Clearing the $2.10–$2.20 zone, and ideally surpassing $2.30, strengthens the case for a bullish reversal. XRP is currently trading at $2.03, just above the inverted hammer’s low, signaling buyers are probing for upward momentum. While promising, this pattern remains a tentative bottom until key confirmation levels are met. Well, the inverted hammer signals renewed hope for XRP bulls after weeks of consolidation below key moving averages. A strong weekly close above $2.20–$2.30 could spark a broader recovery, drawing both retail and institutional interest. Conclusion XRP is at a pivotal juncture, with bulls targeting $2.12 for a breakout and bears defending $1.98. The next sessions will likely set the short-term trend, with $2.26 as the upside target and $1.61 as key support. Additionally, XRP’s weekly inverted hammer at $1.94 signals a potential bottom, but confirmation is key. As a result, a keen eye should be given to higher lows, sustained bullish momentum, and resistance breaks to validate a reversal. The coming weeks will be decisive, as XRP sits at a critical inflection point shaping its short-term trajectory.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-12 09:14:00

The XRP Ledger recorded seven large transfers that settled within minutes, and the precision of the movements raised questions about institutional intentions and liquidity planning. A tweet highlighted the shift first through a post that spread quickly among analysts. His update showed seven wallets each receiving 100 million XRP. Four sending wallets connected to Ripple-linked accounts, while three other addresses did not match any known cluster. This mix of recognized and unknown participants created interest across the monitoring community. On-Chain Evidence of Coordinated Movement Trusted explorers show each transfer moving exactly 100 million XRP. The transactions settled inside a narrow window, and the timing signaled a coordinated plan. Retail users rarely move funds with this level of precision, so analysts examined the structure carefully to understand its purpose. The movements raised logical questions because such alignment usually reflects internal planning or institutional flows. Four wallets in the transfer wave linked directly to Ripple activity. These wallets often handle liquidity management, settlement support, or internal reorganization. Ripple conducts large movements during treasury planning cycles, and this latest sequence aligned with previous operational adjustments. The transfers reflected structured positioning rather than any market-facing action. Unknown Wallets Add New Suspense Three wallets in the group did not match any recognized entity. These addresses held no prior links to exchanges, custodians, or OTC desks . Analysts tracked their behavior because synchronized allocation often signals new strategic participants. These wallets created speculation about fresh institutional entry or new custodial frameworks preparing for ecosystem involvement. Market Reaction and Liquidity Tracking The market watched XRP price behavior closely as the transfers settled. Large movements often influence sentiment because liquidity conditions shift quickly when major addresses reorganize their holdings. Traders monitored exchange inflows to check for any sign of potential activity that could affect short-term volatility. The community also tracked whether the seven wallets would reveal any new patterns that point toward broader operational use. Insights from On-Chain Treasury Review A deeper on-chain review uncovered a structured treasury operation inside Ripple’s wallet framework. Ripple funded six new wallets with 100 million XRP each, which totaled 600 million XRP. Two source wallets drained completely during this process, which signaled a controlled redistribution across smaller internal units. Ripple divided the holdings into tranches that can support future deployments across various corporate needs. Source: X Context from the TOXR ETF Launch The timing aligned with a major ecosystem milestone. The 21Shares XRP ETF (TOXR) launched on the Cboe BZX Exchange after the SEC declared the issuer’s S-1 effective. The ETF tracks the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate and uses a 0.3% sponsor fee. Executives at 21Shares said U.S. investors continue to request wider access to crypto products with strong regulatory structure, and demand for XRP exposure has climbed steadily. XRP-backed ETFs in the U.S. already crossed $1 billion in cumulative inflows before this launch, and the new listing may increase competition among issuers. What Analysts Monitor Next Analysts continue to track all seven wallets for new transfers. Any movement toward exchanges may create fresh signals about near-term liquidity behavior. Clustering patterns may also reveal whether the unknown addresses relate to Ripple’s internal structure or new institutional actors. The synchronized 100 million XRP transactions illustrate strategic preparation during a key moment for XRP as ETF expansion, institutional interest, and on-chain restructuring converge.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-12 09:24:35

This move, reported by BitcoinTreasuries.NET, isn’t just about a single company—it’s a strategic, indirect bet on the future of Bitcoin itself. Let’s unpack what this Northern Trust MicroStrategy stock holding truly means for the evolving financial landscape. What Does Northern Trust’s $260M MicroStrategy Bet Mean? Northern Trust, a cornerstone of traditional finance with over $1.5 trillion in assets under custody, now holds 1.488 million shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR). This is significant because MicroStrategy’s primary corporate strategy is to acquire and hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Therefore, when a firm like Northern Trust invests heavily in MSTR, it is effectively gaining exposure to Bitcoin’s price performance through an equity vehicle. This provides a regulated, familiar pathway for institutional capital to flow into the crypto ecosystem. Why Are Giants Like Northern Trust Choosing This Path? Institutions face regulatory and operational hurdles when buying Bitcoin directly. Investing in a publicly-traded company like MicroStrategy offers a clever workaround. It allows them to participate in Bitcoin’s potential upside without navigating crypto custody, security, or complex accounting rules head-on. For Northern Trust, this MicroStrategy stock position represents a calculated, low-friction entry point into digital assets. Regulatory Clarity: Equities are a well-understood asset class with clear reporting standards. Operational Simplicity: No need for private key management or specialized crypto custodians. Liquidity: MSTR shares can be traded easily on traditional stock exchanges. The Ripple Effect of Major Northern Trust MicroStrategy Stock Holdings This isn’t an isolated event. It’s part of a broader trend of institutional adoption. When a venerable institution like Northern Trust makes such a move, it acts as a beacon for other conservative capital allocators. It validates the thesis that Bitcoin is a legitimate store of value and a viable component of a modern treasury strategy. This endorsement can drive further investment, increasing overall market stability and maturity. What Are the Potential Challenges and Risks? However, this strategy is not without its nuances. The investment carries dual layers of risk: the performance of MicroStrategy as a business and the volatility of Bitcoin’s price. Furthermore, it’s an indirect exposure. Shareholders do not own the underlying Bitcoin directly, and the stock price of MSTR can sometimes trade at a premium or discount to the value of its Bitcoin holdings. Investors must understand they are betting on the company’s execution of its Bitcoin strategy as much as on Bitcoin itself. Actionable Insights for Observers and Investors For the crypto market, the growing list of institutions holding MicroStrategy stock is a bullish long-term indicator. It demonstrates sustained, sophisticated demand. For individual investors, it highlights the importance of understanding the different avenues for crypto exposure—from direct purchase to ETFs and equity proxies like MSTR. Monitoring filings for changes in Northern Trust’s MicroStrategy stock position can also serve as a valuable sentiment gauge. Conclusion: A Landmark Endorsement for Digital Assets The revelation of Northern Trust’s substantial MicroStrategy stock holding is a landmark moment. It transcends a simple portfolio update, representing a profound shift in how traditional finance perceives and accesses Bitcoin. This $260 million vote of confidence from a trusted guardian of wealth underscores Bitcoin’s accelerating journey from niche digital token to a mainstream institutional asset. The walls between old finance and new are becoming more permeable by the day. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Why would Northern Trust buy MicroStrategy stock instead of Bitcoin directly? A> Buying MicroStrategy stock allows Northern Trust to gain Bitcoin exposure through a familiar, regulated public equity, avoiding the direct custody and regulatory complexities of holding the cryptocurrency itself. Q: How much Bitcoin exposure does this $260M investment represent? A> The exposure is indirect and based on MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin holdings relative to its market cap. It gives Northern Trust a fractional claim on the Bitcoin owned by MicroStrategy’s corporate treasury. Q: Is this a common strategy for other big institutions? A> Yes. Several hedge funds, asset managers, and even other corporations have used MicroStrategy stock as a proxy to gain regulated exposure to Bitcoin’s price movement. Q: Does this mean Northern Trust is bullish on Bitcoin? A> While it’s an investment in a company, MicroStrategy’s value is heavily tied to its Bitcoin strategy. A large investment in MSTR is widely interpreted as a bullish signal on Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Q: What are the risks of this indirect investment approach? A> Risks include MicroStrategy’s business performance beyond Bitcoin, potential tracking error between MSTR’s stock price and Bitcoin’s value, and the overall volatility of the crypto market.

AMINA Bank’s CPO noted that native web3 businesses often run into friction when working with legacy banking systems, which is why the organization believes instant cross-border payments are necessary. Ripple Payments’ integration into AMINA Bank’s operations will allow the latter’s clients to reduce the friction typically arising between blockchain and traditional banking rails. It will enable its customers to move funds seamlessly and settle transactions more efficiently without relying on traditional payment infrastructure. This should make transactions faster, while also reducing costs, and would increase reliability and transparency. Through our licensed payments technology, we are providing a crucial bridge between fiat and blockchain rails to AMINA Bank’s clients, giving them access to seamless payments using Ripple USD (RLUSD) and other stablecoins, as well as the ability to make rapid payouts in multiple currencies. AMINA Bank embodies the forward-thinking approach needed to advance wider adoption of digital assets technology, and we’re proud to support them in serving their clients with the most secure, resilien,t and compliant digital asset technology on the market,” commented Cassie Craddock, Managing Director, UK & Europe at Ripple. It’s worth noting that this collaboration builds on a previous one between the two parties, as AMINA Bank became the first such institution globally to support Ripple’s native stablecoin, RLUSD. AMINA Bank was founded in Zug, Switzerland, in April 2018 and categorizes itself as a “pioneer in the crypto banking industry.” It received the Swiss Banking and Securities Dealer License from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) in 2019.

CFTC withdraws “actual delivery” crypto guidance it issued in 2020 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has withdrawn staff guidance that explained how the agency interpreted “actual delivery” for retail commodity transactions involving “virtual currencies,” a standard that can determine whether a crypto trade falls under futures-style regulation. Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham said on Dec. 11, 2025, that the agency pulled the guidance because crypto markets have changed since it was released and because the prior framework had become outdated and overly complex. The announcement points to broader CFTC work tied to federal digital-asset policy recommendations, and it says the agency may later consider updated guidance or FAQs while inviting public engagement through its Crypto Sprint. Why “actual delivery” still drives how some retail crypto trades get regulated The “actual delivery” concept matters because US law treats certain margined, leveraged, or financed retail commodity transactions “as if” they were futures contracts unless they qualify for the actual-delivery exception. That exception can keep a transaction out of futures-style rules when delivery occurs within the required time window. In March 2020, the CFTC issued final interpretive guidance focused on retail commodity transactions in virtual currency, describing two main factors it considered when deciding whether actual delivery occurred. Those factors centered on whether the customer obtained possession and control of the full amount purchased and whether the seller and any counterparties kept residual interests or control that undercut delivery. The CFTC ’s Dec. 11 withdrawal removes that specific 2020 staff guidance from the agency’s active playbook, but it does not erase the underlying statutory framework that makes “actual delivery” a key dividing line for certain retail crypto products.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,COMMODITY|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-12 09:27:50

As the momentum is gaining, and significant milestones of major developments are going to be reached, many are wondering whether Mutuum Finance (MUTM) may become one of the next big crypto gainers in the 2026 cycle. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Building Mutuum Finance is constructing an entrusting protocol of decentralization, based on twolinked rates. Within the Peer to Contract market, the users borrow ETH or USDT. They are awarded mtTokens which are appreciated as the borrower’s service interests. This enables the lenders to have the APY with respect to the actual usage of the platform. Under the Peer to Peer market, the borrowers establish direct contracts with the lenders. Liquidity in interest rates. Borrowing will remain affordable in conditions of strong liquidity. In the case of tightening of liquidity, the rate increases. Collateral protection is through loan to value limits. In case collateral becomes too low, liquidation takes place. A liquidator makes payments on a loan and gets subordinated collateral. This dual form is useful in maintaining a stable movement of borrowing under various market circumstances. Mutuum Finance has been in very good initial momentum. The project indicates fundraising of $19.250M and 18,500 holders. The size of the user base is important to lending protocols since the depth of liquidity and the size of the community response is a factor in establishing the stability of the behaviour over the long term and the potential to be utilized. The team established the V1 testnet will be available in Q4 2025. V1 will comprise the lending pool, mtTokens, liquidation mechanisms and the debt engine. Lending of ETH and USDT will be accepted. Price Activity and Increasing Allocation Pressure Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale launched at $0.01 in early 2025 in the market. It is currently priced at $0.035, with a 250% increase. The total supply amounts to 4 billion of MUTM, and 1.82 billion or 45.5% of these tokens are distributed through presale phases. As of now, 815M tokens were bought. The project is now in the Phase 6 that is already more than 95% allocated. The amount of supply at this level is minimal. The stage 7 will introduce it by a close to 20% MUTM appreciation, which will move the token nearer to its official launch value of $0.06. Phase 1 buyers are set to see 500% MUTM growth at that point. Such stage based increments are important to early movers. After Phase 6, the cost of entry will shift upwards. As the allocation is fast, this was being perceived as one of the few opportunities that traders have to enter before the price realigns. Layers of Security: CertiK and Halborn The project has a significant concern on security. Mutuum Finance was audited by CertiK, with 90/100 points in a Token Scan. The audit was used to review behavior of contracts, and logic of transfer and general risk exposure. Halborn Security is undertaking a more intense examination of the lending contracts. This involves testing of interest computations, liquidation guidelines, collateral handling and communication between the various system components. Halborn plays the task of ensuring that the lending engine performs safely in various cases of liquidity. Among the key factors that traders consider in the most promising options, security plays a significant role in the evaluation of Mutuum Finance as a strong early entrant. Protocols of DeFi are based on very specific mechanics and audit systems contribute to the development of user trust. Time Runs out with Allocation Reduction According to reports of Mutuum Finance, Phase 6 gains momentum on a daily basis. Buyers are responding to the last pricing window with less than 5% left before the next price increment. The latest whale allocation of over $90K lessened the supply further and put more strain. The 24 hour leaderboard helps in high activity of the community. The best contributor of each day receives $500 in MUTM. This aids in the preservation of consistent engagement even in the quieter market conditions. Onboarding is easy with card payments support, and it has contributed to increasing the number of users who are new to DeFi. Being an Ethereum based project, Scaling tools would be compatible with Mutuum Finance in the future. Early stage assets with high utility and development milestones are favored by investors trying to find the best crypto assets to invest in even before 2026. As V1 is coming up soon, and the allocation has nearly in the past, Mutuum Finance is entering one of its most significant periods of growth. This point is regarded by a large number of traders who follow the predictions of cryptos as the possible turning point before the visibility broadens.

For cryptocurrency traders watching traditional markets for correlation signals, these currency movements provide crucial insights into broader financial sentiment and potential risk-off scenarios that could impact digital asset valuations. Why Is the Dollar Facing a Weekly Loss? The US dollar’s decline represents a shift in market dynamics that cryptocurrency investors should monitor closely. Several factors are contributing to this dollar weekly loss : Reduced expectations for aggressive Federal Reserve rate hikes Improving risk sentiment in global markets Technical corrections after extended dollar strength Mixed economic data from the United States This dollar weakness creates interesting opportunities for cryptocurrency traders, as traditional safe-haven flows might redistribute across different asset classes, including digital currencies. Sterling Weakens: The Impact of UK Economic Contraction The British pound’s decline following the latest GDP drop highlights how economic fundamentals continue to drive currency movements . The UK economy contracted more than expected, raising concerns about the country’s economic resilience and the Bank of England’s policy path forward. Economic Indicator Actual Result Market Expectation Impact on Sterling Quarterly GDP Growth -0.3% -0.1% Negative Monthly GDP Change -0.5% -0.3% Negative Services Sector Output -0.8% -0.4% Negative This economic weakness directly contributes to why sterling weakens against major counterparts, creating potential arbitrage opportunities for traders who understand cross-market correlations. Forex Market Implications for Cryptocurrency Traders The current forex market conditions offer valuable lessons for cryptocurrency participants. When traditional currencies experience volatility, several patterns often emerge in digital asset markets: Increased correlation between Bitcoin and traditional safe-havens during risk-off periods Potential capital rotation from weakening fiat currencies into cryptocurrencies Changed dynamics for stablecoin pairs and trading volumes Altered institutional positioning across asset classes Understanding these currency movements helps cryptocurrency traders anticipate potential shifts in digital asset liquidity and investor sentiment. What Does the GDP Drop Mean for Global Markets? The UK’s GDP drop isn’t just a local concern—it signals potential trouble for the global economy. For cryptocurrency markets, which often move independently but remain sensitive to macroeconomic shocks, this development warrants attention: Potential for coordinated central bank policy responses Impact on risk appetite across all financial markets Changes in currency carry trade dynamics affecting liquidity Possible flight to quality affecting both traditional and digital assets The broader implications of this economic weakness could extend far beyond the forex market , influencing investor behavior across the entire financial spectrum. Actionable Insights for Navigating Currency Volatility Successful traders adapt to changing market conditions. Here’s how to approach the current environment of dollar weekly loss and sterling weakens trends: Monitor dollar index (DXY) levels for correlation signals with cryptocurrency markets Watch for breakouts in major currency pairs that might precede crypto market moves Consider how central bank policies might create divergence between traditional and digital assets Use currency volatility as a gauge for overall market risk appetite FAQs: Understanding the Currency Market Dynamics What caused the dollar’s weekly decline? The dollar’s weakness stems from reduced expectations for Federal Reserve rate hikes, improving global risk sentiment, and technical corrections after extended strength. Market participants are reassessing the pace of monetary tightening amid mixed economic signals. How significant is the UK GDP contraction for currency markets? The UK’s GDP contraction of 0.3% exceeded market expectations of 0.1%, indicating deeper economic weakness than anticipated. This has direct implications for Bank of England policy and investor confidence in British assets. Which central banks are most influential in current forex movements? The Federal Reserve , European Central Bank , and Bank of England are driving major currency pairs through their policy decisions and economic outlook statements. How do currency movements affect cryptocurrency markets? Currency movements influence cryptocurrency markets through several channels: changing risk appetite, capital flows between asset classes, stablecoin dynamics, and institutional positioning across traditional and digital assets. What should traders watch next in forex markets? Traders should monitor upcoming central bank meetings, inflation data releases, and technical levels in major currency pairs. The interaction between traditional forex markets and cryptocurrency valuations remains a key area to watch. Conclusion: Navigating the Shifting Financial Landscape The simultaneous dollar weekly loss and sterling weakens scenario reveals deeper currents in global financial markets. For cryptocurrency participants, these traditional market movements offer both warning signals and opportunity indicators. The UK’s GDP drop serves as a reminder that economic fundamentals still drive market outcomes, even as digital assets create new valuation paradigms. Successful navigation of this environment requires understanding how currency movements in the forex market interact with digital asset valuations, creating a complex but potentially rewarding trading landscape for those who can read the signals across both traditional and emerging financial systems.

On a Dec. 11 livestream , Charles Hoskinson said the ecosystem’s new “Pentad” structure — the coordination bloc spanning Input Output, the Cardano Foundation, EMURGO, the Midnight Foundation, and Intersect — has approved its first major integration under the “critical integrations” framework: bringing Pyth’s Lazer oracle to Cardano, with deployment targeted for early 2026. Pyth Deal Kicks Off Cardano’s Critical Integrations Push “This is the appetizer announcement,” Hoskinson said, framing Pyth as the first of what he expects to be a broader menu: bridges, stablecoins , analytics, custodians — the stuff that turns a chain into a DeFi venue people actually build on, not just a community that argues about roadmaps. Hoskinson didn’t really sugarcoat why this matters. “Oracles are really the first part of major integrations,” he said, because you need reliable data coming in and you need credible pathways to the rest of the industry. He also admitted the in-house approach hasn’t landed the way it should’ve: Cardano “tried to build an indigenous oracle solution and it hasn’t worked out as well as it should.” So Pyth. That’s the pivot. Pyth, in its own marketing, has been pushing Lazer as an ultra-low latency product designed for speed-sensitive trading use cases — basically, price updates fast enough that perps and other twitchy DeFi apps don’t feel like they’re operating on last cycle’s data. Hoskinson called Pyth “one of the most advanced Oracle solutions on market,” and emphasized the practical angle: lots of feeds, lots of publishers, and broad distribution across chains. Intersect’s announcement (the one Hoskinson pulled up mid-stream) from X states: “One of the first concrete outcomes of the Critical Cardano Integrations workstream is now in place! The Steering Committee […] has approved the first major integration under this framework: bringing Pyth Lazer oracle to Cardano. Pyth provides low-latency, institutional-grade market data across thousands of price feeds spanning crypto, equities, FX, commodities and ETFs, already used by hundreds of DeFi applications across 100+ blockchains to power trading, lending and risk management.” Hoskinson argued, “[Pyth] effectively attaches Cardano now to the information networks of the entire cryptocurrency space.” He said the team is already exploring whether it can switch parts of the ecosystem — including Djed — over to Pyth, and he wants Cardano dapp teams to seriously evaluate the integration once it’s available. “Pyth is just the appetizer in the Cardano critical integrations,” he said. “There are many more things to come.” The broader context is that Cardano’s new “Pentad” has been positioning “critical integrations” as a coordinated, treasury-backed effort to “prime Cardano for 2026,” including a budget proposal tied to ecosystem-wide enablers. If Pyth is the first concrete output, it’s also a signal the Pentad model is going to be judged on execution, not vibes. Hoskinson, closing out, put it in his usual rally language: “Cardano is not an island anymore […] the cavalry has come.” The market can do what it wants in the short term. But getting credible oracle rails in place is the kind of boring upgrade that tends to matter later — when teams are deciding where to deploy, and where liquidity is willing to live.

The analyst drew attention to XRP’s position on the monthly chart, noting that the asset has returned to a level many traders have been monitoring for several months. The update was accompanied by a chart illustrating the current structure, which has added to the interest surrounding this retest. Comments from other market watchers followed, reinforcing the significance of the current setup. $XRP sits right on its flipped S/R trendline and is once again testing its monthly 20 EMA ($1.93). Hold the line! pic.twitter.com/2WtINGeqxc — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) December 11, 2025 XRP Revisits Its Flipped Support-Resistance Trendline According to ChartNerd’s chart analysis, XRP is positioned directly on the same trendline that previously acted as resistance before the breakout earlier in the year. The analyst described this trendline as a flipped support-resistance level, indicating a zone that, if maintained, reinforces the strength of the broader breakout structure. The chart spans several years of XRP’s price history , showing that the current level has been tested multiple times during both upward and downward movements. The significance of this trendline lies in its historical reliability. The latest monthly candle shows price action contracting toward this line once again, suggesting that XRP’s ability to remain above it may help determine the next phase of the trend. The chart shows this area, with the green horizontal band marking the zone the analyst considers essential to hold. 20-Month EMA Retest Draws Market Attention ChartNerd also highlighted the technical importance of XRP’s retest of the 20-month exponential moving average, currently positioned at approximately $1.93. The EMA is shown in yellow on the chart, rising steadily and intersecting with XRP’s recent monthly candles. The asset’s wick and body both align closely with this EMA, emphasizing the precision of the retest. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A comment from X user Guoyu RWA noted the same interaction, stating that the $1.93 EMA test aligns with the flipped support-resistance trendline. The user added that maintaining this confluence could allow bullish control to re-establish itself if the level continues to act as support. This view matches the visual data presented in the chart, where the EMA and horizontal support converge to form a critical zone. What This Means for XRP’s Structure While no prediction was issued in the thread, the information presented shows that XRP is now positioned at a multi-year technical intersection. ChartNerd’s focus remains on whether the asset can maintain this area on the monthly timeframe, as the structure could guide expectations for future movement. The confluence between the long-term EMA and the flipped support-resistance level forms the central point of the analysis, emphasizing how XRP closes the month relative to these marks.

Certain restrictions apply, but the move will give domestic crypto platforms and their users more time to comply with the country’s recently adopted regulations. Armenians allowed to exchange crypto with cash in 2026 Armenia is postponing a ban on cash purchases and sales of cryptocurrency into the next year, local media revealed this week. The government has already approved the necessary amendments to the new law “On Crypto Assets” which will be submitted to the parliament soon. Officials were initially planning to prohibit cash transactions in crypto trading right after the legislation entered into force on July 4, 2025. However, it was later decided to introduce a transitional period before the ban is enforced to help companies adapt to the current regulations. Crypto businesses were also given a full year to obtain the mandatory licenses from the country’s central bank, Sputnik Armenia recalled in a report on Thursday. Thus, platforms working with digital assets are now free to process cash orders until July 2026, although not without limitations. The amount of each individual transaction must not exceed 300,000 Armenian drams, or $785 at the time of writing. Furthermore, the selling entity is responsible for conducting proper identification of its customers and keeping full records of all their transactions. During the interim period, the Central Bank of Armenia ( CBA ) retains the power to verify compliance of market participants at any given moment. The extension concerns a number of exchange offices operating in Armenia that continue to accept cash for cryptocurrency trades, the news outlet noted. Armenia takes road to regulated crypto market Armenian authorities have been taking steps this year to put the country’s crypto space in order. The digital assets bill was finalized in February and filed with the National Assembly in April, before lawmakers passed it at the end of May. The legal framework introduces regulations governing the trading of coins, the provision of related services as well as the oversight of the market. Ensuring investor protection to improve confidence in the industry is another of its main goals. Under the legislation, platforms operating with crypto assets, including exchanges and issuers, are obliged to disclose details about their owners and meet minimum capital requirements. At the time this was proposed, Armenian media and officials explained the particular focus on ownership and capital sources with the need to improve “ financial hygiene ” in the sector. Another key feature of the law is that it allows commercial banks to offer crypto services, although to do that, they need to set up a separate legal entity and obtain a dedicated license from the monetary authority. In April, CBA Deputy Governor Armen Nurbekyan remarked: “In the presence of uniform rules, Armenian banks, which have long been interested in this domain, can also officially offer cryptocurrency services.” In September, his superior, the central bank’s Chairman Martin Galstyan, suggested that the banking sector should learn to manage the risks associated with decentralized digital currencies to make their crypto services more accessible. Armenia praised for crypto growth and regulation Much like some of its neighbors in the Southern Caucasus, such as Georgia , Armenia has been watching its crypto sector grow over the past few years, but only recently moved to properly regulate it. This week, Binance’s Marketing Manager in Central Asia and the CIS countries, Stanislav Delyonok, highlighted its status as a regional leader in terms of crypto investments. Quoted by the banking news outlet Armbanks.am on Saturday, he stated: “Armenia is at the forefront of crypto development, integrating digital assets in various spheres of life.” The country ranks 14th in the Global Cryptocurrency Investment Index, he pointed out, noting that every tenth resident of the small nation of around 3 million people is already a user of the largest crypto exchange. “We see a huge potential for the development of Armenia’s crypto ecosystem and highly value initiatives that make digital assets more understandable, safe and accessible,” added Kirill Khomyakov, head of markets in Central Asia, Central and Eastern Europe and Africa at Binance.

55680387,https://square.htx.com/?p=47114,1765532319,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/100/default.png,HTX Takes the Crown for the Most Net Inflows of $583.7M Over the Past 30 Days,https://square.htx.com/htx-takes-the-crown-for-the-most-net-inflows-of-583-7m-over-the-past-30-days/,"In a market defined by rapid narrative shifts and unpredictable volatility, one metric never lies: the direction of capital flows. According to DefiLlama data as of December 5, HTX recorded $583.7 million in net inflows over the past 30 days, ranking first among all centralized exchanges globally. The platform also maintained steady growth in total user assets and rising spot trading volume, reinforcing a positive cycle built on asset security, expanding user activity, and accelerating capital inflows. Source: DefiLlama (December 5) This leadership is not a momentary spike but the culmination of a sustained trend. When uncertainty rises, users naturally gravitate toward the platforms they trust most. HTX’s strong net inflow performance ultimately results from millions of users making the same decision. Behind the Numbers: A Real Vote of Confidence from Users In the competitive arena of centralized exchanges, net inflow is one of the most accurate indicators of user behavior. Exchanges with consistent inflows tend to outperform in passive income products, new asset listings, user experience, and operational transparency. When users deposit assets onto a platform, they are communicating a simple but powerful message: they believe the exchange is safe, solvent, and reliable, and that it will not freeze withdrawals, suffer liquidity stress, or engage in opaque operations. Amid the crypto market cycle fluctuations, HTX’s position at the top signals that its reputation for stability and reliability is being re-established. Its core businesses, especially Earn products with asset transparency, have gained real traction. In other words, HTX is entering a new phase of increasing trust across the global market. Why HTX? Three Strategic Drivers Behind the Surge Since the second half of 2025, HTX has made major efforts across transparency, security, and compliance, strengthening its operations and setting the stage for this wave of net inflows. On asset transparency, HTX, one of the first movers in the industry to publish Proof of Reserves, has now disclosed Merkle Tree-based PoR data for 38 consecutive months. All major assets on the platform consistently maintain reserve ratios at or above 100%. Users can access the “ Assets > Proof of Reserves ” section at any time on HTX’s official website to verify monthly reserve reports. Visibility is the strongest form of risk control and HTX’s philosophy is simple: users should always be able to see their money. On security and compliance, HTX is presenting the advantages of a platform founded in 2013. With upgraded compliance architecture and security system, the platform has strengthened its capability in anti-money laundering, on-chain monitoring, and account risk management. Twelve years of security engineering and risk management act as a buffer during critical market cycles, making HTX a preferred destination when stability matters most. What Are Users Choosing When They Move Their Assets to HTX Earn ? HTX’s return to the top of the industry is rooted in one thing: the platform understands exactly what users really want. Crypto users in 2025 are far more pragmatic. They’re no longer swayed by narratives. They look at yield, at user experience, and at security. And HTX’s upgrades across its core business lines align precisely with those three priorities. Let’s illustrate this with HTX Earn’s performance over the past seven days. Both total assets subscribed and total participants have risen meaningfully. Specifically, USDD subscriptions in HTX Earn increased 25.5%, with participants up 12.4%. ETH subscription amounts rose 17.2%, while TRX products’ participants increased 6.7%. The trend is unmistakable: users are allocating more long-term capital into the HTX Earn products. In a market where directional trading is difficult and volatility provides more stress than opportunity, many investors now prioritize stable, predictable returns. That shift has fueled the rapid expansion of HTX Earn. Its advantages can be summarized in three qualities of stability, simplicity, and superior yields. HTX Earn features the user-first principle. Investors are flocking to HTX Earn because of the following strengths: Simple & Seamless: Easy to use, one-click subscription, flexible redemption. No gimmicks, ideal for long-term holding. Transparent Yield: Returns from subscriptions to core assets are more transparent with no complex derivative rules and hidden terms. Competitive & Stable Returns: Earn steady yields on stablecoins and major cryptocurrencies with APYs above the industry average. Across social platforms, users have expressed the same sentiment repeatedly: “When markets are unstable, HTX is the only place I trust with my stablecoin yields.” Capital flows don’t lie and the surge in net inflows validates that trust. HTX Is Rebuilding Industry-Wide Confidence HTX’s performance throughout 2025 speaks for itself. The rise is the result of systemic upgrades. From greater asset transparency and enhanced security to the explosive growth of HTX Earn, the platform has demonstrated consistent resilience during a turbulent period for the industry. All of these strengths converge into the clearest metric of all: as of December 5, HTX ranked No.1 in 30-day net inflows among all global CEXs. As the industry transitions into the “trust premium” phase, capital naturally flows toward platforms that are more transparent, more stable, and more aligned with value creation. Investors have already given their verdict through their actions: HTX is the exchange they trust most with their assets.

The platform is set to list two new perpetual futures contracts: US/USDT and CYS/USDT. This move provides traders with fresh avenues for speculation and hedging, directly impacting the Binance perpetual futures market. The launch is scheduled for today, promising immediate action for the trading community. What Are the New Binance Perpetual Futures Contracts? Binance will introduce these contracts in a swift, sequential launch. The US/USDT perpetual futures contract goes live first at 10:45 a.m. UTC. Shortly after, at 11:00 a.m. UTC, the CYS/USDT contract will commence trading. These are settled in USDT, meaning traders use Tether to manage their positions and profits. The exchange is supporting substantial leverage, which is a key feature for these Binance perpetual futures products. US/USDT Contract: Offers leverage of up to 40x. CYS/USDT Contract: Offers leverage of up to 20x. This tiered leverage structure suggests Binance has assessed different risk profiles for each asset. Higher leverage on the US pair indicates potentially higher liquidity or lower perceived volatility. However, traders must remember that leverage magnifies both gains and losses. Why Should Traders Pay Attention to This Launch? New listings on a major exchange like Binance often lead to increased volatility and trading volume. For active traders, this presents a clear opportunity. Early movers can capitalize on initial price discovery phases. Furthermore, adding these pairs diversifies the available Binance perpetual futures portfolio, allowing for more complex trading strategies. For instance, traders might use these new contracts for pairs trading or to express a view on these specific assets without needing to hold the underlying spot tokens. The perpetual nature of the contracts means there is no expiry date, providing flexibility for longer-term positions, though traders must manage funding rates. What Are the Key Risks and Considerations? While opportunity beckons, caution is paramount. The primary risk with any Binance perpetual futures product, especially with high leverage, is liquidation. A 40x leverage means a mere 2.5% price move against your position could wipe out your margin. Therefore, robust risk management is non-negotiable. Always use stop-loss orders. Never allocate your entire capital to a single leveraged position. Understand how funding rates work, as they can erode profits over time. Moreover, newer or less-established tokens like CYS might exhibit lower liquidity initially. This can lead to wider bid-ask spreads and increased slippage, making entry and exit more costly. Traders should monitor the order book depth closely in the first few hours after launch. How Does This Fit Into Binance’s Broader Strategy? This listing is not an isolated event. It reflects Binance’s continuous effort to dominate the crypto derivatives market. By consistently adding new products, Binance attracts a wider user base, from retail speculators to institutional players seeking specific exposures. Each new Binance perpetual futures contract strengthens the ecosystem’s liquidity and utility. For the projects behind US and CYS, a Binance listing is a major milestone that boosts credibility and visibility. It often leads to increased interest in the spot markets for these tokens as well, creating a synergistic effect across different trading verticals on the exchange. Conclusion: A Calculated Opportunity for the Informed Trader Binance’s launch of US and CYS perpetual futures is a calculated move that expands market access. It offers powerful tools for experienced traders but comes with significant risks that demand respect. The key to navigating this new opportunity lies in preparation. Understand the contracts, have a clear strategy, and prioritize risk management above the allure of high leverage. For those ready, the markets are now open. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a perpetual futures contract? A: A perpetual futures contract is a derivative product that allows you to speculate on an asset’s price without an expiry date. It uses a funding rate mechanism to keep its price tethered to the underlying spot market. Q2: What time do the new Binance futures contracts launch? A: The US/USDT contract launches at 10:45 a.m. UTC, and the CYS/USDT contract launches at 11:00 a.m. UTC on the announcement date. Q3: What is the maximum leverage for these new contracts? A: The US/USDT contract supports up to 40x leverage, while the CYS/USDT contract supports up to 20x leverage. Q4: Do I need to hold US or CYS tokens to trade these futures? A: No. Perpetual futures are settled in USDT. You only need USDT in your futures wallet to trade these contracts and cover margin requirements. Q5: Are these contracts available to users in the United States? A: No. Binance.com derivatives products, including these new perpetual futures, are not available to users in restricted jurisdictions, which includes the United States. Eligible users must check their local regulations. Q6: What’s the main risk of trading with high leverage? A: The main risk is liquidation. High leverage amplifies losses, meaning a small adverse price move can quickly wipe out your posted margin, closing your position at a loss.

In a significant move, banking giant Standard Chartered and leading crypto exchange Coinbase have announced a powerful expansion of their partnership. Their primary goal? To dramatically enhance and broaden their crypto prime services for institutional clients worldwide. This collaboration signals a major step in bridging traditional finance with the digital asset ecosystem. What Are Crypto Prime Services and Why Do They Matter? For institutions, diving into cryptocurrencies involves more than just buying Bitcoin. They require sophisticated infrastructure that matches what they have in traditional markets. Crypto prime services provide this essential backbone. Think of them as a comprehensive suite of professional-grade tools: high-volume trading, secure custody of assets, lending facilities, and staking for earning rewards. This partnership aims to build a seamless, regulated gateway for large-scale investors. How Will This Expanded Partnership Work? The collaboration builds on an existing successful model in Singapore. There, Standard Chartered already enables real-time Singapore dollar (SGD) transfers for Coinbase’s clients. Now, they are scaling this model globally. The expanded focus will develop integrated solutions across several critical areas: Trading & Execution: Providing deep liquidity and efficient trade execution for large orders. Secure Custody: Offering institutional-grade storage solutions for digital assets. Staking & Lending: Creating avenues for institutions to earn yield on their crypto holdings. Prime Brokerage: Delivering a unified platform that consolidates these services under one roof. This holistic approach addresses the core needs of hedge funds, family offices, and asset managers looking for trusted entry points. What Are the Key Benefits for Institutional Investors? This alliance combines distinct strengths. Standard Chartered brings over 160 years of banking trust, regulatory expertise, and a global network. Coinbase contributes its leading technology, deep crypto market access, and proven compliance framework. Together, they offer institutions a compelling package: Regulatory Confidence: Navigating the complex global regulatory landscape becomes more straightforward. Operational Security: Combining bank-level security with crypto-native safeguards reduces risk. Market Access: Institutions gain a reliable and liquid on-ramp to major digital assets. Therefore, the partnership lowers the traditional barriers to entry, making crypto asset allocation a more viable and secure strategy for professional portfolios. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Adoption? The expansion of these crypto prime services is a strong validation signal for the entire industry. When established global banks like Standard Chartered deepen their commitment, it encourages other traditional financial players to follow. Moreover, it provides the necessary infrastructure for potentially billions in institutional capital waiting on the sidelines. The move accelerates the maturation of crypto markets, pushing them closer to the efficiency and stability of traditional finance. Conclusion: A Major Inflection Point The strengthened partnership between Standard Chartered and Coinbase is more than a business deal; it’s a powerful catalyst. By building robust crypto prime services , they are constructing the financial plumbing needed for widespread institutional adoption. This collaboration demonstrates that the future of finance is not a choice between old and new systems, but a strategic integration of both. For institutional investors, the path to digital assets just became clearer, safer, and more accessible. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are crypto prime services? Crypto prime services are a suite of professional financial services tailored for institutional investors in digital assets. They typically include trading, lending, borrowing, custody, and staking, all provided through a single, integrated platform. Why is the Standard Chartered and Coinbase partnership important? It combines the trust, regulatory reach, and banking infrastructure of a major global bank with the technology and crypto market expertise of a leading exchange. This blend is crucial for attracting large, risk-averse institutional capital. Who can use these expanded crypto prime services? The services are designed for institutional clients such as hedge funds, asset managers, family offices, and corporations, not for individual retail investors. What was the foundation of this partnership? The collaboration builds on their existing work in Singapore, where Standard Chartered facilitates real-time fiat currency transfers for Coinbase clients, proving the model’s effectiveness. How does this affect the average crypto investor? While direct access is for institutions, this development contributes to overall market maturity, liquidity, and stability, which can positively impact the broader ecosystem that retail investors participate in. Are there risks with these services? As with all crypto activities, risks related to market volatility, technology, and regulation remain. However, the involvement of a major bank aims to mitigate operational and counterparty risks through stringent compliance and security measures.

Held alongside Abu Dhabi Finance Week, the gathering brought together Web3 leaders and institutional innovators for an evening of strategic dialogue, celebrating Phemex’s 6th anniversary. The exclusive agenda featured industry heavyweights including Anthony Scaramucci (SkyBridge) and Kristin Smith (Solana Policy Institute), who dissected market trends in the “Solana SZN” panel, while Eli Ben-Sasson (StarkWare) explored the critical role of privacy in a dedicated fireside chat. Meanwhile, the night’s centerpiece was the “Crypto’s Security Dilemma” panel. Phemex CEO Federico Variola joined Ian Rogers (Ledger) and Dmytro Budorin (Hacken) to address the sector’s most urgent defense challenges. Federico argued that the industry’s standard “reactive” security model is obsolete against modern AI threats. He advocated for a shift to “Predictive Security Architecture,” revealing how Phemex now uses AI to analyze user behavior patterns to stop threats before they materialize. Federico also used the stage to unveil Phemex’s strategic roadmap, highlighting the incubation of a new Account Abstraction wallet designed to bridge Web2 and Web3. “Beyond hardening our infrastructure with predictive AI, we are fundamentally evolving the platform,” said Federico. “We are building a holistic ecosystem — combining a CEX, a DEX, and a self-custodial wallet — where security is the anchor that allows users to move seamlessly between custody models.” As Phemex enters its seventh year, the event underscored the exchange’s commitment to redefining user protection. By fostering high-level dialogue and partnership among decision-makers, Phemex continues to lead the charge in building a transparent, secure, and unified digital asset future.

Amid a sharp pivot in market sentiment, 2025 is fast emerging as the year in which cryptocurrency investors reclaim privacy, challenging policymakers to rethink an era defined by transparency mandates, stringent KYC rules and exhaustive transaction-tracking regimes. The Global South is powering much of this surge, with privacy coins emerging as a practical solution to routine payment hurdles, unstable currencies and increasingly stringent financial controls. Key Takeaways 81% of global privacy coin trading volume comes from the MENA, CIS, and SEA regions. Institutional privacy coin activity grew 210% in Q4; MENA accounts for 11% of all institutional XMR/ZEC transactions. 1 in 5 privacy coin traders converted USDT or USDC into privacy assets in H2 2025 DASH and ZEC trading volumes rose 2,621% and 4,205%, respectively, in Q4; XMR remains dominant, accounting for 93% of total trading volume. Privacy assets are becoming an alternative to traditional financial instruments that are affected by inflation, currency controls, and payment restrictions. The privacy coin sector has expanded 335% year-to-date, far outpacing the broader crypto market’s 20% growth. Total market capitalization exceeded $34 billion in November, placing privacy assets close to mainstream narrative categories such as memecoins and real-world assets. MEXC ’s trading data shows that MENA, CIS, and Southeast Asia account for 81% of global privacy coin trading. These regions experience the highest levels of new wallet usage, P2P payments, and cross-border settlement activity involving private assets. The CIS region now leads the global usage chart, with privacy asset transactions increasing from 23 million to 104 million per month in H2 2025. Economic instability, inflation, and restricted access to international banking channels push users towards the alternatives. In MENA, institutional engagement has accelerated. Large-value transfers involving XMR and ZEC accounted for 11% of all institutional crypto transactions in Q3–Q4, significantly higher than in Latin America (6%), the CIS (4%), and SEA (2%). Monero remains the sector’s centre of gravity— capturing 93% of all trading volume and 72% of users. Around it, the sector experienced a dramatic surge in Q4: DASH trading volumes jumped 2,621%, ZEC soared 4,205%, and active traders in both markets increased by more than 400%. Stablecoin capital is increasingly flowing into privacy assets. Roughly 1 in 5 privacy coin traders converted USDT or USDC into private alternatives, reflecting growing concern over reporting requirements, FATF Travel Rule expansion, and stricter monitoring of stablecoins. “Privacy tokens are evolving into a parallel financial layer, restoring crypto’s original premise by placing privacy back at the centre. Their rapid adoption across emerging markets reflects a wider global sentiment: people want choice, protection and autonomy in how they transact. Coupled with rising de-dollarisation and momentum across the TON ecosystem, the privacy-asset sector is set for further expansion into 2026, driven not by market cycles but by macroeconomic realities,” said Vugar Usi, COO of MEXC.

After two months in which they didn’t post any updates on the matter, the team outlined the winners earlier this week and their respective prizes. Hackathon Winners CryptoPotato reported in August the details about the event, which started on the 21st of that month. The optional midpoint check-in took place in mid-September, while the entire event was scheduled to conclude on October 15. Following two months of inactivity on the matter, the Core Team finally announced the winners of the Pi Hackathon 2025 on Thursday: 1st Place : Blind_Lounge , a privacy-first social and dating platform where people connect anonymously and reveal identities only by mutual choice. 2nd Place : Starmax , a loyalty program app that enables Pioneers to spend Pi at participating businesses and earn rewards for their engagement. 3rd Place : RUN FOR PI , a fast-paced runner game that incorporates Pi directly into its in-game economy. The hackathon rules stated that the first-positioned Pioneer will receive 75,000 PI tokens, the second will get 45,000, and 15,000 coins will go to the third. The five honorable mentions will receive 5,000 each, which were as follows: Kindrek, Workflet For Pi, PallyPay, SimpleJoy, and Agora Pulse. Overall, the team said there were more than 215 Mainnet app submissions received from August to October that met the ecosystem requirements. They added that this showcases developers’ “clear motivation to build utility-oriented, production-ready apps on the Pi Mainnet.” The Fine Print However, the Core Team also warned that some of the features on these apps could be a work in progress and outlined the possibility of occasional bugs or limitations as they are community-built projects that continue to evolve after the hackathon. The disclosure also reads that, since they do not officially develop these apps, they do not have any affiliation with Pi Network itself. “Likewise, all decisions, features, and limitations of these apps are determined solely by their respective app teams. Use of these apps is at your own discretion and risk, and by using such apps you acknowledge and agree that Pi Network is not responsible for any issues you may encounter, including but not limited to, those relating to and arising from transactions, data security, user experience, or access and use.” The post urged users who encounter any issues with the apps or have suggestions to share them directly through the application’s reporting channels or in the relevant community spaces.

The market is showing signs of exhaustion again, and bulls are struggling to maintain control. Unless stronger momentum steps in, Ethereum may be at risk of rolling back into the range. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart After breaking above the descending trendline, ETH tapped into the $3,400–$3,500 resistance zone but failed to sustain higher prices. The asset is still trading below the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, both located above the $3,500 mark, and despite flipping the trendline, the structure remains fragile. The recent candle shows rejection from the same zone that capped the price in early November, making this a clear short-term barrier. If buyers lose grip, the next potential support is around the $2,900 bullish order block, which coincides with the broken trendline at the moment. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour chart, it is evident that the breakout above the bearish trendline was clean, but the price faced immediate resistance near $3,400 and dropped back below $3,300. The previous resistance has now turned into a minor support zone around $3,100–$3,200. However, the rejection wick from the recent top shows a lack of follow-through. If this support fails, the price could revisit the $2,950–$2,900 range. Structure remains vulnerable, and RSI is cooling off after overbought conditions, suggesting weakening momentum. Sentiment Analysis Open Interest Open Interest is gradually rising again and sits near $19.4B, while the price has bounced back to around $3.2K. The last time this combo was seen, rising OI with flat or correcting price, it preceded a sharp move. This could go either way, but historically, when OI climbs faster than price, it signals aggressive speculative positioning, often followed by liquidations. Therefore, traders should stay cautious here as the risk of a flush is not off the table, especially if spot market demand doesn’t follow.

Key Takeaways: The CFTC granted narrow no-action relief to four prediction markets, reducing immediate enforcement risk. Platforms must fully collateralize all contracts and publish time-and-sales data to maintain eligibility. The move comes amid a surge in prediction market activity, raising expectations for long-term regulatory readiness. In a notice published Thursday , the agency said it would not pursue action against Polymarket US, LedgerX, PredictIt and Gemini Titan, Gemini’s event-contracts arm, for failing to meet certain swap data reporting and record-keeping obligations, so long as they comply with a set of conditions outlined in the letters. The CFTC emphasized that the relief is narrow and mirrors treatment given to other designated contract markets and clearing organizations. CFTC Signals Flexibility as Prediction Markets Build Compliance Systems The no-action letters do not change existing law but signal a willingness by regulators to give emerging prediction markets room to operate as they refine their compliance systems. To qualify for continued relief, the platforms must fully collateralize all contracts, with reserves covering every position in full. They are also required to publish time-and-sales data for each transaction once it is executed. These conditions aim to ensure transparency and mitigate counterparty risk, especially in markets that allow trading on outcomes ranging from sports to political events and cultural oddities. Prediction markets fall under the CFTC’s jurisdiction as designated contract markets, triggering extensive reporting rules that many newer platforms have struggled to meet. The new relief reduces the threat of immediate enforcement but does not absolve the companies from longer-term compliance expectations. . @CFTC Staff Issues No-Action Letters Regarding Event Contracts: https://t.co/oelx60JIap — CFTC (@CFTC) December 11, 2025 The regulatory pause comes during a standout year for event-driven trading. Prediction markets have surged in popularity throughout 2025, with some platforms posting transaction activity on par with mid-tier crypto exchanges. Kalshi recorded $5.14 billion in trading volume over the past 30 days, according to DefiLlama, while Polymarket registered $1.9 billion over the same period. Major crypto firms are also eyeing the space. Crypto.com has launched its own prediction market product, expected to integrate with Trump Media, and site code indicates Coinbase is exploring a similar offering. While the CFTC’s no-action stance offers temporary breathing room, the sector now faces increased expectations to demonstrate transparency, collateral integrity and readiness for full regulatory oversight. SEC Clears DTCC to Launch Landmark Tokenization Program Yesterday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission also approved a major step toward blockchain-based securities markets by granting the Depository Trust Company, a DTCC subsidiary, a rare no-action letter. The decision allows DTC to begin tokenizing Treasuries, index ETFs and assets tied to the Russell 1000 starting in late 2026 on pre-approved blockchains. Such letters are uncommon, signalling strong regulatory confidence in the framework DTCC proposed and marking a broader shift in the SEC’s approach to blockchain infrastructure. The SEC has taken a noticeably more open stance toward blockchain initiatives over the past year. Two decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) projects received similar no-action treatment , and in late September, the agency cleared investment advisers to work with state trust companies serving as crypto custodians. In August, the agency issued a similar letter to Double Zero , surprising many in the industry and fueling optimism that the SEC, now led by Chair Paul Atkins, is taking a more measured approach after years of tension under former chair Gary Gensler.

The vote comes at a pivotal moment for U.S. crypto regulation, with the CFTC poised to assume sweeping new authority over digital asset markets while operating under severe leadership constraints that have left only one commissioner seated since September. Selig’s confirmation hearing in November drew sharp scrutiny over staffing levels , with senators questioning whether the agency’s 543 employees can handle expanded crypto oversight responsibilities that Congress is preparing to assign through pending legislation, including the CLARITY Act. The nominee, currently chief counsel for the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, has pledged to help make America “ the Crypto Capital of the World ” while building regulatory structures that support developer innovation and enforce traditional market safeguards on new exchanges. Michael Selig. | Source: The Intercept CFTC Clears Regulatory Deck With Major Policy Overhaul Acting Chair Caroline Pham announced yesterday that the agency is withdrawing its 2020 “ actual delivery ” guidance for virtual currencies, eliminating compliance barriers that penalized crypto firms with overly complex rules built around a 28-day asset possession standard. The outdated framework, designed when regulators were still uncertain about the crypto market’s development, classified digital assets as a separate regulatory category from traditional commodities, despite years of market maturation and improved custody practices. “ Eliminating outdated and overly complex guidance that penalizes the crypto industry and stifles innovation is exactly what the Administration has set out to do this year, ” Pham said in a statement. The withdrawal allows Bitcoin , Ethereum , and other digital assets to fall under the CFTC’s general technology-neutral framework, reducing compliance burdens for exchanges seeking to list new products while normalizing crypto alongside traditional commodities. The change arrives days after the agency authorized spot crypto trading on federally regulated futures exchanges for the first time, bringing direct buying and selling of digital assets onto platforms that have operated under federal standards for nearly a century. @ CFTC approves spot crypto trading on U.S. futures exchanges, giving investors safe, regulated access to digital assets. #SpotTrading #CFTC https://t.co/S30HuwWjGX — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 4, 2025 Tokenized Assets Gain Ground Through New Pilot Program Beyond spot trading approval, the CFTC is pressing forward with its Crypto Sprint initiative through a December 8 pilot program authorizing Bitcoin, Ether, and USDC as collateral in derivatives markets. The three-month program requires futures commission merchants to submit weekly reports on holdings, giving regulators real-time visibility into the performance of tokenized assets under supervised conditions while establishing guardrails to protect customers. The agency simultaneously issued guidance confirming that tokenized real-world assets, such as U.S. Treasuries and money market funds, can be evaluated within existing regulatory frameworks. It also granted no-action relief for firms seeking to accept certain non-securities digital assets as customer margin, addressing custody, segregation, valuation haircuts, and operational risks that have kept institutions on the sidelines.

The White House had reportedly vetted several alternatives , including former CFTC official Josh Sterling and Treasury counselor Tyler Williams, before settling on Selig, who previously advised blockchain clients in private practice and worked on digital asset policy under former CFTC Chair J. Christopher Giancarlo. The agency has operated in crisis mode since January, when Chair Rostin Behnam resigned after overseeing major enforcement actions, including the $4.3 billion Binance settlement. Commissioner Kristin Johnson departed in September , while Caroline Pham announced plans to join MoonPay once a successor is confirmed, leaving the five-seat commission barely functional and slowing policy coordination with Congress on legislation that would grant the CFTC primary oversight of spot crypto markets under frameworks outlined in the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets report.

This isn’t just another financial filing; it’s a bold plan to issue company shares natively on the Solana blockchain. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, this signals a pivotal moment where traditional finance embraces blockchain’s core infrastructure. What Makes This IPO Application So Revolutionary? Figure’s initial attempt to go public faced hurdles, common in the stringent regulatory environment. However, their renewed IPO application carries a groundbreaking twist. The company, a blockchain-based lending platform, intends to leverage Solana’s high-speed, low-cost network to issue and manage its public shares. This approach tackles long-standing issues in traditional IPOs, such as settlement delays and opaque ownership records. Therefore, this isn’t merely about raising capital. It’s a live test case for tokenizing real-world equity on a public blockchain. The success of this IPO application could pave the way for other companies to follow, creating a more efficient and transparent public market. Why Solana? The Blockchain of Choice Solana’s official X account announced the news, highlighting its role as the chosen platform. But what drives this decision? Figure’s choice hinges on Solana’s technical strengths, which are critical for a smooth public offering. Speed and Scalability: Solana processes thousands of transactions per second, essential for handling the potential volume of a publicly traded stock. Low Transaction Costs: Minimal fees make micro-transactions and fractional ownership economically viable. Proven Infrastructure: The network supports a growing ecosystem of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, providing the necessary tools for secondary market trading. By building its IPO application around Solana, Figure positions itself at the forefront of a financial evolution. Navigating the SEC: Challenges and Opportunities Filing an IPO application with the SEC is complex. Adding a novel blockchain component increases the scrutiny. The regulatory body must assess investor protection, market fairness, and compliance within this new framework. Key challenges include: Defining the digital share’s legal status as a security. Ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) rules. Establishing clear custody solutions for institutional investors. However, a successful approval would be a monumental win. It would validate blockchain’s utility for mainstream capital markets and potentially encourage clearer regulations for future crypto-native public offerings. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors What does this mean for you? This development is more than news; it’s a signal of maturation. A successful IPO application from Figure could act as a catalyst. Watch Regulatory Sentiment: The SEC’s response will signal its openness to blockchain-based traditional finance products. Monitor Solana’s Ecosystem: Increased institutional use cases could drive further development and demand for the SOL token. Evaluate Fintech-Crypto Synergy: Look for other companies bridging these worlds, as they may be next in line for similar innovative offerings. This move demonstrates that real-world asset tokenization is progressing from theory to practice. A Compelling Summary: A Bridge Between Two Worlds Figure’s second IPO application is a daring experiment with far-reaching implications. It represents a direct bridge between the regulated world of the SEC and the innovative potential of the Solana blockchain. If successful, it could revolutionize how companies go public, making the process faster, cheaper, and more accessible. For the crypto industry, it’s a powerful step toward legitimacy and integration with the global financial system. The filing will be a key event to watch, as its outcome will shape the future of both fintech and blockchain. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Figure Technologies? A1: Figure is a financial technology company that originally focused on blockchain-based home equity lending and has expanded into other areas like banking and capital markets, leveraging distributed ledger technology. Q2: Why is this a “second” IPO application? A2: Figure had previously filed for an IPO in 2021 but later withdrew the application. This new filing represents a revised and updated attempt to become a publicly traded company. Q3: What does “issuing shares natively on Solana” mean? A3: It means the digital representation of Figure’s stock (its shares) would be created and exist directly on the Solana blockchain as tokens, rather than just being recorded in a traditional database. This could enable faster trading and settlement. Q4: How would buying these shares work for a regular investor? A4: Details are still pending SEC approval. It would likely involve using a compatible crypto wallet or a brokerage that supports blockchain-based securities, potentially making the process different from buying stock on platforms like Robinhood or Fidelity. Q5: What are the main risks of this blockchain IPO? A5> The primary risks are regulatory uncertainty, potential technical vulnerabilities on the blockchain, and the novelty of the model, which hasn’t been tested at this scale for a U.S. public company. Q6: Could this affect the price of Solana’s SOL token? A6> Potentially, yes. Increased institutional use and transaction volume on the Solana network from such a high-profile application could positively influence demand for SOL, but it depends on many broader market factors.

The report explains how Ripple is steadily positioning XRP as a key infrastructure asset for international payments rather than a speculative instrument. Traders and investors now look at XRP’s functional role in payments alongside its price trends. Ripple’s Strategic Focus on ODL DAS highlights Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity product, now branded Ripple Payments, as XRP’s most important real-world use case. The system converts fiat into XRP, transfers it across borders in seconds, and settles in local currency upon arrival. In the second quarter of 2025, ODL processed $1.3 billion in payments. While this remains small compared to traditional networks, it shows measurable growth and adoption among over 300 financial institutions, including SBI Holdings, Santander, and Tranglo. At the time of the research, Ripple held 36 billion XRP in escrow and maintained nearly 5 billion tokens as a spendable balance. DAS notes that this centralization creates both a structural advantage and potential market risk. The company’s control allows coordinated liquidity and settlement support, but also raises questions about large future sell-offs as adoption expands. Source: X Regulatory Progress and Ledger Activity Recent regulatory clarity has shifted market perception. Following the U.S. SEC closing its case against Ripple in 2025, XRP is confirmed as a non-security for public trading. On-chain activity also increased: Q3 2024 saw a 500% jump in transactions, and early 2025 averaged 2 million daily transactions. About 75% settle in under five seconds, showcasing the network’s capability to handle high-volume, low-cost cross-border payments. Ripple’s launch of the dollar-backed RLUSD stablecoin also expands its institutional reach. Held in custody at BNY Mellon, RLUSD underpins new liquidity corridors and complements XRP as a bridge asset. The acquisition of prime broker Hidden Road strengthens institutional settlement capabilities directly on the XRP Ledger. These moves indicate a deliberate push to integrate XRP into broader financial infrastructure. Positioning XRP for Global Payment Systems DAS Research emphasizes XRP’s structural advantages, including fast settlement, low cost, neutral bridge functionality, and institutional-grade reliability. Ripple integrates stablecoins like RLUSD into its network , with XRP providing liquidity and acting as the bridge asset. This ecosystem design helps scale settlements across banks, fintechs, and cross-border networks while maintaining speed and transparency. Source: X Catalysts and Future Prospects The research identifies key catalysts shaping XRP’s trajectory. RippleNet partnerships, RLUSD corridor openings, and institutional custody improvements create new pathways for on-chain settlement. Exchange-Traded Funds and upcoming XRPL upgrades further support mainstream adoption. Regulatory approvals, worldwide licensing, and emerging ZK-enabled identity layers are designed to enhance bank-level chain utilization. Analysts now question how quickly partners will shift from interest-only usage to direct on-chain XRP settlements. DAS Research Perspective Stern Drew notes that the report demonstrates XRP’s role as infrastructure rather than a tradable token. Ripple is no longer competing with other cryptocurrencies; instead, it competes with traditional payment systems. DAS shows that XRP’s adoption grows among institutions seeking predictable value transfer. This strategic positioning underscores the potential for XRP to become a backbone for global cross-border financial flows.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-12 11:43:21

The token saw short-term price pressure following a week where major holders reportedly sold hundreds of millions of XRP. Whale Activity Drives Pressure According to analyst Ali Martinez, whales offloaded 280 million tokens in the past week alone. The chart shows that wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP have been consistently reducing their balances since late September. Whales sold 280 million $XRP in the past week. pic.twitter.com/0DyORAssj3 — Ali (@alicharts) December 12, 2025 As these holdings fell, XRP’s price followed a similar path, sliding from over $3 to just above $2. A report from CryptoPotato also noted that more than 500 million XRP worth over $1 billion was sold by large holders during the same period. At the same time, exchange supply dropped to 2.6 billion tokens, with 1.35 billion tokens withdrawn over two months. In addition, withdrawals from Upbit, South Korea’s leading crypto exchange, are rising for the first time since 2023. CW stated , “A new wave of Ripple is starting to emerge on Korean exchanges.” XRP Holds Key Support XRP is hovering around the $2 support level. CryptoWZRD commented that the asset has yet to break down, and holding above $2.1 could trigger the next move higher. Ripple’s token traded between $1.99 and $2.05 over the past 24 hours, showing low volatility. This tight range could widen if volume increases near resistance or support levels. Looking back at historical patterns, a chart from ChartNerd compares the current XRP structure to a similar move seen in 2017. In both cases, it completed an ABC correction and bounced from a Fibonacci demand zone. In 2017, that led to a breakout. If this structure plays out again, the chart points to a potential target near $28. Developments in ETFs and DeFi Outside of price, XRP continues to see growing infrastructure. 21Shares’ proposed spot XRP ETF is nearing approval. The Cboe BZX Exchange has certified its listing. The ETF, called TOXR, would be the fifth spot XRP product available in the US. The funds have seen 19 consecutive days of inflows. Separately, Hex Trust is launching wrapped XRP (wXRP), which will allow the token to be used across DeFi platforms and blockchains. wXRP will enable trading without third-party bridges, expanding the token’s reach beyond its native network.

Kamino announced its plans during the Solana Breakpoint event in Abu Dhabi. Kamino will shift from pure crypto lending to a wider selection of DeFi products, offering six new services. The app is trying to adapt to a shifting DeFi climate, as Solana attempts to gain a wider share of DeFi and external liquidity. The biggest shift on Kamino will affect its capacity to tokenize real-world assets. Kamino chose this path of expansion after significant RWA growth in the past year. Introducing the new Kamino A refreshed brand. Six new products. A platform built for the next generation of assets and institutions moving onchain. Welcome to the next chapter 🧵 pic.twitter.com/MVrfl3NGro — Kamino (@kamino) December 12, 2025 Kamino previously worked to provide liquidity and increase its influence by accepting multiple meme tokens as collateral. The protocol accrued $2.59B in total value locked. The slower Solana meme market and the risky collateral, however, led Kamino to reshape its business. The protocol now aims to become the bridge between asset tokenization and DeFi. Kamino targets institutional users During the Solana meme boom, Kamino served retail and whale insiders, providing USDC liquidity against stablecoins. For 2026, Kamino set a new plan, aiming to offer institutional-grade services. To that end, Kamino unveiled its six new products, partially linked to its lending structure. Kamino will add a fixed-rate product, locking the borrowing rate for a certain term. FalconX will become the pilot borrower, demonstrating the institutional-grade credit. Another product will build a lending market through borrowing intents. Potential borrowers will post their desired terms, and will be matched with lenders. Lending in the crypto space is a bit too volatile. Rates depend on liquidity pool utilization and can vary widely, creating high-risk, unpredictable loans. By necessity, crypto has also had to use much larger collateral to secure some of its loans, leading to inefficiencies that are not acceptable to institutions. Kamino will also integrate off-chain collateral, allowing on-chain borrowing for assets in qualified custody. The protocol will use Chainlink data and issue loans in partnership with Anchorage Digital . Kamino will also join the private credit trend by launching a new BTC-backed USDC vault. For RWA expansion, the protocol aims to launch a specialized DEX. The protocol will build liquidity for tokenized assets, while also using precise oracles for pricing. Currently, XStocks is the standard of Solana-based tokenized stocks, but the assets are not integrated into DeFi. The last new product will be a Build Kit, targeting developers with SDK and API access, to integrate Kamino yield into other apps. Kamino is still the leading lending protocol on Solana Kamino Lend is still the biggest lending protocol on Solana. As a whole, the chain carries $3.6B locked in lending liquidity, of which Kamino has a share of up to 75%. Kamino lost some of its liquidity and market share in the past months, but remains the leading lending protocol on Solana. | Source: DeFi Llama The biggest competitor of Kamino is Jupiter Lend, which emerged in the second half of 2025 and quickly started accumulating loans. Initially, Kamino even tried to prevent its users from using Jupiter Lend. The recent expansion with new products may boost the overall market share of Kamino and offset some of the lost revenues from retail users switching to Jupiter Lend.

His post created immediate interest because the pattern shows XRP pressing into the apex of a tightening formation. He predicted that a massive breakout is coming within 72 hours and attached a daily chart to support that claim. The chart displays a symmetrical triangle , where the asset’s price is squeezed between descending resistance and rising support. $XRP MASSIVE BREAKOUT WITHIN 72 HOURS!!! pic.twitter.com/VvK2HQirlC — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 10, 2025 Compression Strengthens Short-Term Expectations XRP’s recent behavior supports his view. The price printed lower highs throughout November. Buyers then stepped in at a higher low near the end of the month. This shift created the structure visible in his chart. Steph focuses on the current squeeze because it sits on a clear timeline . Each daily close now matters as XRP heads to the apex of the triangle. The digital asset currently sits closer to the resistance line than the support line, trading near $2. That position raises expectations for an upward break, although confirmation only comes when the price clears the upper boundary with strength. The End of XRP’s Consolidation Traders are currently watching XRP’s volume, wick behavior, and the speed of its upward movement. XRP has held above $2 for several sessions and formed a cluster of candles that reflect steady demand. Buyers continue to defend the region despite slower momentum. This behavior often shows accumulation during consolidation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The current structure gives both sides clear conditions. A break above the trendline offers a path toward higher levels . A drop below the rising support could shift control to sellers, ending the consolidation with a significant decline. What Comes Next for XRP? XRP now has less than 3 days to break above the descending line that has capped every rally since early November. A clean move through this barrier will give bulls fresh conviction. Some analysts have set the next targets as high as $2.73 before even bigger rallies begin. This level serves as a checkpoint for traders tracking the pattern. A strong breakout can attract new buyers as long as XRP maintains closes above these levels. However, if sellers gain control, XRP may revisit the $1.9 area. Traders will monitor this level because a drop beneath it weakens the current structure.

However, with conviction still thin and macro uncertainty lingering, traders are split on whether this move signals stabilization or just a short lived relief rally. Crypto Markets Bounce From Key Support Levels The crypto markets saw a coordinated rebound after defending critical support, easing immediate downside pressure. The total crypto market cap saw a 2.18% rise to the $3.15 trillion mark. Bitcoin saw a wick that fell to as low as $89,200 but prices soon rallied passed the psychological $90,000 region and now retesting the crucial resistance at the $94,000 mark. From an altcoin perspective, the TOTAL2 chart saw a 2.65% rally and now sits at $1.26 trillion. The OTHERS chart, which is often seen as a barometer for how mid to small caps are performing also saw a ~4% rise. Bitcoin Reclaims $91K After Holding Critical Support Bitcoin rebounded from intraday lows of the $89,500 – $90,000 zone before reclaiming $92,000 as of this writing. The $90-91K area has acted as a key technical support range for three weeks now. A clean support line of this zone helped slow selling pressure after the latest macro-driven volatility spike. Momentum, however, remains mixed. Trading volumes have yet to show a decisive expansion, suggesting the rebound is being driven more by positioning adjustments than fresh conviction buying. Altcoins Turn Green as Risk Appetite Improves Altcoins broadly followed Bitcoin higher as risk appetite in the short term improved. Ethereum continues to outperform Bitcoin, a trend that’s been in place since the start of the month. Solana was the other standout top 10 altcoin to perform with a 6% rise. Other notable gainers were Hyperliquid with a 4.7% move up, Zcash posting a 8% rise and Sui rallying by 7%. The rebound extended into higher beta segments, with memecoins recovering in tandem. The memecoin sector as a whole rose by ~7% with coins like Bonk, MemeCore and SPX6900 all rallying ~5% This synchronized move highlights Bitcoin’s continued role as the primary market driver, with altcoin performance closely tied to BTC’s ability to hold key levels. What Drove Today’s Bounce? One factor supporting the rebound was renewed optimism around U.S. Federal Reserve Policy. After the Fed announced another round of interest rate cuts, expectations that rates may stabilize rather than tighten further helped improve short term sentiment across risk assets. Position dynamics also played a role. Short liquidations and a reduction in leveraged exposure helped relieve immediate selling pressure, allowing prices to climb higher. Finally, dip buying activity emerged around well defined technical support zones. Rather than aggressive accumulation, the flow appears defensive, aimed at protecting key levels rather than starting a new trend. Relief Rally or Bull Trap? Analysts Remain Split From a bullish perspective, a successful retest of support suggest sellers may be losing momentum. Volatility has begun to contract and if Bitcoin can build above current levels, traders see room for a move back above the $94k-$95k region. The opposing view remains cautious, Follow through has been limited and broader macro uncertainty continues to cap upside. Without a clear expansion in volume and participation, the rebound risks forming a lower high within a broader corrective structure. Onchain data adds another perspective. BTC short term holders, coins held for one to three months remain deep in loss. This group has entered one of 2025’s largest pain zones. In the short term, that overhang keeps pressure on price, as weak hands could potentially sell into each rally. Over time, however, such deep loss pockets tend to appear closer to the later stages of a correction. Key Levels Traders Are Watching On the upside, resistance sits in the $94K range, where prior breakdowns and supply clusters remain active. A failure to reclaim this zone could reinforce the relief rally narrative. Derivatives positioning supports this view, with liquidation data showing a concentration of shot leverage just above price. A push through resistance trigger stop-driven upside, leading to a quick expansion rather than a slow grind up On the downside, $90K remains the first key support, with 88K acting as the next critical level. A loss of these supports would likely reintroduce downside volatility and test market confidence. A clean loss of $90K would increase the probability of price being drawn toward this deeper liquidity pocket, potentially accelerating downside pressure. In short, price is currently positioned between nearby upside liquidity and heavier downside liquidity, making reactions around these levels crucial for determining the next directional move. Market Outlook As of this writing, crypto markets show signs of stability but lack clear confirmation. Traders are watching volume, price follow-through and upcoming macro signals. Caution remains, even as prices recover from recent lows.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-12 11:52:21

This exploration follows the company’s completion of a staggering share sale worth up to $20 billion. But what does this mean for the crypto ecosystem and investors seeking liquidity? Let’s dive into the details of this potential financial revolution. What is Tether Planning with Stock Tokenization? According to a Bloomberg report citing insider sources, Tether is actively evaluating options like stock tokenization to provide liquidity for its investors. This initiative comes on the heels of a monumental share sale that valued the company at an eye-watering $500 billion. The core idea is to convert traditional company shares into digital tokens on a blockchain. Therefore, this process would allow for faster, more transparent, and potentially more accessible trading of equity stakes. The reported $20 billion share sale itself was a strategic maneuver. Sources indicate Tether blocked some existing shareholders from selling their stakes at a lower valuation, aiming to maintain and solidify its monumental $500 billion price tag. Moreover, the company plans to restrict existing shareholders from selling in future funding rounds. Consequently, the need for alternative liquidity solutions, like tokenization, becomes not just an innovation but a necessity. Why is Stock Tokenization a Game-Changer? Stock tokenization represents a seismic shift in how we think about ownership and liquidity. But what are the real benefits? Let’s break it down: Enhanced Liquidity: Tokenized shares can be traded 24/7 on global digital asset exchanges, breaking free from traditional market hours and settlement delays. Fractional Ownership: Large-value shares can be divided into smaller tokens, making investment accessible to a broader audience. Transparency and Security: Every transaction is recorded on an immutable blockchain ledger, reducing fraud and increasing trust. Operational Efficiency: It automates and streamlines processes like clearing and settlement, slashing costs and time. For Tether, a leader in the stablecoin space, venturing into stock tokenization is a logical yet ambitious expansion. It leverages their expertise in digital assets to solve a classic finance problem: providing smooth exit options for investors in a highly valued, private company. However, this path is not without its hurdles, including regulatory navigation and market acceptance. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Tether? While the potential of stock tokenization is immense, the road ahead is complex. Regulatory frameworks for security tokens are still evolving globally. Tether will need to work closely with financial authorities to ensure compliance, which could be a lengthy process. Furthermore, the success of such a model depends on creating a robust and liquid secondary market for these tokens—a challenge that requires significant trust and participation from institutional and retail investors alike. The company’s reported tactics during the share sale, such as limiting shareholder sales, highlight its focus on controlling its valuation narrative. Exploring stock tokenization or share buybacks are proactive measures to manage investor relations and capital structure in the long term. This strategic foresight is crucial for maintaining stability and confidence, especially for a company whose primary product, USDT, is a cornerstone of the crypto economy. The Future of Finance: A Tokenized World? Tether’s exploration is more than a corporate strategy; it’s a signal. It indicates a growing convergence between decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional equity markets. If successful, Tether could create a blueprint for other large, private tech and crypto companies to follow, unlocking trillions in currently illiquid private capital. In conclusion, Tether’s potential move into stock tokenization following its historic $20 billion share sale is a watershed moment. It demonstrates how cryptocurrency pioneers are not just creating parallel financial systems but are actively innovating to solve core issues within the legacy system. This bold step could enhance liquidity, democratize access, and pave the way for a more integrated and efficient global financial landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is stock tokenization? Stock tokenization is the process of converting the ownership rights of a traditional stock or share into a digital token on a blockchain. This token represents the same equity but can be traded more flexibly on digital asset platforms. Why is Tether considering stock tokenization? Following a massive $20 billion share sale, Tether is exploring tokenization (alongside options like buybacks) to provide its investors with a liquid way to trade their shares, as it plans to restrict sales in future traditional funding rounds. What are the main benefits of tokenizing stocks? The key benefits include increased liquidity through 24/7 trading, the possibility of fractional ownership, greater transparency from blockchain recording, and reduced settlement times and costs. What is the valuation of Tether based on the share sale? The recent share sale was reportedly based on a company valuation of $500 billion, a figure Tether is keen to protect by controlling secondary market sales. Are tokenized stocks legal? The legality varies by jurisdiction. They are generally treated as securities, so any issuance must comply with local securities regulations, which is a significant hurdle for companies like Tether. How does this affect USDT and Tether’s stability? Tether states that its operational reserves fully back USDT. This equity move is a separate corporate financing activity. However, the company’s overall financial health and innovation can influence market confidence in its stablecoin.

55685581,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=877156,1765540650,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55685581.jpeg,Top 10 Best Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) for 2026,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-dedecentralized-exchanges/,"The gap between centralized and decentralized has narrowed down significantly in the last few years. DEXs are no longer just alternatives to Binance or Coinbase. Some of them are now capable of processing trades faster, at lower cost, and even features that centralized platforms can’t match. The top decentralized exchanges have moved beyond just basic token swaps. They offer programmable liquidity, cross-chain executions, and even institutional derivatives. Picking the right DES depends on what you’re looking for: swapping stablecoins, trading perpetual swaps, yield farming, or speculating on meme coins. What Makes a Great DEX in 2026? Key Selection Criteria We are looking for 8 key factors when choosing a DEX. When selecting the best decentralized exchanges for 2026, we considered security, liquidity, and UX, among other factors. Security & Audit History Security is everything for both centralized and decentralized exchanges. No amount of features can make up for funds lost in hacks. Decentralized exchanges are prone to additional risks, including protocol and smart contract vulnerabilities and front-running. However, they’re also unique in a way that everything is transparent. All users can see every trade, the funds held, and the smart contracts that enable the exchange’s operation. This way, all vulnerabilities, if any, are exposed up front. DEXs such as Uniswap, Curve, and Balancer command a premium due to their battle-tested track record and multiple market cycles. Liquidity – Token Depth, Volume, Slippage With a DEX, higher liquidity and volume can reduce slippage, enabling more efficient trades. Liquidity is often defined by the TVL (Total Value Locked). However, the raw TVL is often misleading. A high turnover ratio, along with high TVL, indicates that locked capital is used efficiently. DEXs have come a long way from concentrated liquidity pools. We now have automated liquidity management built directly into the protocols, enabling passive LPs to earn competitive yields without constantly adjusting their positions. Fees (Gas, Platform Fees, Swap Fees) Trading on a DEX incurs three major costs: gas, platform, and swapping. All three are consolidated into a single contract on most major DEXs for convenience. Gas fee is paid to the network for the trading process. With newer smart contracts, multi-hop swaps settle net balances at the end of the swap. This cuts the gas costs by up to 99% for complex trades. The platform fee is usually a fixed percentage that is paid to the exchange. The swap fee, on the other hand, is more complex. It depends on the trading pair and liquidity available. If there’s not enough liquidity, you might experience a higher fare in the form of slippage. Multi-Chain / Cross-Chain Support With L1 protocols (Ethereum), L2 Protocols (Base, Arbitrum, Optimism), and non-EVM protocols (Solana), there’s a lot of liquidity scattered across them. The best DEXs can efficiently navigate across multiple chains in the background, providing the best possible rates for their users. The protocol handles bridging and routing behind the scenes. UX/Wallet Compatibility MetaMask and WalletConnect have become industry standards. Additionally, some exchanges offer native support for hardware wallets or even account abstraction on ZK-rollups. Users can pay for gas with the token they’re swapping rather than holding ETH. Composability With DeFi: Lending, Staking, Yield, Bridges The best DEXs go beyond just chains to unlock liquidity. They can tap into various DeFi protocols such as lending protocols, staking platforms, and yield aggregators. One example is Balancer V3’s Boosted Pools. It automatically routes idle liquidity to Aave to earn interest. When there’s a large swap, that liquidity is needed and recalled via flash loans, enabling LPs to earn both swap fees and interest on lending to Aave. Decentralization & Protocol Governance Since most DEXs are inherently decentralized, their governance tokens are important in their operations. dYdX distributes 100% of its trading fees to stakers. Uniswap activated a similar fee switch in late 2025. A new development in this space is permissioned hooks. It enables protocols to serve institutional clients with KYC requirements without compromising the core protocol’s permissionless nature. Reputation, Community, and Transparency Finally, reputation is very important in the crypto space. Protocols like Curve and Uniswap have withstood high-profile attacks and continue to do so. It comes down to their transparency and the community that bands behind them. The longer a protocol survives, the more likely it is to continue to survive. Best Decentralized Exchanges 2026 1. Uniswap (v4 / Unichain): Best Overall Multi-Chain DEX Uniswap is no longer just a DEX. It’s an essential piece of infrastructure that keeps the DeFi ecosystem running. It was among the first popular decentralized exchanges and has evolved over the years to keep pace with trends. The latest V4 upgrade and Unichain (its dedicated L2) have cemented its position as the leading DEX for most traders. The Singleton architecture consolidates all pools into a single contract, and multi-hop swaps are settled in a single transaction rather than transferring tokens at each step. Implementation of Hooks allows developers to add additional custom logic, such as dynamic market fees and KYC gates for institutional investors. Its next innovation, Unichain runs on the OP stack with 1-second block times. The MEV from this operation is distributed to UNI token stakers. It has made UNI token a yield-bearing asset. Strengths: Deepest liquidity, programmable pools via hooks, Unichain for cheap L2 trading, and a mature ecosystem with staking rewards. Limitations: Ethereum mainnet remains expensive, and the hooks ecosystem is still maturing. Unichain is also a very new product. Best for: General trading, developers building DeFi apps, and institutions needing custom liquidity. 2. SushiSwap (SushiX, cross-chain, rollups) Best for Aggregated Liquidity and Cross-Chain Swaps After launching as a regular DEX, SushiSwap reinvented itself as a cross-chain aggregation layer. Its Route Processor 6 (RP6) aggregates liquidity from hundreds of sources across 35+ blockchains. SushiCSwap handles atomic cross-chain swaps. For example, you can swap ETH on Ethereum for SOL on Solana in one transaction. The protocol handles bridging, swapping, and gas fees across all chains. SushiSwap also has a “Franchise Model.” Wara on Solana and Saru on Aptos are Sushi-incubated DEXs that share routing with the main hub and provide additional liquidity. Strengths: Cross-chain swaps without manual bridging, aggregated routing across multiple DEXs, and 35+ blockchains supported. Limitations: Multi-chain operations can get confusing for new users if they’re not familiar with the chains. Best for: Multi-chain users who hold assets across Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and Base. 3. PancakeSwap (v4, BNB/BNB-Chain) Best Low-Fee & High-Speed DEX for BNB Chain Users Launched in the early days of the BNB chain, PancakeSwap still remains the dominant DEX on the network. While PancakeSwap is not operated or owned by Binance, the exchange has made strategic investments in it. It has shed its “Meme Casino” reputation and become a serious source of liquidity. The V4 upgrade brings Singleton architecture and supports multiple pool types: concentrated liquidity for major pairs and bin-based liquidity book for stablecoins. The exchange also operates as a SpringBoard for game developers to launch tokens with built-in vesting and anti-bot mechanics. Strengths: Very low fees, fast transactions, and GameFi integration with 7 million active users Limitations: Centralization concerns on BNB Chain and a smaller token selection than Ethereum DEXs. Best for: Retail users, gamers, and traders wanting low fees and yield farming on BNB Chain. 4. Curve Finance : Best for Stablecoin & Low-Slippage Swaps Curve serves as the backbone for stablecoin and Liquid Staking Token (LST) liquidity. StableSwap minimizes slippage for correlated assets, such as stablecoin-to-stablecoin trades and wstETH/rETH swaps. Curve’s LLAMMA (Lending-Liquidating Automated Market Maker Algorithm) revolutionized the way decentralized lending works. Instead of liquidating the collateral immediately when its value declines, LLAMMA gradually converts it into stablecoins and redeems it when it recovers. This prevents liquation cascades and also reduces borrower risk. Curve has also expanded into on-chain forex with pools for non-USD stablecoins like EURC and XSGD. The veCRV governance mechanism creates long-term alignment by locking tokens to boost yields and vote on emissions. Strengths: Lowest slippage for stable pairs, crvUSD lending integration, and sustainable yield via veCRV. Limitations: Not suited for token trading, and Ethereum mainnet gas costs on L1 are high. Best for: Whales, DAO treasuries, and yield farmers seeking stable, low-volatility returns. 5. Balancer (Balancer v3): Best for Custom Liquidity Pools & Multi-Asset LPs Balancer operates as a decentralized asset management platform where liquidity does not sit idle. Boosted pools automatically route idle assets to lending protocols like Aave. When a large swap occurs, the liquidity is recalled via flash loans. This way, LPs can earn yield from both the swap fees and lending. Balancer V3 vault handles token accounting, while AMM math is handled externally. Developers can launch new curve types without building a new DEX. Balancer provides the infrastructure for others to build on and innovate. Strengths: Boosted pools for maximized yield, flexible multi-asset pools (80/20 weights reduce impermanent loss), and composable architecture. Earn passive income safely. Limitations: More complexity than standard AMMs, and also custom pools carry custom risks that investors need to look out for. Best for: Passive investors seeking index fund exposure and DAO treasuries seeking yield on idle assets. It’s ideal for investors looking to optimize the returns on their liquidity. 6. dYdX (v4): Best for On-Chain Orderbook Trading + Margin/Perpetuals With Efficiency Of Centralized Exchanges dYdX was among the first decentralized perpetual-trading platforms on Ethereum. However, it has now moved to its own Cosmos-based platform with 2,000+ TPS and millisecond latency, rivalling centralized exchanges in performance. The order book lives in validator memory and matches off-chain with leverage trading. However, the final transactions are settled on-chain. It combines the speed and efficiency of a centralized exchange with the transparency of a decentralized exchange platform. All trading fees go to DYDX stakers and validators. Permissionless listing via decentralized governance lets dYdX add new markets faster than any centralized crypto exchange. The 2026 roadmap includes plans for “Designated Proposers” to integrate HFT firms and spot markets. Strengths: Order book model with limit orders and stop-losses, high leverage derivatives, real yield to stakers, and institutional-grade API. Limitations: Less token variety than AMM-based DEXs and comes with a steep learning curve for casual traders. Best for: Professional traders, algorithmic strategies, and users seeking high-leverage perpetual futures trading. 7. Raydium / Orca (Solana Chain): Best for High-Speed / Low-Fee Trading On Solana Radium and Orca are the two leading DEXs on the Solana Blockchain. Both operate as AMMs for fast, low-cost token swaps. Radium integrates with both OpenBook Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) for limit orders, along with standard AMM swaps. It dominates long-tail DeFi markets and meme coin launches by supporting permissionless pools for new tokens. Orca, by contrast, emphasizes user-friendliness and focuses primarily on AMM swaps. Concentrated liquidity pools via Whirlpools enable liquidity providers to focus their capital on specific price ranges, improving trading efficiency and yields. It reduces slippage on major pairs, making it ideal for retail swaps even during significant price fluctuations. Solana’s Firedancer validator recently surpassed 1 million TPS. For both Raydium and Orca, it promises stable transactions with trades confirmed under 400 milliseconds. Strengths: Sub-400ms finality, near-zero transaction fees ($0.0002), dominant meme coin liquidity, and Firedancer performance. Limitations : Solana ecosystem is smaller than Ethereum, and the network has had historical congestion issues. Best for: Solana natives, meme coin traders, and high-frequency on-chain traders. 8. Trader Joe (LFJ) : Best for Innovative AMM Mechanics & Vertical Integration On Avalanche Trader Joe uses an innovative Liquidity Book model, “discrete price bins,” instead of continuous curves. Within a bin, all trades can occur at a fixed price, with zero slippage if the trade is smaller than the bin size. Bid Barn adds a central limit order book alongside the AMM, capturing volume that demands limit orders. Additionally, Token Mill offers bonding-curve token launches with built-in liquidity depth from day one. The recent expansion to Monad with 10,000 TPS positions Trader Joe highly for high-throughput cryptocurrency trading. Strengths: Liquidity Book innovation, hybrid AMM + CLOB, Token Mill for early-stage projects, multi-chain presence Limitations: Smaller TVL than Ethereum DEXs; bin-based LP management requires active engagement Best for: Active liquidity managers, users hunting early-stage token launches 9. SyncSwap / zkSwap Finance (zk-Rollup DEX): Best for Low Gas & ZK-Native Features ZK-rollups offers advanced trading tools like account abstraction and paymasters. On these DEXs, traders can pay gas in the token they’re swapping (like USDC) instead of ETH. It removes a major friction point for traders. SyncSwap leads zkSync in volume with Multi-pool technology that combines classic, stable, and concentrated pools into a single interface. zkSwap Finance promotes a swap-to-earn model that enables users with ZF tokens for seamless trading, funded by protocol revenue. Strengths: Sub-cent gas fees, gas abstraction (pay in any token), ZK security guarantees, and a growing hyperchain ecosystem. Limitations: zkSync ecosystem is still maturing, and fewer tokens are available compared to the mainnet. Best for: Gas-sensitive traders and users seeking the lowest possible trade execution costs with Ethereum’s robust security measures. 10. Kuru (Monad) & Kodiak (Berachain): Emerging DEXs, Best for Early-Stage Liquidity & Next-Gen Architecture Two new DEXs to watch in 2026 are Kuru and Kodiak. Kuru (Mondad) Kuru has a fully on-chain order book running on Monad’s parallel EVM with 10,000 TPS. Unlike dYdX, which needs its own chain, Kuru runs on a general-purpose EVM. It’s composable, where traders can flash-loan assets from a lending protocol and trade on Kuru’s order book in the same transaction. This enables CEX speed with decentralized finance composability. Kodiak (Berachain) Berachain’s proof-of-liquidity rewards validators for directing liquidity to specific pools. Kodiak captures these flows with automated concentrated liquidity vaults that are eligible for BGT rewards. This creates protocol-level subsidies that traditional AMMs can’t match. Strengths: Novel architectures, strong ecosystem incentives, early-mover advantages, and potential for future airdrops. Limitations: High-risk new chains, unproven at scale, and potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Best for: Risk-tolerant users hunting alpha and yield farmers capitalizing on new L1 incentives.

Or if you’re trading stablecoins primarily, Curve might be the best option. Check liquidity before trading: A thin pool can lead to high slippage. This is especially important if you’re trading low-volume coins or new tokens. Aggregators like 1inch automatically split orders across multiple pools. Use small test swaps first: Verify the transaction goes through as expected before committing to larger amounts. Evaluate the full cost structure: Various fees make up a successful DEX transaction. Gas costs, cross-chain swaps, and slippage can all add up and vary by transaction complexity. Be cautious of new DEXs: These DEXs have not survived multiple attacks or stood the test of time. If you do not wat to take the risk, it is better to stick to the popular DEXs. Use hardware wallets or secure alternatives: Hot wallets are often an easy attack vector. While they’re convenient, we recommend moving your funds to a hardware wallet whenever possible. Risks and Red Flags to Watch Out For With Decentralized Crypto Exchanges Smart contract vulnerabilities: The most significant risk for decentralized exchanges is on how they employ smart contracts. If they’re not well implemented, the loss of funds is irreversible. However, new developments like hooks architecture compartmentalize the risk. Bridge failures: Protocols like SushiXSwap use bridges like LayerZero and Wormhole to unlock liquidity in multiple chains. However, this adds the risk of the bridge being exploited. Impermanent loss: A silent killer in volatile digital asset markets. Use exchanges with robust IL protection features, such as automated rebalancing and Balancer’s 80/20 pools, to reduce exposure. Front-running and MEV: Every transaction is visible in the public mempool. Bots make use of this to sandwich your trade. Use MEV-protected aggregators. Centralization risks & regulatory pressure: Not all DEXs are fully decentralized. Some aspects of exchanges remain centralized to maintain speed and efficiency. Additionally, some exchanges have large whales or a central authority that can influence the DEX’s direction. It gives rise to potential bad actors or regulatory pressure. The Bottom Line: Choosing The Right DEX Platforms The “best” DEX in 2026 entirely depends on what you’re looking to do. There’s no universal answer. If you want maximum liquidity and flexibility, Uniswap v4 is the best answer. Curve dominates stablecoin swaps while SushiXSwap is ideal for cross-chain movements. There’s no one-size-fits-all trading. These platforms have specialized into programmable liquidity layers, high-frequency order books, and yield optimization engines.

55685901,644310,1765540841,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55685901.jpeg,YouTube Goes Crypto: PYUSD Stablecoin Payout Option Now Live For US Creators,https://bitcoinist.com/youtube-goes-crypto-pyusd-stablecoin-payout-option-now-live-for-us-creators/,"YouTube has quietly added a new payout option that lets creators in the US receive earnings in PayPal’s dollar-pegged token, PYUSD. According to several reports, the change appears to be active now and is being offered through PayPal’s payout rails rather than through any direct crypto custody by YouTube . How The Option Works PayPal’s head of crypto, May Zabaneh, confirmed the setup to Fortune and said the company uses its existing payout network to deliver PYUSD to recipients who opt in. That means YouTube will still calculate and send creator earnings in dollars to PayPal’s system, and PayPal is then responsible for the conversion to the stablecoin and distribution to creators. The move builds on PayPal’s broader push to offer stablecoin tools to businesses and individual users. PYUSD was introduced by PayPal in 2023 and has since been plugged into services such as Venmo and PayPal’s merchant tools. Reports have made clear that YouTube itself is not holding or moving crypto on behalf of creators; PayPal handles the token side. Scope And Availability For the moment, the option is available only to creators based in the US. A Google spokesperson confirmed the rollout but declined to share a schedule for any expansion beyond American users. Creators who qualify for YouTube’s monetization programs may be able to opt into the new payout method for monthly earnings like ad revenue and paid memberships. Some creators will value the extra choice. Receiving PYUSD could let a creator hold a dollar-pegged token onchain, spend it where PayPal tools accept it, or convert back to fiat through PayPal. There are tradeoffs: holding a stablecoin brings different custody and tax considerations than a straight bank transfer. Reporting systems and bank rules may differ depending on how the creator finally cashes out. What Creators Should Expect The signup step should be familiar to anyone who already uses PayPal payouts on YouTube; it will likely appear as an alternative payment method in creator settings. Once chosen, payments will flow through PayPal’s established payout system and show up as PYUSD in the recipient’s compatible wallet or PayPal balance, per the descriptions circulating in the trade press. PYUSD In Numbers PYUSD’s onchain presence has grown rapidly. Market trackers list the stablecoin with close to $4 billion in circulating value and roughly 3.8 billion tokens in supply at the moment, figures that underline how much the token has expanded since launch.

According to the analyst, this formation has appeared only twice in XRP’s history, and each time has preceded a devastating loss. If the pattern were to repeat, the cryptocurrency could be headed for more pain. The analyst warns traders and investors to stop buying XRP at this time, citing heightened risk. Analyst Advices Against Buying XRP As Price Crash Looms An urgent warning from market analyst Steph is Crypto has spread across the community, as he advises traders and investors to “not touch XRP anymore.” The analyst shared a video of his XRP price forecast on a recent X post, revealing that the altcoin’s long-term indicators point to a troubling setup that could mirror downturns observed during past market cycles. Related Reading: Why Now Is The Perfect Opportunity To Short Bitcoin Down To $40,000 Steph Is Crypto shared that his study of the monthly Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) for XRP has revealed a new bearish crossover taking shape, signaling declining momentum. The analyst stated that XRP had formed a bearish crossover on the chart only twice since its inception in 2012. Both times this pattern appeared, the cryptocurrency underwent one of the most dramatic price crashes ever, losing over half its value right after. He explained that during the first bearish crossover in 2019, XRP crashed by more than 84%. Similarly, a second crossover reemerged in 2022, triggering a deep price decline of about 67%. It’s worth highlighting that each time XRP formed this bearish signal, it was after a major bull market. In 2018, the cryptocurrency staged a historic rally that sent its price to its current all-time high above $3.84. Likewise, the steep correction in 2022 came on the heels of an explosive 2021 bull market, one of the most powerful in crypto’s history. Just as in the past, Steph Is Crypto sees a bearish crossover forming once again in the current cycle, suggesting that the conditions are aligning for another devastating price crash. He admitted that he wishes he had not spotted this formation on XRP’s chart, underscoring his usually bullish stance on the cryptocurrency. The analyst has cautioned traders to take this historical setup seriously and to consider the possibility that XRP could revisit significantly lower price ranges if the pattern plays out. XRP Price Momentum Remains Weak XRP remains in a downward trend, with its price barely holding above $2.00. The cryptocurrency has dropped by over 15% so far this month, declined about 2.2% over the past week, and has crashed approximately 16% year to date, according to CoinMarketCap. Related Reading: Here’s Why Strategy’s $1 Billion Bitcoin Purchase Did Not Trigger A Price Rally XRP’s price momentum is weak, with little indication of a near-term recovery. The cryptocurrency’s Fear and Greed Index has slipped to 42, edging closer to the “fear” zone. This market uncertainty is being driven by the cryptocurrency’s sluggish price action, despite having passed $3.00 earlier this year and nearly challenging its all-time high.

Are We Really Heading Toward $27?,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-chart-is-screaming-are-we-really-heading-toward-27/,"The cryptocurrency world is no stranger to explosive forecasts. Many traders chase big targets with technical charts, trendlines, and historical cycles. When a popular analyst claims a major altcoin could hit a sky-high price, the market takes notice. This is exactly the reaction to a recent XRP chart that has stirred significant discussion online. Amonyx, a market commentator on X, shared a logarithmic XRP/USD chart applying a long-term Fibonacci extension drawn from the 2014–2018 swing. Amonyx argues this projection could imply a potential peak near $27.57 by mid-2027, linking historical bull cycles with current price action. The post quickly spread through trader communities, reigniting debate over XRP’s long-term potential. Technical Case: Fibonacci and Logarithmic Trends Fibonacci extensions are popular among technical analysts. These tools project future price levels using ratios derived from significant past price swings. In XRP’s case, using a logarithmic chart — which compresses large price moves — smooths volatility and reveals potential geometric extensions. The chart shared by Amonyx aligns with other long-term models that place high extensions well above current levels. BOOOOOOOOOOOM $XRP chart is screaming… are we really heading toward $27? Via @ChartNerdTA pic.twitter.com/aqFh8bTTfH — Amonyx (@amonbuy) December 11, 2025 Other analysts have applied similar tools and seen intermediate targets around $8–$10 or toward $22–$27 over extended cycles. These forecasts assume sustained momentum is paired with breakouts above critical resistance levels. However, even in those bullish models, reaching $27 still implies an extended multi-year growth period rather than immediate price action. Adoption and Fundamental Drivers Technical projections grow more credible when fundamentals improve. XRP’s utility is centered on Ripple’s cross-border payment infrastructure and its on-demand liquidity (ODL) network. As adoption increases, XRP sees more real-world transaction demand. The XRP Ledger processes transactions quickly and cheaply, features that differentiate it from slower, fee-heavy blockchains. Another catalyst lies in regulatory clarity. The prolonged legal dispute between Ripple and the U.S. SEC has been a major overhang. In August 2025, the SEC dropped its appeal , providing a clearer classification for XRP as a commodity for retail trading. This shift’s opened doors for big players to jump back in and maybe even bring new products like a spot ETF We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional interest could bring billions in fresh capital. Analysts have speculated that a properly regulated ETF could draw a multi-billion inflow similar to what Bitcoin and Ethereum saw with their ETF products. Headwinds and Realism No forecast is guaranteed. Technical models like Fibonacci extensions provide possible pathways, not certainties. Markets can stall, reverse, or remain range-bound for long periods if momentum fades or broader macro pressures rise. Many 2027 price models — even optimistic ones — place XRP well below $27 when factoring in typical growth projections from major forecasting platforms. Changes in rules, money flow, and the global economy often totally shake up crypto markets. XRP must break and hold key technical levels to support outsized targets. Failure to do so could mean extended consolidation in the mid-single-digit range. Conditional, Not Certain Amonyx’s $27 projection is an intriguing technical case built on historic price behavior and Fibonacci logic. It aligns with some long-term scenarios suggested by other commentators. But this target remains highly conditional. XRP would need consistent adoption, institutional inflows, and broad market support to sustain such a rally. Investors should treat the $27 figure as a long-range possibility rather than an expectation. Patience, disciplined risk management, and close monitoring of both technical and fundamental trends remain crucial.

Customers will be able to pay using the AE Coin implemented in collaboration with the AEC Wallet by Al Maryah Community Bank. The AE Coin will be integrated into ADNOC Distribution’s payment channels across its key customer touchpoints, including fuel and service stations, Oasis by ADNOC convenience stores, and car washes. Customers will be able to make instant, secure and frictionless blockchain-enabled payments using stablecoins. ADNOC goes full throttle with AE Coin Eng. Bader Saeed Al Lamki, CEO of ADNOC Distribution, noted that accepting AE Coin across its network represents a significant step in ADNOC Distribution’s journey to enhance mobility and convenience retail through innovation. He explained, “By embracing blockchain-powered transactions, we are adopting advanced technologies to create the industry’s best customer experiences, while preparing our services for the future.” Mohammed Wassim Khayata, CEO of Al Maryah Community Bank, added that through AE Coin, the company is enabling virtual asset payments and showcases real-world examples of how blockchain technology can simplify payments and enhance customer convenience. Ramez Rafeek, General Manager of AED Stablecoin LLC, explained that AE Coin was developed to make secure, instant, regulator-approved virtual asset payments a reality in daily life. He stated , “This partnership shows how licensed and fully reserved payment tokens can be used in mainstream retail environments, moving the promise of crypto from concept to real-world utility at scale.” AE Coin signs agreements with UAE government and private sector AE Coin , the first and only AED-backed stablecoin in the UAE, has signed up with telecom operators such as e& UAE, transport and logistics group 7X, real estate entity East & West International Group, as well as the Abu Dhabi Transport Department and Municipalities, Air Arabia, and more.

The platform has just announced a temporary Upbit Arbitrum suspension for deposits and withdrawals. This move affects several popular digital assets and is a direct result of essential wallet system maintenance. Let’s break down exactly what’s happening, which coins are involved, and what you should do next. What Triggered the Upbit Arbitrum Suspension? Upbit, one of South Korea’s largest and most regulated cryptocurrency exchanges, has proactively suspended all deposit and withdrawal functions for assets on the Arbitrum One network. The primary reason is scheduled wallet system maintenance. Exchanges perform these updates to enhance security, improve transaction efficiency, and integrate new network features. Therefore, this Upbit Arbitrum suspension is a standard operational procedure, not a reaction to a security breach or market event. It underscores the exchange’s commitment to providing a safe and reliable trading environment for its users. Which Cryptocurrencies Are Affected by the Halt? The maintenance specifically targets assets residing on the Arbitrum One layer-2 scaling solution. If you hold any of the following tokens on Upbit, you cannot move them on or off the exchange until the maintenance concludes: ANIME (Cryptonovae) ARB (Arbitrum’s native governance token) MLK (MiL.k) BOUNTY (Bounty0x) It is crucial to note that trading for these assets remains fully operational . You can still buy, sell, and trade ANIME, ARB, MLK, and BOUNTY against other trading pairs on the Upbit platform. The Upbit Arbitrum suspension only blocks the movement of these tokens to and from external wallets. What Should You Do During the Maintenance Window? While the suspension is in effect, your best course of action is patience. However, you can take a few proactive steps: Do Not Initiate Transfers : Avoid attempting any deposits or withdrawals of the affected assets. Transactions initiated during the maintenance window will likely fail or be delayed. Monitor Official Channels : Follow Upbit’s official announcements page or Twitter account for the exact time when services resume. Plan Your Trades : If you had planned to move funds for trading, consider using the internal market. Since spot trading is unaffected, you can execute your strategy within the exchange. This temporary Upbit Arbitrum suspension is a reminder of the importance of planning for liquidity events and understanding the technical dependencies of your holdings. Why Is This Maintenance Important for the Arbitrum Network? Arbitrum One is a leading Layer-2 network designed to make Ethereum transactions faster and cheaper. As adoption grows, exchanges like Upbit must ensure their wallet infrastructure is fully compatible and secure. This maintenance likely involves updates to node software, security patches, or improvements to transaction processing for the Arbitrum One chain. A smooth, upgraded system benefits all users by ensuring faster withdrawal times and reduced risk of errors when the Upbit Arbitrum suspension is lifted. Conclusion: A Temporary Pause for Long-Term Gain The temporary Upbit Arbitrum suspension for ANIME, ARB, MLK, and BOUNTY is a routine but necessary procedure.

Announced via its official X account, this feature integrates decentralized forecasting directly into the wallet experience, potentially changing how millions of users interact with future events. What is the Phantom Prediction Market? The new service is not built from scratch. Instead, Phantom leverages proven technology from Kalshi, a regulated decentralized prediction market platform. This strategic partnership allows Phantom to offer a seamless, familiar trading experience for contracts based on real-world outcomes. Users can now speculate on topics ranging from the Super Bowl winner to the next major cryptocurrency milestone, all within the Phantom interface they already trust. This integration represents a significant step in wallet evolution. Wallets are becoming comprehensive hubs for Web3 activity, not just passive tools. The Phantom prediction market service directly answers user demand for more engaging, utility-driven features within their primary crypto application. How Does This New Prediction Market Work? Think of it like a stock market for opinions. Instead of trading shares of a company, you trade contracts on the outcome of specific events. The core mechanics are straightforward: Select a Market: Browse categories like Sports, Cryptocurrency, Politics, or Pop Culture. Buy a Contract: Purchase a “Yes” contract if you believe an event will happen, or a “No” contract if you believe it won’t. Settle and Profit: When the event concludes, the correct contract settles at $1.00. If you bought it for less, you profit from the difference. The underlying technology from Kalshi ensures the markets are decentralized and the settlement is trustless. This means the outcome relies on code and oracles, not a central company’s decision. For Phantom users, it’s a secure and transparent way to test their foresight. Why Should Crypto Users Care About This Launch? The benefits of having a Phantom prediction market are multi-layered. First, it introduces a novel form of engagement. Holding assets can be passive, but predicting events is active and intellectually stimulating. It turns the wallet into a destination for daily interaction. Second, it provides a practical hedge and speculation tool. A user bullish on a specific crypto project can buy prediction contracts on its success, potentially diversifying their exposure. Conversely, it allows for nuanced bets on broader market trends without directly trading volatile assets. However, challenges exist. Prediction markets involve risk, and users must educate themselves. Regulatory landscapes for such services are also still evolving in many jurisdictions. Phantom and Kalshi will need to navigate this carefully to ensure broad, compliant access. What’s Next for Phantom and Prediction Markets? The launch is likely just the beginning. Success could lead to deeper integration, where wallet activity and prediction market behavior influence each other. Imagine earning special badges or profile features for accurate predictions, or using prediction market credentials to access exclusive DeFi pools. The actionable insight for users is clear: explore this new feature cautiously. Start with small amounts on familiar topics to understand the mechanics. This is more than a game; it’s a new financial primitive being delivered to your digital doorstep. In conclusion, Phantom’s foray into prediction markets is a masterstroke in ecosystem expansion. It leverages existing trust and user base to introduce a complex DeFi concept in a simplified, accessible package. This move doesn’t just add a feature; it redefines what a crypto wallet can be—a portal to the future, in every sense of the word. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Do I need a new account to use the Phantom prediction market? A: No. If you already have the Phantom wallet, you should be able to access the prediction market service directly within the app using your existing wallet address. Q: What can I predict on? A: The service supports contracts on a wide range of topics, including major sports events, cryptocurrency price movements, election outcomes, and entertainment awards. Q: Is my capital at risk? A: Yes. Like any form of trading or speculation, you can lose the funds you use to purchase prediction contracts. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Q: How are winning contracts settled? A> Contracts settle automatically based on verified real-world outcomes. A “Yes” contract for a true event becomes worth $1. The settlement process is handled by the decentralized Kalshi protocol. Q: Are there fees for using the service? A> While Phantom may not charge additional fees, the underlying Kalshi protocol typically includes small trading and settlement fees. Check the in-app details for the most current fee structure. Q: Is this service available worldwide? A> Availability may be subject to regional regulations governing prediction markets. Users should check their local laws and the service’s terms to confirm access in their country. Found this deep dive into the new Phantom prediction market helpful?

The 4-hour chart shows a failed breakout and a pullback, but mid-range support remains intact. SHIB remains in steady consolidation with a neutral-to-positive bias above short-term support. On 12 December 2025, Shiba Inu (SHIB) trades near $0.000008411 up 1.84% over the past 24 hours. The price moved between $0.000008212 and $0.000008586, showing steady intraday activity. SHIB remains about 90.5% below its $0.00008845 all-time high from 28 October 2021. Traders continued to track SHIB’s gradual recovery as volume and sentiment stabilized after earlier declines. Shiba Inu daily price chart: SHIB maintains higher lows as buyers reinforce structure The daily chart indicated that SHIB stayed above its short-term support region near $0.00000820, which acted as a base for the latest upward drive. Price action showed a sequence of higher lows forming gradually, suggesting an improving market structure despite the asset still facing resistance around $0.00000860. SHIB/USDT Chart: TradingView Momentum on the daily view leaned modestly bullish as the green trendline extended from earlier dips, reflecting renewed interest after the market absorbed previous sell pressure. The resistance rejection zones remained visible on the chart, but buyers demonstrated consistent engagement as long as SHIB held above its intraday support line. Shiba Inu 4-hour price chart: SHIB pauses after intraday swing, holding a neutral-to-positive bias On the 4-hour timeframe, the chart displayed a deeper swing toward $0.00000883, followed by a mild retracement into the mid-$0.00000840 area. This pattern highlighted an attempted breakout that encountered supply overhead, causing price normalization. SHIB/USDT Chart: TradingView The structure in this timeframe revealed consolidation forming after the earlier rise, pointing to a pause before the next directional move.

SHIB is likely to remain within its current consolidation zone as long as it holds above short-term support near the $0.00000840 area. Buyers have shown consistent interest on both the daily and 4-hour charts, but upside progress remains limited by the visible supply zone around $0.00000860. A break above this resistance would open room for a broader recovery, as the structure already shows higher lows supporting the trend. However, failure to clear the overhead supply could keep SHIB trading sideways, with price movements staying contained within the recent range. The market does not show signs of aggressive selling, which suggests SHIB may continue to stabilize while awaiting stronger momentum. For now, expectations lean toward continued consolidation with a slight upward bias as long as support levels remain intact. Is Shiba Inu a good investment? Shiba Inu’s investment appeal depends largely on an individual’s risk tolerance, time horizon, and interest in speculative digital assets. SHIB remains a high-volatility token that often moves with broader market sentiment rather than fundamentals, making it more suitable for traders who are comfortable with rapid price swings. The current structure shows stability above key support zones, but the token still trades more than 90% below its 2021 peak, highlighting the long-term downside it has experienced. Its performance continues to rely on market cycles, community-driven developments, and broader conditions in the crypto sector. SHIB may attract investors looking for low-cost, high-risk exposure within the meme-asset category, while others may view its uncertainty and historical drawdown as limiting factors. Anyone considering SHIB should assess their risk profile carefully and evaluate whether such volatility aligns with their investment strategy. Why is Shiba up today? SHIB is up today mainly because buyers continued to defend short-term support levels, allowing the price to stabilize and push higher within its recent range. The gradual formation of higher lows on the daily chart helped reinforce confidence among traders after earlier sell pressure eased. The intraday appreciation also reflects improving sentiment, as shown by steady activity within the $0.000008212–$0.000008586 range. With no aggressive selling visible on the chart, SHIB benefited from a mild shift toward accumulation, contributing to the 1.84% gain over the past 24 hours. Will SHIB reach $0.00005? Yes, according to the long-term SHIB price prediction, those who plan to buy Shiba Inu may see the current price projected to reach up to $0.00005 by 2030, based on a price prediction tool. Will SHIB reach $0.0001? Yes, according to crypto experts’ long-term predictions, SHIB’s role in the cryptocurrency market is projected to lead it to reach $0.0001 by 2031. Will SHIB reach $100? SHIB’s goal of reaching $100 is virtually impossible due to its vast circulating supply in the meme coin market, which significantly influences the price movements of SHIB. Additionally, to get the $100 mark, SHIB would require a significant increase in its market cap, which is beyond imagination for a meme coin. Does SHIB have an excellent long-term future? The Shiba Inu price made headlines in January 2025 after Shytoshi Kusama, the lead developer, stepped down. However, SHIB shows some positive movement, suggesting the ecosystem may have a promising long-term future. However, its success will also depend on macroeconomic factors, partnerships, broader market adoption trends, and other regulatory developments that influence market cycles. You are advised to seek investment advice, do your own research, and form expert opinions before investing in the highly volatile crypto market.

To help them on their quest, ChatGPT has identified 2 cryptocurrencies to turn $100 into $1,000 in 2026. While a 900% annual return sits firmly in high-risk territory, especially given the sector’s inherent volatility, OpenAI’s artificial intelligence algorithm argues the two assets on its list could emerge as contenders for such a run. Solana (SOL) The first pick, Solana ( SOL ), is one of the most widely used smart-contract blockchains with a rapidly expanding decentralized finance ( DeFi ) ecosystem now scheduled to welcome Wrapped XRP as well. According to the language learning model, Solana also has a technological edge that could increase its upside potential. Most notably, the network has characteristically low fees and high throughput, which serves as the core driver for institutional adoption and developer interest. Solana’s debut on Revolut this year has already proven a significant step forward. Since it has historically seen multi-fold gains in sustained bullish markets, ChatGPT reasoned, Solana has a moderate-to-high potential to soar in value if the crypto sector manages to maintain steady momentum in 2026. Solana price prediction. Source: Finbold and ChatGPT Under these market conditions, Solana price could trade in the $40–$500+ range in 2026. At press time, however, SOL was trading at only $138.4, having plunged over 9% year-to-date (YTD), so the scenario remains quite speculative. SOL YTD price chart. Source: Finbold Ozak AI (OZ) The second contender, Ozak AI ( OZ ), is a way more risky, still being in its pre-sale phase. Nonetheless, ChatGPT believes it’s worth keeping an eye on. The emerging project’s potential, OpenAI’s machine learning model predicted, lies in its blend of artificial intelligence ( AI ) and blockchain technologies . The approach has already drawn a lot of speculative interest, most certainly due to AI’s reputation as the most significant development this decade. What’s more, early data suggests some analysts project very high return on investment (ROI) in 2026, as early fundraising and community buildup have led to over 1 billion tokens being sold in pre-sales. Tokens of this nature and at this stage are extremely volatile, and many never list or gain liquidity. Those that do, however, sometimes deliver outsized returns. Should it succeed, ChatGPT sees the OZ price potentially landing above $5 in 2026. Ozak AI price prediction. Source: Finbold and ChatGPT Overall, the AI model suggests that the two entries represent practical, institutional utility on the one hand and a more conjectural play on the other, and contends that both could potentially turn a $100 investment into $1,000 within the next year, albeit admitting that OZ is a more high-risk, high-reward bet. When asked whether to go 50:50 on the two cryptos or to balance the $100 investment in favor of one of them, ChatGPT noted that approach comes down to each investor’s risk appetite. Those looking for more aggressive gains might lean heavily toward OZ (60–70%) while keeping some SOL for stability. Conversely, If your goal is safer growth, a 50/50 split or a slight preference for SOL (60%) leads to a more balanced strategy.

At the same time, a widely shared MSTR chart maps a repeating 474-day pattern that traders use to frame potential price targets into 2026. Strategy Urges Neutral MSCI Standards for Digital Asset Treasury Firms Strategy said it has submitted a formal response to MSCI’s consultation on how to treat digital asset treasury companies in its indexes. The firm argued that index standards should stay neutral, apply consistently across issuers, and reflect how global markets are evolving toward digital assets. In its letter, Strategy called on MSCI to avoid penalizing companies that hold Bitcoin or other digital assets as part of their corporate treasury strategy. Instead, it asked the index provider to maintain rules that focus on transparent disclosures and comparable treatment across sectors. The company also invited investors and industry participants to read the submission and share their support through its website, saying broader feedback can help shape how digital asset treasury firms appear in major benchmarks. Strategy CEO Phong Le Frames MSCI Debate as Barrier to Broad Digital Credit Growth Strategy CEO Phong Le told Schwab Network that restricting passive index investment in bitcoin now would echo past policy missteps that held back transformational technologies. He said excluding digital-asset treasuries from major indexes is “misinformed and misguided,” and risks stifling market innovation at a time when global digital credit could grow toward a $60 trillion opportunity. Le compared MSCI’s proposal to bar companies with large bitcoin holdings from passive benchmarks to past efforts that would have blocked investment in oil and oil rigs in the early 1900s, spectrum and cell towers in the 1980s, or computing and data centers in the 2000s. He argued that picking winners and losers too early can slow adoption of foundational technologies. He also defended Strategy’s corporate structure, saying digital-asset treasury companies should be viewed as operating firms, not funds, and that indexes should treat them consistently with other sectors. The MSCI consultation runs through Dec. 31, with any changes expected in early 2026. MSTR Chart Flags Repeating 474-Day Pattern With 2026 Price Targets Meanwhile, a chart shared by trader Ryan Hogue plots Strategy’s MSTR share price inside a rising channel and marks three equal spans of 474 days between major inflection points. The first interval runs from the early 2021 peak to the start of 2023, while the second stretches into late November 2024. Now the chart projects a third 474-day window that extends to mid-October 2026. MSTR Long Term Cycle Projection.

This means that for Web3 projects, having a presence in traditional media is no longer enough. What matters now is how well your project is recognized by AI systems – whether your brand appears when someone consults an AI assistant and whether your data or narrative is incorporated into AI-generated summaries. This shift is reshaping PR: it’s no longer just about human readers — it’s about ensuring that machines “understand”, cite, and surface your brand. This is the core of what some forward-looking crypto PR agencies now offer. Why Web3 Projects Should Care About LLM / AI Visibility AI is becoming a major discovery channel. When people ask generative-AI assistants about blockchain topics, protocols, or crypto-projects, the answers they get depend on what sources the model “knows.” Without credible, structured content about your project, you risk being invisible. AI visibility builds lasting “knowledge-graph” presence. Good PR content — structured, semantically consistent, well-cited — can become part of what LLMs consider “authoritative knowledge.” That means even months or years later, when someone asks about your project, the AI may reference your brand as a canonical example. AI determines which narratives your project belongs to — and whether you’re included at all. LLMs don’t simply retrieve information; they categorize projects into narratives such as DePIN, ZK rollups, modular chains, RWA, gaming infrastructure, or cross-chain liquidity. If your project isn’t consistently positioned within the right narrative through authoritative media coverage, AI systems may: How PR Agencies Adapt — From Traditional PR to AI/LLM-Aware PR Top crypto / Web3 PR agencies now combine classic PR tactics with AI-aware strategies: Structured storytelling and consistent messaging: They craft content (press releases, explainers, whitepapers) that’s clear, semantically consistent, and optimized for machine reading — making it easier for LLMs to parse and cite. Targeting AI-indexed, high-authority media outlets: They prioritize media placements in publications and platforms likely to be crawled, indexed and trusted by training pipelines or real-time AI-search engines. Building “AI-discovery” as a core deliverable: Some agencies now explicitly offer “PR for GenAI Discovery” or similar services — a framework aimed at helping blockchain/Web3 brands show up in AI-generated answers. Using data & analytics to drive timing and content strategy: By tracking media dynamics, algorithm shifts, and narrative trends (through proprietary tools or “media-pulse” analytics), agencies optimize when and how to publish so that AI visibility is maximized. Treating AI visibility as long-term asset, not one-off campaign: Rather than just chasing headlines, agencies aim for durable presence: structured explainers, consistent coverage, and content that remains relevant as reference material for future AI queries. Top 3 Cases: Agencies & Their AI-Agnostic PR That Generates LLM / AI Visibility Here are three leading examples of Web3/crypto PR agencies applying these AI/LLM-aware techniques successfully — with Outset PR as the #1 case, thanks to its pioneering efforts in “PR for AI visibility.” Case 1: Outset PR — Pioneering PR for GenAI Discovery and LLM-Citations Outset PR has emerged as the frontrunner in the new category of AI-aware blockchain PR — largely because it first tested this methodology on itself. The agency was one of the first to intentionally engineer its own digital presence for LLM visibility, demonstrating in practice how strategic PR can influence how AI systems surface, describe, and rank a brand. To build this foundation, Outset PR restructured all its public-facing channels — website, social media, listings, and review platforms — around a single, coherent narrative: data-driven crypto PR with a human touch. By applying its framework internally, the agency created a unified semantic identity that AI systems could clearly interpret. Instead of seeing fragmented mentions across the web, LLMs began recognizing Outset PR as a distinct, authoritative entity. This structured approach helped shape the very way AI models describe the niche itself. Outset PR’s terminology and messaging began appearing not only in Google and Gemini results but also in AI-generated explanations of what “data-driven PR” in blockchain means. In other words, by optimizing its own presence first, the agency proved that PR can directly influence a brand’s representation inside LLMs — long before offering the method to clients. Scaling Visibility Through LLM Seeding With a consistent identity established, Outset PR expanded its AI presence using a “seeding” approach. Leveraging its in-house Syndication Map , the team identified which content types LLMs absorb most effectively and scaled those formats: Educational explainers that outline how data-driven PR works for Web3 founders Industry lists and roundups, where concise descriptors help LLMs categorize and rank agencies Proprietary data, including Outset Data Pulse reports, which introduce unique phrasing and insights AI systems repeatedly reuse in summariesThis combination increased both how often and how accurately AI models referenced Outset PR. How Outset PR Now Applies This Framework to Web3 Brands Building on its own success, Outset PR now uses this AI-optimized methodology to help Web3 companies strengthen their representation inside AI-generated answers. Its new offering, PR for LLM Discovery, helps brands secure visibility not just in human-facing media but also in the algorithmic layer where modern discovery happens. The service blends verified media coverage, contextual narrative engineering, and technical discoverability. It ensures that when someone asks an AI system about a category, a technology, or a market trend, the project’s voice, data, and positioning are part of the explanation. By establishing semantic consistency and distributing authoritative content through AI-indexed publications, Outset PR enables blockchain projects to shift from chasing clicks to earning visibility through algorithmic understanding. Case 2: ReBlonde — Structuring Web3 Narratives for AI Readability ReBlonde is known for shaping Web3 stories in a way that is easy for journalists to publish and easy for AI systems to interpret. Their specialty is taking complicated blockchain products — such as zk-based solutions, cross-chain tools, or AI-integrated protocols — and turning them into clear, consistent narratives. They improve AI visibility by focusing on: Simplified explanations that help LLMs classify a project correctly (e.g., turning “multi-layer computational orchestration system” into “a platform that automates cross-chain transactions”). Aligned messaging across interviews, websites, press releases, and founder bios, creating reliable semantic signals for AI systems. Clean, declarative writing, the format LLMs prefer when determining authoritative descriptions. Placement in high-authority media, which strengthens the trust signals AI models use when deciding which sources to cite. ReBlonde is especially effective for Web3 teams whose technology is complex and needs to be “translated” into language both humans and machines can immediately understand. Case 3: MarketAcross — AI-Enhanced SEO & Narrative Scaling for Web3 Ecosystems MarketAcross focuses on scaling Web3 visibility across multiple markets and channels using AI-informed content strategy. They support LLM visibility through: AI-powered keyword clustering, ensuring projects align with the right high-intent categories (e.g., “DePIN incentives” or “modular blockchain interoperability”). Amplifying long-form content, such as explainers or ecosystem guides, which LLMs often rely on when generating technical summaries. Influencer and KOL amplification, creating a broader “knowledge graph footprint” through repeated mentions across social platforms. Cross-linked content strategies, spreading consistent narratives across several publications so AI systems detect clear patterns. MarketAcross works best for Web3 ecosystems that need high-volume awareness and consistent recognition across regions — an essential factor for improving how AI systems contextualize and surface a project. Why These Three Agencies Stand Out in the AI Visibility Era What ultimately sets these agencies apart is their understanding of a deeper shift in how information is discovered and trusted. As AI systems increasingly replace traditional search engines, the first point of contact between a user and a blockchain project is often an LLM-generated answer, not a Google search result. Instead of scrolling through pages of links, users now ask AI assistants questions such as: “Which Layer-1 is the most secure?” “What are the top DePIN networks?” “Which cross-chain protocols lead in reliability?” The projects that appear in these AI-driven summaries gain immediate visibility and credibility; those that don’t may as well not exist. The agencies highlighted above recognize this shift and treat PR not simply as human-facing communication, but as machine-readable reputation engineering. They understand that every element of a campaign — a credible article, a consistent message, a structured explainer, a founder quote that aligns with previous narratives — becomes a long-lasting signal in the training data and retrieval systems that LLMs depend on. A single Tier-1 feature or well-crafted expert commentary can influence how AI models answer questions, whether they place a project inside the correct category, and how relevant they consider it months or even years after the original publication. Another shared strength is their ability to craft content that speaks fluently to both audiences: people and machines. They emphasize: semantic clarity, narrative cohesion, consistent terminology, contextual framing — the very qualities LLMs use to determine what information is authoritative and which sources should be ignored. At the same time, their storytelling remains compelling and human-centered, allowing media, investors, and communities to connect with the vision behind the technology. This dual fluency is becoming a critical advantage in a landscape where misunderstanding by AI can be just as damaging as misunderstanding by users. By combining Web3 expertise, strong editorial discipline, and AI-aware content strategy, these agencies ensure that blockchain projects are not just noticed but understood, contextualized, and repeatedly surfaced across the information ecosystems that matter most. Conclusion — The New PR Frontier: Getting Web3 Projects Seen by AI We are entering a new era in which visibility is no longer defined by clicks or ad spend. Ads still serve immediate promotional purposes, but they do little to establish trust. Traditional SEO continues to matter, yet it is no longer the primary gateway to discovery. Increasingly, AI systems — not search engines — act as the arbiters of relevance and credibility. In this environment, PR evolves into something deeper: the foundation of how AI understands a project’s identity, how it categorizes it, and whether it chooses to mention it at all. Outset PR has emerged as a leader in this transformation, pioneering a methodology in which blockchain PR directly contributes to AI visibility, long-term reputation, and durable narrative placement. The agencies that adopt this AI-aware approach will define the next generation of Web3 communication — and the founders who work with them will gain a decisive advantage in discoverability, credibility, and sustained trust. Those who ignore this shift risk something far more damaging than weak publicity: becoming invisible to the very systems the world now relies on to interpret information.

The legislative body has reintroduced a comprehensive crypto bill that President Karol Nawrocki previously rejected. This move signals Poland’s commitment to establishing clear regulatory frameworks while addressing complex geopolitical concerns. The legislation represents more than just domestic policy—it positions Poland at the forefront of European cryptocurrency regulation. Why Did Poland’s Parliament Revive This Crypto Bill? Poland’s parliamentary decision to reintroduce the cryptocurrency legislation stems from multiple strategic considerations. First, the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation creates pressure for member states to develop compatible frameworks. Second, national security concerns regarding financial transactions with Russia and former Soviet states require legislative solutions. The revived crypto bill attempts to balance regulatory oversight with market innovation, addressing criticisms from both supporters and opponents of cryptocurrency regulation. President Nawrocki’s earlier veto highlighted concerns about regulatory overreach. He argued that strict regulations could threaten financial freedom and stability for Polish citizens. However, parliament appears determined to create legislation that satisfies multiple stakeholders while meeting EU requirements. This legislative persistence demonstrates how cryptocurrency regulation has become a priority in Poland’s political agenda. What Does This Crypto Legislation Actually Include? The proposed crypto bill establishes a unified supervisory framework for digital assets in Poland. Key components include: Regulatory alignment with EU’s MiCA standards for consistency across European markets Supervisory mechanisms to monitor cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers Security protocols addressing concerns about illicit financial activities Consumer protection measures to safeguard Polish investors Compliance requirements for businesses operating in the cryptocurrency space This comprehensive approach reflects growing recognition that cryptocurrency markets require structured oversight. The legislation aims to prevent regulatory fragmentation while supporting legitimate cryptocurrency innovation. By creating clear rules, Poland hopes to attract responsible cryptocurrency businesses while protecting national interests. How Will This Crypto Bill Impact Poland’s Digital Economy? The reintroduced legislation carries significant implications for Poland’s position in the global cryptocurrency ecosystem. Properly implemented, this crypto bill could transform Poland into a regional hub for blockchain innovation. Regulatory clarity typically encourages legitimate investment while discouraging fraudulent operations. However, excessive restrictions might push cryptocurrency businesses to more lenient jurisdictions. Poland’s approach reflects a broader European trend toward cryptocurrency regulation. As EU member states implement MiCA requirements, harmonized standards should facilitate cross-border cryptocurrency operations. For Polish consumers and businesses, this means greater protection and clearer operational guidelines. The legislation’s national security provisions also address government concerns about cryptocurrency’s potential misuse. Successful implementation requires balancing multiple objectives. Regulators must protect consumers without stifling innovation. They must address security concerns without creating unnecessary barriers. This delicate balance explains why the crypto bill has faced such scrutiny and debate within Poland’s political system. What Challenges Remain for Poland’s Crypto Legislation? Despite parliamentary support, significant hurdles remain for Poland’s cryptocurrency regulation efforts. The presidential veto demonstrates ongoing concerns about regulatory impact. Key challenges include: Balancing oversight with innovation to avoid driving cryptocurrency businesses elsewhere Addressing presidential concerns about citizen freedoms and financial stability Implementing complex regulations across diverse cryptocurrency activities Coordinating with EU authorities as MiCA implementation progresses Educating stakeholders about new requirements and compliance procedures These challenges highlight why cryptocurrency regulation remains contentious globally. Each country must develop approaches that suit their specific circumstances while meeting international standards. Poland’s legislative journey offers valuable insights for other nations navigating similar cryptocurrency regulation decisions. Conclusion: Poland’s Strategic Move in Crypto Regulation Poland’s decision to reintroduce cryptocurrency legislation represents a strategic commitment to structured digital asset oversight. By aligning with EU standards while addressing national security concerns, this crypto bill positions Poland as a proactive participant in European cryptocurrency governance. The legislative process—including presidential veto and parliamentary response—demonstrates healthy democratic debate about complex financial technologies. As cryptocurrency markets continue evolving, regulatory frameworks must adapt accordingly. Poland’s approach offers a model for balancing innovation with protection, though implementation challenges remain. The ultimate success of this crypto bill will depend on practical application and ongoing stakeholder engagement. For now, Poland takes another significant step toward comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation. Frequently Asked Questions What is the main purpose of Poland’s crypto bill? The legislation aims to establish a unified regulatory framework for cryptocurrency assets in Poland, aligning with EU’s MiCA regulation while addressing national security concerns related to financial transactions with certain countries. Why did Poland’s president veto the original crypto bill? President Karol Nawrocki expressed concerns that the legislation’s strict regulations could threaten financial freedom and stability for Polish citizens, leading to his decision to veto the earlier version. How does this crypto bill relate to EU regulations? The legislation specifically aligns Poland with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, ensuring consistency across European cryptocurrency markets and compliance with broader EU standards. What are the national security aspects of this legislation? The bill includes provisions addressing concerns about cryptocurrency transactions with Russia and former Soviet states, aiming to prevent potential misuse of digital assets for illicit activities. When will this crypto bill take effect if passed? The timeline depends on parliamentary approval and potential presidential signature. If passed, implementation would likely follow a transitional period to allow businesses and regulators to adapt to new requirements. How will this affect cryptocurrency users in Poland? Polish cryptocurrency users should expect clearer regulatory guidelines, enhanced consumer protections, and potentially more legitimate cryptocurrency service providers operating under supervised frameworks.

The move comes as Japan’s 10-year government bond yields have climbed to 1.94%, the highest since mid-2007, while Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s government has grown increasingly supportive of monetary tightening. Bitcoin and Ethereum are facing renewed pressure ahead of the decision. Crypto Markets Reel as Policy Shift Threatens Leveraged Positions Bitcoin traded around $86,000 in early December after a sharp 5% single-session drop, briefly slipping below $85,000 and triggering more than $637 million in long liquidations. During that time, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index plunged to extreme fear levels near 20, down from a trough around 10, as the BOJ’s policy pivot tightened financial conditions and reduced tolerance for leverage that had previously supported rallies. Speaking with Cryptonews, Ignacio Aguirre, CMO at Bitget, said a stronger yen “ raises the risk of unwinding yen carry trades which is a move that can temporarily weigh on crypto valuations as leveraged positions reset across global markets. ” So far this month, Bitcoin saw the largest 24-hour wipeout, with approximately $251.69 million liquidated, while Ethereum followed with roughly $111.31 million in liquidations. The selloff in Japanese government bonds has extended beyond domestic markets, pushing 10-year U.S. Treasury yields up to about 4.08% as the policy shift rippled through global funding markets. Crypto-exposed stocks felt the impact of Bitcoin’s slide as risk aversion picked up, with MicroStrategy shares falling sharply while Coinbase and Robinhood dropped by mid-single digits. Bitcoin hovered near $86,000 in Asia after a sharp crypto selloff and a global bond slump kept traders cautious and risk appetite weak. #CryptoMarket #AsiaMarketOpen https://t.co/r8o6wn1cBo — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 2, 2025 Stablecoin Growth Adds New Dynamic to Bond Market as BOJ Steps Back Japan’s emerging stablecoin sector may reshape the country’s sovereign debt landscape as the BOJ reduces its bond purchases after years of aggressive monetary easing. JPYC, the Tokyo-based issuer behind Japan’s first yen-pegged stablecoin, which launched in October under the nation’s revised Payment Services Act, has targeted circulation of 10 trillion yen within three years. JPYC plans to invest 80% of its proceeds in JGBs and 20% in bank deposits, potentially filling the gap left by the central bank’s retreat from a market where it currently holds roughly 50% of the 1,055-trillion-yen total. The Financial Services Agency has endorsed a pilot program involving Japan’s three largest banks to develop a shared framework for issuing yen-backed stablecoins, initially targeting corporate clients. Meanwhile, the government is preparing its most sweeping crypto oversight overhaul in nearly a decade, moving regulation from the Payment Services Act into the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act to treat digital assets more like traditional investment products. @fsa_JAPAN moves crypto under securities law, stricter disclosure, insider trading ban, and enhanced oversight of exchanges planned. #CryptoNews #Japan #FSA https://t.co/eC3i8zW6kI — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 10, 2025 Tax Reform and Institutional Entry Signal Maturing Market Structure Japan is preparing to introduce a flat 20% levy on crypto trading gains in 2026 , replacing progressive rates that can reach 55% and placing digital assets on the same footing as stocks. The reform would split crypto income into a separate taxation scheme, with 15% directed to the central government and 5% to local authorities. Additionally, Nomura Asset Management has formed a cross-division task force to prepare product strategies ahead of the regulatory changes, while Daiwa Asset Management is coordinating with ETF specialist Global X Japan. Despite the near-term volatility from BOJ tightening, Aguirre expects BTC to “ retest the $95,000–$100,000 range by early 2026, while ETH could climb toward $3,800 as institutional flows resume and macro conditions stabilize. “ Notably, Tokyo Stock Exchange operator Japan Exchange Group is weighing stricter backdoor listing rules for companies shifting into large crypto positions , following losses from recent hoarding waves that raised investor protection concerns. The FSA also plans to require crypto exchanges to hold dedicated liability reserves against customer losses, mirroring requirements long used in Japan’s securities industry, following high-profile hacks, including DMM Bitcoin’s $48.2 billion theft in May 2024.

According to the official documents, the bill aims to ban members of Congress, the president, vice president, and their immediate family members (spouses and dependent children) from trading, or holding individual stocks, bonds, commodities, or futures during their time in office. The ultimate goal is to finally get rid of conflicts of interest and the appearance of insider trading , where lawmakers could potentially use non-public information from briefings or committee work to profit personally. Can Congress members still trade stocks? At the time of this writing, the bill has not yet reached the full Senate floor and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) has expressed doubts about prioritizing it, citing concerns from business-oriented Republicans that it could deter entrepreneurs from running for office. However, recent developments prove momentum is building. In September of this year, a companion House bill, the Restore Trust in Congress Act (H.R. 5106), was introduced by Reps. Chip Roy (R-TX) and Seth Magaziner (D-RI). The bill is said to be a reconciled version of previous proposals stalled by differences in the details and a lack of support from top congressional leaders. It has reportedly gotten the support of Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), who issued a public statement expressing his support for a stock trading ban. Roy told reporters around that time that the bill was the result of years of negotiations aimed at addressing demands from voters worried about insider trading. In announcing the new bill, a group of leading conservatives and progressives are saying the issue is ripe for action in 2025 and that they had agreed on a new plan. “They do not send us here to enrich ourselves while we are voting on the issues they send us here to fix and address and then have members who are trading stocks on the very issues they’re supposed to be voting on,” Roy said . The legislation would require lawmakers to sell all individual stocks within 180 days, and newly elected members of Congress would be required to divest individual stock holdings before being sworn in. Members who fail to divest would face a fine equivalent to 10% of the value of the stock. The proposed ban extends to spouses and dependent children. Opposition to the insider trading bill remains strong Despite the moves, advocacy groups like the Campaign Legal Center have claimed that 44% of House members and 54% of senators still own individual stocks, creating ongoing conflict risks. Opposition remains from the likes of Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), who called it “legislative demagoguery” and argued that existing insider trading laws suffice, warning it could make public service “unattractive” for business owners. The recent push is happening amid scandals involving public officials and their conflicts of interest, which have seen some like Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) face complaints for failing to disclose 100+ trades worth up to $1.6 million. Donalds has said he plans to support a stock trading ban for members of Congress, but for some reason would like to keep his broker. While discussing the issue with the Fox News radio affiliate in his district, the Naples Republican, who is running for Governor said that “when it comes up for a vote, I’m voting for it. I have always been opposed to members trading positions.” Despite that statement, he said he believes members should still be allowed to own stocks, just not to direct trades. “Let me just get it out there because I know people say, ‘Well, Byron, you own stocks.’ I do, but my stocks are traded by my financial advisor, Tom Moran, in Naples. They’ve been my financial advisor since I got to Congress. I actually worked there before I got to Congress. I do not initiate trades. That is done by my broker, (and) he has third-party authorization to trade on my behalf. We have no contact about this stuff,” Donalds said . Donald Trump is also not completely on board with the idea. In the past, the president has framed it as an attack on his “unprecedented success” while going after the only Republican to support the bill back in July, labeling him a “pawn” and “second-tier Senator” for aligning with Democrats.

This vision is now a reality in the Middle East. In a groundbreaking move, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) Distribution has announced it will accept stablecoin payments at hundreds of its service stations. This decision marks a significant leap for cryptocurrency adoption by a major state-owned enterprise. What Does ADNOC’s Stablecoin Payment System Involve? ADNOC Distribution, a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi state oil giant, will now support payments using the AE Coin stablecoin. This initiative covers a vast network of 980 locations. These include gas stations, convenience stores, and car washes across three countries: the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. The move, first reported by CoinDesk, signals a strategic push into digital finance. The chosen currency, AE Coin, holds a unique distinction. It is the first dirham-pegged stablecoin to receive formal approval from the Central Bank of the UAE. This regulatory backing provides a layer of trust and stability often sought by both businesses and consumers in the crypto space. Why Is This Adoption of Stablecoin Payments a Big Deal? The integration of stablecoin payments by a corporation of ADNOC’s stature is not a minor experiment. It is a powerful endorsement of blockchain-based financial systems. For customers, the benefits are tangible: Faster Transactions: Payments can be settled almost instantly, reducing wait times. Enhanced Security: Blockchain technology offers transparent and secure transaction records. Cross-Border Ease: Travelers between the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt could find paying for services more seamless. Financial Innovation: It encourages the public to interact with regulated digital assets. For the region, this step positions the UAE and its partners at the forefront of financial technology. It aligns with national strategies to diversify economies and build smart, cashless societies. What Challenges Might This New System Face? Despite the excitement, the path forward includes hurdles that need navigation. Consumer adoption is the primary challenge. People must be educated on how to acquire, store, and use AE Coin securely. Furthermore, the technical infrastructure at all 980 points of sale must operate flawlessly to ensure a smooth user experience. Market volatility is less of a concern with a dirham-pegged stablecoin , but regulatory landscapes can shift. Consistent support from central banks in all three nations will be crucial for long-term success. However, ADNOC’s pilot serves as a critical test case for other large corporations in the energy and retail sectors. What Does the Future Hold for Crypto in Everyday Commerce? ADNOC’s move is a clear signal. Cryptocurrency, particularly stablecoin payments , is transitioning from a speculative asset to a practical utility. This initiative could trigger a domino effect. Other major retailers and service providers in the region may soon explore similar integrations to stay competitive. The success of this program will be closely watched globally. It provides a real-world blueprint for how traditional businesses can leverage blockchain for efficiency and customer engagement. The focus on a regulated, fiat-backed stablecoin also addresses common concerns about volatility and legality. In conclusion, ADNOC Distribution’s embrace of AE Coin is more than a corporate payment update. It is a visionary step that bridges the gap between traditional oil wealth and the digital economy. By enabling stablecoin payments across three nations, it sets a new standard for institutional cryptocurrency adoption. This move not only simplifies transactions for millions but also solidifies the Middle East’s role as an emerging hub for fintech innovation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is AE Coin? A1: AE Coin is a digital stablecoin. Its value is pegged 1:1 to the UAE Dirham (AED). It is the first dirham-pegged stablecoin approved by the Central Bank of the UAE. Q2: Where can I use AE Coin for payments? A2: You can now use AE Coin at 980 ADNOC Distribution service stations, convenience stores, and car washes across the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. Q3: Why use a stablecoin instead of regular money? A3: Stablecoin payments can offer faster transaction speeds, enhanced security through blockchain, and easier cross-border payments without traditional currency exchange hassles. Q4: Is paying with AE Coin safe? A4: The transaction uses blockchain technology, which is inherently secure. Furthermore, AE Coin has regulatory approval from the UAE Central Bank, adding a layer of institutional trust. Q5: Will this make prices cheaper at ADNOC? A5: The primary benefit is convenience and technological innovation. While prices are set by ADNOC, using digital payments could streamline their operations, potentially leading to benefits for customers. Q6: Could other companies follow ADNOC’s example? A6: Absolutely. ADNOC’s large-scale adoption is a major pilot. Its success will likely encourage other retailers and service companies in the region and globally to explore stablecoin payment systems. Found this insight into the future of payments fascinating?

Corporate Treasuries Add Over 10,000 BTC in November Researchers at bitcointreasuries.net discovered that public and private treasuries acquired more than 12,644 BTC during November, with 1,883 BTC in sales offsetting the purchases.

MicroStrategy once again dominated its competitors, purchasing 9,062 BTC across three separate transactions and concluding November with 649,870 BTC on its balance sheet. Japan’s Metaplanet, China’s Cango, Europe’s Capital B, and multiple Hong Kong-based firms all increased their BTC holdings , collectively pushing non-U.S. public treasury reserves above 100,000 BTC. Companies in Asia and Europe are increasingly utilizing local debt markets, favorable tax structures, and regulatory transparency to implement Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) strategies that extend well beyond U.S. borders. Analysts note that treasury companies have now accumulated nearly 5% of Bitcoin’s entire circulating supply. If this accumulation pace continues, it could propel BTC to new highs exceeding $130,000 in 2026. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Technical Structure Shows BTC Needs to Clear $92,000 Decisively to Target New Highs Bitcoin is working to establish stability following its sharp November-December selloff, with the $82,000–$86,000 zone functioning as the critical demand area that halted the decline and generated the current recovery. BTC price is currently consolidates beneath a substantial resistance band between $107,000 and $112,000, which represents the first barrier that must be overcome before any significant trend reversal can develop. Beyond that lies the far more important macro range at $118,000–$122,000, the level the chart identifies as essential for triggering a 2026 bull-run framework. Source: TradingView Momentum has improved modestly, with the RSI advancing from oversold conditions into neutral territory; however, it hasn’t yet demonstrated strong upward momentum. Bitcoin’s trajectory leans cautiously optimistic, provided the $82,000–$86,000 support maintains, but a breakout will only achieve genuine momentum if buyers can recapture $107,000–$112,000 and subsequently advance into the $118,000 region. Without that progression, the current movement risks becoming merely a temporary relief rally within a broader downtrend.

This vision of democratized finance just took a massive leap forward. Backed Finance, in a groundbreaking partnership with oracle network giant Chainlink, has unveiled the xBridge. This new infrastructure is designed to do one thing exceptionally well: move tokenized stocks securely between the Solana and Ethereum blockchains. This development isn’t just a technical upgrade; it’s a key that could unlock a new era of accessible, global stock trading. What Exactly Is the xBridge for Tokenized Stocks? At its core, the xBridge is a specialized digital corridor. It uses Chainlink’s robust Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) as its foundation. Think of CCIP as the secure, standardized railway system, and the xBridge as the dedicated express train built to carry a specific cargo: tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), starting with stocks. Unlike simple token bridges, this system is built with the complexities of traditional finance in mind. Therefore, it doesn’t just move digital tokens. It is capable of tracking and reconciling critical corporate actions that affect stock value. This includes essential events like: Stock Splits: If a company like NVIDIA executes a split, the bridge ensures your tokenized holdings accurately reflect the new share count. Dividend Payments: It can facilitate the distribution of dividend equivalents to token holders. Other Corporate Actions: The infrastructure is designed to handle mergers, spin-offs, and other financial events. Why Does Bridging Tokenized Stocks Matter? Currently, the world of tokenized stocks and RWAs is fragmented. An asset tokenized on Ethereum might be isolated from the high-speed, low-cost environment of Solana. This creates liquidity silos and limits investor choice. The xBridge directly tackles this problem by enabling interoperability. Now, an institution minting a tokenized Apple stock (bAAPL) on Ethereum can make it available to the vast user base and decentralized applications (dApps) on Solana, and vice-versa. The benefits are profound: Enhanced Liquidity: Assets can flow to where the demand is, creating deeper, more efficient markets. Greater Accessibility: Users can choose the blockchain that best suits their needs—be it for cost, speed, or specific DeFi applications—without being locked into one ecosystem. Institutional Confidence: The automated handling of corporate actions via Chainlink’s proven oracle network reduces operational risk and builds trust for traditional finance players. What’s Next for the xBridge and Tokenized Assets? The launch is currently in a pilot phase, focusing on perfecting the Solana-Ethereum connection. However, the roadmap reveals ambitious plans. Backed Finance has indicated that support for other major blockchains is on the horizon, with networks like Mantle and Tron specifically mentioned for future integration. This suggests a vision of a fully interconnected multi-chain network for RWAs. Moreover, this move signals a powerful convergence. It combines Backed Finance’s expertise in creating compliant, real-world asset tokens with Chainlink’s industry-standard infrastructure for secure data and cross-chain communication. The result is a more credible and robust pipeline for bringing traditional securities on-chain. The Future of Finance is Interconnected The introduction of the xBridge is a clear milestone. It moves beyond theoretical discussions about tokenized stocks and delivers a working, scalable solution for a major practical hurdle: blockchain interoperability. By ensuring these digital securities can move and function correctly across different ledgers, Backed Finance and Chainlink are laying the groundwork for a unified global market. This isn’t just about technology; it’s about removing barriers and creating a financial system where assets are truly borderless and accessible to all. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What are tokenized stocks? A: Tokenized stocks are digital representations of traditional company shares issued on a blockchain. Each token is backed by a real share held in custody, allowing for trading on crypto exchanges and within DeFi applications. Q: How is the xBridge different from a regular crypto bridge? A> Unlike bridges for native cryptocurrencies, the xBridge is specifically engineered for real-world assets. It integrates with oracles to automatically update token balances for corporate actions like stock splits and dividends, which standard bridges cannot do. Q: Is it safe to hold tokenized stocks? A> Safety depends on the issuer and infrastructure. Backed Finance uses fully-backed, audited custodial structures. The use of Chainlink’s CCIP adds a layer of security for cross-chain transfers, but as with any crypto asset, understanding the counterparty and technology risks is crucial. Q: Can retail investors use the xBridge? A> Initially, the bridge is likely geared towards institutions and the platforms that issue or trade these assets. However, retail investors will benefit indirectly through increased availability and better pricing of tokenized stocks on their preferred blockchain networks. Q: What blockchains will be supported next? A> According to reports, the teams plan to expand support to other ecosystems, including Mantle and Tron, following the successful pilot between Solana and Ethereum. Q: Does this mean I can trade stocks 24/7? A> While the tokens can technically be transferred on-chain at any time, their price is still tied to the underlying stock, which trades during traditional market hours. The primary benefit is the method and location of trading, not the market hours. Found this insight into the future of stock trading revolutionary?

The approval places Binance on a phased compliance-driven pathway toward full authorisation in line with Financial Action Task Force standards. Pakistan’s regulator said the decision is part of its broader strategy to establish a regulated and transparent digital-asset ecosystem built on strong governance, AML, and counter-terrorist financing controls. Binance Shows Commitment to Pakistan’s Digital-Asset Growth Richard Teng, CEO of Binance, described the development as a “meaningful milestone” for the exchange’s presence in Pakistan. A meaningful milestone for Binance in Pakistan We’ve obtained AML registration from @PakistanVARA , moving us closer to full VASP licensing and deeper local collaboration. Looking forward to building a safe, transparent and future-ready digital-asset ecosystem together. pic.twitter.com/nIwxQxiymi — Richard Teng (@_RichardTeng) December 12, 2025 “We’ve obtained AML registration from Pakistan VARA, moving us closer to full VASP licensing and deeper local collaboration,” Teng said in a post on X. He adds that Binance looks forward to helping build a “safe, transparent and future-ready digital-asset ecosystem” alongside local stakeholders. PVARA also confirmed it has issued no-objection certificates to both Binance and HTX as part of a phased regulatory framework designed to onboard global virtual asset platforms in a controlled manner. What AML Registration Allows Binance to Do Next Securing AML registration allows Binance to operate within defined regulatory expectations while progressing toward full licensing. A complete VASP licence would permit a broader set of services within Pakistan’s digital-asset market. Interest in cryptocurrencies has been rising locally, driven by retail adoption, remittances, and growing awareness of blockchain-based financial tools. Regulators have increasingly indicated a move toward engagement rather than prohibition, with PVARA positioning itself as the central authority overseeing virtual asset activity. Part of a Wider Trend in Emerging Markets For Binance, this approval adds to a growing list of regulatory engagements worldwide as the exchange works to strengthen its compliance presence across key jurisdictions. The company has emphasised close collaboration with regulators and policymakers as it promotes responsible digital-asset adoption. Pakistan has opened its doors to international crypto exchanges and virtual asset service providers by inviting them to apply for licenses to operate under its newly formed regulatory authority. The PVARA, created under the Virtual Assets Ordinance 2025, reportedly issued a call for Expressions of Interest this Saturday from firms already operating in other major jurisdictions. With over 40 million users and an estimated $300 billion in annual trading volume, Pakistan’s virtual asset market shows rapid growth, but until now it has remained largely unregulated.

These key moments could determine their next move—will they rebound or continue their descent? This article explores which of these digital coins might be primed for a comeback. Traders study resistance and support zones to anticipate the next move, just as Outset PR monitors performance metrics of media outlets to align campaigns with market momentum. By tracking these shifts, Outset PR ensures that its stories fit the moment — much like investors searching for the assets that can break out in a cautious market. Avalanche (AVAX) Hopes to Climb Despite Recent Downtrend Source: tradingview Avalanche (AVAX) has been navigating a bumpy path, with prices hovering between just over twelve dollars to about fifteen dollars. This represents a significant downturn, with a drop of nearly twenty-one percent in the past month alone. However, there's potential for upward movement. The coin's nearest resistance level is sixteen dollars, and if it breaks past this point, it could aim for around nineteen dollars. This would mean a potential rise of roughly thirty percent. The current moving averages suggest AVAX is trying to find a stable footing, while market indicators show a mixed outlook. With patience, AVAX might rebound and reward its holders. Presenting Yourself Without Overspending: How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Chainlink (LINK) Shows Potential for Recovery Amid Price Fluctuations Source: tradingview Chainlink's price is presently moving between almost $12 and just over $15. It's showing some recovery signs despite a recent dip. The growth in the past six months hints at a comeback. The closest potential hurdle is around $16. If LINK can break through this, it might head towards $20, marking over a 30% rise from its current low. However, if it falls below its support line near $10, it could slide further. The steady 10-day and 100-day averages, both close to $14, suggest stability. With its Relative Strength Index near the center, LINK isn't overbought or oversold, offering room for upward momentum. Conclusion Both AVAX and LINK have faced significant declines, bringing them close to crucial support levels. The current state of these assets suggests a critical juncture. Whether they hold support or break lower could determine their near-term direction. Investors will be focused on these support zones to gauge the next move.

The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1, 2025. ​Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market bounced back after Thursday’s decline. Bitcoin (BTC) reached an intraday high of $93,438 before registering a marginal decline, moving to its current level. The flagship cryptocurrency is up almost 3% in the past 24 hours, trading around $92,668. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) are also trading in positive territory, with the crypto market cap up almost 2% Husky Inu (HINU) Completes Latest Price Increase ​The regular price increases are part of Husky Inu's pre-launch phase, which began on April 1. These increases help the project continue fundraising, empower its community, and reward token holders. The pre-launch phase’s primary goal is to secure capital, fund platform improvements, undertake marketing initiatives, and support broader ecosystem growth. ​While Husky Inu’s price increases remain on schedule, it is struggling to raise funds. The project has raised $905,549 so far, as fundraising remains sluggish. Despite the market recovery, investors remain wary and have adopted a wait-and-watch approach. The project crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The project reached the $850,000 milestone in July and crossed $900,000 in October. ​Official Launch Date ​The project’s official launch date is under four months away, but the team has not ruled out moving the launch to an earlier or later date. The team will conduct a series of review meetings to determine the project’s launch date. The first two review meetings were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025, while the third is scheduled for January 1, 2026. Crypto Market Rebounds ​Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market has bounced back after facing substantial volatility and selling pressure on Wednesday and Thursday. The recovery was largely led by Layer2 tokens, which saw increases of 5% to 6%. Analysts attributed the recovery to growing regulatory optimism after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) withdrew outdated and restrictive crypto guidelines. A surge in bullish derivatives activity and news that YouTube has added PYUSD payouts has also boosted market sentiment. ​Bitcoin (BTC) fell to a low of $89,257 on Thursday with volatility and selling pressure persisting. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $92,000 and settle at $92,542, ultimately rising 0.58%. The flagship cryptocurrency is up nearly 3% over the past 24 hours, trading around $92,528. Ethereum (ETH) followed a similar trajectory, reaching an intraday high of $3,270 before moving to its current level. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is up nearly 2%, trading around $3,251. Ripple (XRP) is up 132%, while Solana (SOL) is up over 6% at $139. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up 1.24% and Cardano (ADA) is marginally up, trading around $0.426. Chainlink (LINK) is up almost 4%, and Stellar (XLM) is up 1.55% at $0.244. Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) are also trading in positive territory. The crypto market cap is up almost 2%, while the 24-hour trading volume is down 19.81% at $126 billion.

This vision just became reality as China Asset Management makes a groundbreaking move. The Hong Kong-based financial giant has deployed Asia’s first and largest tokenized money market fund on the Solana blockchain, marking a significant milestone in the convergence of traditional finance and digital assets. What Exactly Is This Tokenized Money Market Fund? China Asset Management, one of China’s largest fund managers, has launched a pioneering financial product that bridges two worlds. This isn’t just another cryptocurrency project – it’s a fully regulated, traditional money market fund that now exists as digital tokens on a blockchain. The fund includes three major currencies: the Hong Kong dollar, the U.S. dollar, and the Chinese yuan, providing diversified currency exposure within a single blockchain-based product. According to Solana’s official statement, this represents Asia’s inaugural deployment of its kind. The fund has already launched, meaning investors can currently access this innovative financial instrument. This development signals a major shift in how institutional players view blockchain technology – not just for speculative assets, but for core financial products. Why Choose Solana for This Financial Innovation? You might wonder why a traditional asset manager would select Solana over other blockchains. The answer lies in practical considerations that benefit both the institution and potential investors. Speed and Efficiency: Solana’s high transaction throughput enables near-instant settlements Lower Costs: Minimal transaction fees make the fund economically viable for various investment sizes Technical Reliability: Solana’s proven infrastructure supports the security demands of regulated financial products Growing Ecosystem: The blockchain’s expanding institutional adoption creates network effects This strategic choice demonstrates how traditional finance increasingly prioritizes technical performance when embracing blockchain solutions. The tokenized money market fund benefits from Solana’s architecture, potentially offering investors advantages over conventional fund structures. What Benefits Does Tokenization Bring to Investors? Tokenization transforms how investors interact with money market funds. Instead of dealing with traditional settlement systems, investors gain several distinct advantages through this blockchain-based approach. First, accessibility improves significantly. Blockchain technology enables 24/7 trading and potentially lowers minimum investment thresholds. Second, transparency increases dramatically – all transactions are recorded on an immutable ledger that investors can verify independently. Third, settlement times reduce from days to minutes or seconds, improving capital efficiency. Moreover, this tokenized money market fund introduces programmability. Smart contracts can automate distributions, enable innovative redemption mechanisms, and create new compliance features. These technical capabilities could revolutionize how traditional financial products operate and interact with investors. How Does This Impact the Broader Financial Landscape? China Asset Management’s move represents more than just one product launch. It signals a broader institutional acceptance of blockchain technology for regulated financial instruments. Other asset managers will likely monitor this deployment closely, potentially accelerating similar initiatives across Asia and globally. The inclusion of three major currencies – HKD, USD, and Yuan – demonstrates how blockchain can facilitate multi-currency products efficiently. This could pave the way for more sophisticated cross-border financial instruments that leverage blockchain’s inherent advantages for international finance. However, challenges remain. Regulatory frameworks continue evolving, and traditional investors need education about blockchain-based financial products. Technical risks, while mitigated by Solana’s robust network, still require careful management for institutional-grade financial products. What’s Next for Tokenized Traditional Finance? This pioneering tokenized money market fund likely represents just the beginning. Successful deployment could encourage other traditional financial institutions to explore similar blockchain integrations. We might see tokenized bonds, equities, and other regulated financial products following this trailblazing example. The convergence of traditional finance and blockchain technology creates exciting possibilities. Imagine seamlessly moving between conventional banking products and blockchain-based instruments, or automated compliance that reduces administrative costs while improving security. This China Asset Management initiative brings us closer to that integrated financial future. In conclusion, China Asset Management’s deployment of Asia’s first tokenized money market fund on Solana marks a watershed moment. It demonstrates that blockchain technology has matured sufficiently to support regulated, institutional financial products. This development benefits investors through improved accessibility, transparency, and efficiency while signaling to the broader market that traditional finance is seriously embracing digital transformation. Frequently Asked Questions What is a tokenized money market fund? A tokenized money market fund is a traditional money market fund represented as digital tokens on a blockchain. It combines the stability and regulatory compliance of conventional funds with the technological advantages of blockchain, including faster settlements and increased transparency. Who can invest in this China Asset Management fund? While specific eligibility criteria depend on regulatory requirements, tokenized funds typically follow the same investment regulations as their conventional counterparts. Potential investors should consult with financial advisors and review the fund’s official documentation for precise eligibility information. How does using Solana benefit investors? Solana offers high transaction speed and low costs, which can translate to better efficiency and potentially lower fees for investors. The blockchain’s technical capabilities also enable features like near-instant settlements and enhanced transparency through its public ledger. Is this fund available internationally? The fund includes Hong Kong dollar, U.S. dollar, and Chinese yuan denominations, suggesting international accessibility. However, availability depends on local regulations in each jurisdiction. Investors should verify accessibility based on their location and applicable financial regulations. How does tokenization affect fund security? Tokenization can enhance security through blockchain’s cryptographic protections and immutable transaction records. However, it also introduces new considerations like digital wallet security. Reputable institutions like China Asset Management implement multiple security layers for such products. Will more traditional funds become tokenized? This successful deployment likely encourages other institutions to explore tokenization. As regulatory frameworks mature and technology proves reliable, we can expect more traditional financial products to adopt blockchain representation, potentially transforming how people access investment vehicles.

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/1-32-billion-xrp-in-30-days-heres-what-happened/,"$1.32 billion worth of XRP left Binance in the last 30 days. Steph is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) shared the data on X and pointed to a steep decline in XRP reserves on Binance. His post included a chart that tracked the drop from early November through early December. The chart showed a clear fall in exchange balances during that period. It also showed price movement that stayed close to the reserve line, which added weight to his message about rapid outflows. BREAKING: $1.32B $XRP LEFT EXCHANGES IN 30 DAYS. pic.twitter.com/7zbmjfzZdu — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 10, 2025 Exchange Supply Drops as Market Participants Accumulate The reduction in supply on exchanges signals strong demand. Traders often move holdings off exchanges when they plan to keep positions for a longer period or place them in custody. This pattern suggests that accumulation strengthened through November and early December. The market saw heavier outflows near the middle of the chart, with the reserve line dipping below $5.6 billion before recovering slightly. The trend stayed firm even as XRP moved between $1.95 and $2.15. Whales appear active in this shift. Large holders tend to move significant amounts when they build positions. The recent drop in reserves aligns with this type of behavior. Whale accumulation reduces liquidity on exchanges. The effect becomes sharper when outflows continue at a steady pace. Rising Institutional Demand through Spot ETFs Interest from institutions has also increased due to the XRP spot ETFs in the market . These products need direct XRP purchases to support inflows. As assets enter ETFs, issuers must acquire more tokens. This process removes supply from exchanges. Recent flows indicate that demand remains healthy. XRP supply on exchanges has shrunk significantly in 2025 . If ETF inflows continue at the current pace, exchange reserves could fall further. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The combination of whale activity and institutional participation creates a tight market. Reserves cannot rebuild if outflows exceed deposits. The past month indicates that deposits have not kept up. The reduced supply puts more pressure on XRP’s price in periods of strong buying. Potential for a Supply Shock If outflows remain heavy, XRP could face a supply shock . A supply shock occurs when high demand meets low available volume. The current trend points toward that scenario, as Binance’s reserves stay far below levels seen in early November. If deposits stay low, the market may tighten further. Strong ETF inflows or renewed whale buying could add to the pressure, and the resulting supply shock could send XRP to new heights.

According to real-time data from Binance’s USDT trading pair, BTC is currently trading at $90,913.43. This sudden move has sent ripples through the investor community, prompting questions about the stability of the recent rally and the potential for further declines. Let’s break down what’s happening and why it matters for your portfolio. What Caused the Sudden Bitcoin Price Drop? Market corrections are a normal part of any financial asset’s lifecycle, and Bitcoin is no exception. The rapid descent of the Bitcoin price below $91,000 can be attributed to a confluence of factors. Firstly, after a significant upward run, profit-taking by short-term traders often triggers a pullback. Secondly, broader macroeconomic concerns, such as shifting interest rate expectations or strength in the U.S. dollar, can pressure risk assets like cryptocurrency. Finally, large sell orders on major exchanges can create cascading effects, quickly moving the market. Understanding these triggers is crucial. However, it’s equally important to view this movement within the larger context of Bitcoin’s historical volatility. Short-term price action, while dramatic, does not necessarily alter long-term fundamental narratives around adoption and scarcity. How Should Investors React to This Volatility? Seeing the Bitcoin price fall can trigger emotional decisions. Therefore, having a clear strategy is paramount. Here are actionable insights for navigating this dip: Review Your Risk Tolerance: Ensure your investment level aligns with your capacity to handle swings. Avoid Panic Selling: Historically, selling during sharp downturns has often locked in losses. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): This strategy involves buying fixed amounts at regular intervals, smoothing out the purchase price over time. Monitor Key Support Levels: Watch how the market behaves around levels like $90,000 or $88,000 for clues on future direction. Is This a Buying Opportunity or a Warning Sign? This is the million-dollar question every trader is asking. For some, a dip in the Bitcoin price represents a discounted entry point, assuming the long-term thesis remains intact. For others, it’s a signal to step back and wait for more clarity. The answer depends entirely on your investment horizon and analysis. If you believe in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition—a decentralized store of value—then short-term price weakness may be less concerning. Conversely, if you are trading based on technical patterns, this break below $91,000 is a significant event that requires a reassessment of your charts. Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin Price Landscape Today’s market action, with the Bitcoin price slipping below $91,000, serves as a powerful reminder of the asset’s inherent volatility. While the immediate move is noteworthy, successful crypto investing requires focusing on long-term trends, sound risk management, and avoiding reactionary decisions based on fear or greed. The market’s next steps will be closely watched, but a disciplined approach remains the investor’s best tool. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why did Bitcoin’s price fall below $91,000? The drop is likely due to a combination of profit-taking after a rally, broader macroeconomic pressures on risk assets, and large sell orders impacting market liquidity. Should I sell my Bitcoin now? Panic selling during a dip often leads to realized losses. It’s generally advised to review your long-term strategy and risk tolerance before making a decision. What is a key support level to watch now? Traders are now watching how Bitcoin behaves around the $90,000 psychological level and the next major technical support zones below it. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? For investors using a Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy or those with a long-term bullish outlook, price dips can present accumulation opportunities. How does this affect other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin often sets the tone for the broader crypto market. A significant drop in BTC can lead to increased selling pressure across altcoins, a phenomenon known as “Bitcoin dominance.” Where can I get reliable Bitcoin price data? Use reputable tracking websites and major exchange data (like Binance, Coinbase) for real-time prices. Always cross-reference information. Found this analysis of the Bitcoin price movement helpful?

Meanwhile, ETH traded near key on chain levels as whale realized price signals and Ethereum linked treasury stocks added new market cues. 60,000 ETH moved to exchanges in 24 hours, Santiment data shows About 60,000 Ethereum (ETH) , valued at nearly $200 million, moved to cryptocurrency exchanges over the past 24 hours, according to data shared by analyst Ali Martinez, known as @alicharts, citing Santiment. Ethereum Exchange Inflows and Exchange Supply Chart. Source: Santiment via @alicharts The update flagged a jump in exchange inflows, a metric traders often watch because transfers to exchanges can raise immediately available supply for spot trading. The post did not identify the wallets or exchanges involved. A chart attributed to Santiment alongside the post showed ETH trading near $3,247 at the latest reading. The same chart showed exchange supply around 1.22 million ETH, after a sharp step down earlier in the week and a smaller rebound near the end of the period. Ethereum’s market has stayed choppy through mid December, with price swings following a sharp drop earlier in the week and a steadier move higher afterward. The latest inflow figure adds a new data point for exchange activity as traders track how quickly deposits convert into spot selling or remain idle on platforms. Ethereum treasury stocks rebound as traders watch ETH buying power Several public companies tied to Ethereum treasury strategies showed a rebound on recent trading charts, after steep declines earlier in the year, according to a post by trader Ted, known as @TedPillows. Ethereum Treasury Companies Price Charts. Source: @TedPillows The shared screen showed short term recoveries across multiple names, including BitMine Immersion Technologies, SharpLink Gaming, Dynamix Corporation, and Bit Digital. In the latest readings shown, BitMine traded near $38.93 in premarket, SharpLink near $11.66, Dynamix near $10.46, and Bit Digital near $2.46. Ted said the bounce matters because stronger equity prices can improve a firm’s ability to raise capital, which can later translate into additional ETH purchases. However, the same charts also showed these stocks still sitting well below earlier peaks, after sharp selloffs that hit several crypto linked equities. ETH trades near whale realized price for fourth time since 2020, CryptoQuant data shows Ethereum has moved very close to the realized price of large whale wallets holding at least 100,000 ETH, marking only the fourth such instance since 2020, according to data shared by analyst Rand, known as @cryptorand, citing CryptoQuant.

Each earlier occurrence coincided with periods when Ethereum later posted strong price recoveries, based on historical chart data. The chart tracks ETH price against the realized price of whale balances and highlights four moments where the two lines converged closely.

Congress Pushes SEC for Change,https://coinpaper.com/13082/crypto-in-your-401-k-congress-pushes-sec-for-change,"U.S. lawmakers are intensifying efforts to revise retirement-plan rules so everyday savers could invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through their 401(k) accounts, a move that could reshape how Americans save for retirement. Lawmakers Press for Rule Changes On Dec. 12, 2025, members of the House Financial Services Committee sent a letter to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins, urging the agency to update its regulatory framework. The goal is to allow digital assets, like Bitcoin, to become eligible investment options in 401(k) retirement plans once regulatory barriers are removed. Supporters say the move aligns with broader policy signals from the federal government to expand investment choices beyond traditional stocks and bonds. The lawmakers noted that current rules are outdated and prevent millions of retirement savers from diversifying into newer asset classes. Executive Order Drives Momentum This congressional push follows President Donald Trump’s Aug. 7, 2025 executive order , titled “Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors.” The order directs federal agencies — including the SEC and Department of Labor (DOL) — to consider revisions that could make alternative investments more accessible in defined contribution plans. Digital assets are explicitly listed among these alternatives. Under the order, regulators are encouraged to rethink long-standing barriers, including how accredited investor and qualified purchaser standards apply to retirement savers. If implemented, this could broaden eligibility and reduce restrictions that now limit participation in certain markets. What This Means for Savers Despite the heightened attention, this effort does not immediately change 401(k) offerings. Even if regulators revise the rules, employers and plan providers would still decide whether to include crypto options, and individuals would have to actively select them for their portfolios. Supporters argue that adding digital assets — if done with proper safeguards — could offer greater diversification and potential long-term growth beyond traditional investments. Critics and some financial professionals warn about volatility, transparency concerns, and fiduciary risks, underscoring the need for clear “guardrails” before widespread adoption. In addition to the SEC letter, lawmakers are advancing legislation, such as the Retirement Investment Choice Act, aimed at codifying the executive order and making these changes permanent. That bill would enshrine into law the broader access to alternative investments, including digital assets, within 401(k) plans. As of today, regulators have not finalized new rules permitting crypto in retirement plans. The SEC and DOL are expected to continue consultations and potentially propose guidance or rule changes in the coming months.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-12 15:44:19

Data reveals a staggering $113 million worth of futures liquidated across major exchanges in just 60 minutes. This intense activity highlights the extreme volatility and high-risk nature of leveraged trading. For traders and investors, understanding why this happens is crucial for navigating these turbulent waters. What Does $113 Million in Futures Liquidated Actually Mean? When we talk about futures being liquidated, we refer to the forced closure of leveraged positions. Exchanges do this automatically when a trader’s collateral can no longer cover potential losses. The past hour saw this process unfold on a massive scale, wiping out $113 million in positions. This event often acts as a catalyst, accelerating price moves and creating a cascade effect in the market. Looking at the broader picture, the past 24 hours tell an even more dramatic story, with total liquidations reaching $324 million. This data isn’t just a number; it represents significant capital erosion and shifting market sentiment. Such events frequently occur during periods of sharp price movements, where over-leveraged positions get caught on the wrong side of the trade. Why Do These Massive Liquidations Happen? The primary driver behind these events is excessive leverage. Traders using high leverage magnify both their potential gains and losses. Therefore, even a small price move against their position can trigger a liquidation. The recent $113 million in futures liquidated serves as a stark reminder of this mechanism. High Leverage: Traders often use 10x, 25x, or even 100x leverage, which requires very little price movement to trigger a margin call. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency prices are notoriously volatile. Rapid swings can liquidate thousands of positions within minutes. Cascade Effect: Large liquidations can force further selling as exchanges close positions, pushing prices further and triggering more liquidations. How Can Traders Protect Themselves from Liquidation? Surviving in a market where $113 million can vanish in an hour requires discipline and strategy. The key is risk management. First, always use stop-loss orders to define your maximum loss upfront. Second, avoid extreme leverage. While 100x might seem tempting, it dramatically increases your risk of being part of the next liquidation statistic. Furthermore, maintain adequate margin in your account. Treat it as a safety buffer against volatility. Diversifying your portfolio can also help, as it reduces exposure to a single asset’s violent move. Remember, the goal is to stay in the game long-term, not to win a single high-stakes bet. What Does This Mean for the Overall Crypto Market? A wave of futures being liquidated, like the $113 million event, often leads to a localized “capitulation.” This can sometimes mark a short-term bottom, as weak hands are forced out of the market. However, it also creates fear and can deter new capital. For the ecosystem, these events underscore the need for better risk education and more robust trading tools for retail participants. In conclusion, the sight of $113 million in futures liquidated in one hour is a powerful lesson in market dynamics. It highlights the double-edged sword of leverage and the relentless nature of volatility. For the savvy trader, these events are not just headlines but opportunities to learn, adapt, and refine strategies for a more resilient trading future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What triggers a futures liquidation? A futures liquidation is triggered automatically by the exchange when the value of your position falls to a point where your remaining collateral (margin) is insufficient to cover potential losses. This is known as hitting your liquidation price. Is losing $113 million in liquidations normal? While large, multi-million dollar liquidation events are not uncommon in the highly volatile crypto market, a figure like $113 million in one hour signifies extreme price movement and a high concentration of leveraged positions moving against traders. Can I get my money back after a liquidation? No. Once a position is liquidated, it is permanently closed by the exchange, and any remaining margin (if any) is returned to your account. The losses from the trade are realized and cannot be recovered. Which side of the market usually gets liquidated more? Liquidations typically hit the side of the market that is wrong about a sharp, sudden price move. In a rapid price drop, long positions (bets on the price going up) are often liquidated. In a rapid price surge, short positions (bets on the price going down) get liquidated. How can I check liquidation data? You can monitor liquidation data on analytics websites like Coinglass or Bybit’s data dashboard. These platforms provide real-time and historical data on futures liquidated across multiple exchanges. Do large liquidations affect the spot price of Bitcoin? Yes, they can. Large-scale liquidations can force exchanges to sell the underlying asset to cover positions, creating additional sell pressure in the spot market, which can drive the price down further in the short term.

Each of these cryptos offers something entirely different: momentum, utility, community-based strength, and explosive growth potential for what will likely be the next big thing. XRP continues to demonstrate strength and resilience, integrating into the markets for payments at a gradually increasing level. Dogecoin, despite having started off as a bit of a joke, continues to have a presence that cannot be denied. By having the liquidity, surviving for so many cycles, and having the massive following that it does, it remains one of the few meme coins left that could potentially shock the markets with a surprise rally during a period of growth. However, the wildcard that could potentially pay off the most, is undoubtedly Mutuum Finance (MUTM). This project has turned out to be the best cheap cryptocurrency to buy, given that the presale surpassed $19.28 million, with Phase 6 already on the cusp of completion. This level of swift progress clearly reflects the commitment of the investors, who are eagerly pushing for the launch of the platform’s version 1. XRP Takes Aim at $4.47 Whilst Quietly Building Momentum XRP is entering a new bullish range, stabilizing with unexpected strength as it moves on to its main target of $4.47, a figure that traders have been waiting for eagerly. The steady market development encourages the notion that the market is about to witness a momentum shift, with buyers showing gradual signs of reviving their confidence, thanks to the reduced volatility and the reappearance of liquidity. It looks like XRP is ready for one of the decisive moves it has seen over the last several months, given the growing positivity in the altcoin market. Meanwhile, the attention of investors continues to widen toward a new player, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which appears to be the best crypto among DeFi platforms. Dogecoin Approaches Key Accumulation Zone as Bulls Await Potential Reversal Dogecoin is again at its strongest support level, the same level that fueled the last huge rally, and the markets are starting to stabilize after weeks of controlled selling. This level again and again has turned out to be the launchpad of massive rallies, and the current signs of DOGE markets are that the markets are heading toward a new phase of accumulation. If the markets continue to hold this level, the journey toward the mid-range breakout starts looking very likely, following the same path that was depicted in the recent technical analysis. And with the rotation of capital toward early-positioning assets, naturally, attention is drawn toward Mutuum Finance, the best cheap cryptocurrency to buy for early-stage positioning. MUTM Presale Approaching Completion in Phase 6 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already emerging firmly on the DeFi scene, and it is gaining the attention of numerous investors who are looking for early access. The presale is gaining tremendous momentum with over 18,450 participants and a total of $19.28 million raised. The current token price for Phase 6 is $0.035, and with over 98% sold, this phase is nearing completion. However, Phase 7 will raise the token price by 20% to $0.04, and the remaining Phase 6 provides a last chance for participants to join the MUTM network at a bargain price. This highlights the tremendous growth potential of the crypto and solidifies its status as the best crypto to invest today. Building on the Buy-and-Distribute Mechanism of Mutuum What marks the distinctive presence of Mutuum Finance is the Buy-and-Distribute system, which helps convert the activity on the platform into a benefit for the token-holding community. The system does not use pricing for benefits. Instead, the fee generated through loans, borrowing, and staking is used for the repurchase of MUTM. The repurchased tokens are subsequently rewarded to users who stake their mtTokens, kickstarting a positive cycle, where the more the platform is used, the higher the fees, and subsequently, the higher the number of buybacks, thus boosting the staking rewards. Through associating the growth of the token with the use of the network, MUTM sets the stage for a reliable investment opportunity within the DeFi sphere and is regarded as the best cheap cryptocurrency to buy for investors seeking real utility and growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Phase 6 is 98%+ sold at $0.035, with 18,450+ investors contributing $19.28M. Phase 7 aims to raise the price to $0.04. With a dual lending DeFi platform, Buy-and-Distribute rewards, and the imminent launch of the V1, the use cases provided by MUTM shine with growth. It is essential that individuals get on board early to secure positions in what is widely considered the best crypto for potential long-term gains.

Even with the prices becoming increasingly bearish, this movement has not entirely affected the overall sentiment toward the altcoin, as evidenced by another day of bullish inflows into the Spot XRP Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) . Huge Capital Keeps Pouring Into XRP Spot ETFs In the evolving Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) landscape, the XRP funds are quietly building one of their biggest waves yet. Since the launch of the funds, they have demonstrated substantial growth, challenging the likes of their Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs counterparts . The funds are extending a remarkable run of consistent inflows that are starting to attract more market attention. A recent X post from Moon Lambo, a crypto enthusiast and YouTuber, shows that the XRP Spot ETFs have now recorded their 19 consecutive days of inflows. What began as a means for more exposure has evolved into a distinct pattern of confidence as asset managers continue to purchase the leading altcoin through the initiative in spite of overall market volatility. Since the first spot XRP ETF was introduced, there has never been a day of outflows. Following weeks of their inception, the cumulative inflow into the funds is currently valued at a staggering $954 million. With such a massive capital accumulated in mere weeks, reflecting relentless demand for the altcoin, the expert believes that this figure could explode in the next 5 to 10 years. Will The ETFs Acquire The Entire Supply? After examining the growth of the funds, SMQKE, a crypto pundit and researcher, reported that the XRP spot ETFs are aiming for the 42.87% of supply that truly matters in the market. According to the expert, the funds do not need to take all of the supply to generate a supply shock . Currently, only 42.87% of the XRP supply is in circulation and available for purchase on the market, which is the real pool from which ETFs are pulled. Data shows that the funds now hold about 0.75% of the overall supply. When compared to the 42.87% that is actually liquid, this is a tiny fraction. However, each step forward draws directly from the limited circulating supply. As demand for the funds increases, the 42.87% share is being eroded. With each incremental increase, the amount of XRP remaining on the open market gets tighter, which is where the early stages of supply pressure start to develop. When the funds move from 0.75% closer to the 42.87% supply that is in circulation, the impact becomes visible. This is because inflows remain focused on a much smaller pool, not the entire supply.

To this question the answer is FleetMining cloud mining. Most of the investors are still locked in the traditional “buy low, sell high” mindset, whereas another faction has already redirected their attention to a more profound and less volatile reasoning – one that is based on the value of computing power itself. This is because no matter if there is a bullish or bearish trend, in fact, blockchain networks will always require computing power to run, and computing power, by its very nature, is continuous output. Why Are More People Abandoning Traditional Mining? Previously, mining meant the high purchase of hardware, difficult maintenance, noise, high electricity bills, site requirements, and the risk of changes in policies. Today, all of this is being radically changed by cloud mining. The core advantages of FleetMining are: • No need to purchase mining machines • One doesn’t need to have any technical knowledge • There is no equipment maintenance • One doesn’t need to worry about electricity costs or hash power scheduling Users can simply use a mobile phone or a personal computer to gain direct access to the worldwide computing power network, with all the difficult technical tasks being handled by the platform. Therefore, what you invest in is not mining per se, but the sharing of the computing power revenue. How Is FleetMining Able to Generate “$3,000 Per Day”? On many occasions, people instinctively react to a $3,000 per day claim with disbelief. However, if one really gets to know the working mechanism of FleetMining, he or she will come to the conclusion that the company is not simply engaging in promotional activities, but is rather presenting a structural revenue model. Through three fundamental modules, FleetMining intensifies the return on investments: 1. Centralized High-Efficiency Computing Power Integration The platform integrates computing power from multiple global data centers, reducing individual user costs through scale while improving overall mining efficiency. 2. Intelligent Scheduling and Yield Optimization Based on network difficulty, block rewards, and market conditions, the system allocates computing power to the tasks with the highest yield that are verified by the on-chain. 3. Contract-Based Revenue Model Through picking computing power level contracts corresponding to different daily income targets and cycles, users thus, minimize the degree of unpredictability. Who Can Honestly Get Close to $3,000 Per Day? Not every newcomer to the platform can immediately attain such a level. Typically, daily earnings of $3,000 are the result of the maturity of configurations and the effects of compounding. An individual’s typical progression may look like this: • Beginning stage: Utilizing free contracts to grasp daily settlement • Intermediate stage: Using the profits for reinvestment to broaden computing power • Proficient stage: Mixing the higher-tier computing power for more consistent revenue How Does FleetMining Compare to Traditional Investments ? In contrast to trading cryptocurrencies: • There is no need to forecast prices • There are no emotional ups and downs • No fear of short-term crashes In comparison with physical businesses: • There are no labor expenses • Location does not matter • The business can be run at any time of the day or night How Can Ordinary Users Get Started ? The elementary steps involved are pretty straightforward: • Opening a FleetMining account • Getting a $15–$100 bonus • Turning on cloud mining computing power • System runs automatically and generates daily income Conclusion The $3,000 per day concept is not a myth but an outcome of the computing power era. The idea behind FleetMining is not to get rich overnight but to allow value to be continuously created by the ‍‌systems.

A storm is brewing in the Aave ecosystem. A key community delegate has raised a serious question that strikes at the heart of decentralized governance: are the Aave CoW Swap fees from the protocol’s new interface being sent to the right place? This allegation suggests a potential secret diversion of funds, putting transparency and trust on trial. What’s the Core Issue with Aave CoW Swap Fees? An Aave Orbit delegate has publicly questioned the flow of transaction fees. The concern is whether swap fees generated through Aave’s newly integrated CoW Swap-based interface are being sent directly to the Aave DAO treasury. Alternatively, the delegate alleges they might be going to a separate address controlled by Aave Labs. This discrepancy, if true, could represent a significant financial leak. The claim estimates that approximately 10% of the Aave DAO’s potential revenue from this service is not reaching its intended destination. Why Does This Fee Flow Matter for Aave? In decentralized finance (DeFi), protocol-owned revenue is crucial. It funds development, security audits, grants, and other initiatives voted on by token holders. Therefore, the proper collection and distribution of Aave CoW Swap fees are not just accounting details. They are fundamental to the DAO’s autonomy and sustainability. Any misdirection undermines the “community-owned” principle that Aave and similar protocols are built upon. The integration with CoW Swap was meant to improve user experience and capture more value within the Aave ecosystem. However, this controversy highlights a critical challenge: ensuring complex technical integrations translate into clear and correct financial outcomes for the collective. What Are the Immediate Questions for the Aave Community? This situation forces several urgent questions to the forefront of Aave governance: Transparency: Can Aave Labs provide a clear, on-chain audit trail for all fees generated by the CoW Swap integration? Governance Oversight: Was the fee collection mechanism fully disclosed and approved by the DAO before implementation? Financial Impact: What is the exact monetary value of the allegedly diverted Aave CoW Swap fees , and how can it be recovered? Precedent: Does this affect other revenue streams or integrations within the Aave ecosystem? How Should the Aave DAO Respond to These Allegations? A robust response is necessary to maintain trust. First, the DAO should demand a formal, verifiable explanation from Aave Labs regarding the fee routing. This likely requires a dedicated governance proposal. Second, community delegates and developers could initiate an independent analysis of the relevant smart contracts and transaction histories. Finally, the DAO must establish clearer standards for how future revenue-generating features are implemented and monitored. This is not just about recovering lost funds. It is about reinforcing the systems that prevent such issues from happening again. The handling of Aave CoW Swap fees will set a powerful precedent for accountability in one of DeFi’s largest communities. Conclusion: A Critical Test for Decentralized Governance The allegations surrounding Aave CoW Swap fees represent more than a financial discrepancy. They are a litmus test for the maturity of decentralized governance. Can a leading DAO like Aave effectively investigate its core developer, demand transparency, and enforce accountability? The outcome will resonate across the entire DeFi landscape, proving whether these communities can self-correct and uphold their founding principles when challenged. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are Aave CoW Swap fees? A1: These are transaction fees generated when users swap tokens through the CoW Swap interface integrated into the Aave platform. They are a potential source of revenue for the Aave DAO. Q2: Who made the allegation about fee diversion? A2: The allegation was raised by an Aave Orbit delegate, a community member entrusted with voting power in Aave’s governance system. Q3: What is Aave Labs’ role in this? A3: Aave Labs is the primary development company behind the Aave protocol. The delegate’s question is whether Aave Labs is correctly routing the fees to the decentralized DAO treasury or to an address it controls. Q4: How much revenue is potentially affected? A4: The delegate’s estimate suggests approximately 10% of the Aave DAO’s potential revenue from this service stream may not be reaching the treasury. Q5: What can AAVE token holders do? A5: Token holders can discuss the issue on governance forums, support proposals demanding transparency, and vote on any formal actions to investigate or rectify the situation. Q6: Why is this important for all DeFi users? A6: It highlights the ongoing challenge of ensuring true decentralization. It tests whether developer teams are accountable to their communities, especially regarding protocol revenue and treasury management. Join the Conversation Governance only works with an informed and active community. Did this breakdown of the Aave CoW Swap fees controversy help you understand the stakes?

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $89,926.01 on the Binance USDT market. This sudden shift has sent ripples through the crypto community, prompting investors to ask: what’s driving this decline, and what happens next? Why Did the Bitcoin Price Fall Below $90,000? The drop below $90,000 marks a significant moment for Bitcoin. Market analysts point to several immediate factors. First, a wave of profit-taking likely occurred after a sustained period of gains. Second, broader macroeconomic concerns, such as shifting interest rate expectations, often impact high-risk assets like cryptocurrency. Finally, increased selling pressure on major exchanges can trigger automated stop-loss orders, accelerating the downward move. Therefore, this price action is not occurring in a vacuum. What Does This Mean for Your Crypto Portfolio? For investors, understanding the context of this Bitcoin price movement is crucial. Market corrections are a normal part of any asset’s lifecycle, especially one as volatile as Bitcoin. However, this event serves as a powerful reminder of key principles: Volatility is inherent: Sharp price swings are standard in crypto markets. Long-term perspective matters: Reacting emotionally to short-term dips can be costly. Diversification helps: Spreading investments can mitigate risk during downturns. Ultimately, the current Bitcoin price level may present a new entry point for some, while others may see it as a signal to reassess their strategy. How Should Traders Navigate This Volatility? For active traders, a falling Bitcoin price creates both risk and opportunity. Key levels to watch now include potential support zones that could halt the decline. Moreover, trading volume provides clues about the conviction behind the move. Is this a minor pullback or the start of a deeper correction? Monitoring these metrics is essential. Remember, successful trading in these conditions requires discipline and a clear plan, not fear or greed. Is the Bull Market Over for Bitcoin? It’s too early to declare the bull run finished based on a single price drop. Historically, Bitcoin has experienced severe corrections during major bull markets before resuming its upward trajectory. The fundamental drivers for Bitcoin—such as institutional adoption, its role as a digital store of value, and limited supply—remain unchanged. Consequently, this dip could be a healthy consolidation phase, shaking out weak hands before the next leg up. The long-term narrative for the Bitcoin price is still being written. Actionable Insights for the Current Market Phase Instead of panicking, use this moment to make informed decisions. Review your investment thesis for Bitcoin. Does this price change alter the core reasons you invested? Consider dollar-cost averaging if you believe in the long-term value. Most importantly, avoid making rushed decisions based on short-term fear. The market’s emotional pendulum often swings too far in both directions. In summary, the Bitcoin price dipping below $90,000 is a significant market event driven by a mix of profit-taking and macroeconomic sentiment. While it introduces short-term uncertainty, it does not necessarily invalidate Bitcoin’s long-term potential. For savvy investors, understanding the reasons behind the move and maintaining a disciplined strategy is the key to navigating this volatility successfully. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: How low could the Bitcoin price go after breaking $90,000? A: Predicting exact price levels is difficult. Analysts watch key support zones, often around previous consolidation areas like $85,000 or $82,000. However, market sentiment and external news will be the ultimate drivers. Q: Should I sell my Bitcoin now? A: This is a personal decision based on your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Selling during a dip often locks in losses. Many long-term investors view such dips as potential buying opportunities. Q: What are the main reasons for this price drop? A: Primary factors include profit-taking after a rally, negative shifts in broader market risk appetite, and potential large sell orders triggering automated trading systems. Q: Will this affect other cryptocurrencies? A> Typically, yes. Bitcoin is the market leader, and major moves often pull the rest of the crypto market (altcoins) in the same direction, a phenomenon known as “Bitcoin dominance.” Q: Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? A> For some investors, a lower price can represent a better entry point. This strategy, known as “buying the dip,” carries risk but aligns with a long-term investment view. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Q: How long might this correction last? A> Corrections can last from a few days to several weeks. The duration depends on how quickly the market absorbs selling pressure and whether new positive catalysts emerge to restore buyer confidence.

Its subsidiary, Vivo Federation, has partnered with Lean Ventures in a joint venture aimed at acquiring a staggering $300 million stake. This isn’t just another crypto headline; it’s a significant signal of traditional finance deepening its roots in the digital asset ecosystem. What Does This $300 Million Deal for Ripple Labs Shares Mean? The agreement, first reported by CryptoBriefing, sees Vivo Federation teaming up with Lean Ventures, a firm with Korean roots. Their goal is clear: to amass a substantial portfolio of Ripple Labs shares . This joint venture structure is a common strategy for pooling resources and sharing risk in large-scale investments. For Ripple, the company behind the XRP cryptocurrency, this represents a major vote of confidence from the corporate investment world, potentially validating its ongoing legal battles and global payment solutions. Why Are Institutions Targeting Ripple Now? You might wonder why a clean energy company like VivoPower is diving into crypto. The answer lies in diversification and future-proofing. VivoPower, through this venture, is positioning itself at the intersection of sustainability and fintech innovation. Acquiring Ripple Labs shares offers several potential benefits: Exposure to Blockchain Growth: A direct stake in a leading blockchain company. Strategic Diversification: Moving beyond their core energy business. High-Potential Asset: Betting on Ripple’s network and XRP’s utility in cross-border payments. However, challenges remain. Ripple’s ongoing lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) creates regulatory uncertainty. Therefore, this bold move by VivoPower and Lean Ventures is a calculated risk, betting on a favorable resolution and Ripple’s long-term global adoption. How Could This Investment Shape the Crypto Landscape? This deal is more than a simple transaction; it’s a trendsetter. When established firms commit nine-figure sums to acquire Ripple Labs shares , it sends a powerful message to other institutional investors. It suggests that major players see underlying value in blockchain infrastructure companies, even amidst regulatory clouds. This could pave the way for more traditional finance entities to make similar strategic investments, further bridging the gap between conventional markets and the crypto economy. For the average crypto enthusiast, the actionable insight is clear: watch the institutions. Their movements often precede broader market trends. While not without risk, VivoPower’s venture highlights a growing narrative of institutional adoption moving beyond simple Bitcoin or Ethereum ETFs and into direct equity stakes in crypto-native firms. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Institutional Crypto Adoption VivoPower’s pursuit of $300 million in Ripple Labs shares through its joint venture is a landmark deal. It demonstrates a sophisticated, equity-based approach to crypto investment by non-crypto-native companies. This strategic acquisition, if successful, could accelerate institutional validation for the entire sector, proving that blockchain companies are viable long-term investment targets.

The initial funding round was a massive success, closing in less than two weeks and securing $500,000 in rapid fashion. That explosive demand has carried over into Phase 2, which has now officially surpassed the $800,000 milestone, with over 13 million tokens already snapped up by early adopters. With the current phase nearing its capacity, market watchers are forecasting that Phase 3 is imminent. This velocity suggests that the window to enter at these early levels is closing much faster than anticipated. Ripple Innovates While GeeFi Delivers Immediate Utility Ripple is making waves with the launch of wrapped XRP (wXRP), the strategic acquisition of Rail, and ambitious plans to tokenize over $1 billion in real-world assets on the XRPL. While Ripple strengthens its infrastructure for the future, GeeFi is capturing today’s investors with a focus on immediate, tangible utility. At the center of this ecosystem is a cutting-edge decentralized exchange (DEX) built on non-custodial principles. This platform ensures that traders maintain absolute sovereignty over their private keys and funds, eliminating the security risks inherent in centralized alternatives and offering a transparent trading environment. Beyond trading, GeeFi is bridging the gap between digital wealth and daily life with its forthcoming Crypto Cards. Backed by partnerships with global payment leaders like VISA and Mastercard, these cards will empower users to spend their crypto assets effortlessly at millions of merchants around the globe. This practical application turns speculative assets into functional currency. Furthermore, the GEE token is designed with a powerful deflationary model, utilizing a systematic burn mechanism to reduce supply over time. This scarcity engine is a critical component for driving long-term value as the platform’s adoption grows. A Financial Structure Primed for Explosive Returns The economics of the GeeFi presale are designed to reward early conviction with substantial upside. Currently, in Phase 2, tokens are priced at a highly attractive $0.06 , significantly below the confirmed listing price of $0.40 . This entry point locks in a guaranteed 667% return the moment the token hits public exchanges. The long-term projections are even more staggering. With analysts targeting a future price of $2, a strategic investment of $1,600 today could potentially balloon into $60,000 , offering a life-changing 3,233% ROI . The market’s reaction validates these ambitious targets. Having already sold over 13 million tokens and raised $800,000 in this phase alone, investor appetite is undeniable. This surge in volume has led experts to predict that Phase 2 will conclude well ahead of schedule. Adding fuel to the fire are persistent rumors regarding upcoming listings on major Tier-1 centralized exchanges. Historically, such developments act as powerful catalysts, triggering massive price appreciation immediately following a project’s public launch. Lucrative Rewards Through Flexible Staking GeeFi maximizes investor value with a robust and flexible staking program managed directly via the GeeFi Wallet. The platform offers tiered staking options tailored to various investment horizons. For those who prefer liquidity, a no-lock option provides a solid 10% APR . For investors willing to commit for fixed durations, the yields increase significantly: 15% APR for one month , 22% APR for three months , and a massive 55% APR for a twelve-month lock . Additionally, the ecosystem incentivizes community expansion through a referral program, granting users a 5% bonus on contributions made via their unique links. The Window for Life-Changing Gains Is Closing In a crowded market, GeeFi stands out as a project with genuine 100x potential, combining strong fundamentals with real-world utility. This presale represents a rare chance to get in on the ground floor of a high-growth ecosystem before it captures mainstream attention. As Phase 2 accelerates toward its hard cap and the inevitable price hike for Phase 3 draws near, the time to act is now. The combination of secured listing gains, high-yield staking rewards, and practical utility is driving intense FOMO, urging smart investors to secure their allocation before this opportunity disappears.

Data from major exchanges reveals a staggering $119 million worth of futures liquidated in a mere 60 minutes. This intense volatility serves as a powerful reminder of the high-stakes nature of leveraged trading. For traders and investors alike, understanding these futures liquidated events is crucial for navigating the market’s turbulent waters. What Does $119 Million in Futures Liquidated Actually Mean? When we talk about futures being liquidated, we’re referring to the forced closure of leveraged positions. Essentially, exchanges automatically sell a trader’s assets when their position loses too much value to cover the initial borrowed funds. The past hour saw this happen on a massive scale, totaling $119 million. Therefore, this isn’t just a statistic; it represents significant, instant financial loss for thousands of traders who bet incorrectly on the market’s direction. Why Do These Massive Liquidations Happen? Such a concentrated wave of futures liquidated is typically the result of a sharp, unexpected price move. Let’s break down the common triggers: Leverage Overload: Traders using high leverage (like 10x or 20x) are highly vulnerable. A small price swing against their position can trigger a liquidation. Cascading Effect: Initial liquidations can force more selling, pushing the price further and triggering even more liquidations in a domino effect. Market Sentiment Shift: Sudden news, a large whale sell-off, or technical breakdowns can spark panic and rapid price declines. In the past 24 hours, the total soared to $417 million futures liquidated , painting a picture of a highly volatile and corrective market session. How Can Traders Navigate This Volatility? Watching $119 million vanish is a sobering lesson. However, you can implement strategies to protect your capital. First, manage your risk by using sensible leverage. Lower leverage means a larger price buffer before liquidation. Second, always use stop-loss orders. These automatically exit your trade at a predetermined price, helping you avoid a forced liquidation. Finally, stay informed. Monitor funding rates and open interest; unusually high values can signal an overcrowded trade ripe for a squeeze. The Bigger Picture: What’s Next After This Liquidation Wave? A flush of futures liquidated often acts as a reset button for the market. It removes excessive leverage, which can reduce selling pressure and potentially pave the way for a more stable price foundation. For long-term investors, these events can create buying opportunities at lower prices. However, it also underscores the market’s inherent risk. The key takeaway is that while futures trading offers high reward potential, the risk of having your position futures liquidated is equally high and very real. In conclusion, the $119 million futures liquidated event is a stark testament to crypto market volatility. It highlights the critical importance of risk management over greed. By understanding the mechanics behind liquidations and adopting disciplined trading habits, you can better weather these inevitable storms and participate in the market more safely. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What causes a futures liquidation? A futures liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position loses enough value that their remaining collateral no longer covers the potential loss. The exchange then forcibly closes the position to prevent further debt. Is a high liquidation event bullish or bearish? It can be both. In the short term, it’s bearish as it forces sell-offs. However, by wiping out over-leveraged positions, it can reduce future selling pressure and is sometimes seen as a necessary cleanse before a potential price recovery. How can I check liquidation data? You can use data aggregation websites like Coinglass or Bybit’s tools, which track real-time and historical liquidation volumes across all major cryptocurrency exchanges. Does this mainly affect Bitcoin? While Bitcoin often sees the largest single value liquidated, such events impact the entire crypto market, especially altcoins paired with Bitcoin (like ETH or SOL), as their prices are highly correlated. Can liquidations be predicted? Not precisely, but warning signs exist. Extremely high funding rates and record levels of open interest often indicate a market overly skewed in one direction, increasing the risk of a liquidation cascade if the price reverses. What’s the difference between long and short liquidations? Long liquidations happen when the price falls sharply, wiping out bets on higher prices. Short liquidations occur during rapid price rallies, wiping out bets on lower prices. The recent $119 million event likely involved mostly long liquidations.

When someone with extraordinary credentials acts, communities and traders take notice. Such moments spark curiosity, analysis, and speculation, particularly when the individual’s decisions seem insight-driven rather than speculative. Amonyx, in a post on X, highlighted that YoungHoon Kim, reportedly the officially recognized smartest man in the world with an IQ of 276, has started buying XRP. The news quickly went viral across crypto circles, prompting discussions on whether his move signals confidence in XRP’s long-term potential. Who Is YoungHoon Kim? YoungHoon Kim is renowned for his exceptional intellect, reportedly holding an IQ of 276. He has historically maintained a low public profile, focusing on research, analytics, and innovation. His entry into cryptocurrency, particularly XRP, is noteworthy because he rarely participates in high-risk speculative markets. The officially recognized smartest man in the world (IQ 276) is buying $XRP . At this point… shouldn’t everyone stop and think for a second? https://t.co/buBaQgGR4t — Amonyx (@amonbuy) December 12, 2025 An action from someone like Kim carries both symbolic and analytical weight. While it does not guarantee market gains, it suggests careful assessment of XRP’s fundamentals. Analysts suggest that high-IQ investors typically evaluate adoption potential, network efficiency, and scalability before committing capital. Kim’s purchase may indicate confidence in XRP’s technological infrastructure and strategic positioning. Community Reactions The revelation sparked lively discussions across social media. Many retail investors paused to consider potential implications. Conversations focused on XRP’s regulatory clarity after the SEC settlement , its cross-border payment capabilities, and long-term adoption trends. Some see this as a bullish signal, while others caution that even exceptional intellect cannot predict market volatility with certainty. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Fundamentals Supporting Interest XRP continues to draw attention for its fast transaction speeds, low fees, and scalable blockchain network. Ripple’s partnerships with financial institutions and central banks enhance its credibility. Analysts point to ongoing adoption, product upgrades, and regulatory compliance as key reasons for long-term optimism. Kim’s move aligns with these fundamental considerations rather than speculative hype. Market Psychology and Strategic Impact High-profile endorsements can influence investor psychology, creating short-term momentum. However, experienced traders pair such signals with fundamental analysis. Momentum may rise if adoption and liquidity trends align, but long-term performance depends on regulatory developments, network expansion, and real-world usage. In Conclusion, YoungHoon Kim’s decision to buy XRP has amplified interest and discussion in the crypto community. While his exceptional intelligence draws attention, XRP’s trajectory depends on adoption, network performance, and regulatory clarity.

A prominent Bitcoin OG , known by the on-chain identifier 1011short, has made headlines by increasing long positions in Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) despite facing over $21 million in unrealized losses. This bold move raises a crucial question: What does a seasoned Bitcoin OG see that others might be missing? Who Is This Bitcoin OG and What’s the Strategy? According to data from Onchainlens, the investor 1011short is not a newcomer. The term Bitcoin OG typically refers to early adopters with deep experience navigating crypto cycles. Their current portfolio is substantial, holding 175,561.8 ETH (worth ~$539 million), 250,000 SOL (~$33.13 million), and 1,000 BTC (~$89.94 million). Adding to positions during a drawdown is a classic contrarian strategy, suggesting this Bitcoin OG is playing a long-term game, unfazed by short-term price fluctuations. Why Would a Bitcoin OG Hold Through Major Losses? This action provides a masterclass in investor psychology and portfolio management. For a seasoned Bitcoin OG , paper losses are part of the journey. Their strategy likely involves: Conviction in Fundamentals: Belief that ETH and SOL have strong long-term value propositions beyond current price action. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Buying more as prices drop lowers the average entry price. Risk Management: With a large, diversified portfolio, a $21M loss, while significant, may represent a calculated risk within their total capital. This behavior contrasts sharply with retail investors who often buy high and sell low. The Bitcoin OG ‘s move signals a deep-seated belief in the assets’ future, viewing the dip as a buying opportunity rather than a catastrophe. What Does This Signal for the Broader Crypto Market? When a Bitcoin OG with this level of capital makes a move, the market pays attention. Their actions can be interpreted as a bullish signal for ETH and SOL, indicating that smart money sees value at current levels. It highlights a key market dynamic: the difference between price and value . While the price of these assets has fallen, this investor’s analysis suggests their intrinsic value remains high or is growing. Key Takeaways for Everyday Crypto Investors You don’t need to be a Bitcoin OG to learn from this story. Here are actionable insights: Have a Plan: Define your investment thesis for each asset before you buy. Why do you own it? Embrace Volatility: Crypto markets are inherently volatile. Prepare for drawdowns mentally and financially. Think Long-Term: Avoid emotional decisions based on daily charts. Focus on multi-year trends and technological adoption. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never blindly follow any investor, even a Bitcoin OG . Understand the risks. In conclusion, the story of this Bitcoin OG is one of steadfast resilience. It underscores a fundamental principle of successful investing: conviction must outweigh fear. While replicating a multi-million dollar strategy isn’t feasible for most, adopting the mindset of a veteran—focusing on long-term value, managing risk, and avoiding panic—is a powerful lesson for anyone in the crypto space. The true test of an investor isn’t during a bull run, but in how they navigate the storms. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‘Bitcoin OG’ mean? A: ‘OG’ stands for ‘Original Gangster’ but in crypto context, it colloquially refers to an early adopter or veteran investor who has been in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency space since its early days. Q2: What are ‘long positions’? A: A ‘long position’ means buying an asset with the expectation that its price will increase in the future. The investor profits if the price goes up. Q3: What are ‘unrealized losses’? A: Unrealized losses are decreases in the value of an investment that you still hold. The loss is only ‘realized’ (or locked in) when you sell the asset at the lower price. Q4: Why would someone buy more of an asset that’s losing value? A: This strategy, called ‘averaging down’ or ‘dollar-cost averaging,’ lowers the average purchase price of the asset. If the investor believes the asset’s long-term fundamentals are strong, a lower price represents a better buying opportunity. Q5: Should I follow what this Bitcoin OG is doing? A: Not necessarily. Every investor’s financial situation, risk tolerance, and goals are different. Use such news as an educational case study, not direct financial advice. Always conduct your own thorough research. Q6: Where can I track on-chain data like this? A: Platforms like Onchainlens, Nansen, Glassnode, and Etherscan provide tools for analyzing wallet activity and on-chain metrics for various blockchains.

Katherine Dowling, head of the Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company (BSTR), has made a stunning Bitcoin price prediction that’s capturing attention across financial markets. She forecasts BTC will surge beyond $150,000 by 2026, driven by powerful structural forces reshaping the cryptocurrency landscape. This bold outlook comes not from speculation, but from analyzing three fundamental catalysts that could propel Bitcoin to new valuation territories. What’s Driving This Bold Bitcoin Price Prediction? Dowling’s analysis identifies three primary structural catalysts that could overcome current market volatility and selling pressure. First, regulatory changes are creating clearer frameworks for institutional participation. Second, quantitative easing policies continue to influence global liquidity. Third, institutional capital inflows are reaching unprecedented levels. Together, these factors create what Dowling describes as a “perfect storm” for Bitcoin’s valuation growth over the next two years. The Three Structural Catalysts Explained Let’s break down each catalyst that forms the foundation of this Bitcoin price prediction : Regulatory Changes: Clearer regulations reduce uncertainty for institutional investors Quantitative Easing: Global monetary policies continue to devalue traditional currencies Institutional Capital: Major financial players are allocating significant resources to Bitcoin Each catalyst reinforces the others, creating a compounding effect on Bitcoin’s potential valuation. Regulatory clarity encourages institutional participation, while quantitative easing makes Bitcoin’s fixed supply more attractive. Institutional capital then validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, attracting even more investment. Why This Bitcoin Price Prediction Differs From Others Many analysts focus on short-term price movements, but Dowling’s Bitcoin price prediction emphasizes structural, long-term factors. She argues that temporary selling pressure from events like miner capitulation or exchange-traded fund outflows will be overwhelmed by these larger trends. The key insight is that Bitcoin’s fundamentals are strengthening even when price action appears weak, setting the stage for significant appreciation. Consider how institutional adoption has evolved. Initially hesitant, major financial institutions now offer Bitcoin products to clients. Pension funds and endowments are allocating portions of their portfolios to cryptocurrency. This institutional validation creates a foundation for sustained price growth that differs from previous retail-driven cycles. Potential Challenges to This Outlook While the Bitcoin price prediction is optimistic, several challenges could impact this trajectory. Regulatory changes could become restrictive rather than enabling. Global economic conditions might shift away from quantitative easing. Institutional interest could wane if returns don’t meet expectations. However, Dowling believes these risks are manageable given Bitcoin’s growing integration into global financial systems. The most significant risk might be technological disruption or security concerns. However, Bitcoin’s network has proven remarkably resilient over its 15-year history. Each challenge overcome has strengthened its position as digital gold, making it more attractive to conservative investors seeking inflation protection. Actionable Insights for Investors If this Bitcoin price prediction proves accurate, what should investors consider? First, understand that volatility will continue despite the upward trend. Second, consider dollar-cost averaging rather than timing the market. Third, maintain a long-term perspective that aligns with the structural catalysts Dowling identifies. Most importantly, conduct your own research and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Remember that predictions are probabilistic, not certainties. While Dowling’s analysis is compelling, market conditions can change rapidly. The key is developing an investment strategy that accounts for various potential outcomes while positioning for the possibility of significant Bitcoin appreciation. Conclusion: A Compelling Vision for Bitcoin’s Future Katherine Dowling’s Bitcoin price prediction of $150,000 by 2026 presents a compelling case based on structural market changes rather than speculative hype. The combination of regulatory evolution, monetary policy trends, and institutional adoption creates powerful tailwinds for Bitcoin’s valuation. While challenges remain, the fundamental case for Bitcoin continues strengthening as it matures from speculative asset to established store of value. This prediction reminds us that Bitcoin’s journey involves both short-term volatility and long-term transformation. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem evolves, such informed forecasts help investors navigate the complex landscape of digital assets with greater clarity and confidence. Frequently Asked Questions Who is Katherine Dowling? Katherine Dowling is the head of the Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company (BSTR), a firm specializing in Bitcoin investment and treasury management strategies for institutions. What are the main drivers behind this Bitcoin price prediction? The prediction is based on three structural catalysts: regulatory changes creating clearer frameworks, quantitative easing policies affecting global liquidity, and increasing institutional capital inflows into Bitcoin. How does this prediction compare to other Bitcoin forecasts? This forecast emphasizes long-term structural factors rather than short-term technical analysis, focusing on fundamental changes in how institutions and regulators view Bitcoin. What time frame does this Bitcoin price prediction cover? The prediction specifically targets Bitcoin surpassing $150,000 by 2026, representing approximately a two-year horizon from current publication. What risks could prevent Bitcoin from reaching $150,000? Potential risks include restrictive regulatory changes, shifts in global monetary policy, decreased institutional interest, or unforeseen technological or security challenges. How should investors approach this Bitcoin price prediction? Investors should consider this as one informed perspective among many, conduct their own research, and develop strategies that account for various potential market outcomes.

As the index changes focus to early-stage investments with high-upside potential, lots of investors ask themselves whether Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the best crypto under $0.05 ahead of Q1 2026. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Lending Protocol Mutuum Finance is creating a two-market protocol in decentralized lending. In the Peer to Contract market, assets that are provided to the market include ETH or USDT. They get mtTokens which increase in value as borrowers pay up the interest. Direct agreement between a borrower and a lender exists in the Peer to Peer market. Rates shift with liquidity. Borrowing is affordable when the liquidity is good. In the event of liquidity decline, rates rise. Loan to value regulations are used to guide the safety of the collateral. In case of excessive fall of collateral, liquidation is done, and a liquidator is awarded discounted collateral. These mechanics assist in making borrowing predictable under varied circumstances. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) started its presale in early 2025 on the price of $0.01, and currently it is being sold at $0.035, which is a 250% MUTM appreciation. According to the project data, it has collected over $19.250M raised, 18,500 holders, and sold 815M tokens. V1 Launch and Security Reviews The official X account of the team assured that V1 testnet will be released in Q4 2025. V1 The lending pool, mtTokens, liquidation tools and the debt system will be launched. Launch support will be ETH, and USDT. This is one of the most significant catalysts of the next stage of MUTM which a number of investors believe in. Security is a major focus. Mutuum Finance has passed a CertiK audit with a score of 90/100 on Token Scan. Halborn Security is evaluating going through contract conduct in borrowing reasoning, the liquidation point and collateral standards. There is a provision of a $50k bug-bounty to facilitate third-party code testing. With these indicators, several altcoin analysts based on crypto prediction reckon that the token could rise to 4x to 6x as long as the borrowing activity starts and takes place in the first testnet phase. Long-Term View mtTokens serve as the native yield protocol. They rise with repayment of interest by the borrowers. This provides the user with predictable APY based on lending volume. A buy and distribute model is also employed at Mutuum Finance. Part of the platform revenue will purchase MUTM in the open market. Such bought tokens are awarded to the users holding staked tokens, which were in the form of mtTokens. This generates inherent purchase pressure. The protocol will be based on Chainlink regarding the accuracy of Oracle with the help of aggregated sources of data, according to the official roadmap. Right pricing is required in stable lending and liquidation behavior. According to analysts, these systems are said to provide MUTM with a good structural base. Some believe that the buy-and-distribute integration and some level of oracle support could make MUTM go as high as 7x to 9x as long as early adopters increase post-V1 with the help of mtTokens. The reason why Analysts Compare MUTM to Early Aave A number of analysts are positioning Mutuum Finance as early Aave because of its well-organized roadmap and early stage of placement. Aave got traction as it provided a straightforward application, actual borrowing action and growing markets. Mutuum Finance is developing the same route but much earlier and at a low price. Similar to the initial Aave, Mutuum Finance builds a platform where yield is built via activity as opposed to unnatural inflation. Its architecture is concerned with stability, transparency and predictable borrowing. This explains why most early investors monitoring the best crypto investments argue that MUTM could be able to follow a development path as early lending protocol. Mutuum Finance is currently at critical Phase 6 zone and final allocation is approaching. The token increased 250%, acquired 18,500 holders, raised capital of $19.250M, overcame significant audits and is preparing its Q4 V1 testnet. MtToken yield, buy-and-distribute pressure, oracle accuracy, stablecoin plans and Layer-2 expansion have the project becoming more visible as traders seek the best crypto to invest in before the coming next cycle.

As the administration targets state AI laws, young companies face the daunting prospect of navigating conflicting requirements while waiting for courts and Congress to determine the future of AI governance. What Does Trump’s AI Executive Order Actually Do? The executive order titled “Ensuring a National Policy Framework for Artificial Intelligence” represents the administration’s most aggressive move yet to assert federal control over AI regulation. Signed Thursday evening, the order directs multiple federal agencies to challenge what it calls “onerous” state AI laws that create a regulatory patchwork for businesses. Key provisions include: The Department of Justice must establish a task force within 30 days to challenge state AI laws on interstate commerce grounds The Commerce Department has 90 days to compile a list of state AI laws that could affect federal funding eligibility The FTC and FCC must explore federal standards that could preempt state rules The administration will work with Congress on developing uniform AI legislation “This David Sacks-led executive order is a gift for Silicon Valley oligarchs who are using their influence in Washington to shield themselves and their companies from accountability,” said Michael Kleinman, Head of U.S. Policy at the Future of Life Institute. The Legal Battle Over State AI Laws Legal experts predict immediate court challenges as states defend their consumer protection authority. Sean Fitzpatrick, CEO of LexisNexis North America, tells Bitcoin World that these cases will likely escalate to the Supreme Court, creating prolonged uncertainty for businesses operating across state lines. The central legal question revolves around whether AI constitutes interstate commerce that should be regulated exclusively at the federal level. This constitutional argument could take years to resolve through the court system, leaving startups in regulatory limbo. Potential Outcome Impact on Startups Timeline Courts uphold state authority Continue navigating patchwork of 50+ different regulations 1-3 years Courts side with federal preemption Wait for Congress to pass comprehensive federal law 2-5 years Congress passes compromise legislation Adapt to new national standards while states adjust 1-2 years Why Federal AI Policy Uncertainty Hurts Innovation Startup founders and AI entrepreneurs express deep concern about the regulatory uncertainty created by the executive order. Arul Nigam, co-founder at Circuit Breaker Labs, highlights the practical challenges: “There’s uncertainty in terms of do [AI companion and chatbot companies] have to self-regulate? Are there open-source standards they should adhere to? Should they continue building?” Hart Brown, principal author of Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt’s Task Force on AI and Emerging Technology recommendations, explains the resource challenge: “Because startups are prioritizing innovation, they typically do not have robust regulatory governance programs until they reach a scale that requires a program. These programs can be expensive and time-consuming to meet a very dynamic regulatory environment.” The Disproportionate Impact on AI Startups Andrew Gamino-Cheong, CTO and co-founder of AI governance company Trustible, warns that the executive order will backfire on AI innovation: “Big Tech and the big AI startups have the funds to hire lawyers to help them figure out what to do, or they can simply hedge their bets. The uncertainty does hurt startups the most, especially those that can’t get billions of funding almost at will.” The regulatory ambiguity creates several specific challenges for emerging AI companies: Increased sales cycles as risk-sensitive customers hesitate Higher compliance costs for navigating multiple regulatory regimes Difficulty obtaining insurance and investment with unclear rules Competitive disadvantage against well-resourced larger companies Gary Kibel, a partner at Davis + Gilbert, notes that while businesses would welcome a single national standard, “an executive order is not necessarily the right vehicle to override laws that states have duly enacted.” The Path Forward for AI Regulation Morgan Reed, president of The App Association, urges Congress to act quickly: “We can’t have a patchwork of state AI laws, and a lengthy court fight over the constitutionality of an Executive Order isn’t any better. Congress needs to enact a comprehensive, targeted, and risk-based national AI framework.” The executive order comes amid stalled congressional efforts to establish federal AI standards. Lawmakers from both parties have expressed concern that blocking state regulation without federal standards could leave consumers unprotected and companies unaccountable. Nigam expresses cautious optimism about congressional action: “I am hopeful that Congress could move more quickly now to pass a better federal framework.” Frequently Asked Questions What is the main goal of Trump’s AI executive order? The order aims to establish federal supremacy in AI regulation by challenging state laws and pushing for a single national framework, arguing that the current patchwork of state regulations creates unnecessary burdens for businesses. Who is David Sacks and what is his role? David Sacks serves as Trump’s AI and crypto policy czar and has been a leading voice behind the administration’s AI preemption push. He is a venture capitalist and former PayPal executive. Which organizations are mentioned in the article? The article references several organizations including the Future of Life Institute , LexisNexis , Trustible , Davis + Gilbert , and The App Association . What immediate effects will startups experience? Startups will face continued uncertainty about which regulations apply, potentially higher compliance costs, and difficulty planning product development and market expansion while legal battles play out. How long might this regulatory uncertainty last? Legal experts predict 1-5 years of uncertainty as court cases progress and Congress potentially develops comprehensive legislation, depending on election outcomes and political will. Conclusion: A Regulatory Crossroads for AI Trump’s AI executive order represents a high-stakes gamble in the battle over artificial intelligence governance. While promising regulatory simplicity, it risks creating exactly the opposite—prolonged legal battles that leave startups navigating shifting requirements while well-resourced tech giants wait out the uncertainty. The coming months will reveal whether this move accelerates national AI policy or plunges the industry into deeper regulatory confusion just as artificial intelligence reaches critical adoption thresholds across sectors. The ultimate irony may be that an order intended to create certainty through federal AI policy instead creates the very regulatory limbo it sought to eliminate, potentially stifling the innovation it aimed to protect.

According to reports, the Fed has carried out three consecutive interest rate cuts totaling 0.75% from September to December. The move was widely expected. Still, market responses have been mixed and somewhat choppy. Related Reading: American Bitcoin Makes Big Buy, Adds 416 BTC To Its Stack Fed Moves And Market Takeaway According to CoinEx chief analyst Jeff Ko, much of the Fed’s action was already priced in, and the updated dot plot leaned a bit more hawkish than some had hoped.

Markets took the measures as mildly positive. US stocks rose, and that helped Bitcoin find some footing after an early dip. Santiment And The Short-Term Reaction Based on reports from onchain analytics firm Santiment, each cut has prompted a classic “buy the rumor, sell the news” move where initial optimism is followed by short selling. 🇺🇸 The US Fed made three strategic cuts over the past 3 months, resulting in a total of an 0.75% reduction to interest rates. 1⃣ September 17, 2025: Fed lowered the target range to 4.00 %–4.25 % (from 4.25 %+) at the 16–17 Sep meeting. 2⃣ October 29, 2025: Fed cut the rate to… pic.twitter.com/X6DWypvq5t — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 11, 2025 Cuts are seen as bullish for crypto over the long haul, yet they have triggered brief pullbacks in practice. Santiment adds that a small wave of FUD or retail selling often signals that the mild post-cut downswing is finished and a bounce may follow once things calm down. Technical Levels Traders Are Watching Bitcoin was volatile in the aftermath. It fell under $90,000 then popped to $93,500 on Coinbase before settling near $92,300 at the time of reporting. Key resistance sits between $97,000 and $108,000. On the daily chart, BTC remains inside a small rising channel that sits within a larger downtrend, and technical traders note that a MACD histogram is approaching a positive crossover — a sign some see as possible renewed momentum. ETF activity has been tepid, with only $219 million in net inflows since late November, which keeps some investors cautious. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin Waking Up?

The enhanced tools now reach almost 20 new countries including Germany, India, Sweden, and Taiwan. Language Pair Available For English → German English speakers German → English German speakers Multiple languages → English Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Dutch, Hindi, Italian, Romanian, Swedish speakers The platform now includes improved feedback mechanisms, providing helpful tips based on speaking practice. A new streak tracking feature shows how many consecutive days users have been learning, encouraging consistency—a feature familiar to Duolingo users. Practical Applications of Real-Time Translation Technology This technology has immediate practical applications that extend beyond casual travel: Business meetings: International negotiations and collaborations become smoother Education: Students can attend lectures in foreign languages without missing content Entertainment: Watch foreign films and TV shows with real-time audio translation Healthcare: Medical professionals can communicate with patients who speak different languages Tourism: Travelers can navigate foreign countries with greater independence The Future of Language Technology and Global Communication Google’s announcement signals a significant shift in how we approach language barriers. The integration of real-time audio translation with everyday technology (headphones) makes this capability accessible to billions of people worldwide. As the technology improves and expands to more platforms and regions, we’re moving toward a world where language differences no longer prevent meaningful connection. For cryptocurrency and technology observers, this development represents another example of how AI is transforming fundamental human experiences. Just as blockchain technology removes financial intermediaries, AI-powered translation removes language intermediaries, creating more direct human connections. FAQs About Google Translate’s New Features What devices support the real-time headphone translation? The beta is currently available on Android devices in the Translate app. It works with any pair of headphones. When will this feature come to iOS? Google plans to bring the capability to iOS and more countries in 2026. How does Gemini AI improve translations? Gemini AI enables smarter, more natural translations by understanding context, idioms, and nuanced meanings rather than translating literally. Which languages are supported for language learning? English speakers can practice German, while speakers of Bengali, Mandarin Chinese (Simplified), Dutch, German, Hindi, Italian, Romanian, and Swedish can practice English. How does this compare to Duolingo? While Duolingo focuses primarily on language learning, Google Translate now combines translation and learning tools, with features like streak tracking that compete directly with Duolingo’s approach. Who announced these features at Google? Rose Yao, Google VP of Product Management for Search Verticals, announced the features in an official Google blog post . Google’s real-time headphone translation represents a transformative moment in global communication technology. By combining advanced Gemini AI with accessible hardware, Google has created a solution that could fundamentally change how people interact across language barriers.

John kept his buy rating on the Google parent and said the stronger call comes after the stock already climbed 65% this year. He wrote that the new level suggests another 12% upside from Thursday’s close. He pointed at Google Search and the fast pickup in Gemini use as the main drivers. John said he lifted the target after Google rolled out artificial intelligence overviews inside Search. He now expects Google Search to grow at a 10.2% compound annual growth rate for the next five years. His earlier estimate was 9.6%. He tied the increase to heavier traffic inside Search as more users turn on AI Mode and rely on AI overviews when they type in a query. He also raised his Gemini monthly average users forecast for the end of 2025. His new estimate sits at 850 million, up from 600 million. He said Gemini could reach three billion monthly average users by 2030. Analyst explains price target lift John backed up his call with fresh survey work from the United States. “We are raising GOOG Search estimates on our positive U.S. survey data, which indicates i) ramping Gemini chatbot usage following the launch of Gemini 3, ii) continued increases in Search engagement driven by AI Mode and AI Overviews usage, and iii) an increasing share of ChatGPT users that are also using Gemini,” he wrote. He said Search traffic keeps rising as AI features become part of normal use for everyday queries. He also talked about Alphabet’s advertising business. “Google is the best-positioned mobile advertising company, in our view, due to its leading mobile advertising revenue position, robust capabilities, and traffic advantage relative to its peers,” he said. John added that the mix of advertising tools, cloud demand, and the company’s AI-heavy structure supports a forecast of double-digit annual revenue growth and double-digit annual EBITDA growth. He said these numbers reflect what he sees in the firm’s long-term models rather than any short-term reaction. The price call landed at the same time the wider AI trade struggled. U.S. artificial intelligence stocks traded lower on Friday and extended losses into their third straight session. Oracle fell 6% on Friday. Nvidia dropped almost 5%. Broadcom, which posted strong results on Thursday, slid 10%, and the Nasdaq traded about 2% lower on the day. The weakness followed a rough stretch earlier in the week. AI stocks fall as other sectors rise The slide began when Oracle posted revenue that missed analyst expectations late Wednesday. The stock fell 11% on Thursday and pulled down other AI-linked names even as Wall Street pushed toward new highs. The action pointed to money leaving tech and moving into different parts of the market. While AI names struggled, stocks in financials, health care, and industrials moved higher. Visa, Mastercard, UnitedHealth Group, and GE Aerospace were some of the names that gained ground. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.26% on Thursday. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both closed at fresh records on the same day. The AI weakness pushed the S&P 500 down 0.8% for the week. The Nasdaq lost almost 2% for the week. The Dow stayed positive with a roughly 1% gain. Smaller companies held up better than large ones. The Russell 2000 rose more than 1% this week and reached new all-time and closing highs on Thursday.

Even with major assets showing some resilience, traders are notably cautious, gravitating toward projects that deliver real revenue, real utility, and clearer value beyond day-to-day volatility. That shift has driven much more interest toward platforms tied to genuine financial use cases rather than hype alone. That shift has put Digitap ($TAP) on the radar. It’s one of the few presales backed by a working app and real financial use, offering cross-border payments, a deflationary token model, and a fixed launch price well above the current round. For those trying to find the best crypto to buy now without relying on hype, Digitap is increasingly becoming the project that stands out. BTC, ETH, SOL Rise, but Fear Persists — What Traders Should Note Bitcoin has climbed back above its 9-EMA after last week’s sharp drop and has been forming a steady pattern of higher lows. The short-term outlook still looks constructive, but momentum has slowed. Ethereum is also back above its EMA, recovering from its mid-November slide and settling into a more stable upward channel. Its recent move toward $3,300 hints at improving sentiment, though buyers remain somewhat hesitant given the broader macro backdrop. Solana, meanwhile, is trading just above its 9-EMA after bouncing off the $130 zone. It’s showing early signs of stability following the wider pullback. Selling pressure has eased, and the chart now appears more balanced, with some short-term strength as long as it continues to hold above the EMA. With all leading coins hovering near their short-term EMAs after brief recoveries, the market’s cautious tone is clear, prompting some investors to look to crypto presales like Digitap, which offer structured token economics and utility-driven growth, rather than relying on volatile price swings. $TAP’s Scarcity and Use Cases Put it at the Top of the Best Crypto Presales Digitap operates as a crypto-first banking layer, giving users a single account to hold both fiat and crypto while moving funds across SEPA, SWIFT, and blockchain rails. The platform now supports more than 20 fiat currencies and over 100 cryptocurrencies, giving it a level of day-to-day utility that many newer projects only talk about in future plans. Importantly, the $TAP supply is locked at 2 billion tokens with no mechanism for additional minting and no secondary emission schedules tucked away in the token model. That ceiling removes the usual dilution risks and provides a clearer sense of scarcity for anyone holding or using the asset. That scarcity is reinforced through a deflationary burn model—tokens are permanently removed from circulation via transaction flows, staking penalties, and, most importantly, through Digitap’s commitment to use 50% of all app fee profits to buy back and burn $TAP. Utility is equally central. $TAP powers staking, unlocks fee discounts and VIP rewards, enables governance, and functions as the native payment currency across the Digitap platform. Staking is designed to be non-inflationary, offering up to 124% APR in presale and 100% post-launch from a fixed reward pool without printing new supply. This combination of real-world banking infrastructure, deflationary economics, and live utility is why Digitap continues to stand out in a crowded presale market. From $0.0125 to $0.0361: Tracking $TAP’s Steady Climb $TAP is in Round 2 of its crypto presale at $0.0361, with the next programmed increase to $0.0371. More than 141 million tokens have been sold, $2.34 million raised, and the round is 98% complete. The urgency is simple: this discounted price remains active only until the stage sells out. The key valuation anchor is the $0.14 launch price. Buying at $0.0361 secures a roughly 280% ROI, positioning a Round-2 buyer for about 3.9x. Even in the short term, the token moved from $0.0325 on Friday to $0.0361 on Monday, an 11% weekend jump while majors stayed flat. The broader presale trend—from $0.0125 in early October to today’s price—represents nearly 190% growth. This is why Digitap continues to stand out as one of the best cryptos to buy now , offering more structured upside than most altcoins to buy during a bear market. USE THE CODE “TAPPER20” FOR 20% OFF FIRST-TIME PURCHASES What Sets $TAP Apart With Supply Discipline and Real Utility Risks remain tied to broader market liquidity and execution timelines, especially with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana still driving macro sentiment. But compared to these volatile majors, Digitap offers a structurally protected entry price, real revenue-backed mechanics, and a clear path to adoption. For investors weighing catalysts against downside, these factors continue to position Digitap among the best cryptos to buy now in a defensive market. Digitap is Live NOW.

Reportedly, the change came from labor shortages and limits on key materials, and investors reacted fast. The stock dropped as much as 6.5%, then traded down 5.3% at $188.26 on Friday. Oracle and OpenAI did not comment on the delay, even though the projects are meant to support one of the biggest AI infrastructure deals in the world. The contract is worth $300 billion, signed this summer, and it requires Oracle to supply the computing power to train and run OpenAI’s models. The US sites are still being built on tight timelines, and people familiar with the work say they are set to become some of the largest data centers on the planet. Clay Magouyrk, one of Oracle’s chief executives, told investors on an earnings call that the first site in Abilene, Texas, remains on schedule and already has more than 96,000 Nvidia chips delivered. He said, “We have ambitious achievable goals for capacity delivery worldwide.” Oracle faces pressure as delays trigger market reaction Oracle’s slide came right after its newest earnings report, which reversed the momentum the company enjoyed earlier this year. Shares had climbed for months as Oracle locked in multibillion-dollar data center deals, including the OpenAI agreement, and that rally briefly pushed Larry Ellison past Elon Musk as the world’s richest person. That streak ended this week when results landed below analyst expectations and the delays raised new questions about Oracle’s AI push. Oracle’s cloud business still showed big growth. Fiscal second-quarter cloud revenue jumped 34% to $7.98 billion. Its infrastructure business rose 68% to $4.08 billion, but both numbers came in just under forecasts. Oracle is now spending heavily on data centers to serve OpenAI, TikTok-owner ByteDance, and Meta. The scale of the build-out has pushed Oracle’s credit costs higher. ICE Data Services said protecting Oracle’s debt for five years rose as much as 0.17 percentage point to 1.41 percentage point, the highest intraday level since April 2009. Jacob Bourne, an analyst at Emarketer, said, “Oracle faces its own mounting scrutiny over a debt-fueled data center build-out and concentration risk amid questions over the outcome of AI spending uncertainty. This revenue miss will likely exacerbate concerns among already cautious investors about its OpenAI deal and its aggressive AI spending.” Oracle absorbs rising costs as investors look for faster payoff Oracle’s remaining performance obligation reached $523 billion, well above the $519 billion analysts expected. Investors want to see that flow into revenue sooner rather than later. But Oracle’s cash burn increased this quarter, and free cash flow hit negative $10 billion. Bloomberg data shows the company’s total debt at around $106 billion. JP Morgan’s Mark Murphy wrote, “Investors continually seem to expect incremental cap ex to drive incremental revenue faster than the current reality.” The delays add another layer of concern for markets still trying to price the risks around Oracle’s AI spending. Workers close to the data center projects said shortages of labor and materials forced the timeline change. These projects were originally meant to showcase Oracle’s ability to move fast in the AI race. Now the shift into 2028 adds pressure on both Oracle and OpenAI. Clay Magouyrk said in a statement, “Oracle is very good at building and running high-performance and cost-efficient cloud data centers. Because our data centers are highly automated, we can build and run more of them.” The message was meant to reassure investors, but the stock kept falling as traders processed the cost load tied to Oracle’s expansion. Oracle is trying to hold on to momentum in cloud computing while building some of the most expensive AI sites in the market. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

The feature, powered by crypto infrastructure provider Zerohash, marks a major expansion of the firm’s digital-asset capabilities. The rollout will occur in phases, with availability determined by account type, jurisdiction, and regulatory requirements. In addition to the U.S. pilot, Interactive Brokers said it has also started offering stablecoin deposits to a wider group of global users, allowing transfers in USDC that are automatically converted to U.S. dollars upon arrival. The company said the move gives traders faster and more flexible funding options, particularly compared to traditional banking rails that are limited by clearing times and operating hours. JUST IN: Financial giant 'Interactive Brokers' to allow brokerage accounts to be funded by crypto stablecoins. pic.twitter.com/rJgWvxtWWA — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) December 12, 2025 How USDC Funding Works To deposit via stablecoin, clients must log into the Interactive Brokers Client Portal, go to Transfer & Pay, select Deposit Funds, and choose “Fund with Stablecoin.” Users then select a blockchain network—such as Ethereum, Solana, or Base—and Zerohash generates a unique wallet address and QR code for the transaction. Clients must send USDC from their personal crypto wallets to the provided address, ensuring that the selected blockchain network matches the one chosen during the deposit setup. Interactive Brokers strongly advises against manually typing wallet addresses due to the risk of irreversible errors. Transaction Limits, Fees, and Supported Assets Stablecoin deposits come with several constraints: a $10 minimum per transfer, a $25,000 per-transaction cap, a $25,000 daily limit, and a monthly ceiling of $100,000. At present, only USDC is supported; deposits in other stablecoins or cryptocurrencies will not be processed. Interactive Brokers said it does not charge deposit fees, though users must cover blockchain gas fees associated with the chosen network. Zerohash applies a 0.3% conversion fee, with a $1 minimum. Most deposits are credited within minutes following blockchain confirmation, offering speed advantages over ACH or wire transfers. Interactive Brokers cautions that USDC must be sent on the exact blockchain network selected during setup. Sending assets via the wrong network or to an incorrect wallet address may result in rejection, delays, or permanent loss of funds. Users encountering issues are directed to the firm’s stablecoin deposit FAQ for troubleshooting. Step Toward 24/7 Bank-Free Funding? By allowing deposits directly from crypto wallets, Interactive Brokers is moving toward a funding model that is faster, continuously available, and less dependent on banking intermediaries. The phased U.S. rollout shows growing institutional acceptance of stablecoins as a practical settlement tool, particularly for active traders seeking real-time funding flexibility. Coinbase Predicts Stablecoins Will Enter the Mainstream Stablecoins are set to move firmly into the financial mainstream next year, according to Keith Grose, UK CEO of Coinbase, who expects continued acceleration in consumer adoption and regulatory clarity. Speaking ahead of expected policy developments in the UK, Grose outlines why he believes stablecoins are becoming a central pillar of the next phase of digital finance. “We see stablecoins transitioning into mainstream payment rails in the UK and worldwide in 2026,” Grose said. “More consumers are now using stablecoins for seamless everyday payments, without needing to change how they transact.” He added that global investors are increasingly turning to digital-currency alternatives to diversify away from traditional dollar-denominated instruments.

OCC’s Approval Of Digital Asset Trust Banks Once finalized and full approval is reached, these national trust bank charters would empower the crypto companies to manage and hold assets on behalf of their customers, enabling faster payment settlements. Currently, Anchorage Digital is the only digital asset company that holds a national trust bank charter from the OCC, which oversees a total of 60 such institutions. Comptroller Jonathan Gould emphasized that each application underwent a thorough and rigorous review process, underscoring the necessity for each entity to meet additional conditions before gaining full operational status. He explained that welcoming new entrants into the banking landscape aids in modernizing the system, diversifying offerings, and enhancing access to innovative financial products. Ripple CEO Challenges Banking Lobbyists Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, commented on the approval via social media, highlighting it as a significant advancement for Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD. He stated that it sets a high standard for compliance under both federal and state regulation. Garlinghouse also took a moment to address banking lobbyists who may have opposed this move, asserting that their “anti-competitive tactics” are evident. The executive pointed out that while these lobbyists have argued that the crypto industry does not abide by the same regulations, the recent approvals demonstrate that the crypto sector is operating transparently under the supervision of the OCC. Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, noted that the firm is among the first entities to receive conditional approval following the enactment of the GENIUS legislation, ensuring the sustainability of Ripple’s stablecoin business for the long term.

Apart from the dates and location, Ripple noted that the 2026 edition is designed to be larger in scope. “Builders, financial leaders, and industry partners will be together under one roof, creating an unforgettable experience,” the announcement noted. One of the most notable elements of the announcement is the decision to merge Swell and Apex into a single event. Swell events have always been focused on institutional finance, payments, and policy discussions, while Apex catered more directly to developers building on the XRP Ledger. The most recent Swell 2025 event was hosted in New York, while the Apex 2025 event was hosted in the first half of the year in Singapore. However, by combining the two, Ripple appears to be planning to promote a better alignment between institutional adoption and on-chain development of the XRP Ledger. This unified format is something to look forward to, as the event is expected to bridge the gap between financial institutions and technical builders, rather than treating them as separate audiences. Looking Back At Swell 2025 The announcement also draws added weight from how Swell 2025 unfolded. The 2025 event in New York was widely viewed as one of Ripple’s most consequential conferences to date, featuring strong institutional representation and focused discussions on stablecoins, tokenized assets, and cross-border settlement. The event took place on November 4 and November 5, 2025. Not long after the event, the first Spot XRP ETF was launched in the US. Ripple Swell 2025 drew a high-profile mix of Ripple executives, institutional leaders, and policymakers. Ripple’s leadership was represented by CEO Brad Garlinghouse , Executive Chairman Chris Larsen, and President Monica Long, all of whom took part in key sessions. Notable attendees from traditional finance included Nasdaq Chair and CEO Adena Friedman and BlackRock’s Director of Digital Assets Maxwell Stein. The event also featured David Ripley, Co-CEO of Kraken; Sandy Kaul of Franklin Templeton; US Representative Ritchie Torres; and Patrick Witt from the White House’s President’s Council of Advisors for Digital Assets, to name a few.",Ripple|Adena Friedman|Apex|BlackRock|Brad Garlinghouse|Chris Larsen|David Ripley|Franklin Templeton|Kraken|Maxwell Stein|Monica Long|Nasdaq|Patrick Witt|ripple|Ritchie Torres|Sandy Kaul|Stablecoins|Swell|The White House|XRP|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-12 18:00:14

Long-term charts sometimes reveal patterns that hint at both short-term corrections and future rallies. Traders and investors alike are watching key technical levels closely, as timing and patience could determine who benefits most from the next move. ChartNerd, in a recent analysis shared on X, examined XRP’s monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI), currently at 54. He drew parallels to past Q4 cycles, including 2016-2017, 2020, and 2024, where RSI dips to approximately 47 triggered rapid rallies toward overbought levels between 74 and 95. According to ChartNerd, these historical patterns suggest that XRP may experience a short-term downside before preparing for a major bullish reversal. $XRP : Monthly RSI Dynamic Shifts: Previous Cycle Echoes Dynamic Trend Shift Approaching Reset Levels Pain For Both Sides Likely Rinse Repeat Scenarios Patience Needed to Reap Rewards. pic.twitter.com/4mWRDqdtUQ — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) December 11, 2025 Historical RSI Patterns and Cycle Echoes RSI is a widely used momentum indicator that measures overbought or oversold conditions. ChartNerd points out that XRP has historically followed a repeatable pattern: periods of consolidation and RSI resets often precede sharp upward momentum. For example, in the 2017 cycle, a dip in RSI caused temporary pain for holders but set the stage for a powerful rally. Similar dynamics occurred during the 2020 and 2024 Q4 cycles, reinforcing the cyclical behavior of XRP. Approaching Reset Levels With the current RSI at 54, XRP appears to be approaching critical reset levels. ChartNerd predicts a potential short-term dip to RSI levels around 47-50, which could push prices toward $1.50-$1.90. While this move may frustrate short-term holders, historical patterns indicate that such resets often prepare the market for stronger rallies. Patience during this phase is essential for traders and investors seeking to capitalize on the next wave. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Dynamic Trend Shifts Monthly RSI readings reflect ongoing trend shifts. ChartNerd highlights that after RSI resets, XRP frequently transitions from sideways consolidation to rapid upward moves. Recognizing these shifts is crucial for strategic positioning. Traders who understand these cycles can navigate volatility while positioning for potential gains once bullish momentum returns. Potential Bullish Reversal If the predicted RSI reset aligns with historical trends, XRP could be primed for a substantial rally , possibly reaching double-digit levels. ChartNerd also notes the possibility of a bearish divergence similar to 2017, which may indicate a blow-off top. This underscores the importance of disciplined risk management and monitoring key technical signals alongside broader market conditions. Patience and Strategic Positioning The main takeaway from ChartNerd’s analysis is patience. Temporary volatility is often a necessary precursor to sustained gains. Investors should anticipate short-term corrections while remaining alert for reversal signals. Careful observation, discipline, and strategic positioning could prove critical in navigating the next phase of XRP’s long-term cycle.

55699396,https://cryptonews.com/?p=463427,1765562914,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/55699396.jpeg,"Weekly Crypto Regulation Roundup: SEC Pulls Back, CFTC Expands and Trump’s Influence Grows",https://cryptonews.com/news/weekly-crypto-regulation-roundup-sec-pulls-back-cftc-expands-banks-open-to-crypto-trumps-influence-grows/,"This week delivered one of the most consequential stretches for U.S. digital-asset policy in recent memory. From the SEC stepping back from past enforcement priorities to the CFTC launching new pilots and rewriting old rules, the regulatory agenda is shifting rapidly—and the political backdrop is changing just as fast. With banks now gaining expanded permissions to transact in crypto and Congress re-opening the CBDC debate, the industry is entering 2026 with an entirely new set of power dynamics. Below are the major developments shaping the new regulatory landscape. Trump’s National Security Strategy Sidesteps Bitcoin, but the Context Matters The Trump administration released its 2025 National Security Strategy (NSS) , a 33-page document detailing the White House’s priorities across global economic and technological fronts. Surprisingly, digital assets received no mention. Instead, the report leaned heavily into AI, quantum computing, biotech, and other frontier sectors. For a pro-crypto administration that has already established the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets, signed the GENIUS Act for stablecoin regulation, and pulled back on several enforcement actions, the omission stands out. It indicates that while the White House is making room for digital assets in market policy, crypto has not yet broken into core national-security planning. Still, the administration’s actions matter more than the document’s omissions. Bitcoin may not have earned a line in the NSS, but regulatory behavior suggests digital assets are becoming embedded in the economic strategy—even if not yet the security framework. SEC Closes Ondo Probe Without Charges—A Break From the Past In another sign of shifting enforcement posture, the SEC formally ended its multi-year investigation into Ondo Finance without filing charges. The probe focused on whether Ondo’s tokenized treasuries complied with securities law and whether the ONDO token itself constituted a security. @SECGov has dropped its two‑year investigation into @OndoFinance with no charges filed. Could this mark the turning point for tokenized securities in the U.S.? #SEC #OndoFinance https://t.co/k039KEBaWE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 8, 2025 The no-action outcome echoes a broader pattern emerging at the regulator: several enforcement cases initiated during the Biden administration have been softened, paused, or dropped entirely. For market participants, it raises a key question: Is the era of aggressive regulatory hostility finally ending? The decision also gives further legitimacy to the fast-growing real-world asset (RWA) sector, which is increasingly viewed as a regulated bridge between traditional finance and blockchain markets. CFTC Expands Its Role: New Collateral Pilot and Rule Withdrawals If the SEC is stepping back, the CFTC is accelerating. Acting Chair Caroline Pham unveiled a major pilot program allowing Bitcoin, Ether, and USDC to be used as collateral in derivatives markets. The initiative will give regulators real-time visibility into how tokenized collateral performs under market stress, a key step toward integrating crypto into regulated clearing and settlement. In the same week, the CFTC: Scrapped its outdated 2020 “actual delivery” Bitcoin guidance, which had long been criticized as incompatible with modern trading practices and the GENIUS Act; Granted no-action relief to four prediction markets—Polymarket US, LedgerX, PredictIt, and Gemini Titan—easing reporting burdens and reducing enforcement risks for a category of platforms that has grown faster than regulators expected. These moves show that the CFTC is preparing to become the dominant U.S. crypto regulator, a shift that appears to be in line with Congressional momentum behind expanding the agency’s mandate. The CFTC granted narrow no-action relief to four prediction markets, reducing immediate enforcement risk. #CFTC #Crypto https://t.co/hqT6BcApBB — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 12, 2025 Congress Reignites the CBDC Fight Rep. Keith Self (R-Texas) introduced an amendment to the annual defense bill that would prohibit the development of a U.S. central bank digital currency. He accused GOP leadership of breaking promises by removing anti-CBDC language from the bill’s latest version. The amendment highlights deepening political divides over digital cash. Conservatives argue that a CBDC threatens financial privacy, while supporters say it modernizes payment infrastructure. With the 2026 election cycle approaching, CBDCs are becoming a wedge issue, and legislative momentum remains uncertain. Banks Move Into Crypto as Regulators Open the Door In a landmark decision, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) said national banks may now engage in riskless principal crypto transactions , allowing them to buy from one customer and sell to another without holding inventory. This effectively gives banks permission to operate as regulated intermediaries in crypto trading, narrowing the gap between banking and digital-asset markets. Combined with previous OCC guidance allowing custody and balance-sheet holdings, the banking sector is now closer to full crypto market participation than ever before. In parallel, regulators revealed that nine major banks imposed inappropriate restrictions on crypto companies, further underscoring the need for consistent standards as banks move deeper into the space. Trump’s CFTC Nominee Heads to a Crucial Senate Vote Michael Selig—Trump’s nominee to chair the CFTC—is now headed for a full Senate vote. If confirmed, Selig will helm an agency gaining sweeping new authority over crypto markets. His pledge to make the U.S. “the Crypto Capital of the World” sets the stage for one of the most consequential regulatory leadership eras since Bitcoin’s inception. CFTC nominee Michael Selig heads to Senate floor as agency removes 2020 crypto rules and authorizes spot trading on regulated exchanges. #CFTC #Trump #Crypto https://t.co/PfMzEGGIIE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 12, 2025 The vote, expected imminently, comes as the CFTC operates with only one seated commissioner and faces staffing concerns about its ability to regulate an expanding sector. This week reflects a structural turning point. The SEC is retreating. The CFTC is positioning itself as the primary crypto overseer. Banks are entering the market. Congress is fighting over CBDCs. And the Trump administration is shaping the future from the top down.

Despite recently opening its platform to cryptocurrency ETFs, the firm has labeled Bitcoin a ‘speculative digital toy.’ This contradictory stance raises critical questions for every investor watching the digital asset space. What does this mean for the future of Bitcoin and its place in a traditional portfolio? Let’s unpack the details and the profound implications. What Did Vanguard Actually Say About Bitcoin? Global asset manager Vanguard, known for its conservative, long-term investment philosophy, made headlines this month. The firm began allowing trades of spot Bitcoin ETFs and some crypto-related funds on its brokerage platform. However, almost simultaneously, a spokesperson for the company delivered a blunt assessment. They described Bitcoin not as a revolutionary asset class, but as a ‘ speculative digital toy .’ This label starkly contrasts with the growing institutional acceptance seen from other major financial players. Why Is This ‘Digital Toy’ Statement So Controversial? The controversy lies in the glaring contradiction. Vanguard is providing access to products based on an asset it publicly dismisses. This creates a confusing signal for investors. On one hand, they are facilitating exposure. On the other, they are warning against its fundamental value. This stance highlights the deep divide in traditional finance regarding Bitcoin’s true purpose. Is it a digital gold, a payment system, or, as Vanguard suggests, merely a speculative plaything? The firm’s position underscores several key concerns they likely hold: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is famously unpredictable, which clashes with Vanguard’s focus on steady, long-term growth. Lack of Cash Flow: Unlike stocks or bonds, Bitcoin does not generate dividends or interest, making its value purely speculative in their view. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape adds risk that traditional firms are uncomfortable with. How Does This Impact the Average Crypto Investor? For the everyday investor, Vanguard’s move is a double-edged sword. The availability of Bitcoin ETFs on a trusted platform like Vanguard lowers the barrier to entry, offering a familiar and regulated way to gain exposure. However, the accompanying ‘digital toy’ rhetoric serves as a powerful caution. It reminds investors that even with easier access, the core investment thesis for Bitcoin remains hotly debated. Therefore, you should consider this development carefully. Actionable Insight: View Vanguard’s platform access as a tool, not an endorsement. Conduct your own research to understand why you are investing in Bitcoin . Are you seeking a hedge against inflation, believing in the technology, or speculating on short-term price moves? Your answer will determine if this ‘ digital toy ‘ has a place in your serious investment strategy. What’s the Future for Bitcoin and Institutional Adoption? Vanguard’s stance represents one end of the institutional spectrum. Other firms, like BlackRock and Fidelity, have taken a more embracing approach with their own ETF offerings. This diversity of opinion is normal for a nascent asset class. The path forward for Bitcoin will likely involve continued friction between skeptical traditionalists and bullish innovators. The key metric to watch is not just price, but the steady flow of assets into these new ETFs, which will signal real-world adoption despite skeptical labels. Conclusion: A Toy Today, A Tool Tomorrow? Vanguard’s characterization of Bitcoin as a ‘ speculative digital toy ‘ is a provocative reminder of the asset’s perceived risks. It forces a crucial conversation about intrinsic value and investment maturity. While providing access through ETFs, Vanguard is clearly distancing itself from promoting Bitcoin as a core holding. For investors, the lesson is clear: navigate this space with both the opportunities and the warnings in mind. The journey from being seen as a toy to a trusted tool is still underway, and your investment decisions should reflect that ongoing evolution. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: If Vanguard calls Bitcoin a toy, why did they start offering Bitcoin ETFs? A1: Vanguard is likely responding to client demand. By offering ETFs on its brokerage platform, it allows customers to make their own choices without the firm having to endorse or manage the underlying asset directly. Q2: Does this mean I shouldn’t invest in Bitcoin through Vanguard? A2: Not necessarily. It means you should understand Vanguard’s skeptical viewpoint. The decision to invest should be based on your own research, risk tolerance, and investment goals, not solely on a platform’s availability. Q3: What is a ‘speculative digital toy’ supposed to mean? A3: The phrase implies that Vanguard views Bitcoin as an asset with no fundamental value (a ‘toy’) whose price is driven mainly by speculation and sentiment rather than cash flows or practical utility. Q4: Are other big investment firms as skeptical as Vanguard? A4: Opinions vary. Firms like BlackRock and Fidelity have launched their own Bitcoin ETFs, showing a more accepting stance. Vanguard is known for its particularly conservative approach to new asset classes. Q5: How does this affect the price of Bitcoin? A5: In the short term, such statements from a major player can create negative sentiment. However, long-term price is driven by broader adoption, regulation, and macroeconomic factors. The simultaneous offering of ETFs is arguably a more positive signal for accessibility. Call to Action: Did Vanguard’s bold label change your perspective on Bitcoin?

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse posted on X that “HUGE news! @Ripple just received conditional approval from the @USOCC to charter Ripple National Trust Bank. This is a massive step forward – first for $RLUSD, setting the highest standard for stablecoin compliance with both federal (OCC) & state (NYDFS) oversight,” and he pushed back at banking lobbyists by saying they complain that crypto avoids rules even though Ripple is now “directly under the OCC’s supervision and standards.” The OCC approval follows the GENIUS Act, signed by President Donald Trump in July 2025, which created the legal structure for U.S. stablecoins. The OCC said Ripple applied to establish RNTB as a federally supervised trust bank, and the approval reflects the company’s plan to build financial products that operate within clear rules. Ripple said the charter will let the company run RLUSD with full oversight from both the New York Department of Financial Services and the OCC, giving the stablecoin a mix of state and federal supervision. Ripple expands stablecoin operations under federal rules With the trust bank structure, RLUSD reserves will fall under trust-company rules, and Ripple said no other issuer in the market today operates under this same dual framework. The company expects traditional finance firms to use stablecoins that meet formal regulatory standards, and it said this structure gives RLUSD the type of compliance profile needed for enterprise payment use. Brad said the conditional approval “represents a massive step forward – setting the highest standard for stablecoin compliance with both federal and state oversight,” and he added that bank lobbyists calling the industry irresponsible “may claim otherwise” even though Ripple is building RLUSD to be “the most transparent and responsibly managed stablecoin in the market today.” Ripple said final approval would allow RNTB to give stronger protections to RLUSD holders and add more security requirements around issuance and reserves. The trust bank will also support Ripple’s broader institutional products, including payments and liquidity tools. RLUSD has already crossed $1 billion in market cap in under a year, and trading firms are using it as collateral through Ripple Prime. Ripple said this shows steady demand for regulated stablecoins that can fit into larger trading and settlement systems. Ripple Payments, which has been running for more than ten years, uses digital assets and stablecoins for fast settlement, global liquidity, and smooth on-ramps and off-ramps. The company said its payout network reaches more than 90% of the global FX market and has processed more than $95 billion in volume so far. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

That’s the alarming picture painted by new research from Kaiko, highlighting a critical liquidity concentration risk centered on the Binance exchange. This vulnerability could send shockwaves through your portfolio. Let’s break down why this matters and what it means for every crypto investor. What Exactly is Liquidity Concentration Risk? In simple terms, liquidity concentration risk means too much trading activity and asset availability is focused in one place. Think of it like a town with only one bridge. If that bridge fails, everything grinds to a halt. Kaiko’s report warns that Binance, while a powerhouse, has become that single point of failure for much of the crypto market’s trading depth and price discovery. This creates a fragile ecosystem. A major problem at Binance—whether technical, legal, or operational—could therefore trigger severe volatility and liquidity crunches across thousands of other tokens and platforms. The risk isn’t just theoretical; it’s a structural weakness built into the current market landscape. Why Does Binance’s Dominance Create This Risk? Kaiko points to several interconnected factors that amplify the liquidity concentration risk . Regulatory Gray Areas: Binance operates without formal regulation in many jurisdictions and lacks key licenses like Europe’s MiCA. Legal Precedents: The exchange’s conviction in the U.S. for anti-money laundering failures adds a layer of operational uncertainty. Market Reliance: A vast portion of daily trading volume and order book depth is routed through Binance, making it the default liquidity hub. Together, these elements mean the market’s health is disproportionately tied to the fortunes of one entity. This dependence is the core of the danger Kaiko identifies. What Are the Real-World Consequences of This Risk? So, what happens if this liquidity concentration risk materializes? The potential fallout is severe and multi-faceted. First, a liquidity crisis could occur. If Binance faces sudden withdrawal pressures or operational halts, the ability to buy or sell assets at stable prices across the market would vanish. This would likely cause panic selling on other platforms and massive price gaps. Second, it exposes the industry to systemic legal risk. Regulatory action against a entity of this size would have cascading effects, potentially freezing assets and shaking investor confidence globally. The market lacks a robust, decentralized safety net to absorb such a shock. How Can the Crypto Market Mitigate This Vulnerability? The solution lies in diversification and building resilience. The market must actively reduce its over-reliance on any single venue. Here are actionable steps for both the industry and investors: For Exchanges & Projects: Incentivize liquidity across multiple platforms. Develop and use cross-chain liquidity solutions and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to spread depth. For Traders & Investors: Diversify your trading across several reputable exchanges. Do not keep all assets on one platform. Understand the liquidity sources for the tokens you hold. For the Ecosystem: Support the growth of regulated, compliant venues to create healthy competition and redundancy in liquidity provision. Addressing this liquidity concentration risk is not about attacking one exchange but about strengthening the entire financial architecture of crypto. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for Market Stability Kaiko’s analysis serves as a crucial wake-up call. The liquidity concentration risk at Binance is a glaring systemic threat that the cryptocurrency industry can no longer ignore. While Binance provides immense value, true market maturity requires resilience through decentralization and redundancy. The path forward involves collective action from projects, exchanges, and investors to build a more robust and distributed liquidity landscape that can withstand shocks and protect the ecosystem’s long-term viability. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does ‘liquidity concentration’ mean? A: It refers to a situation where a disproportionately large amount of trading activity, order book depth, and asset availability is centralized on one or very few platforms, creating a single point of failure for the market. Q: Is Binance the only exchange with high liquidity? A: No, other exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken have significant liquidity. However, Kaiko’s data indicates Binance’s share is dominant enough to pose a systemic risk if disrupted. Q: How does this risk affect a regular crypto holder? A> If a liquidity crisis occurs, you might be unable to sell your assets at a fair price, experience extreme volatility, or face difficulties withdrawing funds. It impacts market stability and asset valuation for everyone. Q: Can DeFi solve this concentration risk? A> Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and DeFi protocols can help by providing alternative liquidity sources. However, for large trades, centralized exchange liquidity is still often deeper, meaning a combined approach is needed. Q: What was Binance convicted for in the U.S.? A> Binance pleaded guilty to charges related to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering (AML) program and violating U.S. sanctions laws, resulting in a massive multi-billion dollar settlement. Q: What is a MiCA license and why does it matter? A> The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation is the EU’s comprehensive framework for crypto. A license under MiCA signifies compliance with strict EU standards for consumer protection and financial stability, which Binance currently does not hold for its main exchange.

The MACD also trends towards a golden cross above the signal line, early signs of a fresh bullish trend. Buyers appear to be stepping back in. But for a decisive recovery, the PI coin price needs to surpass the right shoulder at $0.23, invalidating the bear setup. A full trend reversal only happens if the price moves above $0.284, which is the zone above the head of the pattern. Until there is any decisive upwards momentum, the $0.17 target remains in play.

The regulated digital asset platform said the new token, called wXRP, is a one-to-one backed representation of native XRP designed to expand the asset’s role in decentralised finance and enable trading against Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin on any chain where the asset is available. Cross-Chain XRP Arrives In its official press release, Hex Trust said that authorised merchants will be able to mint and redeem wXRP through an automated, compliant system, and each wrapped unit corresponds to an equivalent amount of XRP held in segregated custody accounts. The firm said the token will launch with more than $100 million in total value locked, which it said should support liquidity, help stabilise pricing, as well as reduce slippage for traders on day one. By using LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token standard, wXRP will allow users to move value between chains without relying on unregulated third-party bridges. It will offer what Hex Trust described as a more transparent and auditable structure backed by insurance coverage and institutional-grade safeguards. The company said wXRP will give retail users, DeFi protocols, and institutional liquidity providers access to swaps, lending, liquidity provisioning, and, where available, rewards opportunities across supported networks. Market makers, OTC desks, and funds will be able to integrate the asset into trading and collateral environments, while businesses can support wXRP and RLUSD in payment and checkout services. Multichain Demand Hex Trust also revealed that wXRP will only be issued when an equivalent amount of native XRP is deposited and will be burned on redemption, in a bid to ensure that the supply remains fully backed. Additional blockchains are expected to be integrated over time as part of efforts to extend XRP’s reach into multichain applications. RippleX SVP, Markus Infanger, highlighted the growing demand to use XRP across the wider crypto ecosystem and institutions, and added, “We are excited to see Hex Trust address this demand. It also fits naturally with the work we’re doing with RLUSD, giving people a regulated way to access DeFi and manage their XRP positions across supported chains.” In a separate development, CryptoQuant recently found that network velocity on the XRPL surged to a record 0.0324 on December 2, which meant that XRP is circulating more frequently among users rather than sitting idle in wallets. The analytics firm said the spike reflects increased liquidity and participation from traders and large holders. Ripple also expanded its enterprise footprint through a new partnership with AMINA Bank AG, which will use Ripple Payments to offer near-real-time cross-border transactions. AMINA said the integration aims to reduce the operational friction that web3-focused clients encounter when interacting with traditional banking systems by improving speed and settlement efficiency.

By 2028, TIA could attain a maximum price of $64.46 and an average price of $56.11. In 2031, the TIA price forecast expects a maximum price of $156.88. Celestia generated significant interest before its October 2023 launch. This was largely due to the strong backing from major crypto exchanges from the outset and the intriguing technical concepts behind the Celestia modular blockchain network. In this article, we’ll provide a Celestia price prediction, analyze the factors driving these projections, and explore what the Celestia modular blockchain network brings to the broader crypto landscape.

Currently, sellers are controlling the price chart as they push the price toward support channels. TIA price analysis 1-day chart: TIA price faces selling pressure Analyzing the daily Celestia price chart, TIA price is facing rising selling momentum as sellers pushed the price toward $0.557 level. The recent selling pressure triggered strong liquidation on the TIA price chart. The 24-hour volume surged to $6.05 million, showing a slight increase in trading activity today. TIA is trading at $0.557, declining by over 0.5% in the last 24 hours. TIA/USD chart.

The SMA-14 level suggests lower volatility for the next few hours. TIA/USD 4-hour price chart: Bears aim for a hold below moving averages The 4-hour TIA price chart suggests TIA continues to experience intense volatility around $0.557, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart. Currently, bears aim for a strong domination as the price prepares for a hold below EMA lines. TIA/USD chart. Image source: TradingView The BoP indicator is bearish at 0.07, suggesting that sellers are trying to build pressure near support levels and boost downward correction.

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent TIA prices from an immediate surge. However, if the TIA price successfully breaks above $0.652, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.821. TIA/USD chart. Image source: TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, the TIA price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.548, resulting in a correction to $0.488. Is TIA a good investment? Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‘s performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? TIA’s price is attempting to hold around $0.557 as buyers lose confidence, resulting in a downward push. Will the TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA’s price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will the TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers’ interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns. It is advised to do your own research and conduct investment advice before investing in the volatile crypto market. Recent news/opinions on TIA Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade introduced PeerDAS, increasing data availability capacity to 10–15 blobs per block, compared with Celestia’s roughly 1,600 blobs per day. This challenges Celestia’s modular DA narrative as Ethereum now supports more than 55 rollups and over $40 billion in total value locked. Celestia price prediction December 2025 Celestia’s price is declining following the market crash in October. As a result, we expect the TIA price to record a minimum of $0.5 and a maximum of $1.3, with an average of $0.9 in December. Celestia Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Celestia Price Prediction December 2025 $0.5 $0.9 $1.3 Celestia price prediction 2025 Historically, the full impact of a Bitcoin Halving isn’t felt until about a year to a year and a half afterward. This suggests that new all-time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might occur around 2025. Considering this, along with the ongoing development of the Celestia network and the growing adoption of modular blockchain technology, the outlook appears positive for the year ahead. Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $1, a potential maximum of $1.5, and an average trading price of $1.3 in 2025.

Some of these investors might be waiting for the price surge triggered by the Bitcoin Halving to maximize their profits. Consequently, there could be significant downward pressure on the price of TIA as it reaches its peak moment. According to price forecast and technical analysis, Celestia’s price is forecasted to range from a minimum of $2.15 to a maximum of $2.59 in 2026, with an average trading price of $2.54.

As part of this transition, Sonic plans to introduce new features to increase community engagement and enhance its ecosystem’s utility, which could drive demand for its token. However, the price of FTM is expected to remain largely influenced by overall market sentiment and the platform’s adoption rate. The success of this rebranding will likely depend on how effectively Sonic aligns with the crypto market’s growing focus on regulatory compliance. Will Sonic (Prev.FTM) reclaim FTM’s all-time high of $3.48 soon? How high can Sonic (S) go in 2025? Let’s dive into Sonic’s price predictions for 2025 and beyond. Overview Cryptocurrency Sonic Token S Price $0.09602 Market Cap $276.55M Trading Volume (24-hour) $36.51M Circulating Supply 3.22B S All-time High $1.03 on Jan 4, 2025 All-time Low $0.04356 on Jan 29, 2025 24-h High $0.09736 24-h Low $0.091 Sonic (S) price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 13.09% (Very High) 50-Day SMA $ 0.1309 14-Day RSI 35.64 (Neutral) Green Days 11/30 (37%) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 25 (Extreme Fear) 200-Day SMA $ 0.3259 Sonic price analysis TL;DR Breakdown : Sonic Price remains below key moving averages with weak volume confirming a fragile rebound Oversold indicators triggered short-term buying but momentum lacks follow-through Broader market risk-off conditions and Bitcoin dominance continue to cap upside Sonic (S) price analysis 1-day chart SonicUSD Chart by TradingView Sonic is still in a daily downtrend, dropping from October highs into a base near $0.096. Price trades below the 20-day basis around $0.1027, meaning bounces keep meeting supply, while the lower Bollinger band near $0.0883 is acting as support. The uptick to ~$0.0962 (+1.8%) reads as a relief bounce, not a confirmed trend flip. RSI is weak in the mid-30s, hinting at mild oversold pressure, and MACD remains negative but is flattening. A daily close above $0.103 opens $0.117, while failure risks a retest of $0.090–$0.088. Watch for a higher low above $0.090 and volume expansion to validate buyers. S/USD technical analysis 4-hour chart SonicUSD Chart by TradingView Sonic is still in a broader downtrend, sliding from the early-November spike into a tight consolidation around $0.096. On this 4-hour view, price is holding just above the Bollinger mid-band near $0.0954, suggesting buyers are defending the range, but upside is capped by the upper band around $0.1004. The latest candle shows a small pullback (C ~$0.09624) after failing to sustain above ~$0.0975. RSI near 52 is neutral, while MACD is only marginally positive, hinting momentum is fragile. A clean break above $0.1004 could target $0.110, while loss of $0.095 risks $0.090. Expect choppy, mean-reversion price action until volatility returns.

Based on the chart, Sonic (formerly FTM) is entering a decision phase after stabilizing near recent lows. Price action shows compression within a tight range, suggesting sellers are losing momentum but buyers have not yet fully taken control. The RSI is recovering from oversold territory, indicating building bullish pressure, while MACD is flattening, hinting at a potential trend shift. If Sonic holds above its short-term support and breaks above the nearest resistance zone, a relief rally toward the mid-range resistance is likely. However, failure to sustain current levels could lead to another support retest before a clearer reversal forms. Is Sonic a good investment? Sonic is a high-speed, scalable blockchain platform gaining attention as an alternative to networks like Ethereum. Based on our analysis, we are optimistic about its growth, projecting a $0.5123 price by 2025 and $3.72 by 2030. Despite its potential, investing in Sonic (S) involves risks typical of cryptocurrencies, including market volatility. Own research and assessing personal risk tolerance are essential for anyone considering S as a potential investment opportunity. Why is Sonic (Prev FTM) up today? Sonic (FTM) is up with recent positive developments because broader market and technical pressures are outweighing its fundamentals. While DeFi upgrades and partnerships improved long-term utility, they have not translated into strong, sustained trading volume. The recent bounce was driven mainly by oversold technical conditions, not fresh demand, and volume actually declined during the rebound, signaling weak conviction. Price is still far below the 200-day EMA, keeping the higher-timeframe trend bearish. At the same time, macro headwinds persist, with Bitcoin dominance near 59% and the Altcoin Season Index deep in risk-off territory, limiting capital rotation into mid-cap tokens like Sonic. Will Sonic reach $5? The price of Sonic could reach $3.11 by 2030, with price predictions suggesting a high of $3.72. However, achieving this depends on market conditions and overall blockchain adoption trends. Will Sonic reach $10? Based on our technical analysis, Sonic will not approach double-digit prices within the next 6 years. Our recent Sonic predictions suggest that by 2031, S could attain a price of about $5.53. Is Sonic a safe network? Sonic is regarded as a secure blockchain platform that utilizes its unique Lachesis consensus mechanism for high-speed and scalable transactions. However, as with any blockchain network, users should exercise caution, use official channels, and follow best security practices to protect their assets. Does Sonic have a good, long-term future? Sonic shows potential for a strong long-term future, with price predictions suggesting significant growth by 2030 and beyond. Analysts forecast prices could reach between $3.11 and $3.72, driven by its unique blockchain technology and increasing adoption in decentralized applications. However, market volatility remains a concern. Recent news/opinion on Sonic (prev.

On the lower end, corrections may pull the price to $0.15 with an expected average trading price of around $0.15. However, this is supported by the network’s rebrand momentum, scalability upgrades, and stronger developer activity. Expanding DeFi and gaming applications are expected to increase demand.

The comment came from John Ameriks, the firm’s global head of quantitative equity, who spoke at Bloomberg’s ETFs in Depth event in New York. He said the coin brings no income, no compounding, and no cash flow, and said the firm views it as a collectible rather than a productive asset. John also said the firm has not seen proof that the technology behind it offers lasting economic value and said, “it’s difficult for me to think about Bitcoin as anything more than a digital Labubu,” referring to the plush toy that went viral. His comments landed while the coin trades near $92,000, retreating from $126,000 only weeks earlier. Vanguard’s stance lines up with its earlier view of crypto, which it has called speculative. The firm oversees about $12 trillion and still does not plan to launch its own crypto ETFs. But it opened trading access earlier this month for investors who want to buy and sell these funds. John said the decision came after watching ETFs tied to Bitcoin build records since January 2024. He said the firm wanted to make sure the products show “what’s on the tin, the way that they’re described,” before giving people access. John also stated that Vanguard will not provide any advice on when to buy or sell and will not recommend any specific tokens to clients. A spokesperson said the firm does see potential in blockchain as a tool that may improve how markets work, even though that view does not change the firm’s position on the token itself. Vanguard lets users trade ETFs but sticks with its view John did point out a few cases where the coin could have value outside speculation. He said he could imagine moments where Bitcoin moves in useful ways during high inflation or political stress. He said its history is still short and does not yet show a pattern that makes those cases clear. John said, “If you can see reliable movement in the price in those circumstances, we can talk more sensibly about what the investment thesis might be and what role it could play in a portfolio,” but said the market does not yet show that. He also repeated that the firm does not plan to offer advice around the ETFs now listed for clients. He said Vanguard wants investors to decide for themselves, that’s why it opened access only after watching how the early ETFs performed since the January 2024 debut. Standard Chartered reduced its view for the coin as demand from corporate treasuries slows and ETF inflows fall. The bank now sees Bitcoin moving to $150,000 by the end of 2026 after cutting an earlier call of $300,000. It also moved its long-term target of $500,000 to 2030 after first placing it in 2028. Bernstein analysts said they expect the coin to move toward $150,000 by the end of next year and see it approaching $200,000 by the end of 2027. They pulled back a call for a $200,000 top this year after the downturn. They said the coin now appears to operate outside the four-year cycle that shaped its earlier years and may follow a steadier path going forward.

In 2028, HBAR is predicted to trade at a maximum price of $0.8458, with an average price of $0.7545. By 2031, HBAR could trade between $2.32 and $2.67, with an average price of $2.38. HBAR price prediction – Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) is a cryptocurrency that enjoyed the bullish crypto market of 2021, alongside other altcoins. As a result, traders and investors have since taken a keen interest in the digital coin. Moreover, the Hedera Hashgraph network shows prospects of becoming a force in the blockchain space. Every crypto investor asks: When will HBAR’s price rise again? Despite the overall bear market, the price momentum of the HBAR coin has been somewhat positive. With trading indicators pointing to a possible uptrend and the positive perception of HBAR, we may see a bullish scenario unfold sooner, perhaps a retest of its all-time high. Overview Cryptocurrency Hedera Hashgraph Ticker HBAR Current Price $0.1351 Market Cap $5.74B Trading Volume (24Hr) $157.56M Circulating Supply 42.39 Billion HBAR All-time High $0.5701 on Sep 16, 2021 All-time Low $0.01001 on Jan 03, 2020 24-hour High $0.1359 24-hour Low $0.1283 HBAR price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 12.79% (Very High) 50-day SMA $ 0.1649 200-day SMA $ 0.2073 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 20 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 12/30 (40%) Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) price analysis HBAR bounced from the $0.13 support level with indicators showing early accumulation Price is trying to reclaim the mid range around $0.135 to $0.138 but upside remains limited Momentum is improving slightly though resistance above and weak volume keep the trend cautious HBAR price analysis 1-day chart HBARUSD chart by TradingView According to the 1-day chart, HBAR remains in a clear daily downtrend, printing lower highs since August and trading below the 20-day basis near $0.1398. Price is hovering around $0.1287, sitting on the lower Bollinger Band ($0.1267), which signals persistent sell pressure but also a short-term stretch that can spark bounces. RSI is weak at ~37.8, showing bears still control momentum, while the MACD is negative and flattening, hinting the slide is slowing rather than reversing. Key support is $0.126–$0.128; a break exposes $0.12. Bulls need a reclaim of $0.14, then $0.153, to shift structure. Until then, rallies look like relief moves inside a decline. HBAR/USD 4-hour price chart HBARUSD chart by TradingView HBAR’s 4-hour chart shows persistent consolidation within a broader bearish structure. Price is hovering near $0.129, holding just above the lower Bollinger Band around $0.125, signaling fading downside momentum but no strong reversal yet. The mid-band near $0.133 acts as immediate resistance, repeatedly capping short-term bounces. MACD remains slightly negative and flat, indicating weak momentum and a lack of bullish follow-through. Balance of Power stays marginally bearish, reflecting seller control despite reduced volatility. As long as HBAR trades below $0.133–$0.142, upside remains limited. A breakdown below $0.125 risks continuation toward $0.12, while reclaiming $0.133 could trigger a modest relief bounce. HBAR technical indicators: Levels and action Simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 0.1674 SELL SMA 5 0.1586 SELL SMA 10 0.1513 SELL SMA 21 0.1471 SELL SMA 50 0.1613 SELL SMA 100 0.1858 SELL SMA 200 0.2044 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 0.1463 SELL EMA 5 0.1569 SELL EMA 10 0.1771 SELL EMA 21 0.2012 SELL EMA 50 0.2180 SELL EMA 100 0.2151 SELL EMA 200 0.2051 SELL What can you expect from the HBAR price analysis next? HBAR’s next price phase is likely defined by consolidation with a slight bearish bias unless key resistance is reclaimed. On the daily and 4-hour charts, price remains below the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, showing weak trend strength. RSI is hovering in the low-40s, suggesting limited selling pressure but also a lack of strong buying interest. If HBAR fails to hold the $0.125–$0.128 support zone, a deeper pullback toward $0.12 is possible. Conversely, a sustained break above $0.133 could open room for a short-term recovery toward $0.15, though volume confirmation will be critical. Is HBAR a good investment? Hedera Hashgraph distinguishes itself with its Hashgraph consensus algorithm, which promises higher speed, security, and scalability than traditional blockchain technologies. This positions HBAR as a potentially innovative player in distributed ledger technology, catering to various applications, including smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). These notable features could spur HBAR to new highs in the coming months and years, making it a profitable investment tool. Why HBAR is down today? HBAR is down today due to a combination of macro pressure, technical weakness, and slowing capital inflows. Markets turned risk-off after the Fed’s rate cut came with warnings about persistent inflation, pushing investors toward capital preservation as crypto lost $95B in a day. With a high correlation to Bitcoin, HBAR followed BTC lower. Technically, price broke below the 50-day EMA and key Fibonacci support, triggering sell algorithms while RSI remains bearish but not oversold. Adding pressure, HBAR ETF inflows slowed sharply, signaling reduced institutional demand despite long-term optimism from real-world tokenization developments. Will HBAR reach $1? Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) reaching $1 is possible but depends on several key factors, including market conditions, adoption rates, and overall crypto sentiment. HBAR has strong fundamentals with its fast, low-cost transactions and backing from major enterprises. If adoption grows within industries like DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise applications, demand for HBAR could push prices higher. However, competition from other layer-1 blockchains and regulatory factors may slow its growth. A bullish crypto cycle and wider institutional interest would be necessary for HBAR to reach $1. While achievable, sustained utility and investor confidence are crucial for long-term price appreciation. What will HBAR be worth in 2025? By 2025, HBAR is expected to be worth $0.14. How much will HBAR cost in 2030? By 2030, HBAR is expected to be worth a maximum of $1.09. Can HBAR reach $20? HBAR reaching $20 would require an extraordinary market rally and widespread adoption, making it highly unlikely. For context, with HBAR’s current circulating supply of around 33 billion tokens, a $20 price would push its market capitalization to $660 billion, placing it among the largest cryptocurrencies, rivaling Bitcoin and Ethereum. Where to buy HBAR? Traders and investors can buy Hederah Hashgraph (HBAR) on these CEXs: Binance, KuCoin, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, and others. Will HBAR reach $10? HBAR reaching $10 is highly unlikely, requiring a massive market cap increase. Predictions for 2030 estimate HBAR could reach between $0.92 and $1.09, making $10 an unrealistic target without extraordinary market changes. Will HBAR reach $100? Hederah Hashgraph (HBAR) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and would require exceptional growth, widespread adoption, and wild market speculation. Does HBAR have a good long-term future? HBAR has the potential for a good, long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $0.14 by 2025 and $1.09 by 2030. However, as with all meme coins, its future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support. Recent news/opinion on HBAR Hedera announced surpassing 9 million mainnet accounts, marking fast network growth and expanding its user base. This milestone signals increasing real world adoption and offers a larger audience for applications building utility on the network. https://twitter.com/hedera/status/1996588946768253264?s=20 Hedera Hashgraph price prediction December 2025 The price of Hedera is expected to be at least $0.12 in December 2025.

From September 6 to now, HBAR traded mostly between $0.075 and $0.10. This was because buying slowed down after earlier gains and investors were waiting for clearer signals from the market as a whole.

The Solana -based decentralized exchange, which has processed $1.08 trillion in combined spot and perpetuals volume year-to-date while maintaining $2.7 billion in total value locked, framed the upgrades as solutions to fragmented data, fraudulent assets, and the absence of professional-grade tools needed for institutional adoption.

According to Jupiter executives, controlling both the dollar and the transaction platform allows synergies across use cases, creating a self-reinforcing flywheel effect. The stablecoin will route through Jupiter’s existing infrastructure, handling billions in stablecoin volume via swap aggregation, perpetuals, and lending, completing what the company called an end-to-end stack. The launch arrives as Solana’s stablecoin infrastructure expands through institutional partnerships, with Western Union planning to launch its US Dollar Payment Token through Anchorage Digital Bank in the first half of 2026 for international remittances. The Solana Foundation also partnered with Korean blockchain infrastructure company Wavebridge to build a compliance-ready KRW-pegged stablecoin following South Korea’s preparation of regulatory framework legislation, with Wavebridge CEO Jongwook Oh stating the collaboration seeks to create structures where the stablecoin is “ not only issued but also verified, controlled, and fit for institutional use. “ Additionally, Jupiter Lend exited beta and became fully open source after reaching $1 billion in total supply within eight days, the fastest growth rate for any Solana protocol in history. Now, the lending protocol is built with Fluid and introduced tick-based liquidity, allowing all risky positions to be liquidated in a single transaction and allowing Jupiter to offer the highest loan-to-value ratios and the lowest liquidation penalties in decentralized finance. Developer Tools and Data Infrastructure The newly launched Developer Platform consolidates real-time analytics across all Jupiter APIs, giving builders visibility into logs, usage patterns, and performance metrics through a unified dashboard that tracks every swap, pricing call, and token API request. Developers can now debug issues by investigating 429 errors, 500 errors, and downtime events through comprehensive logs designed to help teams ship more efficiently. Yesterday, @kashdhanda announced a huge bullish moment for developers: @JupiterExchange just launched the Jupiter Developer Platform.

The terminal leverages Ultra v3, Jupiter’s proprietary end-to-end trading engine that powers features like Jupiter Beam and Predictive Execution, technology adopted by Robinhood for its own operations. Meanwhile, VRFD expanded beyond token verification into a full, trusted data layer to address Solana’s challenge of 30,000 daily token launches, most of which are scams or imposter tokens. VRFD now verifies metadata and provides high-signal insights across all surfaces, including Jupiter mobile and APIs, building on Jupiter Verify’s position as the most trusted token verification system powering nearly every wallet, terminal, and explorer in decentralized finance. Acquisition Strategy Extends Lending Capabilities Beyond Traditional Assets To amplify adoption and scalability, Jupiter acquired Rain.fi to expand its money market capabilities to off-chain, long-tail, and long-duration assets that previously lacked viable on-chain pathways. Rain.fi’s Offer Book, a specialized orderbook launching in Q1, will enable simpler, more transparent liquidity access without price-based liquidations, making every on-chain asset productive through peer-to-peer lending models that scale through Jupiter’s integration infrastructure. Rain was built to scale and accelerate the credit market on Solana, powered by fixed-term loans. As credit markets evolve, timing and distribution are key. We’re proud to announce that Rain is joining the Jupiter ecosystem to accelerate on-chain credit market growth. pic.twitter.com/qe3NbcWLRo — Rain.fi (@RainFi_) December 11, 2025 The Rewards Hub unified rewards, trading activity, and referrals into one system with a $1 million pool tied to real contributions, addressing what Jupiter called fragmented on-chain incentives disconnected from actual usage. Jupiter’s coordinated upgrades across data infrastructure, execution tools, lending protocols, and developer resources represent what executives called “ deliberate upgrades to systems already powering hundreds of millions of users, traders, and builders ” rather than entirely new products.

GeeFi has become a focal point in this movement, initiated by a powerful Phase 1 presale that sold 10 million tokens and raised $500,000 from a foundation of 2,400 investors . The project’s growth has only intensified, with total token sales now exceeding 13 million and capital raised surpassing $800,000 . With Phase 2 now over 80% complete , GeeFi is solidifying its position as a leading non-custodial ecosystem, prompting analysts to predict that Phase 3 will sell out in less than 10 days amid growing speculation about major exchange listings. An Alternative to Solana’s Established Position While Solana continues to impress with a $3.6 billion TVL in its lending markets and major announcements at its Breakpoint 2025 conference, some investors are seeking earlier-stage opportunities with higher growth potential. This search is leading them to GeeFi , an ecosystem that numerous experts are now identifying as 2026’s 100x gem . It provides a unified, all-in-one platform for managing assets across more than 14 networks . This allows users to execute token swaps and bridge between chains without technical friction, directly addressing the complexities of the current DeFi landscape. The GeeFi Team started development in 2023 with a product-first philosophy, ensuring a fully functional platform was ready for its 2024 launch. The system’s architecture is founded on self-sovereignty, guaranteeing users always maintain exclusive control over their private keys. With a feature-rich Android app already available and an iOS version in the pipeline, GeeFi is proving its commitment to delivering tangible results. This focus on practical utility is why the conviction that it is 2026’s 100x gem continues to spread among informed market participants. The Strategic GeeFi Presale Opportunity GeeFi is currently in Phase 2 of its presale, with tokens priced at an attractive $0.06 . This entry point provides early investors a guaranteed return of 667% , based on the confirmed $0.40 listing price . The potential for wealth creation is substantial; a well-timed investment of $1,800 at this stage could expand to $90,000 if the token hits the analysts’ forecast of a $3 valuation , delivering an incredible 4,900% ROI . The market’s enthusiasm for GeeFi is clear from its presale performance. Phase 2 has already flown past the 80% completion mark , raising over $800K from the sale of 13 million tokens . Industry specialists anticipate Phase 3 will commence next week and sell out rapidly as anticipation builds around GeeFi’s imminent listings on top-tier exchanges. This powerful demand reinforces its status as 2026’s 100x gem . Generate High-Yield Passive Income and Rewards A key factor drawing capital to GeeFi is its competitive staking program, which allows investors to generate significant passive income. By locking tokens, users can earn 15% APR for one month , 22% APR for three months , or a market-leading 55% APR for a 12-month commitment . For those who prioritize liquidity, a flexible option offers returns of up to 10% with no lock-up requirement , providing a versatile earning solution for every type of investor. To further accelerate portfolio growth, GeeFi incorporates a valuable referral system. By sharing their unique link, users earn a 5% bonus in GEE tokens on every purchase made by their contacts. This program rewards active supporters and enables early participants to multiply their holdings with minimal effort. These income-generating features make GeeFi an appealing choice for investors focused on maximizing returns. Secure Your Position Before Mainstream Adoption Opportunities to invest in projects with high utility before they achieve widespread market recognition are often brief. The GeeFi presale presents a rare occasion to get involved before the general market takes notice. With its deflationary token model, a live product, and a development plan that includes a crypto debit card, GeeFi is well-positioned to become an industry leader. The rapid sales rate is a clear signal of strong market confidence. As the industry prepares for its next expansion, projects with solid fundamentals are expected to outperform. Missing this opportunity could lead to significant regret when the token lists on major exchanges, confirming the forecast that it is 2026’s 100x gem . The time to act is now.

55701192,644226,1765566008,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55701192.jpeg,A Major Bitcoin Pivot? Realized Loss Drops Below The Key Threshold – Here’s What It Means,https://bitcoinist.com/a-major-bitcoin-pivot/,"As the market volatility heats up again, the price of Bitcoin witnessed a pullback, bringing it closer to the $90,000 threshold. While BTC’s price faces a pullback, key on-chain metrics are beginning to follow suit, reaching levels that could shape or determine the next trajectory of the market. A Crucial Breakdown In Bitcoin Realized Loss Given the bearish state of the market, on-chain indicators for Bitcoin are flashing a slight but crucial signal in its dynamics. BTC On-Chain Trader Realized Price and Profit/Loss Margin, one of the most important metrics, has now dropped below a crucial level as the market and BTC’s price fluctuate. According to Ali Martinez, a seasoned crypto analyst and trader, this drop in the metric is offering a clue to the next potential path for the BTC market. Following weeks of increased capitulation-driven losses, the drop in realized losses indicates that market players are no longer selling coins at sharp discounts. While the wave of panic selling that clouded recent market turbulence may finally be dissipating, this crucial indicator is providing traders with new grounds to reevaluate the short-term course of Bitcoin. This implies that sentiment is gradually stabilizing, pointing to an early shift from capitulation to accumulation . In the post, Ali Martinez highlighted that the metric has fallen below the critical -37%, now located at -18%. The drop may appear increasingly negative, but it is hinting at a pivotal junction for the broader Bitcoin market. Historically, this drop in the metric below this level has led to a rebound in investors’ confidence in the market. Martinez claims that some of the best buy-the-dip opportunities have emerged when Bitcoin on-chain traders’ realized loss falls below -37%. BTC’s Rebound Requires Fresh Liquidity Since the sharp pullback from its all-time high, Bitcoin has failed to bounce back strongly. Darkfost, a market and author at CryptoQuant, claims that one of the major reasons why BTC is currently struggling to recover is the absence of incoming liquidity . This is the biggest issue in the market now. Liquidity here refers solely to stablecoins. According to Darkfost, monitoring these flows makes it easier to assess if new liquidity is poised to enter the market or if it is still lacking. Data shows that since August, stablecoin inflows into exchanges have steadily declined from 158 billion to around $76 billion. This sharp drop represents a 50% decrease in incoming liquidity. Additionally, the 90-day average has dropped, from $130 billion in stablecoin inflows to $118 billion. A drop in liquidity suggests that Bitcoin is battling with a decline in demand, which has not been strong enough to absorb the selling pressure impacting the market. Presently, the trend is still negative, and the minor rebounds observed are primarily a consequence of reduced selling pressure rather than more purchasing demand . For BTC to regain a genuine bullish trend, Darkfost stated that the key rests on new liquidity entering the market.",Bitcoin News|Ali Martinez|bitcoin|bitcoin news|Bitcoin On-chain Trader Realized Price and Profit/Loss Margin|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CryptoQuant|Darkfost,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-12 19:00:08

The project ignited its journey with a phenomenal Phase 1 , selling out 10 million tokens and raising $500,000 in just over a single week. That powerful start has transformed into unstoppable momentum, pushing the total funds raised beyond the $1 million milestone, with a growing legion of over 2,400 holders . GeeFi’s commitment to building a fully decentralized ecosystem is resonating deeply with those who prioritize security and real-world utility. The buzz has become so intense that seasoned market watchers predict Phase 3 could sell out in less than 10 days , driven by mounting speculation about its debut on major exchanges. From Hype to High-Utility: The GeeFi Advantage While meme coins like Shiba Inu react to macro events like Fed rate cuts and face volatility with a modest $0.00008254 price target, investors seeking fundamental value are finding it in GeeFi. The GeeFi ecosystem is a complete, non-custodial financial suite built for genuine user empowerment. At its heart is the GeeFi Wallet , a secure mobile application that guarantees you are the sole controller of your private keys. This principle of self-sovereignty provides a level of security that centralized platforms simply cannot match. The ecosystem’s power extends well beyond secure storage. An integrated Decentralized Exchange (DEX) supports over 14 networks , facilitating seamless cross-chain swaps and asset bridging without ever needing to leave the app. Moreover, the upcoming GeeFi Crypto Card is poised to revolutionize daily spending by enabling users to transact with their crypto holdings globally through the VISA and Mastercard networks. The GeeFi Team , which began development in 2023 , has prioritized delivering tangible products over empty hype. Your Final Chance for Ground-Floor Entry The GeeFi presale is strategically structured to offer explosive ROI for its early backers. In the current Phase 2 , tokens are available for just $0.06 , an entry point that is generating immense demand. This is because the confirmed listing price of $0.40 locks in a staggering 667% ROI for all presale participants at launch. This opportunity is fleeting; Phase 2 is already over 80% sold out , having accumulated $800,000 from the sale of 13 million tokens . With strong rumors suggesting that Tier-1 exchange listings are imminent, the chance to secure GEE at this price is rapidly diminishing. Generate Passive Income with Top-Tier Staking GeeFi creates compelling reasons to hold for the long term with one of the most attractive staking programs in the market. Investors can earn an exceptional 55% APR by locking their GEE tokens for 12 months, providing a powerful passive income stream. For those who prefer more flexibility, the platform offers 22% APR for a three-month lock and 15% APR for a one-month lock. In a standout feature, GeeFi also provides up to 10% APR for staking with no lock-up period , perfectly blending yield generation with asset liquidity. The ecosystem’s growth is further fueled by a referral program that rewards users with a 5% bonus in GEE for every purchase made through their link. The 100x Gem That Analysts Are Watching Every crypto cycle crowns a few projects that deliver extraordinary returns, and GeeFi has all the hallmarks of a future leader. Its combination of a finished product, blistering presale velocity, and a clear path to major exchanges distinguishes it from speculative assets. Crypto analysts are increasingly pointing to GeeFi as a 100x gem with the potential to deliver life-altering gains. This presale is the last call to invest at a foundational price before the token is exposed to the full force of the public market. Don’t let this opportunity slip away, secure your position before Phase 2 sells out for good.

The comments came just two days after the Fed lowered its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point on Wednesday. That marked the third straight meeting with a rate cut, but the decision faced pushback from within the central bank as officials worry about inflation that refuses to fully go away. Two Fed officials who voted against Wednesday’s rate cut explained their reasoning Friday. Austan Goolsbee, who leads the Chicago Fed, and Jeff Schmid from the Kansas City Fed both said they disagreed with cutting rates at this time. For Goolsbee, this was his first time voting against a Fed decision since he joined in 2023. He said officials should have waited to see more data before making another cut. The government shutdown in October and November delayed important economic reports, and some inflation numbers before the shutdown looked worrisome, he explained. However, Goolsbee told CNBC later Friday morning that he actually expects more rate cuts in 2026 than most of his colleagues do. “I’m one of the most optimistic folks about how rates can go down in the coming year,” he said. Hawks call for restrictive stance Schmid took a harder line. He said inflation stays too high while the economy keeps growing and the job market, despite cooling down, remains mostly balanced. “I view the current stance of monetary policy as being only modestly, if at all, restrictive,” he said. The debate will continue into next year with new voting members joining the rate-setting committee. Goolsbee and Schmid will lose their voting seats in 2026, but two officials who will gain votes also spoke Friday with different concerns. Beth Hammack from the Cleveland Fed said at an event in Cincinnati that the central bank needs to keep rates high enough to push inflation down. “Right now, we’ve got policy that’s right around neutral,” she said. “I would prefer to be on a slightly more restrictive stance.” According to Cryptopolitan’s live coverage , when the Fed released its projections Wednesday, six out of 19 policymakers said they would have kept rates where they were instead of cutting them. Since only 12 officials get to vote each year, and just two actually voted against the cut, some analysts called these higher rate projections “silent dissents.” Anna Paulson from the Philadelphia Fed, who will also get a vote next year alongside Hammack, focused on different worries. She was the only official speaking on Friday who stressed concerns about the labour market rather than inflation. “On net, I am still a little more concerned about labor market weakness than about upside risks to inflation,” Paulson said Friday at an event hosted by the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce. “That’s partly because I see a decent chance that inflation will come down as we go through next year.” Fed moves quickly to reappoint regional leaders In separate news, the Fed moved faster than expected to reappoint its regional leaders, easing worries that allies of Donald Trump might try to block them from keeping their jobs. The Fed board said Thursday it approved reappointing the 11 regional presidents who want to stay in their roles. The vote happens every five years and was supposed to take place before the end of February. The early timing matters because regional Fed presidents have taken the toughest stance on fighting inflation, even as Trump and his advisers have pushed for aggressive rate cuts. This raised concerns that Trump supporters on the Fed board might prevent some regional leaders from continuing. The reappointment vote received support from all board members, including Trump ally Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, who were both appointed during Trump’s first term. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has criticized the power held by regional presidents. Earlier this week, he indicated the administration would push for changes requiring new regional Fed presidents to live in their district for three years before taking the job. Regional Fed heads do not need presidential nomination or Senate approval, unlike Fed governors. Each regional Fed’s board of directors handles their appointments. The last reappointment vote happened in January 2021. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Yet deep structural charts often reveal patterns that outlast emotions. XRP traders now face another moment where calm analysis matters more than market chatter. Log-scale regression channels track percentage growth instead of raw price movement. This method captures long-term behavior more accurately. XRP has shifted through several exponential cycles since launch, making log-scale readings ideal for cycle mapping. This approach reduces distortion from early-stage volatility and highlights true macro direction. Egrag Crypto’s Technical Framework Egrag Crypto applied a long-term logarithmic regression channel to XRP’s historical structure. The model identifies three major price zones. Each level represents a different phase of market behavior. These levels help traders see the broader technical framework beyond short-term swings. #XRP – Linear Regression (Log-scales) Targets $3.4,$10, $27: Using the long-term Logarithmic Linear Regression Channel (log scale), three major price levels stand out as of December 2025 1⃣Mean Reversion → $3.40: A retest and rejection from $3.40 would be one of the… pic.twitter.com/3vIhXCCDRM — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 12, 2025 The First Key Level: Mean Reversion at $3.40 The model places mean reversion near $3.40. A rejection from this level signals renewed bearish pressure. Such a rejection would reflect structural weakness rather than fundamental issues. A strong close above this level confirms a shift into macro bullish territory. This close would signal regained momentum after recent market exhaustion. The Expansion Zone: Upper Midline Near $10 The regression channel’s upper midline sits near $10 . This zone normally triggers accelerated bullish expansion. Momentum often increases when the price enters this band. The level also rises over time because the channel is logarithmic. Traders watch this zone closely during high-volume breakouts. The Cycle-Top Zone: The $27 Region The channel’s upper boundary aligns near $27 . Several long-term confluences support this target. These include cycle symmetry, historical volatility, and multi-year extension ratios. This region represents a potential peak rather than a guaranteed outcome. Market makers may influence timing, but they cannot distort long-term math.

The asset pulled back from its mid-2025 highs near $3.66. This context shapes expectations for each target. Current price action keeps XRP below structural confirmation levels. However, the long-term channel remains intact. What Traders Should Consider Now The three levels act as decision points. A break above $3.40 confirms renewed macro strength. A move toward $10 signals expansion. The $27 zone reflects a possible cycle top. Traders must manage risk through clear position rules. Emotional discipline remains essential during volatile phases. In sum, Egrag Crypto’s log-regression roadmap offers a structured view of XRP’s future. It highlights phases that may unfold as the cycle matures. These levels should guide expectations, not create assumptions. Master your emotions, stay patient, and follow the math.

The regulators claim that these new markets are unlawful betting platforms. Kalshi, Coinbase, Crypto.com, and other prediction market platforms have entered into a coalition to defend federal regulation and fight back against state gaming regulators and lobby groups trying to restrict their operations. Are states against prediction markets? Kalshi, Crypto.com, Coinbase, Robinhood, and Underdog have announced the formation of The Coalition for Prediction Markets to protect safe, transparent, and federally supervised access to prediction markets. According to Kalshi founder Tarek Mansour, the coalition was created to provide a voice for prediction markets against adverse lobbying groups and to protect the transparency and customer protection standards within the industry. As it stands, nearly half of Americans under 45 have already used an online financial or prediction market. The industry has seen explosive growth, and platforms now record billions in weekly trading volume. Prediction markets have reached over $150 billion in annualized volume. They allow users to trade contracts based on real-world events ranging from sports outcomes to elections. The platforms are currently regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) at the federal level, which distinguishes them from state-regulated gambling operations. However, the nascent industry is taking punches from multiple fronts. The American Gaming Association (AGA), which represents major casino operators like MGM and Caesars, launched campaigns describing prediction markets as unlawful sports betting operating without proper state licenses. The AGA and many of its members have warned that platforms with contracts tied to sports events undermine regulated betting. States including Massachusetts, Washington, New York, and Connecticut have taken legal action against prediction market operators. Gaming regulators in these states argue that sports-related event contracts should be treated as gambling and subject to state licensing requirements. “Americans deserve clarity, not 50 conflicting interpretations,” Sara Slane, an Executive Board Member of the Coalition and Head of Corporate Development at Kalshi, stated. Matt David, the President of North America at Crypto.com and an executive board member of the coalition, described prediction markets as a way to help people and institutions make better decisions. The coalition will focus on educating policymakers and the public about how prediction markets differ from traditional gambling. Is the sports betting industry getting along with prediction markets? In November, DraftKings and FanDuel both resigned from the American Gaming Association specifically because of disagreements over how prediction markets should be regulated. Both companies view the growing sports prediction markets as a significant growth opportunity and are putting in efforts to break into it. FanDuel announced it was partnering with Wall Street firm CME Group to launch a prediction markets platform in December. The platform will provide users with contracts for baseball, basketball, football, and hockey in all states, including those where sports betting remains illegal. DraftKings acquired prediction market platform Railbird in October and plans to launch DraftKings Predictions. PrizePicks, Underdog, and Fanatics have all introduced or announced prediction market products. Sources told CNBC that the AGA’s board was considering a rule change that would exclude any operator involved in prediction markets from membership. Polymarket , one of the largest prediction market platforms globally, is notably absent from the new coalition, but according to the announcement, other companies are currently in discussion to join the collective.

Launched by Protocol Labs in October 2020, it utilizes blockchain technology to create a peer-to-peer digital storage marketplace. Users can rent unused hard drive space to earn Filecoin tokens (FIL), the network’s native cryptocurrency. The system operates on a proof-of-replication and proof-of-spacetime consensus mechanism, ensuring that data is reliably stored over time and that storage providers hold the exact copies they claim. This approach incentivizes a robust and distributed network of storage providers, enhancing data retrieval speeds and security compared to traditional centralized servers. Filecoin aims to reduce the costs of storage services by leveraging the global surplus of storage capacity. As part of the broader Web3 ecosystem, it supports decentralized applications (dApps) and services requiring secure, decentralized data storage solutions, significantly advancing decentralized internet infrastructure. Overview Cryptocurrency Filecoin Token FIL Price $1.38 Market Cap $1B Trading Volume (24 hr) $73.46M Circulating Supply 1.95B FIL All-time High $237.24 on Apr 01, 2021 All-time Low $1.83 on Aug 29, 2019 24 High $1.41 24 Low $1.36 Filecoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Volatility (30-day variation) 13.54% (Very High) 50-Day SMA $ 1.78 14-Day RSI 36.07 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 29 (Fear) Green Days 10/30 (33%) 200-Day SMA $2.37 FIL price analysis Filecoin price analysis 1-day chart analysis FILUSD chart by TradingView According to the FIL 1-day chart on Dec.12, Filecoin (FIL) is attempting to stabilize around the $1.38–$1.40 region following an extended decline, but the broader daily trend remains bearish. Price continues to trade below the 20-day moving average near $1.54 and remains close to the lower Bollinger Band, indicating persistent selling pressure. The MACD stays negative, though its histogram is flattening, suggesting bearish momentum is weakening. RSI near 37 shows subdued demand without signaling a strong oversold bounce. Immediate support lies at $1.36–$1.38, while a breakdown could expose $1.30. On the upside, resistance stands at $1.54 and $1.71. A sustained daily close above $1.45 would be needed to signal a meaningful trend reversal. Filecoin price analysis 4-hour chart analysis FILUSD chart by TradingView On the 4-hour FIL/USDT chart, price is compressing into a tight range after the November spike and subsequent fade. FIL is trading near $1.38, below the 20-period basis around $1.45, keeping the short-term bias slightly bearish. Bollinger Bands (≈$1.31–$1.58) are narrowing, signaling volatility compression and a likely breakout attempt. MACD remains under the zero line with a small, flattening histogram, suggesting selling momentum is weakening rather than reversing. Balance of Power is negative, so rallies can be sold. Support: $1.31–$1.35; resistance: $1.45 then $1.58. A clean close above $1.45 would shift momentum bullish, while a breakdown under $1.31 opens $1.20.

Price is consolidating around the $1.35–$1.45 zone, showing indecision between buyers defending support and sellers controlling rallies. Momentum indicators suggest bearish pressure is weakening, but there is no confirmed bullish reversal yet. A sustained close above $1.45 could open a recovery toward $1.60–$1.70, while failure to hold $1.31 support risks a slide back toward $1.20. Expect low volatility and choppy price action until volume expands and a clear directional breakout emerges. Why is Filecoin up today? Filecoin is moving higher today mainly because sellers appear to be losing control after a long period of sideways price action. The price defended the $1.35–$1.38 support area, which attracted buyers looking for a bounce. Momentum indicators show bearish pressure fading, encouraging short-term traders to step in. A calmer broader market, with Bitcoin holding steady, also helped reduce fear across altcoins. Some traders likely closed short positions, adding to the upward push. Overall, the move looks like a short-term relief bounce rather than a major trend shift, but it shows that selling momentum is easing for now. Is Filecoin a good investment? Filecoin is a decentralized storage network aiming to revolutionize data storage. Its investment potential depends on market adoption and competition. Like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant risks due to volatility. Investors should carefully research and assess their risk tolerance before considering investing.

Filecoin (FIL) has the potential for significant price appreciation, especially if adoption increases within the decentralized storage sector. Historically, FIL reached an all-time high of $236.84 in 2021, but its price has since retraced significantly. Looking forward, realistic long-term projections depend on market conditions, demand for decentralized storage, and crypto adoption. In a bullish scenario, FIL could reach $5 by 2025 if institutional interest and on-chain activity increase. More optimistic forecasts suggest $50+ in the next major bull run. However, market risks remain, and sustained growth depends on ecosystem developments and competitive advantages over traditional cloud storage solutions. Can Filecoin reach 100 dollars? Filecoin (FIL) reaching $100 is possible, but it would require significant market momentum, adoption, and favorable conditions in the broader crypto space. The token hit an all-time high of $236.84 in 2021, proving that such price levels are achievable during bullish cycles. For FIL to reach $100 again, it would need strong institutional adoption, increased demand for decentralized storage solutions, and a broader crypto bull market. However, competition from traditional cloud providers and other blockchain-based storage networks could limit growth. While possible, it would require a massive market resurgence and sustained network adoption to materialize. What is the all-time high price of Filecoin?

According to the analyst’s report, this new technical pattern suggests the meme coin could be on the verge of a bottom, potentially marking its next key buying point for market watchers. This projected decline could extend the downtrend Dogecoin experienced over the past few months, which already wiped out most of the gains made earlier this year during the meme coin hype. Dogecoin Bullish Reversal Setup Reveal Buying Point Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has stated that Dogecoin may be close to forming a bottom on the daily chart, as it develops what appears to be a classic Bullish Three Drives pattern. He points out that the first 1.272 Fibonacci extension near $0.137, measured from Point 1 to Point 2, lines up with the descending resistance line formed by Points A and B. This alignment is significant, as it suggests that Point 3 may represent the next buying opportunity, potentially marking Dogecoin’s lowest level before a reversal. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Will Rally Before It Crashes, But What’s The Target? Trader Tardigrade’s chart shows the full Three Bullish Drives pattern taking shape, with three apparent dips labeled Points 1, 2, and 3. Each downward move follows the same harmonic rhythm seen in the sample pattern shown in the chart’s inset. Points A and B, between $0.159 and $0.155, form lower highs, creating a strong resistance line that the Dogecoin price continues to respect throughout the pattern. The repeated appearance of the 1.272 Fibonacci extension reinforces the setup, showing that the market is following the expected price behavior of this chart formation. Point 3, which sits between $0.131 and $0.124, stands out as a major turning point for investors. What this means is that Trader Tardigrade expects Dogecoin to temporarily decline to this lower buy point before moving back upwards. The momentum from DOGE’s projected rebound is expected to push its price toward $0.155. Although the analysis initially forecast that Dogecoin would hit a bottom, it also suggests that the recent downtrend, which has seen the meme coin’s price crash by roughly 20% this month, may be approaching its end. Falling Wedge Signals Strong Upside For DOGE A market expert identified as ‘Crypto King’ on X suggests that Dogecoin has strong bullish potential, as a clean Falling Wedge pattern is forming on the daily chart. He highlighted that the DOGE price is currently compressing against the trendline, signaling that the market may be gearing up for a significant move. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Price Is Ready To Fly, Here’s Why According to Crypto King, once the market structure is broken and the diagonal resistance is reclaimed, a rapid surge toward $0.27 could unfold for Dogecoin. At its current price of $0.14, this would represent a staggering 92.86% gain.

The forecast arrives even as Bitcoin is trading about 28% below its all-time high. BTC is currently trading at approximately $90,180, down about 0.59% in the last 24 hours. Source: TradingView Bitcoin Tipped for $150K High as Institutional Forces Align Katherine Dowling, president of BSTR, outlined her bullish case in a DL News interview . “I am bullish on Bitcoin in 2026 despite the recent risk-off sentiment and price slide. Outside of the clear fundamentals, we also have the trifecta of a positive regulatory environment, quantitative easing, and institutional inflows.” The prediction is anchored by major structural shifts in the U.S. financial environment. For example, President Trump recently signed the ‘ GENIUS Act ‘ into law, establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Concurrently, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued guidance permitting national banks to offer crypto brokerage services , removing a key barrier for traditional financial institutions. Regulatory Tailwinds and Monetary Easing Further momentum comes from the Federal Reserve, which has cut interest rates three times this year, a policy historically favorable to assets like Bitcoin. This accommodative stance is coupled with growing institutional acceptance. BREAKING: FED MEETING MINUTES REVEAL ALMOST ALL MEMBERS AGREED ON A 25 BPS RATE CUT. THE PRINTING ERA IS BACK.

This move alone could channel a large portion of the bank’s $3.5 trillion in client assets toward the digital asset. Brian Huang, CEO of investment platform Glider, echoed Dowling’s sentiment in an interview with DL News. “If we zoom out, the FED is lowering interest rates. That should bode well for risk assets like Bitcoin and ETH ETFs,” Huang stated. “Expect Bitcoin to reach $150k before year’s [2026] end.” The Institutional Take The BofA greenlight is more than just another headline. It indicates a procedural and compliance shift within a top-tier U.S. bank, moving Bitcoin from a client-inquiry-only asset to a proactively recommended portfolio component. This change normalizes Bitcoin exposure for a massive pool of conservative capital, managed by advisers who now have a fiduciary framework for recommending it. The true sign is the operationalizing of Bitcoin access within legacy financial infrastructure, a far more durable catalyst than fleeting retail sentiment.

The highly anticipated Firedancer client , developed by Jump Crypto, has officially launched on the Solana mainnet. This isn’t just another update; it’s a foundational shift designed to supercharge the network’s capabilities and fortify its defenses. According to The Block, its ambitious goal is to process a staggering one million transactions per second. But what does this launch truly mean for developers, validators, and the entire Solana community? Let’s explore the transformative impact of this new Firedancer client . What is the Firedancer Client and Why Does It Matter? Think of a blockchain client as the software that allows a computer to join and participate in a network. For years, Solana validators primarily relied on a single client software. The introduction of the Firedancer client changes this dynamic completely. It’s a brand-new, independent implementation built from the ground up by Jump Crypto’s expert engineers. Its primary mission is to push Solana’s performance to unprecedented levels while introducing a critical concept: client diversity. How Does Client Diversity Make Solana Unbreakable? Relying on one client is like building a city on a single foundation. If a flaw is found, the entire system is at risk. The new Firedancer client provides a second, independent foundation. This diversity is a game-changer for network security and resilience. Enhanced Security: It becomes exponentially harder for bad actors to disrupt the network. An attack or bug affecting one client is unlikely to affect the other. Accidental Failure Protection: If a software bug causes the primary client to falter, validators running the Firedancer client can keep the network alive and stable. Fostering Innovation: Competition between client teams drives faster optimization, better features, and more robust code for everyone. Therefore, this launch isn’t just about speed; it’s about creating a more decentralized, secure, and reliable blockchain infrastructure. Can Firedancer Really Achieve 1 Million Transactions Per Second? The target of one million transactions per second (TPS) is a bold declaration of intent. While the mainnet launch is the first crucial step, achieving this peak throughput will be a journey. The Firedancer client is engineered with this extreme scale in mind, utilizing highly efficient, performance-oriented code. Its deployment allows the Solana network to gradually scale its capacity, stress-test new limits, and optimize performance under real-world conditions. This positions Solana not just as a fast blockchain, but as a global-scale settlement layer capable of handling application demand we haven’t even seen yet. What Are the Immediate and Future Benefits? The launch delivers tangible value today while paving the way for tomorrow. Network Stability: Users and developers can expect a more resilient Solana, with reduced risk of widespread outages. Validator Choice: Validators now have options, allowing them to choose the client that best fits their technical needs and improves network health. Ecosystem Confidence: This major investment from a firm like Jump Crypto signals strong institutional belief in Solana’s long-term vision, potentially attracting more builders and capital. Looking ahead, the success of the Firedancer client could inspire more independent teams to build their own clients, further strengthening the network’s decentralized fabric. A New Chapter for a High-Performance Blockchain The mainnet launch of Jump Crypto’s Firedancer client marks a pivotal evolution for Solana. It moves the network beyond a single software implementation towards a mature, multi-client ecosystem. This strategic upgrade directly addresses past criticisms regarding network stability by baking resilience into the protocol’s core. While the quest for one million TPS continues, the immediate win is a fundamentally stronger and more secure Solana. The Firedancer client is now live, dancing across the network and setting a new standard for what a high-performance blockchain can achieve. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly is the Firedancer client? A: The Firedancer client is a new, independent software implementation for running a Solana validator, built from scratch by Jump Crypto to increase network speed, capacity, and security. Q: How does Firedancer improve Solana’s security? A: It introduces client diversity. If one client has a bug or is attacked, the other can keep the network running, making Solana much harder to disrupt accidentally or intentionally. Q: Do all validators have to switch to Firedancer now? A: No. Validators can choose to run the original client, the new Firedancer client, or both. This choice and diversity are what strengthen the network. Q: Will transactions become cheaper and faster immediately? A> The mainnet launch is the first step. As Firedancer is adopted and optimized, it is expected to significantly increase network capacity over time, which should lead to lower costs and higher speed as capacity meets demand. Q: Who built the Firedancer client? A: It was developed by Jump Crypto, the cryptocurrency and blockchain division of the trading firm Jump Trading Group. Q: Does this affect SOL token holders or users of Solana apps? A> Indirectly, yes. A more stable, secure, and high-capacity network benefits everyone using Solana by providing a better overall experience and greater reliability for decentralized applications.

The seizure occurred under the Fugitive Disentitlement Act, which allows authorities to confiscate assets from individuals who are fugitives from justice. The recovery comes as Florida lawmakers are proposing new regulations to combat rising crypto ATM scams, which defrauded Americans of $240 million in the first half of the year. Florida crypto scam victim gets justice According to Uthmeier, the Office of Statewide Prosecution’s Cyber Fraud Enforcement Unit made the seizure of cryptocurrency worth $1.5 million in a money laundering case against a Chinese national. The seized assets are reportedly intended to be returned to the victim upon conclusion of the legal process. In a statement announcing the seizure, Uthmeier expressed pride in the ability of the Statewide Prosecutors to adapt, which ultimately helped them deliver justice. In his statement, he thanked Florida’s Cyber Fraud Enforcement Unit and the Citrus County Sheriff’s Office for their continued dedication and “for making this fraudster’s victim whole again.” Uthmeier said. The investigation began in July 2024 when a report was filed with the Citrus County Sheriff’s Office in which the victim, a Citrus County resident, reported he had been scammed out of $47,421 USD via an internet-based investment scheme. The investigation that followed the revelation saw Tu Weizhi, a citizen of China, charged with money laundering, grand theft, and an organized scheme to defraud. Weizhi currently walks free in China, but there are plans to arrest him if he ever attempts to enter the U.S. A seizure warrant was also filed in the Fifth Judicial Circuit to recover Weizhi’s entire cryptocurrency wallet, valued at approximately $1.5 million, which contained AVAX (Avalanche), DOGE (Dogecoin), PEPE (Pepe), and SOL (Solana) cryptocurrency tokens. As earlier stated, the seizure occurred under the Fugitive Disentitlement Act, which allows courts to move against assets tied to a criminal case even though a defendant is situated outside the jurisdiction. The Act ensures the suspect’s ability to use Florida’s courts to contest forfeiture can’t be exercised unless they appear to face the charges. “This isn’t the first time U.S. law enforcement has seized assets in absentia, but what’s notable is how comfortably those doctrines now extend to crypto,” Angela Ang, head of policy and strategic partnerships for Asia Pacific at TRM Labs, said. Florida is struggling with crypto-based scams Florida has ramped up efforts to curb crypto crimes and scams this year. However, despite the best efforts of the government and law enforcement, scams are still quite rampant. Just last month, Okaloosa County reported over $1.1 million lost to similar investment frauds, and recent reports claim Florida lawmakers have started considering new safeguards designed to curb rising crypto ATM scams . As things stand, crypto ATM machines operate with barely any oversight or regulation, which has made them a prime tool for scanners that have been used to target mostly senior citizens, according to law enforcement. Data from the FBI claims that Americans lost up to $240 million to crypto ATM scams in the first half of this year. How do crypto ATM scams work? The fraudsters convince victims to withdraw cash from their bank accounts and deposit it into crypto ATMs . However, once the money is inserted into the machine, it is converted into a virtual currency that cannot be tracked and is rarely recovered. During a hearing in Tallahassee on Tuesday, a Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Deputy testified that he covered cases last year that saw victims lose a combined $13 million to crypto schemes. Several of those cases, according to Master Deputy Jeffrey Merry with the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office, involved seniors. To curb this, Florida officials have proposed BH 505 , a bill that would require crypto kiosks to display clear warnings explaining the tactics fraudsters use to direct victims to the machines. The bill would also put a cap on how much customers can deposit, with new customers limited to $2,000 per day, while existing customers would be limited to $10,500 in a single day. There are currently no transaction limits at all. The machines will also be forced to provide printed receipts with the company’s contact information. And in certain situations where theft is reported quickly, the proposal covers a refund process. The bill has bipartisan support in the House and has passed unanimously in a House Insurance & Banking subcommittee. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Analysts suggest this cross-chain liquidity expansion could propel the XRP price prediction toward $5. Ripple Expands to Solana and Secures First European Banking Partnership Hex Trust, a prominent regulated digital asset platform serving institutional clients and functioning as a qualified custodian, announced plans to issue and custody wrapped XRP (wXRP), a 1:1-backed representation of native XRP to support DeFi activity and cross-chain functionality. BREAKING: XRP is coming to Solana pic.twitter.com/LabnKkLs71 — Solana (@solana) December 12, 2025 Consequently, wXRP’s utility will extend beyond the XRP Ledger, becoming tradable with RLUSD on Solana, Ethereum, and other blockchains where RLUSD is available. “Users of wXRP and RLUSD will benefit from two assets that are built on trusted, compliant infrastructure, enabling broader DeFi utility for XRP and RLUSD across supported blockchains,” stated Giorgia Pellizzari, CPO and Head of Custody at Hex Trust. In another significant development, Ripple recently partnered with Amina Bank AG to facilitate near real-time cross-border payments for Amina Bank’s clients using Ripple Payments. Notably, Amina Bank AG becomes the first European bank to adopt Ripple Payments. These strategic initiatives are expected to impact XRP token valuation. Analysts note the asset is forming a bullish pennant pattern with price already positioned above strong support levels, potentially targeting $5 in 2026. XRP Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Shows Critical $2.00 Support Test On the XRP/USDT chart, price currently trades at $1.9960, down approximately 1.87%, and sits at a pivotal juncture. The technical setup reveals XRP has been consolidating within a range following a substantial rally earlier this year. The chart identifies critical support at $2.00, where the price currently rests, with a stronger support zone at $1.80 if the current level breaks. Source: TradingView On the upside, initial targets include approximately $2.61 and an ambitious secondary target near $3.17, with a confirmation level at $2.40 that would signal bullish control. The RSI at 43.55 is in neutral to slightly bearish territory, suggesting potential for movement in either direction without extreme conditions. If XRP maintains support above $2.00 and builds momentum, there is potential for a return to the $2.40-$2.61 range. MAXI Presale Hits $4.3M as Traders Position for XRP-Led Altcoin Season As XRP attempts to leverage Solana DeFi for a bullish reversal heading into 2026, presale projects like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) are attracting investors seeking to capitalize on altcoin rotation typically associated with XRP rallies. $MAXI is building an active community where traders share insider information, early trade setups, and hidden opportunities before they become widely known.

This isn’t just speculation—it’s the disturbing reality uncovered by LinkedIn users who discovered their gender might be the invisible hand suppressing their visibility. The #WearthePants experiment has revealed potential cracks in LinkedIn’s new LLM-powered algorithm, raising urgent questions about fairness in professional networking platforms. What’s Really Happening with LinkedIn’s Algorithm? In November, a product strategist we’ll call Michelle conducted a simple but revealing experiment. She changed her LinkedIn profile gender to male and her name to Michael. The results were startling: her post impressions jumped 200% and engagements rose 27% within days. She wasn’t alone. Marilynn Joyner reported a 238% increase in impressions after making the same change, while numerous other professional women documented similar patterns. This experiment emerged after months of complaints from heavy LinkedIn users about declining engagement. The timing coincided with LinkedIn’s August announcement that they had “more recently” implemented Large Language Models (LLMs) to surface content. For women who built substantial followings through consistent posting, the sudden change felt particularly unfair. The #WearthePants Experiment: Systematic Gender Bias? The movement began with entrepreneurs Cindy Gallop and Jane Evans, who asked two male colleagues to post identical content. Despite having combined followings exceeding 150,000 (compared to the men’s 9,400), the results were telling: Creator Followers Post Reach Percentage of Followers Reached Cindy Gallop ~75,000 801 1.07% Male Colleague ~4,700 10,408 221% “The only significant variable was gender,” Michelle told Bitcoin World. She noted that despite having over 10,000 followers compared to her husband’s 2,000, they received similar impression numbers—until she adopted his profile details and writing style. How AI Bias Creeps into Social Media Algorithms LinkedIn maintains that its “algorithm and AI systems do not use demographic information such as age, race, or gender as a signal to determine the visibility of content.” However, experts suggest the bias might be more subtle and systemic. Brandeis Marshall, a data ethics consultant, explains: “Platforms are an intricate symphony of algorithms that pull specific mathematical and social levers, simultaneously and constantly. Most of these platforms innately have embedded a white, male, Western-centric viewpoint due to who trained the models.” The problem stems from how LLMs learn: They’re trained on human-generated content containing existing biases Human trainers often reinforce certain patterns during post-training Historical engagement data might favor traditionally male communication styles Writing Style: The Hidden Variable in LinkedIn’s Algorithm Michelle noticed something crucial during her experiment. When posting as “Michael,” she adjusted her writing to a more direct, concise style—similar to how she ghostwrites for her husband. This stylistic change, combined with the gender switch, produced the dramatic results. Sarah Dean, assistant professor of computer science at Cornell, notes: “Someone’s demographics can affect ‘both sides’ of the algorithm—what they see and who sees what they post. Platforms often use entire profiles, including jobs and engagement history, when determining content to boost.” This suggests LinkedIn’s algorithm might be rewarding communication patterns historically associated with male professionals: Concise, direct language Confident assertions Industry-specific jargon Less emotional or qualifying language LinkedIn’s Response and the Algorithm Black Box LinkedIn’s Head of Responsible AI and Governance, Sakshi Jain, reiterated in November that their systems don’t use demographic information for content visibility. The company told Bitcoin World they test millions of posts to ensure creators “compete on equal footing” and that the feed experience remains consistent across audiences. However, the platform offers minimal transparency about their AI training processes. Chad Johnson, a sales expert active on LinkedIn, described the new system as prioritizing “understanding, clarity, and value” over traditional metrics like posting frequency or timing. Key changes users report: Deprioritization of likes and reposts Increased competition (posting up 15% year-over-year) Reward for specific, audience-targeted content Greater emphasis on professional insights and industry analysis Not Just Gender: The Broader Algorithm Discontent The frustration extends beyond gender issues. Many users, regardless of gender, report confusion about the new system: Shailvi Wakhulu, a data scientist, saw impressions drop from thousands to hundreds One male user reported a 50% engagement drop over recent months Another man saw impressions increase 100% by writing for specific audiences Brandeis Marshall notes her posts about race perform better than those about her expertise Sarah Dean suggests the algorithm might simply be amplifying existing signals: “It could be rewarding certain posts not because of the writer’s demographics, but because there’s been more historical response to similar content across the platform.” Actionable Insights for Navigating the New LinkedIn Algorithm Based on user experiences and LinkedIn’s guidance, here’s what appears to work: Write for specific audiences with clear professional insights Focus on clarity and value over emotional appeal Share career lessons and industry analysis Provide educational content about work and business economics Engage meaningfully rather than chasing vanity metrics The Transparency Dilemma in Social Media Algorithms “I want transparency,” Michelle stated, echoing a common sentiment. However, as Brandeis Marshall notes, complete transparency could lead to algorithm gaming. Platforms guard their algorithmic secrets closely, creating what experts call the “black box” problem. The fundamental tension remains: users want fair, understandable systems, while platforms need to prevent manipulation. This conflict is particularly acute in professional networks like LinkedIn, where visibility can directly impact careers and business opportunities. FAQs: Understanding LinkedIn’s Algorithm Controversy What is the #WearthePants experiment? The #WearthePants experiment involved women changing their LinkedIn profile genders to male to test whether the platform’s algorithm showed gender bias in content distribution. Who started the #WearthePants movement? The experiment began with entrepreneurs Cindy Gallop and Jane Evans, who suspected gender might explain declining engagement. What has LinkedIn said about these allegations? LinkedIn maintains its algorithm doesn’t use demographic data for content visibility. Sakshi Jain , Head of Responsible AI, and Tim Jurka , VP of Engineering, have both addressed these concerns. Could writing style explain the differences? Yes. Participants noted that adopting more direct, concise writing styles—often associated with male communication patterns—correlated with increased visibility. Are other social media platforms facing similar issues? Yes. Most LLM-dependent platforms struggle with embedded biases from their training data, as noted by experts like Brandeis Marshall and researchers including Sarah Dean . Conclusion: The Unsettling Reality of Algorithmic Fairness The #WearthePants experiment reveals a disturbing possibility: even well-intentioned AI systems can perpetuate real-world biases. While LinkedIn denies intentional discrimination, the patterns observed by numerous professional women suggest something systemic at work. Whether it’s embedded in training data, reinforced by historical engagement patterns, or amplified through stylistic preferences, the effect remains the same: some voices get amplified while others get suppressed. As AI becomes increasingly embedded in professional platforms, the need for transparency, accountability, and diverse training data becomes more urgent. The alternative is a digital professional landscape where success depends not just on merit, but on how well one can conform to algorithmic preferences—preferences that might carry the biases of their human creators.

The stock had a rough da y Th ursday, dropping 6.1% to finish at $16.43 per share. But things turned aroun d Fr iday, with shares climbing more than 15% during trading hours. Most Wall Street experts kept their ratings the same after Rivian held its first “Autonomy and AI Day” event . However, Needham bumped up its price target by 64% to $23 per share, citing the technology reveals and possible future deals where Rivian could license its systems to others. The firm also expects stronger sales next year when the company launches its new midsize R2 SUV. “RIVN signaled a shift from an [automaker] adopting autonomy to one leveraging AI to build end-to-end autonomy,” Needham analyst Chris Pierce wrot e Fr iday. “We attended Rivian’s Autonomy & AI Day yesterday in Palo Alto and came away mostly impressed with the strategic direction outlined by management,” Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu wrot e Fr iday. “However, the stock’s weakness seems warranted given the run-up since earnings and lack of a major AI partnership/deal announcement.” Company unveils custom chip and self-driving plans At the event, Rivian unveiled several new technologies . These included RAP1, a custom chip built for “physical AI” and self-driving features, along with updated software that acts as the vehicle’s brain, a new AI helper, and a plan for reaching “personal L4″—meaning cars that can drive themselves completely. The rollout starts later this month with improvements to the hands-free driving system. Rivian plans to keep adding features until vehicles can drive fully on their own in the coming years. The company didn’t say exactly when full self-driving or a robotaxi service might arrive. Before the event, Rivian shares had jumped more than 30% to $17.50. Even with those gains, the stock remains far below its IPO price of $78 per share in 2021. Barclays analyst Dan Levy and others said the technology announcements, including the surprise chip reveal, looked good, but Rivian still needs to prove itself in difficult market conditions. “With RIVN facing a tougher path to breakeven on core vehicle sales alone, we believe with enhanced AV/AI capabilities, RIVN is further paving the path to additional software/service revenues, which would be margin accretive,” Levy wrot e Fr iday. “To be clear, there is certainly a ‘show me’ element for RIVN on its capabilities.” The company faces several obstacles. Electric vehicle sales have slumped since tax credits worth up to $7,500 ended in September. Support from the Trump administration appears limited, and Rivian has internal problems with products and funding. Several analysts pointed out that even Tesla, the top EV seller in America, struggles with low adoption of advanced driving features. Rivian is playing catch-up to competitors who have offered such systems for years. Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe defended the company’s approach, sayin g bu ilding everything in-house, like software, AI, vehicle platforms, and other technology, will make the automaker faster and better tha n ri vals. “AI is enabling us to create technology and customer experiences at a rate that is completely different from what we’ve seen in the past,” Scaringe said at the event. This strategy, plus Rivian’s $5.8 billion software partnership with Volkswagen previously reported by Cyptopolitan , has led Wall Street to value Rivian’s software business more than its car manufacturing operation. Software business valued higher than car sales Morgan Stanley, which recently downgraded the company, has a $12 price target that breaks down to $7 for software and services and $5 for making and selling vehicles. Some analysts think Rivian could license or sell its new technologies, including chips. “RIVN is developing a suite of hardware and software offerings to remain competitive in an Auto 2.0 world. However, several risks remain around demand, potentially limiting data capture needed to reach higher levels of autonomy,” Morgan Stanley’s Andrew Percoco wrot e Fr iday, according to CNBC. Morgan Stanley kept its rating based on concerns about slow adoption of self-driving features, weak EV demand before the R2 launch next year, and a long road to making money. RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan agreed: “The advancements enhance Rivian’s product offering but do not address ongoing concerns around liquidity and R2/R3 profitability.” Join Bybit now and claim a $50 bonus in minutes",Tech|Rivian,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-12 19:55:31

Volumes have risen to near $30 billion, and market sentiment strongly favors the outcome of the FOMC meeting. Now that the technical analysis for Ethereum is bullish and the recent improvements on the technology front have enhanced the platform’s scalability and appeal, analysts think that a recovery of the $3,500 level is imminent. This momentum continues, and the attention of investors is also growing for an ETH-based new crypto, named Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is increasingly seen among the best cryptos to invest in right now for those focusing on the DeFi segment. Ethereum Sees Breakout Opportunity As Bullish Sentiment Amplified Ethereum is up over 8% in the last 24 hours, thanks to increasing liquidity and the overall sentiment shift among markets towards risk on. It appears that over $260 million worth of shorts were unwound within four hours when the price of ETH burst through critical resistance. It appears that the 200-day EMA for the token has been breached, which is a very reliable indicator of a long-term trend change. The momentum indicators are also bullish, with the RSI above the average for the 14-day period, which is usually the buy signal given by institutional traders. Ethereum, following the upgrade by both Fusaka and Pectra, has lower transacting costs and higher transactions per second, which improves its competitive advantage at a time when institutional investments are rising. If the $3,500 level is breached, analysts expect the market to trigger a recovery, with estimates indicating a possible target of $4,000. Mutuum Finance: The Best Cryptocurrency To Invest In For Access To DeFi Market With the Ethereum rebound lighting the way for the next big thing in crypto, the name that keeps popping up among the ranks of the next big thing is none other than Mutuum Finance, better known by the ticker MUTM. With the goal of providing a decentralized lending and borrowing platform that excels on the level of capital efficiency, real yield, and the transparent nature of their liquidation model on the Ethereum platform, the premise of the project truly speaks for itself. Mutuum’s presale is currently at phase 6, and the data demonstrates increasing momentum: $19,280,000 raised and 18,450 total holders since the project’s inception. The current price at phase 6 is $0.035, indicating a steep 250% increase since the initial entry price of $0.01 during phase 1. However, with the current phase 6 already 98% sold out, it is the last call for buyers to get their hands on the tokens before the price spikes by nearly 20% to $0.04 in phase 7. The launch price for the new token, MUTM, is $0.06, indicating that current buyers will get a whopping 360% return when the token is goes live. One of the main factors contributing to the adoption of the protocol is the implementation of the new dashboard for the Mutuum protocol. This new platform features a leaderboard of the top 50 account holders, with the number one-ranked user receiving a $500 MUTM reward every day that a transaction is made. Security is also among the areas that have received heavy attention, with Halborn Security already undertaking a comprehensive audit of the smart contracts of Mutuum. This will help enhance the confidence of the investors, especially when the protocol is ready for launch. As the benefits of Phase 6 are almost exhausted, with the next price increase for $0.04 imminent, the time for a discounted entry into the market for MUTM is running out. Those looking for the next big thing in the cryptocurrency arena for the growth of the DeFi space might not get a better opportunity.

VeChain historic price sentiment VeChain Price History VeChain began in 2015 as a private consortium chain for blockchain applications. It transitioned to a public blockchain with the ERC-20 token VEN in 2017 and launched its mainnet as VET in 2018. In 2018, VeChain partnered with DHL to develop blockchain solutions for logistics but saw a significant price correction, stabilizing at lower levels. The price remained relatively stable in 2019 and 2020, with occasional spikes as VeChain continued developing technology and forming partnerships. In 2021, VeChain’s price surged to an all-time high of $0.20 in May but dropped to $0.070 by December. In 2022, VeChain attempted to recover but remained below $0.10, with continued volatility throughout the year and into early 2023. Towards the end of 2023, the price saw a slight uptick, stabilizing around $0.020 by early 2024. In 2024, VeChain’s price fluctuated, recovering to $0.025 by mid-March but dropping due to bearish trends, reaching a low of $0.019 by August. It traded around $0.021 in September but ended the month above the $0.024 mark. The price remained mostly stable in October, with the occasional bearish movement causing a decline from the $0.02400 level to start November at the $0.02100 price level. The asset closed November at a high level, with prices near the $0.04600 mark and a strong bullish outlook. However, the bulls only took the price higher in December, as the $0.0500 resistance was crushed swiftly. As of January 2025, VET traded around the $0.04300 mark as it started and closed the month around the same level. In February, the price fell towards the $0.03000 mark as bears took over, ending the month at $0.02800. In March, the net movement was low, but the volatility was very high, as the price fell to $0.02200 where it closed the month. In April the price saw an initial crash but observed sharp recovery ending the month above the $0.02600 mark. In May the price dwindled again ending the month around $0.0250. In June the price continued to struggle as it dropped to $0.0200 to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with VET crossing the $0.02800 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and VET ended the month around the $0.02200 level. In September, the price saw high volatility reaching as high as $0.0260 but failed to stay at the level and ended the month below the $0.02200 mark. In October, the price declined further and ended the month below the $0.01500 mark as bears dominated the crypto markets during the later half of the month. in November, the downtrend continued with VET ending the month below the $0.130 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|RESEARCH|VET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-12 20:00:00

The asset remains above key support levels despite recent price rejection. Resistance Blocks Further Upside Ethereum attempted to push through the $3,350 zone but failed. This area includes the 200-day moving average and a key horizontal resistance level. Since that rejection, the price action has cooled, but ETH has not broken below the recent higher lows formed in November. Daan Crypto Trades noted , “$ETH rejected from its Daily 200MA/EMA and ~$3,350 horizontal level.” He also pointed out that ETH is still outperforming much of the broader market. While momentum has slowed, the trend since November remains upward. Moreover, after breaking a descending trendline, ETH pulled back to retest it. The price action is holding just above that line, which has served as resistance since October. If it continues to hold, it could support a move higher. DonnieBTC commented that ETH is “ retesting the trend line ” and appears “ ready for a new bounce .” The next resistance sits in the $3,600 to $3,800 range, while immediate support is at $3,000. A higher low near this level would likely confirm that the uptrend is still valid. Ethereum (ETH) Price Chart 12.12. Source: DonnieBTC/X Past Pattern Repeats? ETH’s recent 47% pullback matches a similar decline from mid-2024. That correction was followed by a strong move upward. A new weekly chart comparison from CryptoWZRD suggests the two structures are nearly identical in both size and timing. A similar recovery now would echo the late 2024 rally. In addition, CryptoWZRD stated that ETH closed indecisively in the daily candle, and ETHBTC was weak. Resistance and support levels are identified at 3,700 and 2,800, respectively. “Further upside from ETHBTC is needed and will depend on a decline in Bitcoin Dominance.” Meanwhile, Ethereum’s social sentiment shifted after the recent Fed rate decision. Initial excitement around a rate cut faded quickly as ETH pulled back. However, data from CryptoQuant shows early signs of buyer activity returning. Analyst Maartunn noted , “ Net Taker Volume is still negative at –$138M ,” though it has improved from October, when it reached –$500M. Exchange data also shows modest inflows into ETH spot ETFs after weeks of outflows. Glassnode reported early signs of recovery, with demand appearing to stabilize. These inflows suggest that some investors are positioning for strength as the year ends.

Price action, liquidity data, and macro forces are aligning in a way that demands attention. Traders sense uncertainty, yet the chart structure shows a narrow path that could define the next major trend. Every monthly close now carries weight, and ignoring it could prove costly. In a detailed video analysis shared on X, STEPH IS CRYPTO broke down this turning point with unusual clarity. His observations form the backbone of this report. After the first mention, he will be referred to as Steph. The $2 Monthly Level Is the Decisive Pivot. XRP is sitting directly on the $2 monthly zone. That level marked the 2017 cycle peak. It now acts as a major point of control. A monthly close below $2 would expose deeper support levels . The next major zone sits near $1.60. That level served as a key monthly rejection area in 2021. A deeper breakdown could extend toward $0.70, which acted as strong resistance in 2023. Yet, if XRP holds above $2, bullish momentum can recover quickly. #XRP : DON’T SAY YOU WEREN’T WARNED… pic.twitter.com/HVn0JvrP6G — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 12, 2025 Momentum Indicators Are Sending Conflicting Signals Steph notes a powerful weekly bullish signal. The weekly stochastic RSI has fully bottomed out. Historically, that setup produced strong rallies in XRP. However, the monthly MACD has flipped bearish. Previous bearish monthly crosses led to extended downside periods. This creates a mixed environment. The market may bounce soon, but could face a larger correction after that move. Liquidity Above Price Suggests a Future Short Squeeze The liquidation heat map shows huge liquidity above $3. Those levels include billions in leveraged positions. Markets often move toward heavy liquidity to trigger liquidations. A squeeze could unfold if buying pressure lifts the price above $2.21.

Once reclaimed, the structure shifts from defensive to constructive. Yet, until that occurs, the market remains vulnerable. Market Interest Is at a Yearly Low Search activity for XRP has dropped sharply. Retail interest sits at yearly lows. Steph emphasizes that low interest often marks major accumulation periods. Crowds typically return only after price rallies. Market history supports this pattern. Low interest can signal a developing bottom, not a final collapse. Macro Conditions Add Another Layer The Federal Reserve delivered a 25 basis-point cut . The Fed also announced $40 billion in Treasury bill purchases. Officials stressed that these buys are technical operations, not full quantitative easing. Still, additional liquidity can support risk assets. Crypto markets often respond to liquidity changes before other sectors. What Comes Next for XRP The monthly close remains the central trigger. A close above $2 keeps bullish hopes alive. A close below that level opens the door toward $1.60. Trend confirmation requires a break above $2.21. Until then, caution matters. Steph’s warning is clear. Watch the levels. Trust the data. Avoid emotional judgment. XRP is approaching a decisive moment. The chart will reveal the next direction soon.
