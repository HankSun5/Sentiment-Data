Related Reading: Upcoming Crypto Market Structure Bill Markup Likely Pushed To Post-Holiday As traders react to mixed Federal Reserve messaging, institutional flows, and rising caution across risk markets, analysts remain split on whether Bitcoin’s latest consolidation represents stability, or a deeper shift in how the asset behaves. Analysts Question Whether the Cycle Has Ended A growing number of major firms now argue that Bitcoin may be moving beyond its historic halving-driven rhythm. Investment firm Bernstein said in a recent note that the asset is in an “elongated bull cycle,” pointing to minimal ETF outflows despite a nearly 30% correction. The firm has raised its 2026 price target to $150,000, projecting a potential cycle peak of $200,000 in 2027 and maintaining a $1 million long-term estimate for 2033. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood echoed this view, saying that institutional adoption is reducing the likelihood of the steep 75–90% drawdowns seen in previous cycles. Grayscale has also suggested Bitcoin could break the four-year pattern, forecasting renewed strength in 2026. Bitcoin is currently trading near $90,000–$93,000 depending on the venue, with recent intraday swings highlighting a lack of strong directional conviction. Fed Signals Keep Markets Cautious The Federal Reserve’s 25 bps rate cut initially lifted risk sentiment, but a shift toward cautious, data-dependent language quickly reversed momentum. Bitcoin and Ethereum slipped after the announcement, with BTC falling below $90,000 at one point as traders reassessed the macro backdrop. Liquidity remains thin, contributing to choppy movements across major crypto assets. Analysts note that Bitcoin’s inability to sustain gains, despite the weaker dollar and softer Fed stance, reflects persistent uncertainty. Several commentators say BTC must hold above $90,000 to avoid strengthening bearish pressure, while a break above $94,500 could reopen a path toward $100,000 if inflows improve. Derivatives and On-Chain Data Flag Rising Bearish Sentiment Options and on-chain indicators are also signaling caution. Traders have increased bearish option positions, with the put/call ratio turning positive ahead of a significant expiry window. More than $500 million in crypto liquidations occurred within 24 hours, reflecting heightened volatility. On-chain data shows declining bullish momentum. The Bitcoin Bull Score Index has fallen back to zero, and realized losses suggest further downside could be possible. Analysts warn that despite past buy-the-dip patterns, current readings do not yet reflect the levels typically associated with market bottoms.

The project’s initial phase sold out its allotment of 10 million tokens and secured $500,000 in funding. This early success has only grown, with total sales now climbing past 23 million tokens and funds raised exceeding $1 million from a strong community of over 2,400 investors . As a fully-featured non-custodial ecosystem, GeeFi is proving its utility, and analysts forecast that Phase 3 will be fully subscribed in under 10 days due to ongoing talk of major exchange listings. An Answer to Avalanche’s Congestion Problems While Avalanche (AVAX) faces challenges with network congestion and performance during periods of high activity, investors are shifting their attention to more reliable and user-centric platforms. This search has led many to discover GeeFi , a project that a growing chorus of experts is labeling 2026’s 100x gem . It offers a single, cohesive dashboard for overseeing digital funds across more than 14 networks , letting users swap tokens and move between chains without the usual technical difficulties. This comprehensive system solves a major fragmentation issue for crypto holders. The GeeFi Team , which started development in 2023, prioritized having a working product ready for its 2024 public launch. In contrast to many projects that debut with only a concept, GeeFi presented a functional platform before asking for public funds. Its architecture guarantees users maintain full authority over their private keys, putting security first. With the Android app live and an iOS version on the horizon, GeeFi is demonstrating its dedication to real-world progress, which strengthens the forecast that it is 2026’s 100x gem . The Strategic Power of the GeeFi Presale GeeFi is currently in the second phase of its presale, with tokens offered at the accessible price of $0.06 . This price point ensures early investors a guaranteed 667% return , based on the established $0.40 listing price . The potential for financial growth is massive; a $1,800 investment at this stage could become $90,000 if the token achieves the analysts’ $3 valuation target, representing an astonishing 4,900% ROI . The market’s reaction to the presale has been exceptionally positive. The quick completion of Phase 1 has fueled Phase 2, which is now more than 80% sold out . This stage alone has drawn over $750K from the sale of 13 million tokens . Industry specialists predict Phase 3 will begin next week and conclude swiftly as excitement builds around GeeFi’s expected debut on leading exchanges. This powerful demand reinforces its standing as 2026’s 100x gem . Earn High Returns via Staking and Community Referrals A key element drawing investors to GeeFi is its rewarding staking program. Participants can generate significant passive income through various flexible options. By locking their tokens, users can secure 15% APR for one month , 22% APR for three months , or a top-tier 55% APR for a 12-month period . For those who need constant access to their capital, a liquid option provides returns up to 10% with no lock-up requirement . To further amplify community growth, GeeFi includes a valuable referral system. By sharing a personal link, users get a 5% bonus in GEE tokens on every purchase made through their network. This structure incentivizes organic expansion and helps early backers multiply their holdings efficiently. These income-generating tools make the project a compelling choice for investors focused on portfolio optimization. A Final Opportunity for a Ground-Floor Investment Chances to invest in a project with such strong utility before it gains mainstream recognition are often brief. GeeFi’s presale is a limited-time event to get involved before the general market takes notice. With its deflationary tokenomics, a working product, and a development plan that includes a crypto debit card, GeeFi is positioned to become a key player in the industry. The rapid sales rate is a clear indicator of strong market belief. As the industry gets ready for its next growth cycle, projects with solid fundamentals are expected to outperform. Overlooking GeeFi now could lead to major regret when the token is listed on major exchanges, validating the prediction that it is 2026’s 100x gem . The time to act is now. Securing your allocation is the best way to leverage the extraordinary growth that experts are forecasting.

55660933,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=865747,1765494048,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/55660933.jpeg,Solana Hits Critical Demand Zone — Is A Surprise Bottom Loading?,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-critical-demand-zone/,"Solana has slipped into a crucial demand zone between $118 and $138, a region where buyers must prove they’re still in the game. Early reactions are emerging, but momentum remains weak, raising the big question: Is SOL preparing for one more leg down, or could a surprise bottom quietly be forming beneath the surface? Solana Slides Into A Critical Support Zone Crypto analyst More Crypto Online, in an update shared on X, revealed that SOL has recently dropped into a major support band. This crucial zone stretches from $118 up to roughly $138.30. The analyst emphasizes that this is the exact region where the market must definitively prove that robust demand is still present to prevent further structural decline. Related Reading: Solana Price Faces Critical Test Near $140 While Analysts Track KOL Indicators and Liquidity Shifts While examining the smallest timeframes, the analyst noted that there are indeed early attempts at a reaction developing within this broad support band. However, the expert warns that these reactions currently lack conviction and do not yet display the sustained buying strength necessary to signal a durable reversal. More Crypto Online includes a more bullish possibility, which he labels the “white scenario,” where the broader B-wave correction could finish at any point within this current support region. If successfully confirmed, it would effectively establish a definitive low and open the door for Solana to rechallenge its previous cycle highs by initiating a powerful C-wave rally. However, the core problem preventing a definitive bullish call is that the recovery observed from the recent swing low has not exhibited the characteristics of an impulsive advance. As long as that remains the case, the analyst concludes that a deeper dip is the more realistic path, cautioning traders to prepare for a potential test of levels below the current support range. A–B–C Correction Still In Play For Solana According to More Crypto Online, Solana’s price action continues to mirror the broader structure seen on Bitcoin. The ongoing decline can still be viewed as an A–B–C corrective pattern within the orange scenario, with the final C wave unfolding as a five-legged move. If this interpretation holds, the last leg of the correction still has room to extend further, potentially reaching the $81 to $90 zone. Related Reading: Reversal Loading? Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Build Powerful High-Time-Frame Structures The analyst noted that the current upswing resembles an internal wave 4 rally. Under this outlook, the market could still produce one more low, completing the final leg of the corrective wave before a more reliable reversal structure begins to form. Solana now sits at a key decision point, but the Elliott Wave framework indicates that bearish pressure may not be fully exhausted. Until the structure confirms a shift with impulsive upward movement, the chart still allows for another push lower before a durable trend change can develop.

Manche has pledged $100 million to support blockchain founders. Founders familiar with and trusted by the Nyx Group are the only individuals eligible for Rushi Manche’s $100 million support initiative. He indicated that additional information about the partners would be shared soon. What is Rushi Manche doing now? Former Movement Labs co-founder Rushi Manche has made a reappearance in the crypto industry with Nyx Group, a multi-strategy investment initiative. Nyx Group announced in an official statement that it plans to deploy up to $100 million into liquid markets while offering operational support to token-launching project founders. The initiative brings together multiple partners and family offices, but Manche has not yet disclosed the specific backers. The investment group aims to address what Manche describes as a critical gap in the current crypto landscape, where founders have limited access to capital during challenging market conditions. Nyx Group will also offer hands-on support to help founders secure capital, attract investors, set up their foundations, and connect with key partners. “Crypto is entering a new chapter rife with opportunity and uncertainty,” Manche said in the announcement. “Nyx Group aims to match founders we know and trust with the funds and hands-on counsel they need to bring important, transformative tokens and projects to life.” How will Nyx Group invest its $100M fund? Nyx Group explained that investments will be limited to founders the team knows personally and deeply trusts. The group will also only back founders building projects that add value through community-oriented initiatives or technological innovation. Manche claims that Nyx Group has already been operating for a few months and has made some initial investments, but he didn’t provide specific details. Investment decisions are made by committee, and the group is reportedly focusing on founders backed by reputable funds or showing traction in areas like revenue, active users, and community strength. Manche emphasized this approach reflects the type of support he wished he had during his own entrepreneurial journey. Nyx Group is also considering taking governance positions, foundation roles, or board seats in supported projects. Before Nyx Group, Manche was booted from Movement Labs, the blockchain infrastructure startup he co-founded with fellow Vanderbilt University dropout, Cooper Scanlon. Movement Labs suspended co-founder Rushi Manche while it investigated allegations of organizational governance in May 2025 after Coinbase delisted the MOVE token. The scandal involved 66 million MOVE tokens that were dumped on the market in December 2024, which resulted in $38 million in profits for a market maker called Rentech. Coinbase suspended trading of the MOVE token after it was reported that a market maker had been involved in a token dump. At the time, CoinDesk reported that it had seen evidence that shadow advisers received large token allocations as part of questionable agreements with Movement Labs, citing internal documents it reviewed. Cryptopolitan previously reported that the scandal exposed chaotic internal operations and raised questions about governance and oversight. Movement Labs hired blockchain intelligence firm Groom Lake to conduct a third-party review of the situation. The fallout damaged Movement Labs’ reputation significantly, and the company’s MOVE token saw its price tumble by 23% to an all-time low of $0.18 at the time, following the Coinbase delisting announcement. The token has since lost over 70% of its value from its all-time high. Movement Labs first suspended Manche in May before it eventually let him go on May 7. The company announced it would continue under different leadership, rebranding as Move Industries with Torab Torabi as CEO and Will Gaines as president.

Speaking on Bloomberg’s The Mishal Husain Show, Mustafa vowed that Microsoft’s focus is building super intelligence aligned with human interests, not chasing raw power at any cost. “We won’t continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us,” Mustafa said during the interview. He added that this stance should not be controversial, calling it an obvious position, even though he believes it is still rare across the AI industry. Microsoft regains freedom to build advanced AI systems Mustafa joined Microsoft early last year after the company acquired the intellectual property and much of the team behind his startup, Inflection AI after abandoning OpenAI for consumer-facing AI tools. After the acquisition, Mustafa was tasked with building products that could compete directly with the strongest models already on the market. For much of that time, his work came with limits. Contractual terms tied to Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI blocked the company from developing artificial general intelligence, defined as systems that can perform at human level, as well as superintelligence, which would surpass human abilities. Mustafa said Microsoft gave up those rights in exchange for access to OpenAI’s latest models. That arrangement also involved Microsoft building and equipping data centers for OpenAI over several years. That structure changed in October.A new deal reshaped the relationship and returned development rights to Microsoft. Mustafa said OpenAI now has infrastructure agreements with other partners, including SoftBank and Oracle, to build more data centers than Microsoft was willing to commit. “They now have deals with SoftBank and many others – Oracle – to build more data centers than Microsoft wanted to build for them,” he said. “And so, in return, we then have the right to go develop our own AI.” He said Microsoft has remained a general-purpose AI developer over the past 18 months but is now moving into work that could exceed human performance across tasks. “We’ve still been a general-purpose AI development shop over the last 18 months, but now we can work on some techniques and methodologies that have the potential to exceed human performance at all tasks,” Mustafa said . “And so, it is a shift for us.” Suleyman outlines cautious approach as tools remain unfinished Last month, Mustafa had formally announced the superintelligence effort in a blog post that laid out Microsoft’s position that such systems must be designed to serve people. Other major players, including OpenAI and Anthropic PBC, often make similar claims about safety and human benefit. “Everybody has to decide what they stand for and how they operate, and I don’t want to judge how they’re operating right now,” he said. “I don’t see any evidence of large-scale mass harm.” Despite the long-term focus on superintelligence, Mustafa said the current debate remains academic. Consumers expect assistants that can handle tasks like booking tickets or organizing shopping plans. Executives expect productivity gains. Neither group is fully there yet. Mustafa pointed to Microsoft’s Copilot consumer assistant as proof.He said its agent-like features are still being tested and do not always perform as intended. “We’re still experimenting with it,” said Mustafa. “But when it does work, it is the most magical thing you’ve ever seen.” Don’t just read crypto news.

DOGE’s current price means that it’s now down by 7.5% in a week and by 22% in a month, while the meme token – the tenth-biggest coin in the market – has suffered a 65% decline in a year. However, while the past couple of months have been negative for DOGE and for the wider market, Dogecoin has plenty of things to look forward to on a more fundamental level, including the arrival of a bridge with Solana. Psy Protocol will unveil this bridge for the first time at this week’s DogeCon, an event which has very positive implications for the Dogecoin Price Prediction , in the short- and long-term. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Dogecoin–Solana Integration Announced – Is This the Biggest Partnership of 2025? First announced in May, Psy Protocol’s Solana-Dogecoin bridge will use DOGE’s proof-of-work consensus as its underlying validation layer, something which Psy Protocol says will make it one of the most secure bridges in crypto. (2/4) Bridge hacks have cost crypto users over $2.8B. Psy’s solution? Trustlessly validating Dogecoin's PoW consensus on Solana and leveraging the @wormhole guardian network to ensure safe, fast and user friendly bridging between chains. — Psy Protocol (@PsyProtocol) May 22, 2025 At the same time, the bridge will enable Dogecoin holders to deploy their DOGE on Solana, making use of the latter’s speed and DeFi ecosystem. While it hasn’t yet launched, Psy Protocol will show it off for the first time at DogeCon, and its eventual launch could be a massive boost for the Dogecoin price going forward. It would certainly benefit from a boost right about now, given how much the market has oversold in recent weeks and months. As we see from its chart, October, November, and the start of December have been largely negative for the token, making a rebound likelier. This is what its relative strength index (yellow) tells us, since its recovery above 50 is now long overdue. Source: TradingView At the same time, we see that the Dogecoin price has been trading within an increasingly narrow pennant, and that this pennant is about to converge. This could mean that we’re about to see a breakout, potentially one that may come in time for the traditional festive-season bull rally. Not only is the market overdue for a big rally, but Dogecoin has lots to recommend it, and not just the forthcoming bridge with Solana. Recent weeks have also welcomed the launch of several DOGE ETFs , widening potential institutional investment in the token. As such, the coin could be in for a massive 2026, ending the year at around $0.20 and reaching $0.40 by Q1 of next year. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Reaches $29.3 Million: Is This L2 the Next Big Thing?

The biggest presale happening at the moment belongs to Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a new layer-two network for Bitcoin . $HYPER is Unstoppable. 29M Raised! https://t.co/VNG0P4GuDo pic.twitter.com/51TU5mrGJK — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) December 5, 2025 It has raised a hugely impressive $29.3 million in its ongoing sale, which continues to grow from strength to strength. This is a massive sign of confidence in the new project, which is aiming to tap into the enormous value of Bitcoin, enabling BTC holders to use their coins for DeFi and other purposes. On a technical level, it makes use of Solana’s Virtual Machine, providing superior speed and scalability. On top of this, it also employs zero-knowledge proofs, which offer a high level of privacy and security. This makes it one of the most technically capable L2s in crypto, explaining why its presale has taken off so quickly. Its native token HYPER will be necessary to pay for transaction fees, which will be competitively low. Even so, the need for HYPER could see the coin’s price rise steadily over time, especially as adoption of the L2 grows. Investors can join its sale by going to the official Bitcoin Hyper website , where the token is currently selling at $0.013405. This price will rise again later today, so newcomers should move quickly if they want to buy this intriguing new token at the lowest possible price.

According to White House data , total U.S. retirement assets reached $43.4 trillion as of March 31, 2025, yet most savers remain blocked from accessing alternative investments. Lawmakers contend that permitting measured allocations into these assets could improve risk-adjusted returns and bring retirement investment strategies into the modern era. Industry experts view this policy evolution as a pivotal moment for Bitcoin’s integration into traditional finance. Analysts calculate that even minimal allocations, ranging from 1–3%, from retirement funds could generate tens of billions in fresh buying pressure, potentially driving BTC to record highs. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Technical Setup Shows Mid-Cycle Correction The weekly chart reveals Bitcoin retreating from the substantial $100,000–$108,000 resistance zone after failing to maintain support above it, creating a distinct mid-cycle pullback. Price currently hovers around $90,000, positioned just above the critical long-term weekly support near $76,000, which represents the essential structural foundation for preserving the broader uptrend. The MACD remains deep in bearish territory but is starting to flatten, suggesting downside momentum may be weakening after months of selling pressure. Source: TradingView If Bitcoin can recapture the $100,000–$108,000 region and subsequently break through the next major pivot at $116,000 , the chart structure supports continuation of the bull run toward the projected target around $131,000. This Presale Raised $2.3M – Is Pepenode the Next PEPE? If Bitcoin starts going up again and people begin putting their retirement money into crypto, meme coins like Pepenode (PEPENODE) could see big price jumps. Pepenode is a new crypto project that’s already raised over $2.3 million, even though the market has been tough. It’s a game where you can “mine” coins without needing any expensive computer equipment. You play the game in your web browser, set up virtual mining nodes , and upgrade your facilities to earn more tokens. The project is trying to copy the success of PEPE, another meme coin that went up over 1,000 times in value during 2023-24. As more people start buying Pepenode’s mining rig, the token price is expected to go up quickly. To join the presale before the price increases, go to the official Pepenode website and connect a crypto wallet like Best Wallet . You can buy tokens right now for $0.001192 each and can pay with crypto coins like ETH, BNB, or USDT. You can also use a regular credit or debit card to make your purchase in just seconds.

The U.S. Senate is advancing comprehensive legislation to govern cryptocurrency law, as well as other pieces of legislation, to clarify regulatory oversight and address gaps in current regulations, including the GENIUS Act . Rapid developments in the field of digital assets, particularly stablecoins and decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, have put investors at risk, and lawmakers are determining which cryptocurrencies fall under the jurisdiction of the SEC versus the CFTC. The Senate is making progress on a major crypto bill On Thursday, the South Carolina Republican met with Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, Citi CEO Jane Fraser, and Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf. The team discussed the landmark legislation , which aims to establish comprehensive rules for the digital asset industry and assign regulatory authority to bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. “We are making real progress toward passing digital asset market structure legislation that will help cement America’s role as the crypto capital of the world,” Scott said in a statement on Thursday. “For months, my colleagues and I on the Senate Banking Committee have received valuable feedback from across the banking and crypto industries.” The three banking CEOs were scheduled to meet with senators this week to discuss proposed legislation regarding cryptocurrencies. According to a source familiar with the meetings, two separate meetings, one with Democrats and another with Republicans, were called “cordial.” The discussions covered topics including yield, decentralised finance, and anti-money laundering concerns, among others, according to the person familiar. Banks raise concerns about gaps in the GENIUS Act Yield-generating crypto assets, particularly stablecoins, have been a significant obstacle to passing a comprehensive crypto market structure bill. Banking associations argue that the stablecoin bill passed last summer, known as the GENIUS Act, has gaps that need to be addressed. They argue that the law’s limits on stablecoin issuers paying interest to holders are too weak, which could make these assets more attractive as stores of value and credit instruments than as payment tools, potentially creating “distorting market incentives” for banks, they said. The groups also contend that the GENIUS Act’s restrictions can be easily circumvented by exchanges, brokers, and other affiliated entities. Lawmakers are rushing to pass a bill regulating the crypto industry into law. Over the summer, the House passed its version of a market structure bill, known as the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, or Clarity for short, with bipartisan support. The Senate has since begun efforts to pass a comparable bill. Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott’s panel has drafted legislation that aims to divide regulatory authority between the SEC and the CFTC, introducing a new category called “ancillary assets” to clarify which cryptocurrencies are not considered securities. Meanwhile, the Senate Agriculture Committee released its own bill last month, which would expand the CFTC’s authority. Both committee drafts would need to be reconciled before moving forward. In the past few days, Democratic and Republican senators have met to negotiate certain provisions of the bill, but the talks appear shaky. Some lawmakers are seeking to advance the bill and move it through the Senate Banking Committee before the end of the year, but it remains unclear whether this will happen.

Since XRP is priced near $2, acquiring 1,000 units requires an investment of roughly $2,000. The question many investors ask is what price level XRP would need to reach for such a position to be worth $1 million, and whether any realistic long-term pathway makes that outcome achievable. Understanding the Required Price Level For a portfolio of 1,000 XRP to reach a value of $1 million, the asset would need to appreciate to $1,000 per coin. This figure forms the basis of several long-range forecasts shared by well-known community commentators such as BarriC and JackTheRippler . Their arguments typically reference the possibility of XRP becoming a core instrument for settlement operations, large-scale liquidity management, and global value transfer mechanisms. At this price point, a $2,000 investment today would experience gains exceeding 49,000 percent. While critics associate such projections with unrealistic expectations, supporters argue that other digital assets have produced outcomes that seemed unlikely in their early years. Long-Term Forecasts That Outline a Possible Path Multiple research groups and market analysts have issued long-term estimates that, while not uniform, indicate a consistent upward trajectory for XRP. Data-driven projections from Changelly position the asset near the $115 range between 2033 and 2034. This level remains well below the $1,000 threshold, but it suggests ongoing positive momentum over the next decade. Other forecasts extend beyond that period. Telegaon’s previous long-term model estimated that XRP could approach $285 around 2050. Under such circumstances, 1,000 XRP would be valued at $285,000, a considerable increase despite falling short of the million-dollar mark. Some analysts offer more ambitious scenarios. Matthew Brienen, the Chief Operating Officer at CryptoGuard, has outlined a model in which XRP could reach $1,000 by 2035. His position centers on the expectation that the asset may become integrated into large-scale financial infrastructure, particularly in areas related to institutional settlement channels and tokenized liquidity frameworks. If such integration occurs, the value of 1,000 XRP would exceed $1 million. These projections depend heavily on adoption trends, regulatory developments, and broader market conditions. They do not function as guarantees, but they outline potential outcomes based on long-term structural assumptions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Historical Comparisons and Their Limitations Supporters of the $1,000 target often compare XRP’s potential to earlier growth patterns observed in other major crypto assets. Bitcoin advanced from fractions of a cent to above $126,000. Ethereum moved from below $1 to nearly $5,000, and Solana rose from under $1 to approximately $260 during peak periods. These increases were driven by expanding use cases, structural improvements, and rising demand. Advocates contend that XRP could experience a similar rise if it becomes widely adopted for institutional transactions and large-scale digital value transfer. Ripple’s corporate initiatives, including multibillion-dollar investments in 2025, are frequently cited as supportive factors. However, critics raise supply concerns. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, which have significantly smaller circulating supplies, XRP has a maximum supply close to 100 billion tokens. A price of $1,000 per XRP would imply a market capitalization nearing $100 trillion. For comparison, Bitcoin’s market cap at its peak remained below $4 trillion. Even at $1 million per Bitcoin, its projected market cap would be under $21 trillion. This contrast forms the core objection to the $1,000 XRP scenario . The possibility of turning 1,000 XRP into $1 million depends on whether XRP can reach a four-digit valuation. Analysts remain divided, with some highlighting long-term structural strengths and others noting significant supply-based limitations. While future adoption and regulatory clarity will play critical roles in determining the asset’s trajectory, the debate underscores the broader uncertainty surrounding long-term valuation models in the digital asset sector.

Bitcoin is also down by 2% today, while Ethereum has declined by 3.5%, Solana by 4.5%, and Cardano by a hefty 10%. These are disappointing falls, yet the market remains as strong fundamentally as it was in January, suggesting that a rebound must be imminent. We’ve therefore chosen our best new meme coin to buy today under $0.01, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , which has the potential to outpace the market when it lists in under a month. Best New Meme Coin to Buy Today Under $0.01 – 11 December PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) is an Ethereum-based token that opened its presale in late September and has since gone on to raise over $2.3 million . This sale has proven increasingly popular in recent weeks, yet it has now entered its home stretch, with only 28 days until it ends and the coin lists. Even the pickaxe is festive. This season the best present is a levelled up virtual mining rig. https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/BRg3lVom3u — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) December 11, 2025 It has attracted investors for one simple reason: it’s launching an innovative mining platform that will make mining more accessible to average investors. Instead of requiring investment in expensive mining hardware (not to mention the large facilities to house such hardware), it enables users to build virtual mining rigs. Users can run their virtual rigs to earn mining rewards in external tokens such as Fartcoin and Pepe, while they can use PEPENODE tokens to buy more nodes. And by acquiring and upgrading more nodes, they can increase their rewards, while users also have the option to sell their nodes when they no longer need them. Because the PEPENODE token is necessary to grow mining rigs, it could attract substantial demand, pushing its price up massively over time. Holders can also stake it for a passive income, with its protocol currently providing a yield of 558% APY . This means that PEPENODE could be one of the most lucrative new coins to own once it launches in just under a month. PEPENODE Launch Could Coincide with Xmas and New Year Rally While there isn’t long left until the PEPENODE sale ends, investors can still join it by going to the project’s official website. There, they can connect a compatible wallet (e.g., Best Wallet) and use ETH, USDT, BNB, or fiat to buy any desired amount of the token. It’s selling at its final presale price of $0.001192, although its popularity would suggest that it could eclipse this level once it lists on exchanges. It has a max supply of 210 billion PEPENODE, with 5% of this total reserved for node rewards. And while the market remains subdued today, a festive rally could coincide nicely with the coin’s launch, helping it to surge on trading platforms.

The decision opens the door for the exchange to begin offering regulated prediction markets in the United States. Gemini Titan Debuts in Prediction Markets The launch marks Gemini’s first entry into the fast-growing event-contracts sector, where traders buy and sell binary “yes or no” positions tied to future outcomes. Gemini, which first filed for a DCM license in March 2020, had not previously disclosed that the application would form the basis of a standalone prediction-market platform. US customers will initially access the contracts through Gemini’s website using existing USD balances, and mobile access is expected to follow. The move places Gemini in a competitive field led by Kalshi and Polymarket, platforms that saw trading volumes surge during last year’s US election cycle and continue climbing since President Donald Trump took office. The sector has been shaped by years of cautious CFTC oversight, including enforcement actions such as the earlier ban on Polymarket and tight restrictions on political-themed markets. A recent legal win by Kalshi against the CFTC over event-contract listings has widened the regulatory pathway for platforms seeking to expand into categories such as sports and economic forecasting. Gemini’s CEO, Tyler Winklevoss, thanked Trump for “ending the Biden Administration’s war” on the sector and added that “it’s incredibly refreshing and invigorating to have a President and a financial regulator who are pro crypto, pro innovation, and pro America.” Meanwhile, the exchange’s President Cameron Winklevoss said, “Prediction markets have the potential to be as big or bigger than traditional capital markets. Acting Chairman Pham understands this vision and its importance. Unlike her predecessor, Acting Chairman Pham has positioned the CFTC as a pro-business, pro-innovation regulator that will allow America to lead in these new and exciting markets.” The official press release also revealed that Gemini Titan may later broaden its derivatives offerings to include crypto futures, options, and perpetual contracts, products widely traded in Asia but historically limited in the United States due to regulatory hurdles. CFTC Warms Up to Prediction Markets Prediction markets are gaining momentum in Washington as the CFTC, now led by Acting Chair Caroline Pham under Trump’s second term, has taken a more welcoming approach to the sector. In October, CryptoPotato reported that Trump Media and Technology Group said it would launch a prediction market inside Truth Social through an exclusive partnership with Crypto.com. The new feature, called Truth Predict, will let users trade contracts on elections, inflation moves, commodity prices, and sports results. Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek said the industry could grow into a “multi-deca-billion-dollar” market.

Investors have widely written off the altcoin since system instability triggered a hyperinflation-driven collapse in 2022, but major reforms may put it past that era. The December 8 launch of the LUNA v2.18 upgrade introduced stronger security features, tighter Cosmos interoperability, and a reinforced link between LUNA and USTC. These changes created a fundamental backdrop for the surge, directly addressing issues that contributed to the original breakdown. And with, since the start of the month, LUNA is up 222%. Today’s court hearing for Terra co-founder Do Kwon has added a social catalyst, with headlines around a potential sentencing pushing fresh attention toward the coin.

The court weighs a 12-year bid from prosecutors vs. a 5-year cap sought by the defense. pic.twitter.com/43sBzyqDn2 — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) December 11, 2025 Still, many market participants attribute the rally to short-term speculative flows rather than improving fundamentals, raising doubts about how durable the uptrend really is. Terra Luna Price Prediction: Can the Comeback Last? The rally affirms the lower boundary of a three-year descending channel pattern, a proven launchpad throughout LUNA’s post-crash consolidation. With that confirmation, eyes are turning back to a potential breakout as the upper resistance trendline comes into view and momentum indicators show room for further upside. LUNA USD 1-day chart, descending channel. Source: TradingView . The RSI sits at 63, yet to reach the 70 overbought threshold that often marks local tops, while the MACD strengthens its bullish posture with a widening gap above the signal line. The key breakout threshold sits at a past demand zone around the $0.357 0.382 Fib retracement. Flipping this level to support could open the door to a potential 1,000% rally toward $2. The interim $0.246 0.236 retracement remains immediate resistance, capping today’s advance. still, the sudden and sharp spike in both momentum indicators could commemorate a rally driven by speculation rather than a long-term positioning, opening the door to downside volatility. If long-term holders decide to take profit, a shakeout of weak hands could trigger a 70% slide back to the $0.0665 support and potentially expose lower lows. New PEPENODE Presale Lets Users Mine Meme Coins with No Hardware With volatile coins like Terra Luna swinging between rallies and crashes, timing the market can feel like a losing game, especially for meme coin investors.

The collapse wiped out an estimated $50 billion in market value within three days and triggered a chain of events that reshaped the digital-asset sector. The sentence, issued by District Judge Paul Engelmeyer of the Southern District of New York, exceeded the 12-year term recommended by prosecutors and was higher than the five-year sentence sought by Kwon’s legal team. Under federal rules, Kwon must serve at least half of the imposed term before he may request a transfer to South Korea, where he faces additional charges. Court reviews evidence and impact of Terra’s failure The sentencing was the result of an extended hearing, which involved the testimony of the victims, face-to-face and by phone, explaining the financial impact on individuals and families as a result of the breakdown of Terra. Judge Engelmeyer considered those testimonies with the guilty pleas that Kwon had already signed. In August, Do Kwon was found guilty of one count of conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, securities fraud, and wire fraud, as well as one count of wire fraud, in connection with the business of Terraform Labs. At a hearing of his plea, he admitted to being involved in an active conspiracy to defraud buyers of the UST stablecoin. The collapse of Terraform Labs marked the first major event in the broader crypto meltdown of 2022. The collapse of the company led to a series of market tensions, including mass liquidations, that contributed to the November 2022 FTX implosion. Plea deal reduced charges but did not limit the judge’s decision Do Kwon was initially charged with nine counts and faced a maximum sentence of 135 years to serve if found guilty on all counts. In a plea bargain agreed upon in the summer, the prosecutors reduced the charges to two counts with a maximum aggregate sentence of 25 years. According to the agreement, prosecutors were required to consent to recommending a term of 12 years’ imprisonment and assist Kwon in seeking an international prison transfer to South Korea upon completion of half of his American jail term. Judge Engelmeyer enquired about what such a pre-sentencing transfer means. According to court documents, he enquired about what guarantees there should be that Kwon would not be released prematurely in case he was sent back to South Korea. He also inquired with the prosecutors and defence counsel whether Kwon was still being charged in South Korea and whether the time spent abroad should be counted against his federal sentence. In a written response submitted on Wednesday, the prosecutors said they did not have any specifics about the ongoing proceedings in South Korea but confirmed that authorities there had indicated that Kwon would disagree with the charges. In the filing, the Bureau of Prisons indicated that Kwon would receive credit for the time he had served in Montenegro after the four months related to a different conviction concerning a passport.

According to data from Artemis, Stellar operations spiked in early December, pointing to growing real-world adoption. With both projects sharing similar use cases and institutional interest rising, XRP may soon escape its range-bound pattern and reclaim upside momentum. TThe metric tracks the total volume of payments moving across the Stellar blockchain, which is designed to streamline cross-border transactions using its native XLM token and stablecoins like USDC. XRP directly competes in this space with a nearly identical mission, though it currently commands a much larger market cap. Ripple, the company behind XRP, has also made major strides in global expansion by securing key regulatory licenses in jurisdictions like Dubai, Singapore, and the US. These licenses allow Ripple to offer compliant off-ramp services to enterprises looking to move money internationally using blockchain infrastructure. XRP Price Prediction: Break Above $2.20 Will Signal the Beginning of XRP’s Next Leg Up In the past 24 hours, XRP has retreated by 2.4% but continues to stay above the critical $2 threshold following yesterday’s widely awaited interest rate decision by the Federal Reserve. Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that XRP has been trading relatively range-bound in the past few days, bouncing up and down between the $2 and $2.20 zone. If XRP decisively breaks out of this range, this could mean that XRP is getting ready to move to higher highs before the year ends. Positive on-chain metrics on Stellar could be a “canary in the coal mine” signal that altcoins are about to explode. While XRP battles it out in the highly regulated cross-border payments arena, a more accessible opportunity is quietly gaining momentum. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a fast-growing crypto presale , has already raised millions to build a next-gen Layer-2 network for Bitcoin using Solana-based tech. It’s an early-stage opportunity that anyone can join, with the potential to ride a wave of innovation across two of crypto’s most powerful ecosystems. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Nears $30 Million Raised to Launch Its Innovative Bitcoin L2 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is an ambitious project that taps into the efficiency of the Solana blockchain to bring faster transaction speeds and lower costs to Bitcoin transactions.

55664723,643792,1765497630,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55664723.jpeg,Dogecoin Barely Blinks As Musk Confirms X Money Is Running Internally,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-musk-confirms-x-money-internally/,"Elon Musk has confirmed that X’s long-promised payments layer, X Money, is already running inside the company — but Dogecoin, his on-again-off-again favorite meme coin, has barely twitched. Replying to developer and X feature-watcher Nima Owji on December 10, Musk dropped a characteristically terse update: “It has been launched internally.” Within hours, promoter Mario Nawfal was broadcasting that “X MONEY IS LIVE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, PUBLIC LAUNCH NEXT,” describing the system as “quietly tested by employees and early users while the rest of the world waits for access.” It has been launched internally — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 10, 2025 The market, however, did not exactly wait breathlessly. As of press time, Dogecoin traded around $0.137, down less than 0.1% on the day — essentially noise, given an intraday range between roughly $0.137 and $0.150. For a coin that once ripped 20–30% on a single Elon meme, this is… subdued. Why Is The Dogecoin Price Not Reacting? The contrast with earlier X Money headlines is stark. When Musk first framed the payments stack as part of a broader relaunch of XChat in mid-November, he boasted that X had “just rolled out an entire new communications stack with encrypted messages, audio/video calls and file transfer,” adding pointedly: “Money comes out soon… X will be the everything app.” Dogecoin and other high-beta names squeezed higher on that story, if only briefly. Back in May, when Musk confirmed that a beta version of X Money was coming, DOGE jumped from about $0.08 to $0.09 on the announcement — a double-digit percentage move triggered by one more hint that the dog might be wired into X’s rails. Today’s non-reaction lands against a deeper build-out of X Money in the background. According to a recent job posting, X Money is hiring a technical lead to design a payments platform “from the ground up” for more than 600 million monthly users, with an emphasis on distributed systems and secure transactions. The description notably does not mention crypto or Dogecoin at all. Notably, X Money already announced a partnership with Visa earlier this year for an “X Money Account” that would fund wallets and peer-to-peer payments, while Solana figures — including ecosystem advisor Nikita Bier, now at X — have publicly signaled they are eager to help. Crucially, Musk has not exactly gone quiet on Dogecoin in general. On November 3 he posted “It’s time” on X, reviving his old promise to “put a literal Dogecoin on the literal moon” via a SpaceX mission, as reported by Bitcoinist. In mid-October he waded into the “energy money” debate, backing Bitcoin as impossible to “fake” because it is grounded in energy and then replying with an approving emoji when a Dogecoin community account insisted that “Dogecoin is also based on energy” — his “first explicit nod toward DOGE in a while,” as reported on NewsBTC . Even more recently, on October 11 and again on November 15, Musk posted Doge-coded content — a Shiba Inu mascot image, then a meme of a Shiba playing a banjo — that historically would have lit up DOGE order books. However, this time, Dogecoin’s response was muted to outright negative. In other words, the last few times Musk has talked about or referenced Dogecoin on X, the market reaction has been steadily decaying. So when he now says X Money “has been launched internally,” the absence of a pump in DOGE looks less like a mystery and more like a trend. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.13765.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-12 00:00:30

Critical On-Chain Metric Explodes Higher,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/is-dogecoin-waking-up-critical-on-chain-metric-explodes-higher/,"Dogecoin rose 4% to trade at $0.14 Thursday, according to market reports. Market capitalization was about $21 billion while 24-hour trading volume hovered near $1.6 billion. The move followed renewed on-chain activity that has drawn attention from traders and analysts. Related Reading: Institutions Scoop Up 9,000 Ether, Fueling Bullish Signals Spike In Active Wallets Based on reports from BitInfoCharts, the number of daily active addresses on the Dogecoin network jumped to over 67,500 on December 3, marking the second-highest reading in the past three months. That earlier spike on September 15 came as DOGE briefly approached a local top near $0.30. At that time, network activity rose as prices climbed; today, rising wallet activity is being watched closely as prices test a familiar zone after a long slide. Support Holding Near $0.14 Dogecoin is sitting above an important area around $0.138–$0.14, which has been tested and defended multiple times. Reports show the token has bounced off that level before, and trading volume has more than doubled during the most recent uptick, a sign that buying interest is growing. Market feeds also report mixed short-term figures: one line shows the token down by 5% in a week while another notes a 7.5% decline over the last week; those numbers do not align and highlight some reporting inconsistencies. Longer-term data show the token has lost roughly 60% over the past year and is about 50% off its recent highs. Volume And Technical Targets Traders are eyeing $0.16 as the next meaningful resistance. Based on reports, a decisive move above that zone would be the first clear break in the short-term bearish pattern. Beyond that, the 200-day exponential moving average sits as a broader target, often watched for signals that medium-term momentum has shifted. A break above the 200-day EMA would be treated by many as confirmation that a recovery could gain traction, although history shows these signals sometimes reverse quickly. Signals Are Mixed Daily active address spikes can point to rising interest. They can also reflect simple transfers, bot traffic, or wallet reshuffles by large holders. Increased volume helps the case for buyers, but active-address readings alone are not foolproof. The current setup looks like a battleground: both bulls and bears are more active than they were a few weeks ago. That activity makes the coming days important for traders who favor short-term moves.

While many market participants had anticipated a significant rally earlier in the year, the token has instead shown continued volatility. According to market data, XRP has declined both on a quarterly scale and year-to-date, contributing to growing concerns within the community. Some commentators, including Zach Rector, have argued that several developments slowed XRP’s momentum. He pointed to the prolonged legal dispute with the U.S. SEC, delays surrounding the introduction of XRP exchange-traded products, and the absence of regulatory clarity as contributing factors. In his view, these issues prevented XRP from achieving price levels that were once expected for 2025. Despite these, not all analysts are discouraged. One of the more optimistic voices is The Block Bull, who recently outlined what he sees as a realistic upper boundary for XRP if the market enters a supercycle. His assessment places a potential top near $48, assuming XRP can regain key technical levels that previously shaped its long-term trajectory. Realistic height For $XRP for those that believe in the Super Cycle… Parallel Channel Gives you greater targets to obtain 20X~ in a super cycle $40.00+ pic.twitter.com/thb8IUCnwD — BLOCK BULL (@TheBlockBull) December 7, 2025 Long-Term Structure: The Parallel Channel Framework A major part of The Block Bull’s argument centers around a parallel ascending channel that he states has influenced XRP’s market structure for several years. This chart pattern came into focus in 2017, a period when XRP was still valued under one cent. The analyst highlights that the asset repeatedly interacted with the upper boundary of this channel at the time and consistently maintained support above it, leading into its 2018 surge toward all-time highs. Following the peak, XRP eventually fell back into the channel and continued trading within it for several years. Although its progression was slow, the structure suggested steady upward movement. That trend came under substantial pressure during the 2022 downturn, which was intensified by large-scale market failures involving major industry players. As a result, XRP fell below the lower boundary of the channel and has remained outside of it since then. Renewed optimism briefly surfaced in late 2024 when XRP approached $2, bringing it close to the channel’s lower line again. However, attempts to regain this technical level have repeatedly been rejected, indicating strong resistance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Price Targets in a Supercycle Scenario The Block Bull suggests that re-entering the multi-year channel is essential before XRP can attempt higher valuations. In his analysis, the upper boundary of the channel points to a potential high near $48 if a broad market expansion occurs. He views this level as ambitious yet still within the realm of possibility if XRP manages to reclaim its historical structure. At current prices, around $2, reaching the $48 region would represent an increase of more than 20 times from the present market value. Even so, the analyst acknowledges that many investors may choose to take profits much earlier, particularly around the $10 range, which he believes would trigger significant selling pressure. Although the $48 estimate is aggressive, it is not entirely isolated. Forecasts from research platforms such as Changelly have also placed XRP in that general range over the long term, projecting a potential move toward this level in the early 2030s. The outlook for XRP remains divided between ongoing skepticism and persistent long-term optimism. While the asset continues to face technical and regulatory challenges, some analysts argue that a return to its historical channel could open the door to substantial appreciation. Whether the conditions required for a supercycle will materialize is uncertain, but the discussion underscores the wide range of expectations surrounding XRP’s future trajectory.

This perspective highlights the potential for Pakistani officials to consider regulating the crypto market. This outlook was noted at the Bitcoin MENA Conference a few days after Saqib shared a statement dated Tuesday this week, declaring that the country can no longer rely on outdated economic models. Therefore, according to him, “a new engine”, which he referred to as digital assets, is needed to boost economic growth. Saqib refers to digital assets as essential aspects for Pakistan’s new financial system During a discussion in Abu Dhabi , the senior official argued that they do not view Bitcoin, digital assets, and blockchain as speculative tools, but as an important part of their infrastructure. Saqib further explained that they are not just distractions but play a significant role in establishing the basis for a new financial system for developing nations. Saqib, who was recently appointed Chairman of the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority ( PVARA ) and previously served as Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Blockchain and crypto matters, highlighted that he is working towards a major goal of transforming the largest unregulated cryptocurrency markets into a favourable investment environment. According to him, Pakistan has the potential to develop a regulated crypto ecosystem as soon as possible, given that 70% of the population belongs to the 30-year-old age group, rather than becoming a late adopter. “My message is straightforward,” he stated. “If El Salvador can achieve this with 6 million people, just think about what Pakistan could accomplish with a population 40 times larger and one of the fastest-growing digital sectors in Asia.” Following the senior official’s argument, analysts weighed in on the situation. They pointed out that Pakistan is increasingly becoming one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrency markets globally. Their remarks came after the country moved up six spots to solidify its top position as the third in Chainalysis’ 2025 Global Crypto Adoption Index . Pakistan positions itself as a hub for digital assets Earlier this month, Saqib informed reporters that the country is preparing to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. He also noted that Pakistan is working towards adopting more supportive policies specifically for cryptocurrency. This move sparked excitement among individuals who are advocates of cryptocurrencies. To further illustrate their commitment to exploring the crypto ecosystem, Pakistan reported allocating 2,000 megawatts of additional electricity to support Bitcoin mining activities and the construction and operation of AI data centres that same month. This time round, the country embraced national efforts essential to enable it to go digital. This move triggered reports to reach out to fi nancial leaders in the country to explain this plan further. Respondingly, they mentioned that this plan aims to attract significant foreign investment and create new high-tech jobs by diverting excess power supply to AI and crypto initiatives. To position itself as a hub for digital assets, Pakistan notified international crypto firms in September that they are accepting applications for licenses under the country’s new federal regulations. For leading exchanges and service providers interested in exploring the market, the PVARA advised them to begin submitting their interest.

The latest reading from the widely watched Crypto Fear & Greed Index confirms the mood: it’s holding steady at a score of 29. This firmly places current market sentiment in the ‘fear’ category. But what does this number really tell us, and more importantly, what should a savvy investor do about it? Let’s decode the signal from the noise. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Telling Us Right Now? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool that quantifies the emotional temperature of the cryptocurrency market. Think of it as a market mood ring. A score of 29, unchanged from the previous day, indicates that fear is the dominant emotion among traders and investors. This index ranges from 0, representing extreme fear , to 100, which signals extreme greed . The current stagnation at 29 suggests the market is in a cautious, wait-and-see phase, lacking the conviction for a strong move in either direction. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? This isn’t just a guess; it’s a data-driven snapshot. The index from Alternative.me compiles information from several key sources to create its daily score. Understanding the components helps explain why the sentiment is what it is. Volatility (25%): Sharp price swings, especially downward, feed fear. Market Volume (25%): Low or declining volume can indicate a lack of buyer interest. Social Media (15%): The tone and volume of conversations on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Direct polling of market participants. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): When Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap rises, it often signals a ‘flight to safety’. Google Trends (10%): Search volume for terms like ‘Bitcoin crash’ or ‘crypto bubble’. The current Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 29 means these factors collectively paint a picture of apprehension. Should You Be Afraid When the Index Shows Fear? Here’s where it gets interesting. While ‘fear’ sounds negative, experienced market participants often see it differently. A low Crypto Fear & Greed Index can present a strategic opportunity. Historically, periods of extreme fear have sometimes preceded market bottoms or buying opportunities, as weak hands sell and value investors step in. However, it’s crucial to remember that the index is a sentiment indicator, not a price predictor . It tells you how people feel, not necessarily where the price will go next. Actionable Insights in a Fearful Market So, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is flashing yellow. What’s your next move? First, avoid panic selling based on sentiment alone. Use this information as one piece of your broader research puzzle. This is an excellent time for due diligence—researching projects with strong fundamentals that may be undervalued. Consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to build positions gradually, reducing the risk of buying at a single high point. Most importantly, ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with your personal risk tolerance. The Bottom Line on Today’s Crypto Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index holding at 29 is a clear sign that uncertainty reigns. It reflects real concerns about volatility, macroeconomic factors, and regulatory headlines. However, by understanding what drives this index, you can move from reacting to emotion to making informed decisions. In the tumultuous world of crypto, sometimes the best action is informed patience. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Is a Fear & Greed Index score of 29 a good time to buy Bitcoin? A: It can be. Many contrarian investors view periods of fear as potential buying opportunities, as prices may be depressed. However, you should never base a buy decision solely on this index. Always conduct your own research and consider your financial goals. Q: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A: The index is updated daily, typically once per day. You can find it on websites like Alternative.me. Q: Does the index only measure sentiment for Bitcoin? A> While Bitcoin is the primary driver due to its dominance and data availability, the index aims to reflect sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market, as many altcoins move in correlation with Bitcoin. Q: Has the index been accurate in the past? A> The index has been effective at identifying periods of extreme market emotion, such as the euphoric highs near bull market peaks and the fearful lows during sharp corrections. It is a reliable gauge of prevailing mood, not a crystal ball for exact price movements. Q: Where can I check the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A> The most common source is the website Alternative.me. Many major crypto news and data platforms also display it on their market analysis pages. Q: Should I sell my crypto if the index is in ‘Extreme Fear’? A> Not necessarily. ‘Extreme Fear’ often coincides with market capitulation, which can mark a turning point. Selling during extreme fear can mean selling at a low. Review your investment thesis and long-term strategy instead of making emotional decisions. Did this breakdown of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index help you make sense of the market’s mood?

After slipping over 5% in the past 24 hours, DOGE now trades just under a critical support at $0.14, with bulls and bears locked in a high-stakes battle. This comes in the wake of yesterday’s FOMC meeting, which triggered volatility across the crypto market. With trading volumes still elevated and making up over 8% of DOGE’s circulating cap, the $0.13 zone has become a crucial line in the sand.

Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE Hits Key Support and Faces Make-Or-Break Moment Heading to the 12-hour chart, DOGE seems to be hitting a pivotal level at $0.13. In the past few weeks, it has bounced three times off this mark, increasing its technical relevance. If the price breaks above its dynamic trend line resistance, the odds of a move toward its point of control at $0.195 will be high. This confirms Bitconsensus’ view and further validates a bullish Dogecoin price prediction. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) would need to push above the 14-period moving average to confirm a bullish reversal for Dogecoin. Right now, it hovers around 40. Ideally, a breakout above the mid-line would signal that momentum is truly shifting in favor of the bulls. While the broader market hesitates following yesterday’s rate cut, some investors are already looking ahead.

This significant event, sourced from leading exchange Deribit, has the potential to inject volatility and shape short-term price action. But what does this actually mean for you, and how should savvy market participants interpret the key metrics? What Does Today’s Massive Bitcoin Options Expiration Mean? Today at 8:00 a.m. UTC, a critical financial instrument for sophisticated traders reaches its deadline. Bitcoin options are contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) Bitcoin at a predetermined price by a specific date. The expiration of $3.67 billion worth of these contracts forces traders to make decisions: exercise their rights, let them expire worthless, or roll them over. This concentrated activity often leads to increased trading volume and can cause price swings as market makers hedge their positions. Decoding the Key Metrics: Put/Call Ratio and Max Pain To gauge market sentiment, analysts look at two vital numbers provided by Deribit. First is the put/call ratio of 1.1 for Bitcoin options . A ratio above 1 indicates more put (bearish) contracts exist than call (bullish) ones, suggesting a cautious or hedging sentiment among traders. However, at 1.1, the bias is only slightly negative. The second crucial figure is the “max pain” price of $90,000. This is the strike price at which the maximum number of options would expire worthless, causing the most financial loss to option buyers and maximum gain to sellers. Market forces often, but not always, gravitate toward this price at expiration to minimize payouts. Put/Call Ratio (1.1): Slight bearish hedging bias. Max Pain Price ($90,000): The price point that would cause maximum loss to option holders. Ethereum Joins the Expiry Frenzy: A $770 Million Event It’s not just Bitcoin in the spotlight. A substantial batch of Ethereum options worth $770 million is set to expire simultaneously. The metrics here show an even stronger defensive posture. With a put/call ratio of 1.22 and a max pain price of $3,100, Ethereum traders appear to be exhibiting more pronounced caution or protection against downside moves. This dual expiration creates a compounded event that could amplify market-wide volatility. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders and Investors So, how should you navigate this? For active traders, expect potential volatility around the expiration time. Price may experience pinning near the max pain levels as the deadline approaches. Long-term investors, however, should view this as a routine market mechanism. While these expiries can cause short-term noise, they rarely alter the fundamental long-term trajectory. The key is not to panic but to understand the mechanics at play. Conclusion: Navigating the Options Expiry Landscape In summary, today’s expiration of $3.67 billion in Bitcoin options is a major market event that highlights the growing sophistication of the crypto derivatives space. The slightly bearish put/call ratio and the $90,000 max pain price provide a snapshot of current trader sentiment and potential pressure points. By understanding these concepts, you can better interpret market movements and avoid being swayed by temporary volatility. Remember, knowledge is your most powerful tool in a dynamic market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What happens when Bitcoin options expire? At expiration, traders must decide to exercise their right to buy/sell Bitcoin at the strike price or let the contract expire worthless. This flurry of activity can increase market volatility. What is a put/call ratio? It’s the number of put (sell) options divided by call (buy) options. A ratio above 1 suggests more traders are betting on or hedging against a price decrease. What is the “max pain” price? It’s the price at which the total financial loss for all option buyers is maximized (and seller gain is maximized). The market sometimes moves toward this price at expiry. Should I change my investment strategy because of options expiry? For long-term holders, typically no. These are short-term technical events. For active traders, it’s a factor to consider for timing entries/exits due to potential volatility. Where does this options data come from? The data is primarily reported by major crypto options exchanges like Deribit, which is the leader in this market segment. Do options expiries always move the market price? Not always, but they often create conditions ripe for volatility due to the hedging activity of large market makers. Found this breakdown of today’s crucial Bitcoin options expiry helpful?

This transaction, spotted by blockchain analysts, adds to a pattern of substantial movements from the prominent financial services firm. What does this mean for the market, and why would a major player shift such a large sum into an unknown wallet? Let’s explore the details and potential implications. What Does This Major Bitcoin Transfer Reveal? According to a report from Onchain Lens shared on X, the recipient address (bc1qp8…) has been receiving Bitcoin transfer batches from Galaxy Digital since December 9th. Therefore, this is not an isolated event but part of a coordinated accumulation strategy. The wallet’s total holdings have now ballooned to 1,900 BTC, valued at approximately $176 million. This scale of movement from a known institutional entity into an opaque destination naturally fuels speculation and analysis. For context, Galaxy Digital, founded by billionaire Mike Novogratz, is a heavyweight in crypto finance. Their actions are closely watched as a barometer for institutional sentiment. A Bitcoin transfer of this magnitude out of their known custody solutions could signal several strategic shifts. Why Would an Institution Use an Anonymous Wallet? Understanding the ‘why’ behind this Bitcoin transfer requires looking at common institutional practices. Moving assets to a new, private address isn’t necessarily alarming. However, it does raise important questions about strategy and security. Enhanced Security & Custody: The primary reason is often operational security. Institutions may rotate funds between wallets or migrate to new, more secure custody solutions. A fresh address with no transaction history can be harder to track and target. Preparing for a Transaction: This could be a preparatory move for a larger over-the-counter (OTC) trade, a collateralization event, or an allocation to a new fund or product. The anonymity prevents front-running in the markets. Internal Treasury Management: Large firms manage assets across multiple entities and balance sheets. This Bitcoin transfer might simply reflect an internal reallocation of assets between different subsidiaries or investment vehicles. What Are the Market Implications of This Move? While the exact purpose remains private, the market impact is tangible. Firstly, such visible movements can influence trader psychology. A large outflow from a known entity might be misinterpreted as a sell-off, causing short-term anxiety. Conversely, understanding it as a custody shift or strategic hold can reinforce beliefs in long-term Bitcoin accumulation by institutions. Moreover, this event highlights the transparency of blockchain. Every major Bitcoin transfer is public, allowing for real-time analysis. This transparency is a double-edged sword—it builds trust in the network’s integrity but also requires sophisticated interpretation to avoid misreading institutional intent. Key Takeaways for Crypto Observers This development offers several actionable insights for anyone following the crypto space. It underscores that institutional activity is multifaceted and not solely about buying or selling on public exchanges. The use of anonymous wallets is a standard practice for security and operational efficiency, not inherently secretive in a negative sense. Furthermore, tracking these flows is crucial. The pattern shows sustained accumulation into one address since December, suggesting a deliberate, long-term position is being built. For investors, this reinforces the narrative of continued institutional faith in Bitcoin as a core digital asset, regardless of short-term price volatility. Conclusion: Decoding the Signal in the Noise Galaxy Digital’s latest $64.8 million Bitcoin transfer is a powerful reminder of the dynamic and complex nature of institutional crypto management. While the destination wallet is anonymous, the action itself speaks volumes about ongoing strategic asset deployment. It reflects sophisticated custody practices and a potential commitment to holding substantial Bitcoin reserves off the public radar. For the market, the key lesson is to look beyond the headline and understand the common operational reasons behind such moves, which often signify long-term planning rather than imminent selling pressure. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is a large Bitcoin transfer to an anonymous wallet a sign of selling? A: Not necessarily. While it could precede a sale, it’s more commonly linked to security upgrades, internal treasury management, or preparing assets for other financial operations like collateralization. Q2: Why can we see this Bitcoin transfer if the wallet is anonymous? A: The Bitcoin blockchain is transparent; all transactions are public. We can see the amount, timestamp, and sending/receiving addresses. “Anonymous” means the owner of the address is not publicly known, not that the transaction is hidden. Q3: What is Galaxy Digital’s role in cryptocurrency? A: Galaxy Digital is a full-service financial services firm operating in the digital asset sector. It provides trading, asset management, investment banking, and mining services for institutions. Q4: How does this transfer affect Bitcoin’s price? A: The direct impact is often minimal if the coins are not sent to an exchange for sale. However, the news can influence market sentiment. Perceived as accumulation, it can be bullish; perceived as preparation to sell, it can be bearish. Q5: Should retail investors be concerned about such transfers? A: Retail investors should monitor them as part of overall market analysis but not overreact. Institutional moves are part of normal operations and should be considered within the broader context of market trends and fundamentals. Q6: What tools can track these Bitcoin transfers? A: Blockchain explorers like Blockchain.com, Etherscan (for wrapped BTC), and analytics platforms like Arkham Intelligence or Nansen are commonly used to track large wallet movements and cluster addresses.

This strategic timing signals an intensifying battle for supremacy in the foundational models that will power the next generation of decentralized applications, smart contracts, and automated crypto analysis tools. For investors and builders in the Web3 space, the capabilities of these agents to synthesize vast data sets could revolutionize due diligence, tokenomics research, and on-chain analytics. What is Google’s New Gemini Deep Research AI Agent? Google’s newly “reimagined” Gemini Deep Research is built on its flagship Gemini 3 Pro model. This isn’t just another chatbot. It’s an autonomous agent engineered for deep, complex reasoning tasks. Its core function is to ingest and synthesize “mountains of information” from large context prompts, producing comprehensive research outputs. Crucially, Google is now offering this capability to developers through its new Interactions API, allowing them to embed these advanced research functions directly into their own applications. This move is pivotal for the AI research agent ecosystem, enabling bespoke tools for crypto portfolio analysis, whitepaper summarization, and regulatory tracking. Why the Fight Against AI Hallucinations Matters for Crypto For any financial or technical analysis, accuracy is non-negotiable. Google emphasizes that Gemini 3 Pro is its “most factual” model, specifically trained to minimize hallucinations—those instances where an AI confidently invents false information. In the context of long, multi-step agentic tasks (like analyzing a project’s entire codebase or audit history), a single hallucination can corrupt the entire analysis. This focus on reliability is a direct response to a major pain point in deploying Google AI and other models for serious financial or technical work, where errors have real monetary consequences. Key Features of Gemini Deep Research vs. Traditional AI Models Feature Gemini Deep Research Standard LLM Primary Function Autonomous, multi-step research synthesis Single-turn Q&A or content generation Context Handling Massive context windows for deep dives Limited context, often summarized Output Structured reports, due diligence summaries Conversational responses, paragraphs Integration Via Interactions API for custom apps Often limited to chat interfaces Target Use Case Drug research, financial due diligence, technical analysis Customer service, content creation, brainstorming The Benchmark Wars: DeepSearchQA and Humanity’s Last Exam To prove its prowess, Google introduced a new benchmark, DeepSearchQA, designed to test agents on complex, multi-step information tasks. It has open-sourced this benchmark. More intriguingly, it tested its agent on “Humanity’s Last Exam,” an independent benchmark filled with niche general knowledge tasks. Google’s agent topped these charts. However, the released data showed OpenAI’s ChatGPT 5 Pro was a very close second, even slightly outperforming Google on the BrowserComp benchmark for browser-based tasks. This data was instantly overshadowed by the release of OpenAI GPT-5.2 (codenamed Garlic), which OpenAI claims now leads on key benchmarks. This relentless one-upmanship on AI benchmarks drives rapid iteration but also creates confusion in the market. OpenAI GPT-5.2: The Same-Day Counterpunch The narrative took another dramatic turn with OpenAI’s release of GPT-5.2 . The timing was unmistakably strategic. While the world awaited “Garlic,” Google seized the news cycle with its Deep Research announcement. OpenAI then fired back, claiming its new model now leads the pack. This tit-for-tat launch day highlights the fierce, real-time competition between the two giants. For the crypto and tech industry, this competition accelerates innovation but also presents a dilemma: which platform’s evolving capabilities should developers bet their next project on? Strategic Timing: Google’s announcement was clearly timed to blunt OpenAI’s news momentum. Performance Claims: Each company now claims benchmark leadership, making direct comparison difficult for users. Developer Mindshare: The battle is as much for developer adoption and ecosystem building as it is for raw model performance. What This Means for the Future of Search and Crypto Research Google plans to integrate Deep Research into Google Search, Finance, the Gemini App, and NotebookLM. This is a step toward a world where AI agents conduct research on our behalf. For crypto, this could manifest as: Automated Due Diligence: Agents scanning whitepapers, audit reports, GitHub activity, and team history to generate risk profiles. Real-time Sentiment & News Synthesis: Parsing thousands of news articles, social media posts, and forum discussions to gauge market sentiment. On-Chain Analysis Tools: Building custom agents that monitor wallet activity, liquidity pool changes, and smart contract interactions for actionable insights. The race between Google AI and OpenAI GPT-5.2 is no longer just about better chat. It’s about which company can provide the most reliable, powerful, and integratable brain for the autonomous agents that will increasingly manage our digital and financial lives. The launch-day clash proves both are all-in on this agentic future. Conclusion: An Accelerating Arms Race with High Stakes The dual launch of Google’s Gemini Deep Research and OpenAI’s GPT-5.2 marks a pivotal escalation in the AI war. It’s a transition from conversational AI to functional, autonomous research agents. The focus on combating hallucinations and handling deep, multi-step tasks shows the industry is maturing, targeting enterprise and high-stakes applications like finance and crypto. While benchmark claims will fly, the real test will be in production—which platform enables developers to build the most transformative and reliable tools first. For the crypto community, these advancements promise a new tier of analytical power, but they also demand heightened scrutiny of the underlying models’ accuracy and bias.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Gemini Deep Research? It is Google’s advanced autonomous AI agent, built on Gemini 3 Pro, designed to perform deep, multi-step research and synthesis tasks, moving beyond simple Q&A. What is GPT-5.2? GPT-5.2, codenamed “Garlic,” is OpenAI’s latest model release, announced the same day as Google’s agent. It claims improvements across standard benchmarks. Who leads in AI benchmarks now? Both companies claim leadership. Google’s agent led on its new DeepSearchQA and Humanity’s Last Exam benchmarks, while OpenAI claims GPT-5.2 now leads on a suite of standard tests. The landscape is highly dynamic. How can developers use Gemini Deep Research? Through Google’s new Interactions API, allowing the deep research capabilities to be embedded into third-party applications for customized use cases. Why is reducing AI hallucinations important? For long, complex tasks involving many autonomous decisions (like financial analysis), a single fabricated fact (hallucination) can invalidate the entire output, leading to faulty conclusions and potential losses.

For crypto investors scanning the horizon for the next big opportunity, a key metric just flashed a stagnant signal. The Altcoin Season Index is holding firm at 17, unchanged from the previous day. This low reading tells a clear story about the current market dynamic, but what does it mean for your portfolio? Let’s decode this crucial indicator and explore the actionable insights it provides. What Exactly Is the Altcoin Season Index? CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index is a vital tool for gauging market sentiment. It measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. The calculation is straightforward but powerful. The index asks one simple question: are altcoins outperforming the king of crypto? An official altcoin season is declared when 75% of these top coins beat Bitcoin’s returns over the preceding three months. Conversely, a Bitcoin season occurs when BTC outshines the majority of altcoins. The index score itself ranges from 0 to 100. Therefore, a reading closer to 100 signals a stronger, more pervasive altcoin season. Why Is a Score of 17 Significant for the Altcoin Season Index? A score of 17 on the Altcoin Season Index is far from the 75 threshold needed to declare a season. This low and steady number indicates we are firmly in a Bitcoin-dominant market phase. Here’s what this current reading typically means for investors: Bitcoin Leadership: Capital and attention are primarily flowing into Bitcoin, often driven by macro factors like ETF approvals or institutional interest. Altcoin Patience: Most alternative cryptocurrencies are struggling to keep pace, waiting for a broader risk-on sentiment to return to the crypto market. Consolidation Phase: This period can be a time of accumulation for strong altcoin projects, building a base for their next move. This index is not a crystal ball, but a diagnostic tool. It confirms the prevailing trend, helping you align your strategy with the market’s current rhythm. How Can You Use the Altcoin Season Index in Your Strategy? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index is one thing; applying it is another. With the index stuck at 17, consider these actionable insights for your crypto investment approach. First, manage your expectations. A low index suggests chasing quick, massive gains in random altcoins is a high-risk strategy. The wind is not at their backs. Second, this is an ideal time for research. Use this quieter period to deeply analyze fundamental projects without the noise of a frenzied bull market. Finally, consider a phased approach. You might: Maintain a core position in Bitcoin while the trend is clear. Dollar-cost average into high-conviction altcoin picks at lower prices. Set alerts for when the Altcoin Season Index begins a sustained climb above 50, signaling a potential shift. What Triggers a Shift in the Altcoin Season Index? The index doesn’t move on its own. It reacts to market forces. For the Altcoin Season Index to rise from 17 towards 75, specific catalysts are usually required. Historically, a sustained Bitcoin rally often comes first, bringing new capital and confidence into the entire crypto ecosystem. Once Bitcoin’s price stabilizes at a higher level, that confidence and capital begin to ‘rotate’ into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. This rotation is what powers the index upward. Other triggers can include breakthrough developments in major altcoin sectors like DeFi or NFTs, or a significant reduction in macroeconomic uncertainty that boosts risk appetite. Conclusion: Navigating the Calm Before the Storm The Altcoin Season Index holding at 17 is a snapshot of a patient market. It signals a period of Bitcoin strength and altcoin consolidation, not a period of altcoin opportunity. For the savvy investor, this is not a time for disappointment, but for preparation. Use this data to fortify your portfolio’s foundation, conduct rigorous research, and develop a clear plan for when the index’s needle finally starts to swing. By understanding this metric, you move from reacting to market noise to responding to market structure. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Where can I find the current Altcoin Season Index reading? A1: The index is published and tracked by CoinMarketCap. You can typically find it on their website or data platforms that aggregate market metrics. Q2: Does a low index mean I should sell all my altcoins? A2: Not necessarily. A low index indicates a trend, not an absolute rule. It suggests caution and selective investment rather than a wholesale exit, especially for projects with strong fundamentals. Q3: How often does the Altcoin Season Index update? A3: The index is typically updated daily, reflecting the rolling 90-day performance data of the top cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin. Q4: Has an altcoin season ever started from a low index like 17? A4: Yes, altcoin seasons often begin from periods of Bitcoin dominance. The key is to watch for a sustained, multi-week upward trend in the index value, not just a single-day spike. Q5: Are all altcoins included in the index calculation? A5: No. The index specifically analyzes the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like WBTC) to give a pure performance comparison.

While ETH stabilizes under familiar resistance levels, a new altcoin priced at $0.035 has surged 250% and is moving through its final allocation window. With attention shifting toward early-stage assets that still offer meaningful room to grow, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now being compared to Ethereum as traders evaluate what may deliver stronger performance in 2026. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum remains one of the most important assets in the entire market. It holds a massive market cap, supports the majority of decentralized applications and serves as the foundation for major sectors such as DeFi, NFTs and layer-2 networks. ETH has produced major returns since launch and played a key role in building the crypto landscape. But the same size that made Ethereum strong is now one of its biggest obstacles. Large-cap assets move more slowly because they require heavy liquidity to break through price barriers. ETH faces repeated resistance near the $3,100 to $3,400 zone. Many traders say the next top crypto cycle may give ETH a modest boost rather than a breakout. A common view is that Ethereum may deliver small gains, but not the kind of high-multiple returns early-cycle investors are looking for. This has shifted attention toward lower-priced tokens with earlier positioning and stronger upside potential, especially those backed by meaningful utility rather than speculation alone. That is where Mutuum Finance is beginning to stand out. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized lending protocol built on structured borrowing and lending mechanics. The system uses two connected markets to give lenders and borrowers clear financial environments. In the Peer to Contract market, users lend assets such as ETH or USDT into the protocol. They receive mtTokens. mtTokens increase in value as borrowers repay interest. For example, someone lending $500 of USDT may watch mtTokens grow as the protocol gains users. This creates a natural APY based on real activity inside the system. The Peer to Peer market allows borrowers to form direct agreements with lenders. Borrowing rates shift with liquidity. When liquidity is strong, borrowing stays affordable. When liquidity weakens, borrowing becomes more expensive. Loan-to-value rules help protect users by setting boundaries for collateral. If collateral falls too far, liquidation may occur. Liquidators repay part of the debt and receive discounted collateral. This approach keeps the system predictable when market prices move fast. These mechanics give Mutuum Finance a functional DeFi structure that operates very differently from ETH. Ethereum’s value comes from ecosystem demand, while MUTM’s value comes from protocol activity, interest repayment, mtToken performance and revenue-driven buy pressure. Presale Progress and Expanding Participation Mutuum Finance began its presale in early 2025 at $0.01. Since then it has surged to $0.035, reflecting a 250% increase during development. The project has now raised $19.250M and grown to 18,500 holders. More than 815M tokens have been purchased so far. Out of the total 4B MUTM supply, 1.82B tokens, equal to 45.5%, were allocated for the presale. Phase 6 is now over 96% allocated, and the next stage will introduce a nearly 20% price increase as the project moves toward the final pre-launch structure. The official listing price is set at $0.06, which positions Phase 1 participants for a 500% appreciation at launch. Community participation remains high due to the 24-hour leaderboard, where the top buyer each day receives $500 in MUTM. This has kept daily traffic strong and improved visibility. Mutuum Finance also supports card payment, which has helped onboard new users quickly. Security has been one of the project’s most emphasized areas. Mutuum Finance completed a CertiK audit, scoring 90/100, and Halborn Security is currently reviewing the protocol’s borrowing, liquidation and repayment logic. A $50,000 bug bounty is active as well. These steps have helped build confidence as the project prepares for its first public version. V1 Testnet, Development and Why These Matter for 2026 Mutuum Finance confirmed through its official X account that the V1 testnet will launch in Q4 2025. V1 introduces the liquidity pool, mtTokens, the liquidation engine and the debt module. ETH and USDT will be the first supported assets. This will be the first time users can interact with the protocol in a live environment. The project is also preparing a USD-pegged stablecoin supported by borrower interest. Stablecoins are important for lending systems because they create predictable borrowing conditions and reduce exposure to volatility. They also expand liquidity, which increases borrowing and lending volume. Analysts expect that stablecoin integration will play a major role in Mutuum Finance’s growth curve once V1 is active. Mutuum Finance plans to expand across several layer-2 networks. L2 deployment helps lower transaction fees and improve processing speed. Lending platforms rely on frequent updates to collateral levels, interest rates and liquidations. Faster settlement is essential for a smooth user experience. Why Ethereum’s Outlook Looks Slower Ethereum’s growth expectations for 2026 show limited upside. Many traders expect ETH to rise only modestly due to its size, resistance zones and slowing momentum. Mutuum Finance sits on the opposite side of the spectrum. It is early, priced low, backed by functional lending mechanics, supported by a buy-and-distribute engine, tied to mtToken yield and preparing for a fully audited V1 launch. The early structural combination gives MUTM the kind of setup analysts typically associate with high-multiple moves. Mutuum Finance, by contrast, has the foundational elements that historically supported early breakouts in prior cycles. The demand surge in Phase 6, the high number of holders, the $19.250M raised, and the upcoming price increase in Phase 7 all add pressure as the project approaches its next crypto stage.

While rate cuts typically support risk assets, Jerome Powell’s comments added a new layer of uncertainty to the market. Related Reading: The Whale Who Can’t Stop Buying: BitcoinOG Scales Ethereum Long To $280M After Price Surge By openly acknowledging the risks of weaker growth paired with persistent inflation, Powell introduced the possibility of stagflation—a scenario that historically challenges both equities and crypto. As a result, sentiment across the market remains fragile, and investors are struggling to interpret what this macro shift could mean for Ethereum’s next move. Despite the volatility surrounding the decision, one major whale continues to act with conviction. According to Lookonchain, the Bitcoin OG who famously shorted the market during the October 10 crash is once again doubling down on his bullish Ethereum position. Instead of taking profits or reducing exposure after the recent rally, he has continued accumulating aggressively, signaling a strong belief in ETH’s medium-term trajectory even as broader sentiment turns cautious. Whale Position Ramps Up, But Risk Is Rising According to Lookonchain, the whale’s position has now surged to 120,094 ETH, valued at approximately $392.5 million. With a liquidation price at $2,234.69, this has become one of the largest and most aggressive long positions currently tracked on-chain. Such a massive allocation signals extreme conviction, especially coming from the same Bitcoin OG who successfully shorted the market during the October 10 crash. However, the scale of this bet also highlights how much risk is now concentrated in a single directional position. The liquidation price is a key concern. At $2,234, it sits nearly $1,000 below current levels, but in highly leveraged environments—especially during macro uncertainty—prices can retrace violently. Ethereum has already shown a tendency toward sharp intraday moves, and with funding rates rising and leverage across the market stretching to historical highs, even a moderate correction could trigger cascading liquidations. If ETH experiences a sudden spike in volatility due to shifting macro conditions, a negative reaction to the latest FOMC decision, or a broader market unwind, the whale’s position could come under significant pressure. While large whales often influence market sentiment, this setup illustrates how thin the margin for error has become. Related Reading: Why Ethereum’s Rally Isn’t Overheated – And Where Demand Must Grow Next ETH Testing Resistance While Momentum Weakens Ethereum has retraced to the $3,196 level after failing to hold above the $3,300 zone, signaling that bullish momentum is beginning to weaken. The daily chart shows ETH rejecting the red 200-day moving average, a key long-term trend indicator that has acted as resistance throughout the recent downtrend. Until ETH breaks and closes decisively above this level, the broader structure remains vulnerable. The 50-day moving average is still sloping downward, reflecting persistent selling pressure despite last week’s rebound. Meanwhile, the 100-day moving average sits well above the current price, reinforcing the heavy overhead resistance ETH must overcome to reestablish a bullish trend. Volume has also declined compared to the early December bounce, suggesting buyers are losing strength as price approaches major resistance levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Fall To Lowest Levels on Record: The Bullish Signal Most Traders Are Missing Structurally, ETH remains in a mid-term downtrend, forming lower highs and lower lows since September. Although the recent push from the $2,800 region shows buyers defending key support, the rejection at $3,350 highlights that sellers are still in control at higher levels. If ETH fails to regain the 200-day moving average soon, a retest of the $3,050–$3,100 support range becomes likely. Conversely, a strong reclaim above $3,350 could open the door for a move toward $3,500, but the market will need renewed momentum to get there.

Next week, the US Senate will hold a crucial vote to confirm the chairs of two powerful financial watchdogs—the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). This decision will directly shape the rules of the game for the entire cryptocurrency sector. Why is this US Senate vote on CFTC and FDIC chairs so important? The US Senate vote on CFTC and FDIC chairs is not just routine Washington procedure. It’s a decision with profound consequences for market stability and innovation. The CFTC oversees derivatives markets, including crypto futures and swaps, while the FDIC insures bank deposits and influences how traditional banks interact with crypto firms. Their leadership sets the regulatory tone. If confirmed, Michael Selig will lead the CFTC and acting Chair Travis Hill will officially head the FDIC. Their approaches to enforcement, rule-making, and industry guidance will either foster a clear, supportive environment or create new hurdles for crypto businesses and investors. What does this mean for the future of cryptocurrency? The outcome of this US Senate vote on CFTC and FDIC chairs will send immediate signals to the market. Regulatory clarity is the single biggest request from institutional investors. Confirmation of these nominees could accelerate progress on several fronts: Market Structure: Clearer rules for crypto exchanges and trading platforms. Consumer Protection: Enhanced safeguards against fraud and manipulation. Banking Access: Improved relationships between crypto companies and FDIC-insured banks. Innovation Pathways: Defined frameworks for new products like spot Bitcoin ETFs and tokenized assets. However, challenges remain. The division of authority between the CFTC and the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) over different crypto assets is still a complex issue. The leadership confirmed by this US Senate vote will need to navigate this jurisdictional overlap carefully. Actionable insights for the crypto community While the US Senate vote on CFTC and FDIC chairs happens in Washington, its effects ripple out to every participant in the crypto ecosystem. Here’s what you should watch for in the coming weeks: Post-Confirmation Statements: Listen for the first public remarks from the confirmed chairs regarding their regulatory priorities for digital assets. Enforcement Trends: Monitor whether the CFTC under new leadership increases or refines its enforcement actions against unregistered crypto derivatives platforms. Banking Guidance: Watch for any new FDIC bulletins that clarify risk management for banks dealing with crypto asset custodianship. Legislative Momentum: This vote could catalyze movement on broader crypto legislation, such as market structure bills, that have been stalled in Congress. The key takeaway? Regulatory uncertainty is a major market risk. A smooth confirmation process and the installation of permanent leadership can help reduce that risk, potentially leading to greater institutional capital inflows and mainstream adoption. The bottom line for investors and builders This upcoming US Senate vote on CFTC and FDIC chairs represents a critical inflection point. For years, the crypto industry has operated in a patchwork regulatory environment. The individuals leading these agencies will be responsible for interpreting and enforcing rules that are still being written. A stable, predictable regulatory framework is the foundation for sustainable growth. It protects consumers, deters bad actors, and gives legitimate projects the confidence to build and innovate. The vote next week is a significant step toward establishing that framework. Therefore, the entire sector has a vested interest in its outcome. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who are the nominees for the CFTC and FDIC chairs? A1: The nominee for CFTC Chair is Michael Selig. The nominee for FDIC Chair is the current acting chair, Travis Hill. Q2: When exactly is the US Senate vote scheduled? A2: The confirmation votes are scheduled for early next week, according to reports from CoinDesk. Q3: How does the CFTC regulate cryptocurrency? A3: The CFTC regulates cryptocurrency derivatives, such as futures and swaps contracts, treating Bitcoin and Ether as commodities under its jurisdiction. Q4: What is the FDIC’s role in crypto? A4: The FDIC insures deposits at US banks. Its policies influence whether and how traditional banks can provide services to cryptocurrency companies, which is crucial for crypto banking and custody solutions. Q5: Will this vote immediately change crypto regulations? A5: Not immediately. The vote confirms the leaders. Regulatory change is a slower process involving proposed rules, public comments, and final rulings. However, leadership sets the agenda and enforcement priorities. Q6: Why should an average crypto investor care about this? A6: Clear regulation reduces systemic risk, deters fraud, and can lead to more investment products (like ETFs) becoming available, ultimately creating a safer and more robust market for all participants.

The transfer was sent to wallets tied to Coinbase Prime, raising questions about whether the company is reshaping part of its treasury while attention grows around its potential public listing. Ledger Shuffle Raises Questions Reports have disclosed that this move is only the latest in a series of large bitcoin transfers involving wallets believed to be linked to SpaceX. Analysts tracking the transactions say the pattern looks more like a shift into institutional custody rather than an immediate market sale, since Coinbase Prime is commonly used for storage and structured trades by large companies. SpaceX is estimated to hold around 8,285 BTC, a stash worth roughly $770 million based on recent market prices. That amount places the company among the biggest private holders of bitcoin. Records show the balance was once higher during 2022, though part of it has been reduced over time as transfers continued. SpaceX( @SpaceX ) just transferred out another 1,021 $BTC ($94.48M), to possibly Coinbase Prime for custody. https://t.co/zW62EKM2RD pic.twitter.com/PwBIvD5RaR — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 10, 2025 SpaceX: IPO Talk Adds Pressure At the same time, reports from major outlets say SpaceX is preparing for an initial public offering that could take place in 2026. Coverage has suggested the fundraising round may target tens of billions of dollars, and estimates of the company’s possible valuation range from $800 billion to more than $1.5 trillion. Elon Musk reacted on social media to one of the reports, saying the information was accurate, which added more weight to expectations that a listing is being planned. Because companies often adjust their balance sheets ahead of a public offering, analysts say moving crypto into institutional platforms would not be unusual. It can be done for audits, custody needs, or overall treasury preparation before large financial transactions. What The Move Might Signal A transfer into Coinbase Prime does not automatically mean a bitcoin sale is underway. Institutional accounts can hold assets for long periods without sending them directly to the open market. Traders watching the activity say that only an actual sale — not a custody transfer — would create immediate pressure on Bitcoin prices. Still, the timing stands out. The latest 1,021 BTC move comes during a period where SpaceX’s on-chain activity has increased. More transfers may follow if the company continues preparing documents and financial disclosures linked to a potential public listing. The main question now is whether the recent shift was routine treasury work or part of a larger strategy connected to the IPO. SpaceX has not issued a public statement on the transaction, leaving analysts to rely on blockchain data and regulatory reporting to understand what comes next.

According to live data from Binance’s USDT trading pair, BTC is currently trading around $91,960.31. This sudden move has left many investors wondering: is this a minor correction or the start of a deeper trend? Let’s unpack the situation. What’s Driving the Current Bitcoin Price Action? Market movements rarely happen in a vacuum. While the immediate Bitcoin price drop is clear, several underlying factors often contribute to such shifts. Understanding these can provide much-needed context for traders and long-term holders alike. Firstly, broader market sentiment plays a huge role. When traditional markets like stocks experience volatility, cryptocurrency often follows. Secondly, on-chain data, such as exchange inflows and outflows, can signal whether large holders are accumulating or distributing their coins. Finally, technical analysis levels, like the $92,000 mark, act as psychological barriers for traders. How Should Investors React to BTC Volatility? Seeing the Bitcoin price dip can trigger emotional decisions. However, a strategic approach is far more effective. Here are three actionable insights for navigating this volatility: Review Your Strategy: Does this dip align with your buying targets, or was your plan to hold regardless of short-term noise? Assess Risk: Ensure your portfolio allocation to crypto still matches your personal risk tolerance. Look for Context: Check if this drop is isolated to Bitcoin or if the entire crypto market is moving in sync. Remember, Bitcoin’s history is defined by cycles of dramatic peaks and troughs. Short-term price action, while important, is just one piece of the long-term puzzle. Is This a Buying Opportunity or a Warning Sign? This is the million-dollar question every investor is asking. The answer depends entirely on your perspective and goals. For some, a pullback in the Bitcoin price presents a chance to ‘buy the dip’ at a more attractive entry point. For others, especially short-term traders, it may signal a shift in momentum that warrants caution. Key indicators to watch now include whether Bitcoin can reclaim the $92,000 level as support and the trading volume accompanying the move. High volume on a down day can suggest stronger selling pressure. Conversely, stabilizing at a new level with lower volume might indicate the sell-off is exhausting itself. Conclusion: Navigating the Waves of Crypto Markets Today’s Bitcoin price movement below $92,000 serves as a potent reminder of the asset’s inherent volatility. While headlines focus on the number, savvy participants look deeper at the ‘why’ and the ‘what next.’ Whether you view this as a temporary setback or a significant shift, informed decisions based on data and a clear personal strategy will always outperform reactive, emotion-driven trading. The market’s next move is uncertain, but your preparedness doesn’t have to be. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why did the Bitcoin price fall below $92,000? The price drop is likely due to a combination of factors including broader market sentiment, profit-taking by short-term traders, and a break below a key technical support level that triggered automated sell orders. Should I sell my Bitcoin now? This is a personal decision based on your investment strategy. If you are a long-term holder believing in Bitcoin’s fundamentals, short-term dips may be less relevant. Always consult your financial plan. How low could the Bitcoin price go? Predicting exact price floors is impossible. Analysts watch other support levels, like $90,000 or $88,000, but market conditions can change rapidly. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? For investors using a ‘Dollar-Cost Averaging’ (DCA) strategy, any price can be a good time to buy a small, scheduled amount. For others, it may present a lower entry point than yesterday, but there are no guarantees. What is the best platform to track the Bitcoin price? Reputable cryptocurrency data aggregators and major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken provide real-time price data. Always use multiple sources for verification. Will this affect other cryptocurrencies? Typically, yes. Bitcoin often sets the trend for the wider crypto market. When BTC experiences significant volatility, altcoins frequently follow suit, often with greater intensity. Found this analysis helpful? Understanding market moves empowers the entire community.

However, a new partnership is changing the game. Swiss hardware wallet leader Tangem has integrated with the powerhouse DeFi lending protocol, Aave. This move directly allows users to earn stablecoin yield on assets like USDT and USDC with unprecedented simplicity and security. Let’s explore how this integration works and why it’s a significant step for mainstream DeFi adoption. What Does the Tangem and Aave Integration Mean for You? This partnership bridges the gap between secure cold storage and decentralized finance (DeFi) earning potential. Previously, to earn a stablecoin yield on Aave, you typically needed to connect a software wallet, manage private keys on an internet-connected device, and navigate multiple steps. Tangem’s integration streamlines this process. Now, you can deposit your stablecoins directly from your Tangem card—a physical, self-custody wallet—into Aave’s liquidity pools. The transaction is signed offline on the card, keeping your keys secure, while you seamlessly access DeFi’s earning power. How to Start Earning Stablecoin Yield with Tangem The process is designed for user-friendliness. If you own a Tangem wallet and some stablecoins, getting started is straightforward. First, ensure your Tangem app is updated to the latest version. Then, within the app’s interface, you will find the new Aave integration module. From there, you can select which stablecoin to deposit (USDC or USDT), review the projected stablecoin yield rate, and confirm the transaction by tapping your Tangem card. Your assets are now supplied to the Aave protocol, and you will begin accruing interest in real-time, all without exposing your private keys online. Why This Partnership is a Game-Changer for DeFi This collaboration addresses two critical pillars of crypto: security and accessibility. Tangem provides bank-grade security through its offline transaction signing. Aave offers one of the most trusted and liquid platforms for earning yield. Together, they create a powerful and safe on-ramp for everyday users into DeFi. The benefits are clear: Enhanced Security: Private keys never leave the Tangem card. Simplified Access: Earn yield directly from a user-friendly mobile app. Reduced Risk: Combines the safety of cold storage with DeFi opportunities. Stable Earnings: Focus on stablecoin yield minimizes exposure to crypto volatility. What Are the Potential Challenges to Consider? While this integration is a leap forward, users should remain informed. The stablecoin yield rates on Aave are variable and depend on market supply and demand; they are not fixed. Furthermore, as with any DeFi protocol, there are inherent smart contract risks, though Aave is one of the most audited and time-tested platforms. It’s also crucial to understand that you are interacting with a decentralized protocol; the integration is a gateway, not a custodial service. Therefore, doing your own research (DYOR) on both Tangem and Aave remains essential. Conclusion: A Secure Step Toward Mainstream DeFi Earnings The Tangem and Aave integration marks a pivotal moment where high-security custody meets user-friendly DeFi yield generation. It demystifies the process of earning a stablecoin yield , making it accessible to anyone who prioritizes the safety of their assets. By removing technical barriers and leveraging Tangem’s intuitive hardware, this partnership paves the way for the next wave of users to confidently explore and benefit from decentralized finance. It’s a compelling blend of innovation, security, and practical utility. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Do I need to move my crypto to a new wallet to use this? A: No. If you already use a Tangem wallet, you can use it directly. If not, you would need to purchase one and transfer your stablecoins to it. Q: Is the stablecoin yield paid daily? A: Yield accrues continuously in real-time. You can see your growing balance within the Tangem app whenever you check it. Q: Are my funds locked when supplying to Aave? A: No, they are not locked in a traditional sense. You can withdraw your supplied stablecoins and accrued yield back to your Tangem wallet at any time, subject to Aave’s protocol liquidity. Q: What are the fees involved? A: You will pay standard Ethereum network gas fees to initiate the deposit and later for withdrawal. Aave also takes a small percentage of the yield generated as a protocol fee. Q: Is this service available worldwide? A: Availability may depend on local regulations. It’s best to check Tangem’s and Aave’s official resources for any geographic restrictions. Q: How does this differ from a centralized exchange (CEX) savings product? A: With Tangem and Aave, you retain full self-custody of your assets. On a CEX, you typically lend your coins to the exchange itself. This integration uses a decentralized, non-custodial protocol.

This development unlocks a new realm of decentralized finance (DeFi) possibilities for XRP holders, who can now securely explore applications on other blockchains without selling their original assets. Let’s break down what this means for the ecosystem. What is Wrapped XRP and Why Does It Matter? Wrapped tokens are essentially blockchain bridges. They represent a token from one blockchain, like XRP from the XRP Ledger, on a completely different network, such as Ethereum or Polygon. Each wrapped XRP token is pegged 1:1 to the value of a real XRP held securely in reserve by a custodian like Hex Trust. Therefore, this mechanism allows the value and utility of XRP to travel to ecosystems where it wasn’t natively available before. How Does Hex Trust’s Service Empower Users? Hex Trust’s entry into the wrapped XRP space brings a critical element: institutional-grade security and trust. As a licensed and regulated custodian, they manage the complex process of wrapping and unwrapping tokens. For users, this translates to a simplified and secure experience. Secure Custody: The underlying XRP backing the wXRP tokens is held in Hex Trust’s bank-grade, insured custody solutions. Seamless Issuance: Users can convert their XRP into wXRP (and vice-versa) through Hex Trust’s platform, ensuring the peg is maintained. DeFi Gateway: With wXRP in hand, users can finally leverage their XRP holdings across hundreds of DeFi protocols for lending, borrowing, yield farming, and more on other chains. What Are the Broader Implications for Crypto? This launch is more than just a new service; it’s a signal of maturation for the entire digital asset space. Firstly, it addresses a long-standing demand from the XRP community for greater utility. Secondly, it demonstrates how regulated institutions are building the necessary infrastructure to connect siloed blockchain economies safely. This kind of trusted interoperability is crucial for mainstream adoption, as it reduces technical barriers and counterparty risk for investors. Are There Any Challenges to Consider? While promising, using wrapped XRP and wrapped assets, in general, does introduce considerations. Users must trust the custodian (in this case, Hex Trust) to hold the reserves correctly. There’s also smart contract risk associated with the wXRP token on its destination chain. However, partnering with an established, audited custodian like Hex Trust significantly mitigates the first concern, making this a compelling option for cautious investors. In conclusion, Hex Trust’s launch of wrapped XRP custody and issuance is a pivotal step. It securely bridges the XRP ecosystem with the expansive world of DeFi, providing holders with new avenues for growth and utility. This move not only empowers individual users but also strengthens the interconnected fabric of the blockchain industry, paving the way for a more fluid and functional digital asset landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is the main benefit of using wrapped XRP (wXRP)? A: The primary benefit is accessing DeFi applications on other blockchains (like Ethereum) using the value of your XRP holdings without having to sell them. Q: Is my XRP safe when it’s wrapped by Hex Trust? A: Hex Trust is a regulated, institutional custodian. Your original XRP is held in their secure, insured custody while you use the wXRP representation on other chains. Q: Can I unwrap my wXRP back to native XRP? A: Yes. A key function of Hex Trust’s service is allowing you to redeem your wXRP tokens to receive your native XRP back at a 1:1 ratio. Q: On which blockchains will wXRP be available? A> While the initial report doesn’t specify, wrapped assets typically target EVM-compatible chains like Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche to access their large DeFi ecosystems. Q: Do I need a Hex Trust account to use wXRP? A> To mint or redeem wXRP through their official service, yes. However, once wXRP is in circulation on other chains, you may trade or use it in DeFi protocols like any other ERC-20 token. Q: Are there fees for wrapping or unwrapping XRP? A> Custody and issuance services typically involve fees. You should check Hex Trust’s official platform for their specific fee structure for the wXRP service.

This development follows the expansion of Prediction markets’ presence throughout the U.S., offering “event contracts” on sports, elections, news, entertainment, and other topics. Coinbase prepares to launch tokenized stocks and prediction markets Coinbase, the U.S.’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, will unveil its products at a showcase on December 17, according to the person, who asked not to be named because the information had not yet been made public. Its tokenized stocks will be launched in-house, not through partners, they said. Initially, Coinbase executives said that they intend to enter these businesses, but they have not yet officially announced their plans. Still, screenshots of apps have been circulating on social network X, hinting at the functionality for several weeks. When contacted for feedback, a Coinbase spokesperson declined to comment specifically on the company’s plans but said, “Tune in to the livestream on Dec. 17 to find out what new products Coinbase is shipping.” The development is part of the company’s push to become an “everything app,” enabling traders to access multiple assets and markets, and to keep pace with competitors who are also diversifying. Earlier this year, Robinhood Markets released prediction market products from Kalshi Inc. Additionally, Robinhood and the crypto exchange Kraken have tokenized U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds, although only outside the U.S. Data from tracker rwa.xyz shows that trading in tokenized equities, which are digital stocks tied to blockchain, has been rising, with monthly transfer volume up 32% in the last month to $1.45 billion. Rising popularity of prediction markets attracts crypto and retail platforms Prediction markets, where users can bet on events such as sports and elections, have experienced a surge in popularity over the past year, attracting attention from both traditional financial exchanges and cryptocurrency platforms. This week, Gemini, the crypto exchange co-founded by billionaire twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, received approval to launch its own prediction markets. Crypto.com, another exchange, has partnered with the likes of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. to help them launch prediction markets. Coinbase is announcing the new products as the crypto market continues to teeter after a sharp October selloff. The company’s shares are still up 8.3% this year. In related development, Kalshi and Crypto.com have also established a national alliance of prediction market operators, which includes cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, retail trading platform Robinhood, and sports gaming operator Underdog. The group, the Coalition for Prediction Markets (CPM), has followed the boom in U.S. prediction markets since the start of the year. A federal court’s dismissal last year of a prohibition on election betting has also fueled the sector’s surge. “This was the catalyst for growing investor interest, and this new coalition will further legitimize the sector, strengthening operating rules and setting a higher bar for integrity standards,” said Nick Jones, founder of crypto firm Zumo. Prediction market platforms enable users to trade binary contracts on various outcomes, including politics, sports, economics, and entertainment.

Caroline Pham, the acting Chair and commissioner of CFTC, hinted at this decision. In a statement dated Thursday, December 11, Pham mentioned that the CFTC will reverse guidelines from 2020 that follow the Dodd-Frank Act, a federal regulation established in 2010 to address issues raised from the 2008 financial crisis. Notably, these guidelines, set to be withdrawn, concentrate on the “actual delivery” of digital assets. The move follows the recent publication of a list comprising the first members of its CEO Innovation Council. Sources close to the situation revealed that this council was established to review transformations in the derivatives market, with a specific focus on cryptocurrency, tokenization, and blockchain technology. Notably, some of the major crypto industry CEOs joining this council include Shayne Coplan from Polymarket , Tyler Winklevoss from Gemini, and Arjun Sethi from Kraken. Leaders from prominent companies, including Nasdaq, Intercontinental Exchange, CME Group, and Cboe Global Markets, will accompany them. This team of CEOs was formed over a period of just two weeks. According to Pham, the focus will primarily be on advancements in sectors such as derivatives markets connected to tokenization, crypto assets, 24/7 trading, perpetual contracts, prediction markets, and blockchain infrastructure. The White House issues an order mandating the CFTC to oversee digital assets The CFTC’s sudden decision has ignited heated debates in the crypto ecosystem. In an attempt to address this controversy, Pham alleged that this move aligns with US President Donald Trump’s earlier proposals, as presented in a report by his Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. Following these suggestions, sources close to the situation highlighted that the White House released a detailed report on cryptocurrency over the summer. This report addressed topics such as illicit finance and tax evasion. It also mandated that the CFTC be granted the opportunity to oversee digital assets. Responding to this announcement, Pham noted, “Today’s announcement demonstrates that we can make real progress to protect Americans by ensuring access to safe U.S. markets.” Meanwhile, reports have noted that since Trump assumed the presidency of the United States, Pham has led several projects at the CFTC focused on supporting the crypto ecosystem. Some of these initiatives include the introduction of the “Crypto Sprint,” which was designed to establish clear regulations for cryptocurrencies. To further demonstrate the commission’s efforts to back the crypto industry, the acting chair unveiled last week that Bitnomial positioned itself as the first exchange to successfully list spot crypto products after securing approval from regulators. Additionally, a major, regulated cryptocurrency exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, Gemini, received clearance from the CFTC on Wednesday, December 10, allowing it to provide users with classic binary event contracts. As cryptocurrencies become increasingly adopted among individuals, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency declared this week that national banks are granted permission to directly engage in “riskless principal” transactions involving digital assets. Trump’s pro-crypto stance encourages more exposure to the crypto industry Regarding Bitnomial’s move to provide spot cryptocurrency products approved by regulators, analysts acknowledge that this practice demonstrates the Trump administration and federal agencies’ efforts to encourage a more positive attitude towards the crypto industry. Pham, on the other hand, mentioned that such a moment illustrates “a new golden age for innovation in America.” At this time, Bitnomial was about to introduce its services officially. “The CFTC has a strong tradition of encouraging responsible innovation on futures exchanges while balancing regulatory flexibility with essential principles that protect both institutional and retail traders,” the acting chair said. She added that this administration has developed a comprehensive plan, under the guidance of the U.S. president, to purposefully ensure the country reclaims its position as a leader in digital asset markets globally. In this plan, Pham asserted that the CFTC will play a key role. Following the “Crypto Sprint” initiative, sources stated that this move came after the SEC and CFTC released a joint statement in September, clarifying that registered exchanges are allowed to promote the trading of certain spot commodity products, including crypto assets.

55665995,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=244077,1765503611,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Sui Blockchain: The Revolutionary Car Leaving Ethereum’s Carriage Behind,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sui-blockchain-ethereum-comparison-future/,"BitcoinWorld Sui Blockchain: The Revolutionary Car Leaving Ethereum’s Carriage Behind Imagine a world where blockchain technology evolves from horse-drawn carriages to high-speed vehicles. That’s exactly the powerful analogy Christian Thompson, Managing Director of the Sui Foundation, uses to describe the Sui blockchain versus Ethereum. In a recent interview, Thompson made bold claims about Sui’s position in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, suggesting we’re witnessing a fundamental shift in how blockchains operate. Why is the Sui Blockchain Considered a Modern Vehicle? Christian Thompson’s carriage versus car comparison isn’t just marketing hype. It represents a fundamental difference in architectural philosophy. While Ethereum pioneered smart contracts and decentralized applications, its design faces scalability challenges. The Sui blockchain , however, was engineered from the ground up with different priorities. Thompson explains that Sui started as a Layer 1 solution specifically to create what he calls “a fast and efficient network.” This means the team didn’t simply copy existing blockchain designs. Instead, they reimagined core components like transaction processing and data storage. The result? A blockchain that promises to handle significantly more transactions per second while maintaining security and decentralization. What Makes Sui a Top-Tier Layer 1 Solution? According to Thompson, the Sui blockchain has moved beyond comparing itself to other chains. He asserts it has firmly established itself among elite Layer 1 blockchains. This confidence comes from several technical advantages: Parallel transaction processing that eliminates bottlenecks Object-centric architecture that differs from account-based models Built-in scalability that grows with network demand Enhanced interoperability with other blockchain ecosystems These features address pain points that have plagued earlier blockchain generations. For example, parallel processing means multiple transactions can occur simultaneously rather than waiting in line. This approach fundamentally changes how networks handle increased activity. How Does Sui Enable Institutional Blockchain Adoption? Thompson emphasizes a crucial point about the Sui blockchain : its design directly supports institutional adoption. Traditional financial institutions and large enterprises have specific requirements that many blockchains struggle to meet. These include predictable transaction costs, guaranteed finality times, and enterprise-grade security. The Sui Foundation director argues that high-performance Layer 1 solutions like Sui provide the necessary foundation for serious institutional involvement. When transaction speeds resemble traditional digital systems and costs remain stable even during peak demand, blockchain technology becomes viable for mainstream business applications. This represents a significant step beyond speculative trading and into practical utility. What Challenges Does the Sui Blockchain Face? Despite its technical advantages, the Sui blockchain confronts substantial hurdles. The most significant challenge isn’t technological but rather ecosystem development. Ethereum boasts a massive network effect with thousands of developers, applications, and users. Building comparable community engagement takes time and strategic effort. Additionally, the blockchain space has seen numerous “Ethereum killers” come and go. Each promised revolutionary improvements but struggled to gain lasting traction. Sui must demonstrate not just technical superiority but also sustainable growth in real-world usage. The project needs compelling applications that drive genuine user adoption beyond speculative interest. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts For those following blockchain development, the evolution of the Sui blockchain offers valuable lessons. First, technological innovation continues at a rapid pace in cryptocurrency. Second, architectural decisions made during a blockchain’s creation have long-lasting implications. Third, institutional adoption requires specific technical characteristics that newer blockchains are specifically designing for. Thompson’s perspective suggests we’re entering a new phase of blockchain development where performance and practicality take priority over being first to market. As the technology matures, the focus shifts from what’s possible to what’s practical for widespread use. The Future Road for Sui and Blockchain Technology The carriage versus car analogy powerfully captures blockchain’s evolution. Early systems like Ethereum proved the concept worked, much like carriages proved wheeled transportation worked. Now, projects like the Sui blockchain aim to optimize that concept for mass adoption, similar to how cars transformed personal transportation. Thompson’s vision positions Sui not as an Ethereum replacement but as part of blockchain’s natural progression. Different solutions will serve different needs, with high-performance options like Sui potentially dominating applications requiring speed and efficiency. The ultimate test will be whether developers and users embrace this new architecture for their decentralized applications. Frequently Asked Questions What is the main difference between Sui and Ethereum? Sui uses a parallel transaction processing model and object-centric architecture, while Ethereum uses sequential processing and an account-based model. This fundamental difference allows Sui to potentially handle more transactions simultaneously. Is Sui really faster than Ethereum? Based on its architecture, Sui is designed for higher throughput and lower latency. However, real-world performance depends on network conditions, application design, and adoption levels. Laboratory tests show promising results, but widespread usage will provide the true test. Can Sui applications interact with Ethereum applications? Yes, Sui was designed with interoperability in mind. While direct interaction requires bridging solutions or cross-chain protocols, the blockchain includes features to facilitate communication with other networks including Ethereum. What types of applications benefit most from Sui’s architecture? Applications requiring high transaction volumes with low fees benefit most. This includes gaming platforms, decentralized exchanges, social media applications, and any system expecting frequent user interactions. How does Sui achieve its scalability? Sui uses several techniques including parallel transaction execution, efficient data storage methods, and a consensus mechanism optimized for its architecture. These combine to allow the network to scale with increased demand. Is Sui secure despite being newer than Ethereum? Sui employs robust cryptographic techniques and has undergone multiple security audits. However, as with any newer blockchain, it has less battle-tested history than Ethereum. The team prioritizes security in its development process. Found this comparison between Sui and Ethereum enlightening?

What Is the Vision for a Crypto-AI Economy? This is more than just a technical project; it’s an economic blueprint. The ultimate goal is to foster a vibrant crypto-AI economy. In this new economy, autonomous AI agents could operate seamlessly. They could license data and models directly on-chain and, crucially, automatically pay or receive royalties based on actual usage. This creates a self-sustaining ecosystem for innovation. Consider this actionable insight: For developers, this means a new revenue model where their AI creations can generate continuous, micro-transaction-based income. For enterprises, it offers a verifiable audit trail for compliance and ethical AI sourcing. The potential is transformative. What Are the Challenges Ahead? Building this future is not without obstacles. The technology for scalable, cost-effective verifiable computation is still maturing. Furthermore, achieving widespread adoption requires convincing developers and companies to migrate to a new paradigm. However, the partnership between Story Protocol and EigenCloud represents a significant step toward overcoming these hurdles. Their combined expertise in IP management and decentralized infrastructure is a powerful combination. In summary, the collaboration to build a verifiable AI infrastructure is a pivotal development at the intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence. By proving data origin and automating IP royalties on-chain, it lays the foundation for a more transparent, fair, and innovative AI-driven future. This initiative could very well redefine how we create, share, and monetize intelligence in the digital age. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is verifiable AI infrastructure?

While many expected a stronger reaction from Ethereum, the asset instead slipped lower as traders reassessed the macro environment and the implications of a potential shift toward stagflation. Despite this pullback, on-chain data suggests that the underlying market structure may be quietly improving. According to new insights from CryptoQuant, Ethereum’s Net Taker Volume (30-day moving average) is showing a clear upward trend in its lows. This metric tracks the balance between aggressive buyers and sellers in the derivatives market . Although ETH remains under selling pressure, the data reveals that the intensity of aggressive selling has been weakening steadily over the past several weeks. Each subsequent negative low is forming higher than the previous one, signaling that sellers are losing dominance. While the broader sentiment remains cautious, subtle improvements in Net Taker Volume suggest that ETH’s current weakness may be masking the early stage of a larger structural shift. Net Taker Volume Signals a Potential Structural Shift According to CryptoQuant’s CoinCare, Ethereum may once again be approaching a pivotal turning point. The report highlights that a similar Net Taker Volume structure appeared earlier this year. After forming a clear bottom in January 2025, the metric began to trend upward—even while remaining in the negative zone—indicating that aggressive sellers were gradually losing strength. By April, Net Taker Volume flipped decisively into positive territory. From that exact moment, Ethereum entered one of its strongest rallies of the cycle, surging more than 3x and printing a new all-time high. Current conditions echo that same pattern. Since the peak of selling pressure in September, the market has continuously absorbed sell flows for nearly three months. Each negative low in Net Taker Volume has formed higher than the previous one, revealing improving market resilience despite the broader downtrend. If this trajectory holds, CoinCare estimates that a positive flip in Net Taker Volume may be only about a month away. Historically, this transition from negative to positive has marked the beginning of Ethereum’s most explosive breakout phases. A confirmed move into positive territory would represent a high-probability trigger for the next expansion toward new all-time highs, signaling that momentum is quietly rebuilding beneath the surface. ETH Weekly Structure Attempts a Recovery Ethereum’s weekly chart shows the market attempting to stabilize after several weeks of volatility, with price currently trading near $3,195 following a strong rebound from the $2,800 zone. This area acted as a key demand region in mid-2024 and has once again provided support, preventing a deeper breakdown. The recent weekly candle reflects renewed buying interest, closing firmly above the 50-week moving average, a level that often defines medium-term trend direction. Despite this rebound, ETH still faces structural challenges. The 100-week moving average — now overhead — has acted as resistance throughout the current downtrend, and the price rejected it again on the latest push toward $3,447. Until Ethereum can reclaim this dynamic resistance with conviction, the broader trend remains neutral to slightly bearish. Volume also shows a notable shift: sell-side activity has been declining over the past month, while buyers are beginning to step in more aggressively at key support levels. This aligns with the improvement in on-chain metrics, suggesting weakening selling pressure. For bulls, the next major objective is a weekly close above $3,400, which would signal a potential trend reversal. A failure to break this level, however, risks another retest of $2,900–$2,800, where market sentiment would again be tested.

Some analysts have suggested that the cryptocurrency is setting the stage for a massive short-term and mid-term rally if the retests of current levels hold. Related Reading: Cathie Wood Says Bitcoin Is ‘Climbing Another Wall Of Worry’– Here’s Why Dogecoin Prepares For $1 Milestone On Thursday, Dogecoin followed the rest of the crypto market and retraced to the $0.136-$0.138 levels. The cryptocurrency has retraced around 50% following the Q4 market downturn, trading within the $0.130-$0.155 price range over the past few weeks. Amid this week’s recovery, DOGE’s price briefly tested the local range highs, trying to break out of this area for the second time this month. However, Wednesday’s volatility, driven by the expectations of the Federal Reserve’s rate cut announcement, led to a 4.6% intraday drop before continuing its descent to the current levels. Market observer Trader Tardigrade highlighted the cryptocurrency’s performance, noting that Dogecoin is holding strong at a key support area despite the pullback, which could “potentially set the stage for a massive surge to $1” next year. According to the chart, DOGE is retesting an ascending support zone that has preceded major moves over the past two years. Since late 2023, this support has been retested three times, marking the bottom of each major corrective phase and serving as a “launchpad” to new highs. Notably, the subsequent rally’s size and duration have seen an increasing trend, with the bounces lasting longer and reaching higher levels after each retest of the two-year trendline. During the first rebound, Dogecoin rallied 87% in eight weeks. Meanwhile, DOGE surged by over 210% in ten weeks after retesting this crucial level. Lastly, it registered a 14-week 442% run between Q3 and Q4, 2024, to its multi-year high of $0.48. With the price currently retesting this level once again, the analyst suggested that a rally to the $1 mark could be brewing if the current levels hold. A bounce from this area could kick off a 610% jump at the start of 2026. DOGE’s Rally To September Highs Imminent? The trader also pointed out that DOGE’s MACD Bullish Crossover “is now happening.” He explained that the cryptocurrency’s trend began shifting from a downtrend to an uptrend on Wednesday, suggesting a significant price move is to follow. He previously affirmed that this setup has preceded previous breakouts this year, with the price surging to new local highs in Q2 and Q3 after each MACD bullish cross. As this setup begins to unfold, the analyst’s chart suggests that the price could bounce to the October levels. Similarly, other market observers hinted that Dogecoin could be preparing for a 60%-120% surge in the short term. Analyst Bitcoinsensus highlighted a classic bullish reversal pattern, a falling wedge pattern, that has been forming since October in DOGE’s chart.

If we get a decent breakout above the upper yellow line, we could be targeting the 0.20$ area (+60%),” the analyst stated. Meanwhile, AltCryptoTalk recently noted that Dogecoin is retesting “the same weekly demand zone that sparked every major rally in the past,” which could spark a 115% rally to the $0.30 September high if the area holds. As of this writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.137, an 8% decline in the weekly timeframe.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs and Macquarie Securities both told the trading floor this week that Kunlunxin, Baidu’s chip unit, will unlock serious value if it goes public, advising investors to start considering it. Hong Kong-listed shares of Baidu have now had their average price target boosted by around 60% since late August, which was just a little over 3 months ago, and the third-largest rally across the Hang Seng Tech Index entire history. China’s state regulator has approved the public listing of Kunlunxin in Hong Kong, meaning an AI chip unit ran by the CCP is going to have its own stock by this time next year. It’s all so serious. Baidu’s chip unit pulls in big orders and bigger bets Since China Mobile, a state-owned telecom giant, handed Kunlunxin its first big chip order, Baidu’s stock has surged 45%, and that was before the IPO talk even started. Ellie Jiang, an analyst at Macquarie, said Kunlunxin is now worth around $16.5 billion based on Baidu’s 59% ownership, which is about 30% of her total valuation for the company. Ellie is predicting that Kunlunxin’s revenue will double to $1.4 billion next year, putting it neck and neck with Cambricon Technologies, the domestic chipmaker that global retail investors love to call “China’s Nvidia.” But hey, Cambricon is dealing with capacity bottlenecks, and Huawei is still dealing with foreign tech restrictions, so they’re not really ready to face Nvidia right now. Kunlunxin, on the other hand, already has a real customer base and is deeply integrated across Baidu’s cloud platform, powering its AI models, infrastructure, and applications. Goldman Sachs argued that Baidu’s edge is growing as demand shifts toward inference chips. “Baidu Cloud can offer alternative options for AI models inference and even training tasks, at competitive pricing,” said the bank in a research note Thursday. “As chip demand moves towards inference usage over time, Baidu’s Kunlun could be a good fit for users given its high inference efficiency.” Nvidia hits a wall as China boosts local players While Donald Trump just approved restricted access to Nvidia’s H200 chips for China after nearly a year of delays, that green light didn’t go very far. Xi Jinping immediately responded that he would still limit imports of Nvidia’s chips. His priority, he said, was pushing domestic firms like Kunlunxin instead. It wasn’t expected, but also kind of was. This is the AI Wars after all, and as much as Trump likes to say it, Jinping isn’t actually his friend. For China, the priority remains global tech dominance. They’ve been saying that for at least a decade now. ANyway, this leaves Nvidia more exposed, because as Jensen Huang has said time and time again, his company still needs the Chinese market. Without it, all of the company’s plans kind of come to a bit of a halt. We can prove it too. In Q3, Nvidia’s accounts receivable (money customers owe) jumped $16 billion to $33 billion. But accounts payable, the money Nvidia owes, only climbed $3 billion to $8 billion. That massive gap now has to be funded while Nvidia waits to get paid. And oh boy, things aren’t going smoothly in the markets either. Invesco’s SPHQ ETF, which dumped Nvidia in June, had been beating iShares’ QUAL fund all year… until now. Over the past six months, SPHQ has underperformed by the biggest margin since 2013, except for QUAL’s launch period. Even among so-called “quality” stocks, Nvidia’s current financial setup is triggering volatility that’s throwing off traditional fund strategies. Meanwhile, institutional investors are loading up on Chinese tech. Vanguard, BlackRock, and Fidelity have all been quietly increasing their holdings in Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares. That’s not all. Tencent and Baidu, both building out large-language models for generative AI, have seen their stocks rise by nearly 50%. The trend isn’t slowing. Amundi, BNP Paribas, Fidelity International, and Man Group all expect Chinese equities to keep climbing into 2026. JPMorgan Chase just raised its rating on the market to overweight. And Gary Tan, a fund manager at Allspring Global Investments, called the asset class “indispensable” for foreign money managers now chasing growth outside the US.

Lack of firm dip buying kept Bitcoin’s gains limited. Samer Hasn, senior market analyst at XS.com, said the market still lacks committed buyers, which leaves prices vulnerable. He noted that more than $220M in long liquidations today show leveraged traders pulling back rather than positioning for a rebound. Those liquidations added to the sense that speculative leverage is being flushed out rather than rebuilt, a pattern that often leaves spot moves choppy even when broader risk sentiment improves. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $92,331, up 2.4% Ether : $3,248, up 0.7% XRP : $2.04, up 1.6% Total crypto market cap: $3.23 trillion, up 1.9% Asia Traders Watch Positioning Shifts As ETF Inflows Offer Brief Support For traders in Asia, that backdrop keeps the focus on positioning data and funding rates as much as on the headline price. One support pillar came from US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Data provider SoSo Value reported more than $223M of net inflows on Thursday, the strongest reading in twenty days. In the current environment, however, these flows may reflect short-term positioning rather than sticky institutional demand, and could reverse quickly if equity markets wobble again. Bitfinex analysts said the next moves will hinge on Fed signals, Treasury market reactions, ETF flows and the behaviour of ETH relative to BTC. They noted that the steady rise in ETH/BTC, even with low network fees, suggests capital is rotating back into Ethereum’s longer-term story, making the pair a useful gauge of risk appetite in crypto. Global Benchmarks Hit New Highs As Traders Position For Gentler Fed Settings Global markets have been recalibrating since the Federal Reserve delivered a third consecutive interest rate cut this week while sounding less hawkish than many feared. The move helped lift the MSCI All Country World Index to a new closing high and pushed the dollar index down to a two-month low near 98.30, as traders leaned into the idea that policy is slowly shifting toward easier settings.

Traders are still betting on two cuts in 2026 even though the Fed’s latest projections point to only one. In equity markets, MSCI’s broad index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan rose about 0.7%, tracking Thursday’s mostly higher close in the US, where the Dow and Russell 2000 both notched new highs while the Nasdaq dipped. The move extended a global rally that has favoured cyclicals and small caps, a backdrop that often helps sentiment in higher beta assets such as crypto. Japan Outperforms As Softbank Jumps, While Wall Street Futures Turn Cautious Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 outperformed in morning trade, climbing around 1%. Shares in SoftBank Group jumped about 6% after a Bloomberg News report said the conglomerate is considering an acquisition of the US data centre company Switch Inc, a deal that investors see as another way to capitalise on rising demand for AI infrastructure. Futures pointed to a more cautious open for Wall Street. S&P 500 e-mini contracts were little changed in Asian hours, while Nasdaq futures slipped about 0.2% after Oracle shares plunged 13% overnight. The company’s heavy spending plans and weak forecasts fanned doubts over how quickly large AI investments will translate into profit, triggering a fresh round of tech selling. Tech sentiment was mixed even within the AI complex. Broadcom projected first-quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates, offering some reassurance, but its shares fell about 5% in late trading after it warned that margins would narrow because a higher share of sales is coming from AI.

That future just took a giant leap forward. Ant Group, the Chinese fintech titan, has successfully completed a landmark test for cross-border tokenized deposits in partnership with banking behemoth HSBC and the global messaging network SWIFT. This trial isn’t just another tech experiment; it’s a potential blueprint for the next generation of international finance. What Exactly Is a Cross-Border Tokenized Deposit? Let’s break down this complex-sounding term. A tokenized deposit is a digital representation of money held in a bank. Think of it as a secure, digital twin of your traditional bank balance. This ‘token’ can be programmed and moved on a blockchain or similar digital ledger. Therefore, a cross-border tokenized deposit test involves moving these digital representations of money between banks in different countries. The recent trial by Ant International, HSBC, and SWIFT proved this concept works using established global standards, signaling a major shift in how value might travel in the future. Why Does This Ant Group Test Matter for Global Finance? This collaboration is a powerful signal from major financial players. Here’s why this test is a game-changer: Speed and Efficiency: Traditional cross-border payments can be slow, taking days to settle. Tokenization could slash this time to minutes or even seconds. Transparency and Cost: Every step of a tokenized transaction is recorded. This transparency can reduce errors, cut down on intermediary fees, and lower costs for businesses and consumers. Programmable Money: Tokenized deposits can have rules attached. This opens doors for automated payments, smart contracts in trade finance, and more complex financial products. Interoperability is Key: The test used the ISO 20022 standard through SWIFT. This is crucial because it shows a path where new tokenized systems can work alongside the existing global financial infrastructure, not replace it overnight. What Were the Key Components of the Trial? The success of this cross-border tokenized deposit pilot hinged on three pillars. First, Ant International provided the technological expertise and platform from the fintech world. Second, HSBC brought the deep institutional banking knowledge and global reach. Finally, SWIFT and the ISO 20022 standard acted as the universal translator, ensuring the new tokenized messages could be understood across different financial institutions and borders. This powerful trio demonstrates a practical model for future industry-wide adoption. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Tokenized Deposits? Despite the exciting progress, the road to widespread use of cross-border tokenized deposits has hurdles. Regulatory frameworks vary wildly between countries, and creating a harmonized global approach will be complex. Furthermore, banks must invest significantly in new technology and security systems to handle digital assets. Widespread public and corporate trust in these new digital instruments also needs to be built. However, tests like this one are essential for identifying and solving these challenges in a controlled environment. A Compelling Summary: The Future is Tokenizing The Ant Group, HSBC, and SWIFT trial is more than a technical proof-of-concept. It is a bold statement about the future direction of money. By successfully testing a cross-border tokenized deposit , these giants have shown that the immense efficiency of blockchain technology can be integrated into the trusted, regulated world of traditional banking. This paves the way for a financial system that is faster, cheaper, and more transparent for everyone. The era of programmable, digital money moving across borders is no longer a distant dream—it’s being built today. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is Ant Group’s role in this test? A: Ant Group, through its global arm Ant International, provided the technological platform and expertise for the tokenization and transfer of the digital deposits. Q: Does this mean cryptocurrencies are being used? A: Not exactly. This test involved tokenized deposits , which are digital representations of traditional currency (like USD or EUR) held in regulated banks. It’s different from volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Q: How does SWIFT fit into a blockchain-based test? A> SWIFT acted as the secure messaging layer. It carried the standardized data (using ISO 20022) about the tokenized transaction between the participating banks, proving that new token networks can work with existing financial messaging systems. Q: When will I be able to use tokenized deposits? A> Widespread consumer use is still years away. This was a pilot test. Broader adoption depends on regulatory development, further industry testing, and technological integration by banks worldwide. Q: What are the main benefits for an average person? A> In the future, you could see much faster international money transfers (like remittances), significantly lower fees for sending money abroad, and greater transparency in tracking your cross-border payments. Did you find this deep dive into the future of cross-border finance insightful? This move by Ant Group, HSBC, and SWIFT could reshape how the world moves money.

The latest update introduces two powerful features: seamless cryptocurrency transfers and an encrypted chat function. This evolution signals Worldcoin’s ambition to create a comprehensive, user-centric ecosystem built around its unique proof-of-personhood technology. What’s New in the Worldcoin App? According to a report from Bitcoin World, the updated Worldcoin app now allows users to send and receive WLD tokens directly. Moreover, it includes a built-in messaging platform called World Chat. This dual enhancement transforms the app from a verification tool into a functional hub for digital interaction and finance. Therefore, users have more reasons to engage with the platform daily. How Do the New Crypto Transfers Work? The transfer feature is designed for practicality. It supports virtual accounts, which opens up several real-world use cases. For instance, users can now receive salaries in cryptocurrency or easily deposit and withdraw cash. This functionality lowers the barrier to using crypto for everyday transactions, moving Worldcoin closer to its vision of a global financial network. Send/Receive WLD: Instantly transfer the native WLD token. Virtual Accounts: Facilitate salaries and cash operations. User-Friendly: Simplifies the process for mainstream adoption. Is World Chat a Game-Changer for Privacy? World Chat is not just another messaging feature. It includes a crucial tool that verifies if the person you’re chatting with is a unique, authenticated human. This built-in verification leverages Worldcoin’s core iris-scanning technology to combat bots and spam. Consequently, it promises a more secure and trustworthy communication environment within the Worldcoin app ecosystem. What Does This Mean for User Adoption? A project representative stated the update aims to increase user interaction. By bundling finance, communication, and identity, the Worldcoin app becomes a more sticky product. Furthermore, the company plans to simplify its iris authentication process in the future. This planned simplification is key to lowering the verification barrier and onboarding millions more users globally. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities? While the features are promising, Worldcoin faces ongoing scrutiny regarding data privacy and the centralization of biometric data. However, if it can navigate these concerns while delivering tangible utility, the Worldcoin app could set a new standard for verified digital ecosystems. The integration of chat and payments creates a powerful network effect that could drive unprecedented growth. In conclusion, Worldcoin’s latest update is a strategic leap forward. By adding crypto transfers and encrypted chat, the Worldcoin app is no longer just about proving ‘you are you’—it’s about what you can do once that’s established. This shift towards a multi-functional platform could be the catalyst that propels Worldcoin from a controversial project to a widely used tool in the digital economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Can I transfer any cryptocurrency in the Worldcoin app? A: Currently, the transfer function supports the native WLD token. The feature is designed for WLD transactions, salaries, and cash operations via virtual accounts. Q: How does World Chat verify the other user? A: World Chat includes a tool that checks if the other party has been authenticated through Worldcoin’s iris-scanning Orb. This aims to confirm they are a unique human, not a bot. Q: Is the chat feature completely private? A: The report describes it as an ‘encrypted chat feature,’ which suggests a focus on security. However, users should review the app’s specific privacy policy for details on encryption standards and data handling. Q: Will the iris verification process change? A: Yes. A project representative confirmed plans to simplify the iris authentication process in the future to make verification easier and more accessible. Q: What is the main goal of this update? A: The primary goal is to increase user interaction and engagement by making the Worldcoin app a more versatile platform for both finance and communication. Q: Where can I download the updated Worldcoin app? A: The app is available through official mobile app stores. Always ensure you are downloading the genuine application from the official Worldcoin project channels. Found this breakdown of the new Worldcoin app features helpful?

Right now, a fascinating shift is happening behind the scenes. While corporate buyers slow their roll, Bitcoin miners are seizing a golden opportunity. They’re strategically accumulating BTC at prices below the market average, giving them a unique advantage in the current landscape. Let’s explore why this trend matters and what it reveals about market dynamics. Why Are Bitcoin Miners Buying Cheap BTC Now? A recent report from BitcoinTreasuries, highlighted by Cointelegraph, reveals a clear trend. Bitcoin miners are in an enviable position. They can acquire new Bitcoin through their mining operations at a cost often below the open market price. This allows them to build their reserves without competing directly with other buyers. Meanwhile, the usual heavyweights—corporate Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) companies—are taking a breather. This creates a perfect storm for accumulation. Miners are essentially getting a discount on their primary asset. Therefore, they can strengthen their balance sheets during a period of relative market calm. This strategic move highlights their long-term confidence in the Bitcoin network. What’s Causing the Corporate Slowdown? On the other side of the equation, corporate buying has noticeably cooled. DAT companies are projected to purchase only 40,000 BTC in the fourth quarter. This represents the lowest volume since Q3 of last year. So, what’s behind this hesitation? Portfolio Digestion: Many firms are still processing their recent, large-scale acquisitions. Risk Assessment: The recent price volatility, with BTC dipping below $90,000, has prompted a more cautious approach. Unrealized Losses: The report states about two-thirds of the 100 companies holding BTC are currently sitting on unrealized losses, which may discourage further immediate investment. This corporate pause is not necessarily a sign of lost faith. Instead, it indicates a period of consolidation and strategic review. How Does This Impact the Broader Bitcoin Market? This divergence between miner and corporate activity has several implications. First, it shows a healthy, multi-faceted market. Not all participants move in lockstep. Miners, with their direct connection to the network’s security, often have a different investment horizon than public corporations. Second, sustained buying from miners can act as a stabilizing force. They provide consistent, below-market demand that isn’t solely driven by short-term price speculation. Moreover, their actions signal a strong belief in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition, regardless of quarterly price fluctuations. What Can We Learn From This Trend? This situation offers valuable insights for any crypto observer. It demonstrates that smart money looks for opportunities during periods of uncertainty. While headlines might focus on price drops or corporate pauses, savvy players like Bitcoin miners are actively building their positions. For the average investor, it’s a reminder of the importance of a long-term perspective and cost-averaging strategies. The entities closest to Bitcoin’s core infrastructure are choosing to accumulate, not retreat. Conclusion: A Strategic Shift in Bitcoin Accumulation In summary, the current market phase highlights a strategic divergence. Bitcoin miners are capitalizing on their operational advantage to buy cheap BTC, fortifying their holdings for the future. Concurrently, corporate treasuries are in a temporary holding pattern, reassessing their strategies. This dynamic underscores the resilience and complexity of the Bitcoin ecosystem. It proves that even when one group of buyers steps back, others see a compelling opportunity to step forward and strengthen the network from within. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Why can Bitcoin miners buy BTC cheaper than the market price? A: Miners earn new Bitcoin as a block reward for securing the network. Their cost is primarily their operational expense (electricity, hardware). If this cost is lower than the market price, they effectively acquire BTC at a discount. Q: Is the corporate slowdown in buying BTC a bad sign? A: Not necessarily. It often indicates digestion of past purchases and prudent risk management. It’s a pause, not necessarily a permanent exit. Q: What does ‘unrealized loss’ mean for corporate BTC holders? A: It means the current market price of the Bitcoin they hold is below the price they paid for it. The loss is “unrealized” because they haven’t sold the asset. Q: Could miner accumulation drive the Bitcoin price up? A> While miners add consistent demand, price is influenced by many factors. However, reduced selling pressure from miners (if they hold) and steady accumulation can be supportive for the market over time. Q: How long might this trend of Bitcoin miners buying cheap BTC last? A> It’s tied to market conditions and mining economics. If the price falls further relative to mining costs, their advantage grows. The trend may last as long as corporate demand remains subdued and mining remains profitable. Q: Should retail investors follow the miners’ lead? A> Investors should never follow any single group blindly. However, understanding the strategic moves of key network participants like miners can provide valuable context for making informed personal investment decisions.

Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon, the central figure behind one of crypto’s most catastrophic failures, stood before a judge and the world to deliver a long-awaited statement. Do Kwon apologizes to victims , offering remorse for the immense financial ruin stemming from the $40 billion Terra-Luna ecosystem collapse. This sentencing marks a significant chapter in holding crypto leaders accountable. What Did Do Kwon Say in Court During His Sentencing? Wearing a yellow prison jumpsuit, Do Kwon addressed the court directly. He stated that the stories from hundreds of victims were heartbreaking. These victims had sent letters detailing their devastating losses following his extradition to the United States in 2024. His words served as a stark reminder of the profound damage caused by the project’s failure. Following the hearing, his defense team emphasized his genuine remorse and his commitment to working toward compensating those who lost funds. Why Was Do Kwon Sentenced to 15 Years in Prison? The court handed down a 15-year prison sentence after convicting Kwon on nine criminal charges. These charges were directly related to the fraud that led to the implosion of the Terra (LUNA) and TerraUSD (UST) tokens in May 2022. The collapse erased nearly $40 billion in market value almost overnight. Key factors in the sentencing included: The massive scale of investor losses. The hundreds of victim impact statements submitted to the court. The determination that Kwon’s actions constituted serious financial fraud. This case sets a crucial precedent for regulatory action within the cryptocurrency industry. What Was the Plea Deal for Do Kwon? Prior to the sentencing, Do Kwon reached an agreement with U.S. prosecutors. He pleaded guilty to select charges in exchange for a potential reduction in his prison location. The arrangement could allow him to serve half of his 15-year sentence in another country, such as his home nation of South Korea. However, this transfer is not guaranteed and depends on international agreements. Therefore, while he expressed remorse, the legal process ensures significant consequences for his role in the collapse. What Does This Mean for Crypto Regulation and Victims? The sentencing of Do Kwon sends a powerful message. It demonstrates that authorities will pursue legal action against individuals responsible for large-scale crypto fraud. For the victims, the statement that Do Kwon apologizes to victims is a small step. The real test will be the follow-through on compensation efforts promised by his defense team. This case highlights several critical points for the industry: Accountability: Founders can be held personally liable. Investor Caution: The importance of due diligence in decentralized finance. Regulatory Focus: Increased scrutiny on algorithmic stablecoins and tokenomics. The aftermath continues to shape how new projects are built and marketed. Conclusion: A Landmark Moment of Accountability The image of Do Kwon in court, stating that he wanted to apologize to all his victims, closes a painful chapter for many investors. His 15-year sentence represents one of the most substantial penalties ever given to a cryptocurrency executive. It underscores a new era of enforcement and the human cost behind market crashes. While the apology is noted, the industry and victims now watch to see if actions will match words in the long journey toward restitution. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What was Do Kwon found guilty of? Do Kwon was found guilty on nine charges, including fraud, related to the $40 billion collapse of the Terra-Luna ecosystem in 2022. Will Do Kwon serve his entire sentence in the US? Not necessarily. He has a deal to potentially serve half of his 15-year sentence in another country, like South Korea, subject to international approval. Did Do Kwon admit fault? Yes. In court, he apologized to victims, calling their stories heartbreaking, and his defense stated he is genuinely remorseful. What happens to Terraform Labs now? The company is defunct following the collapse. The legal focus has been on holding its leadership, namely Do Kwon, accountable. Are victims getting their money back? Kwon’s defense team says he will work toward compensating victims, but specific plans or a timeline have not been publicly detailed. Why is this case important for crypto? It sets a major precedent for prosecuting crypto fraud, showing founders can face severe prison time for misconduct that causes massive investor losses. This landmark case affects everyone in the crypto space.

This is precisely the concern raised by cryptocurrency asset manager Bitwise regarding MSCI’s potential move to exclude companies holding significant cryptocurrency reserves. The debate over the MSCI exclusion of crypto-holding firms has sparked a crucial conversation about market objectivity and institutional bias in the digital age. What’s Behind the MSCI Exclusion Controversy? Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI), one of the world’s leading index providers, has suggested it might remove companies like MicroStrategy from its indexes due to their substantial cryptocurrency holdings. Bitwise has responded forcefully, calling this potential action discriminatory. The firm argues that indexes should reflect the market as it exists, not as some might prefer it to be. This situation raises fundamental questions about how traditional financial institutions view the growing cryptocurrency sector. When an index provider considers excluding successful companies based on their asset choices, it creates a precedent that could limit investor access to innovative business models. Why Does This MSCI Exclusion Matter for Investors? The potential MSCI exclusion of crypto-holding firms isn’t just about a few companies—it’s about market access and representation. Index funds and ETFs tracking MSCI indexes manage trillions of dollars in assets. Exclusion from these indexes can significantly impact: Investment flows : Billions in passive investment dollars could bypass crypto-exposed companies Market legitimacy Investor choice : Limits options for investors seeking crypto exposure through traditional vehicles Price discovery : Reduces market efficiency by excluding relevant market participants Bitwise emphasizes that indexes should serve as neutral market mirrors, not as gatekeepers determining which business models deserve recognition. The Bigger Picture: Institutional Acceptance of Crypto This controversy arrives at a critical moment for cryptocurrency institutional adoption. As more traditional companies add digital assets to their balance sheets, the financial establishment faces a choice: adapt to include these developments or create artificial barriers. The MSCI exclusion of crypto-holding firms represents what many in the crypto space see as institutional resistance to innovation. MicroStrategy, for instance, has successfully leveraged Bitcoin holdings as part of its corporate treasury strategy. Excluding such companies from major indexes suggests that traditional finance hasn’t fully accepted cryptocurrency’s role in modern corporate finance. What Could This Mean for Future Crypto Adoption? If MSCI proceeds with excluding companies based on cryptocurrency holdings, several consequences could follow: Reduced institutional participation : Companies might hesitate to adopt crypto strategies Market fragmentation : Separate crypto-focused indexes could emerge, creating parallel markets Regulatory attention Innovation slowdown : Could discourage corporate innovation in digital asset management Bitwise’s strong stance highlights the growing confidence within the cryptocurrency industry. The firm believes that companies embracing digital assets represent forward-thinking business models that deserve equal market access. Conclusion: A Test of Market Objectivity The debate over the MSCI exclusion of crypto-holding firms ultimately tests whether traditional financial institutions can maintain objectivity as markets evolve. Bitwise’s criticism raises valid concerns about discrimination against an entire asset class and the companies that recognize its potential. As cryptocurrency continues its march toward mainstream acceptance, index providers like MSCI face a choice: reflect the market as it exists or risk becoming irrelevant in an increasingly digital financial landscape. The outcome of this controversy will signal how quickly traditional finance can adapt to technological innovation. Frequently Asked Questions What is MSCI proposing to do with crypto-holding companies? MSCI has suggested it might exclude companies holding significant cryptocurrency reserves from its indexes, potentially removing firms like MicroStrategy that have substantial Bitcoin holdings. Why does Bitwise consider this action discriminatory? Bitwise argues that excluding companies based on their cryptocurrency holdings represents discrimination against both the asset class and innovative business models, contradicting the purpose of indexes as neutral market reflections. How would MSCI exclusion affect crypto-holding companies? Exclusion could reduce investment flows from index-tracking funds, lower market visibility, and potentially decrease liquidity for affected companies while sending negative signals about cryptocurrency legitimacy. What companies would be affected by this MSCI policy? Primarily companies like MicroStrategy with substantial cryptocurrency treasury reserves, but potentially any company holding digital assets as part of their corporate strategy. Has MSCI made a final decision on this exclusion? As of now, MSCI has only suggested this possibility. No final decision has been announced, making this a developing situation that market participants are watching closely. What alternatives exist if MSCI excludes crypto-holding firms? Specialized crypto indexes, alternative index providers, or direct cryptocurrency investment vehicles could emerge to fill the gap, though they might not match MSCI’s market influence.

55668677,643944,1765508406,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55668677.jpeg,UAE Telecom Powerhouse Embraces Dirham Stablecoin In New Payment Trial,https://bitcoinist.com/uae-telecom-powerhouse-embraces-dirham-stablecoin-in-new-payment-trial/,"e& UAE, United Arab Emirates’ telecom giant, has signed a memorandum of understanding with Al Maryah Community Bank to trial AE Coin, a Central Bank-licensed stablecoin, as a payment option across the telco’s services. According to company statements, the plan would let customers use an AED-backed token to pay for mobile and home-service bills, prepaid and postpaid recharges, and purchases on e& digital platforms. Integration Across Consumer Touchpoints Reports have disclosed that e& Group aims to plug AE Coin into its existing payment systems. The move would add the stablecoin as an alternative to cards and bank transfers on e&’s mobile apps and at smart self-service kiosks. e& UAE’s CEO, Hatem Dowidar, said the partnership with Al Maryah Community Bank will allow “instant settlement, complete transparency, and frictionless access” — language that signals the operator expects quicker finality and clearer audit trails for transactions. For many users, that could mean fewer delays and simpler proof of payment when calling or browsing for services. What The Partners Say Based on reports, Al Maryah Community Bank’s chief executive, Mohammed Wassim Khayata, said the collaboration widens real-world uses for licensed virtual assets and opens the door to faster, more secure options for everyday payments. Ramez Rafeek, General Manager of AED Stablecoin LLC, described AE Coin as created to support regulated and transparent digital payments. Those comments frame the trial as an attempt to move a regulated token from niche experiments into mass consumer use. The pilot will start within selected e& channels; no national rollout timetable has been disclosed. Potential Impact On Users And The Market Analysts and payments experts say a telecom of e&’s size could quickly expose millions of customers to stablecoin payments if the test succeeds. According to the companies involved, integrating AE Coin would cover prepaid top-ups and postpaid billing, which are high-frequency transactions that could provide an immediate test bed for volume and reliability. Observers note that real adoption will hinge on how easy customers find the process, how wallets are managed, and whether merchants accept the token beyond e&’s own services. Alignment With National Goals Reports indicate the trial fits into the UAE’s push for regulated blockchain payments and a less cash-dependent economy. Regulators have been encouraging licensed solutions, and using a Central Bank-approved stablecoin inside a major consumer network sends a clear signal that authorities are open to controlled innovation. If adopted more widely, the token could serve as another regulated payment choice alongside existing systems.

While the market’s reaction has leaned bearish in the short term, on-chain data tells a very different story beneath the surface. Related Reading: The Whale Who Can’t Stop Buying: BitcoinOG Scales Ethereum Long To $280M After Price Surge According to new insights from CryptoQuant, one of the most striking signals comes from the Exchange Inflow Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric on Binance, which has fallen sharply to 380, its lowest reading since September 2017. CDD is one of the most important indicators for understanding long-term holder behavior because it assigns greater weight to older coins that have accumulated more “coin days.” Low values mean that the BTC moving onto exchanges is predominantly from short-term traders, not long-term holders. In other words, veteran holders — the investors who historically move markets — are refusing to sell, even as Bitcoin trades near cycle highs. Long-Term Holders Signal Strong Conviction CryptoOnchain highlights that the significance of this CDD collapse becomes far clearer when viewed against Bitcoin’s current price context. With BTC trading near $89,600, the market is witnessing an unusually large divergence between price action and long-term holder behavior. Historically, when Bitcoin approaches or surpasses all-time highs, long-held coins tend to move — triggering spikes in CDD as early investors and whales take profits. This pattern has repeated across past cycles, making elevated CDD a classic top-signal. But this time, the exact opposite is happening. Instead of old coins entering exchanges, Exchange Inflow CDD is collapsing, indicating that almost none of the BTC being deposited onto Binance comes from long-term wallets. CryptoOnchain explains that this phenomenon strongly suggests that Smart Money and long-term whales have zero interest in selling at these levels, even after a multi-month correction. This refusal to distribute supply removes a major source of overhead resistance and reflects a market dynamic driven increasingly by strong hands. The absence of long-term sell pressure reduces the available liquid supply, often preceding powerful bullish expansions. In simple terms, whales are signaling confidence — not caution — despite short-term volatility, reinforcing the narrative that Bitcoin may be preparing for its next major move. Related Reading: Why Ethereum’s Rally Isn’t Overheated – And Where Demand Must Grow Next Bitcoin Price Action: Testing Support Amid Weak Momentum Bitcoin’s 3-day chart shows the market stabilizing just above the $90,000 level after last week’s sharp post-FED decline. Price remains compressed between the 200-day moving average (red line)—currently acting as primary support—and the 100-day moving average (green line) overhead, which continues to cap upward momentum. This creates a classic squeeze structure where BTC is holding its ground but struggling to reclaim lost trend levels. The recent candle structure highlights a series of higher lows forming near the $89K–$90K region, suggesting buyers are defending this zone as a short-term floor. However, the rejection from the 100-day MA reinforces the broader bearish shift, as BTC remains below both key trend indicators and is yet to reclaim the breakdown level around $100K. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees Largest Binance Inflow Since 2023 – Warning Sign? Volume also tells an important story: despite the bounce, buy-side conviction appears weak. The rebound has not been accompanied by a spike in demand, indicating that market participants are cautious following the rate cut and macro uncertainty. If Bitcoin loses the 200-day MA, the next major support lies closer to $84K, which would open the door to a deeper retracement. Conversely, a decisive close above the 100-day MA near $98K would signal momentum returning to the bulls. For now, BTC remains in a fragile consolidation with limited directional strength.

This strategic move signals a significant step toward mainstream cryptocurrency adoption, offering creators a faster, more global way to access their earnings. The PYUSD stablecoin provides a bridge between traditional finance and the innovative world of digital assets. What Does YouTube’s PYUSD Stablecoin Integration Mean for Creators? According to an exclusive report by Fortune, YouTube now permits creators to opt for receiving their revenue share in PayPal’s dollar-pegged cryptocurrency. A Google spokesperson confirmed this addition, highlighting the platform’s ongoing partnership with PayPal. This integration leverages PayPal’s existing infrastructure, allowing YouTube to offer a crypto payment option without directly managing the digital assets, thereby simplifying the process for the tech giant. This partnership is not entirely new. YouTube has reportedly been a long-time client of PayPal, utilizing its services for operational expenses like employee salaries. However, extending this relationship to include PYUSD stablecoin payments for creators marks a pivotal expansion into the crypto economy. It demonstrates a growing institutional confidence in stablecoins as a viable medium for financial transactions. Why is the PYUSD Stablecoin a Game-Changer? The introduction of the PYUSD stablecoin as a payment method addresses several pain points for the global creator community. Firstly, it potentially reduces transaction times and costs associated with international bank transfers. Secondly, it offers an alternative in regions with volatile local currencies or restrictive banking systems. Speed and Efficiency: Crypto transactions can settle much faster than traditional cross-border bank transfers. Financial Inclusion: Creators in underserved banking regions gain a new avenue to access global revenue. Reduced Friction: PayPal’s handling of the crypto assets means creators get a seamless experience without needing deep technical knowledge. Moreover, this move by a platform as influential as YouTube lends immense credibility to the entire stablecoin sector. It acts as a powerful validation, encouraging other major platforms to explore similar integrations. What Are the Potential Challenges and Considerations? While the benefits are clear, creators must also navigate certain considerations. The volatility commonly associated with cryptocurrencies is mitigated by the stable nature of PYUSD , which is pegged 1:1 to the US Dollar. However, creators should be aware of regulatory landscapes in their respective countries regarding cryptocurrency earnings and taxation. Furthermore, the practical utility of receiving PYUSD stablecoin depends on one’s ability to easily convert it to local currency or use it for purchases. PayPal’s ecosystem supports holding, sending, spending, and converting PYUSD, which simplifies this process. Nonetheless, adoption is still in its early stages, and liquidity outside major platforms may vary. How Does This Shape the Future of Digital Payments? YouTube’s adoption of the PYUSD stablecoin is more than a new feature; it’s a bellwether for the future of digital work and finance. It represents a quiet but powerful shift where major tech corporations are not just accepting crypto but actively weaving it into their payment architectures. This could accelerate a domino effect across the social media and content creation landscape. For creators, this evolution means greater autonomy and flexibility over their finances. It empowers them with choices that align with a more digital-native, borderless way of living and working. The move underscores a broader trend where the lines between fintech, social platforms, and cryptocurrency continue to blur, creating a more interconnected digital economy. Conclusion: A Bold Step Toward a Crypto-Integrated Economy YouTube’s decision to offer PayPal’s PYUSD stablecoin is a landmark moment. It provides tangible, immediate benefits for creators seeking efficiency and global access while simultaneously pushing the entire industry toward broader cryptocurrency acceptance. This collaboration between a content titan and a payments pioneer sets a compelling precedent, proving that digital assets have a concrete and growing role in mainstream business operations. The future of creator payments is becoming more innovative, inclusive, and instantaneous. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the PYUSD stablecoin? A1: PYUSD is a stablecoin issued by PayPal. It is a digital currency pegged 1:1 to the US Dollar, designed to combine the stability of fiat currency with the digital efficiency of cryptocurrency. Q2: How can YouTube creators start receiving payments in PYUSD? A2: Eligible creators should check their YouTube Studio payment settings. If the option is available in their region, they can select PayPal’s PYUSD as their preferred payout method through the integrated PayPal infrastructure. Q3: Are there any fees associated with receiving PYUSD payments? A3> Specific fee structures are determined by PayPal’s policies for crypto transactions. Creators should review PayPal’s terms for receiving, holding, and converting PYUSD to understand any applicable fees. Q4: Is receiving payments in PYUSD available to all YouTube creators globally? A4> Availability may be subject to regional regulations and PayPal’s service coverage. YouTube and PayPal are likely rolling out this feature in phases, so creators should check for updates in their local payment settings. Q5: How is the value of PYUSD stablecoin maintained? A5> The PYUSD stablecoin is fully backed by US dollar deposits, short-term US Treasuries, and similar cash equivalents. This reserve system ensures its value remains stable and pegged to the US dollar. Q6: Can I spend my PYUSD earnings directly? A6> Yes, you can use PYUSD to pay for goods and services at millions of online merchants that accept PayPal. You can also hold it in your PayPal account, send it to others, or convert it to other currencies within the PayPal ecosystem.

That’s the incredible reality for one anonymous solo miner who just earned a staggering 3.1 BTC, worth roughly $280,000, for mining an entire Bitcoin block alone. This rare event at block height 927,474 is a powerful reminder of Bitcoin’s decentralized dream. Let’s explore how this happened and why it’s causing such a stir. What Does a Solo Miner Actually Do? Unlike large mining pools where thousands combine computing power, a solo miner operates independently. They use their own hardware to try and solve the complex cryptographic puzzle required to add a new block to the Bitcoin blockchain. The odds are astronomically low, comparable to winning the lottery. Therefore, when a solo miner succeeds, it’s a monumental event that celebrates the core, permissionless principle of Bitcoin. How Did This Solo Miner Beat the Odds? According to data from Mempool.space, the block was mined on December 11th. The miner received the full 3.125 BTC block subsidy plus a small fee reward, totaling 3.1 BTC. This success highlights several key points: Proof of Decentralization: It proves individuals can still compete, even against industrial-scale operations. Sheer Luck: The solo miner likely had a very powerful setup, but luck was the dominant factor. Network Health: Such events are healthy for Bitcoin, demonstrating that mining isn’t entirely centralized. Is Solo Mining Bitcoin Realistic for You? While this story is inspiring, it’s crucial to be realistic. The challenges for a modern solo miner are immense. Extreme Competition: You’re competing against global mining pools with exahash-level power. High Costs: The electricity and hardware investment is significant with no guaranteed return. Statistical Long Shot: You could mine for years without ever finding a block. For most people, joining a mining pool provides smaller, more frequent payouts and is the practical choice. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Future? This event is more than a lucky break. It’s a symbolic victory. It reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin remains accessible to dedicated individuals. Furthermore, it may inspire more hobbyists to participate, however they choose, strengthening the network’s resilience and distributed nature. The story of this solo miner is a beacon of possibility in a landscape often dominated by large corporate players. Conclusion: A Testament to Bitcoin’s Core Promise The anonymous solo miner’s $280,000 windfall is a modern-day gold rush story. It encapsulates the hope, risk, and revolutionary potential of cryptocurrency. While not a practical strategy for most, it stands as a powerful testament to the decentralized ethos that made Bitcoin revolutionary. It reminds us that in the world of crypto, with enough perseverance and a bit of magic, anyone can theoretically strike digital gold. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: How much did the solo miner actually earn? A: The miner earned 3.1 BTC, which was valued at approximately $280,000 at the time of the block’s discovery. Q: What are the odds of a solo miner finding a block? A: The odds are extremely low, often compared to winning a major lottery. It requires immense computational power and a significant amount of luck. Q: Should I try solo mining Bitcoin? A: For the vast majority of people, solo mining is not financially viable due to high hardware and electricity costs with no guaranteed return. Joining a reputable mining pool is the recommended approach for consistent, smaller rewards. Q: Why is this solo miner event important? A: It’s important because it demonstrates that Bitcoin’s network is still decentralized enough for an individual to participate successfully, upholding its core foundational principle. Q: What hardware is needed for solo mining? A> It requires specialized, high-powered hardware called ASIC miners, which are expensive and consume large amounts of electricity. A basic home computer is not sufficient. Q: Was the solo miner’s identity revealed? A> No, the miner remains anonymous, as is common with Bitcoin mining. The achievement is visible on the public blockchain, but the individual’s identity is not linked to it. Did this story of incredible luck and perseverance inspire you?

The South Korean national pleaded guilty in August to conspiracy and wire fraud charges at Terraform Labs. US District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer handed down the sentence on Thursday at a hearing in Manhattan. Judge Dismisses 12-Year Jail Plea for Kwon, Calls it ‘Unreasonable’ Federal prosecutors already urged the court to impose the full 12 years permitted under Kwon’s plea agreement. Meanwhile, Kwon’s lawyers requested a 5-year sentence, so he can return to South Korea to face criminal charges. US prosecutors demand 12-year sentence for Do Kwon after Terra's $40B collapse that destabilized crypto markets and aided FTX implosion. #FTX #DoKwon #TerraForm https://t.co/LfzwEWH4XG — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 6, 2025 Per Inner City Press , which live-tweeted the proceedings of the lengthy hearing, Judge Engelmayer called the 12-year prison recommendation by US prosecutors “unreasonable.” He further said that a 5-year sentence “would be so implausible.” “15 years is the least I can impose,” the Judge said finally. “It is the judgment of the court that you are to serve a sentence of 15 years, with credit for time serviced in the US.” The Staggering $40B Crypto Debacle: Here’s What Happened Judge Engelmayer called the collapse an “epic” fraud. “This was a fraud on an epic, generational scale,” he said, per a BBC report . “In the history of federal prosecutions, there are few frauds that have caused as much harm as you have.” From 2018 to 2022, Kwon orchestrated schemes to defraud purchasers of cryptos created and issued by Terraform. The firm publicly announced the launch of its 1:1 USD-pegged stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST), and Luna coins. TerraUSD slipped below its $1 peg in May 2021, and Kwon made false statements about the stablecoin’s peg restoration mechanisms. He also concealed Jump Trading’s role in supporting the stablecoin during a 2021 depeg event. TerraUSD, which was designed to maintain a $1 peg, unraveled in May 2022, wiping out tens of billions in value, sparking a crypto sector-wide cascade of failures. “I made false and misleading statements about why it regained its peg by failing to disclose a trading firm’s role in restoring that peg,” Kwon admitted in August. “What I did was wrong.” The collapse led to criminal charges in the U.S. and South Korea, with both nations seeking Kwon’s extradition. In March 2023, Kwon was arrested in Montenegro for travelling with forged documents and was later extradited to the United States in December.

Bloomberg reported Friday that the the US-based exchange will announce the new offerings at an event on Dec. 17, a source told the outlet, adding that Coinbase intends to issue tokenized stocks in-house rather than through external partners. Executives at Coinbase have previously signalled interest in both businesses, but until now the company had not formally laid out a launch timeline. Traders Anticipate New Tools After Images Reveal Coinbase’s Expanding Roadmap In recent weeks, screenshots that appear to show prediction market and tokenized equity features inside Coinbase apps have circulated on X, fuelling speculation among traders.

The push fits with Coinbase’s ambition to become an “everything app” for digital assets, where customers can trade crypto, tokenized versions of traditional securities and, increasingly, event-based markets. It also helps the company keep pace with rivals that are adding similar tools as competition intensifies. Trading In Digital Stock Representations Surges As Adoption Spreads Robinhood Markets this year began offering prediction products from Kalshi Inc, giving its users a way to bet on economic and political outcomes. Robinhood and crypto exchange Kraken already list tokenized US stocks and exchange-traded funds in some jurisdictions, although these products remain unavailable in the US itself. Trading in tokenized equities, which are digital representations of stocks recorded on a blockchain, has been gaining traction. Monthly transfer volumes have risen about 32% in the past 30 days to roughly $1.45B, according to data provider rwa.xyz, as more platforms experiment with bringing traditional assets on chain. Demand For Event Contracts Climbs As Exchanges Embrace Prediction Tools Prediction markets, which allow users to wager on the outcomes of events such as elections, sports and macro data releases, have also grown quickly over the past year. They have attracted interest from both traditional exchanges and crypto native firms that see them as a new way to monetize information and order flow. Gemini, the exchange founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, recently secured a key approval from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission to launch its prediction platform, Gemini Titan, for American customers. The licence will allow it to offer event contracts structured as simple yes or no questions. Crypto.com has struck deals with partners including Trump Media & Technology Group to help them build prediction markets, while Robinhood and trading firm Susquehanna have agreed to buy 90% of regulated venue LedgerX , a move that deepens their exposure to event driven crypto derivatives.

ETH is now consolidating and might soon aim for a clear upside break above $3,350. Ethereum started a downside correction from the $3,450 zone. The price is trading above $3,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a new connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $3,180 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it settles below the $3,150 zone. Ethereum Price Holds Support Ethereum price managed to stay above $3,150 and started a fresh increase, beating Bitcoin . ETH price gained strength for a move above the $3,300 and $3,320 resistance levels. The bulls even pushed the price above $3,400. However, the bears were active below $3,450. A high was formed at $3,448 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below $3,250, and the price even spiked below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,914 swing low to the $3,448 low.

A clear move above the $3,350 resistance might send the price toward the $3,400 resistance. An upside break above the $3,400 region might call for more gains in the coming days. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,450 resistance zone or even $3,500 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,320 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,200 level. The first major support sits near the $3,150 zone. A clear move below the $3,150 support might push the price toward the $3,040 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,020 region. The next key support sits at $3,000.

Over a single 24-hour period, a staggering $222 million vanished from the crypto futures market in a wave of forced liquidations. This dramatic event underscores the extreme volatility and high-stakes nature of leveraged trading, serving as a stark reminder for every market participant. What Are Crypto Futures Liquidations and Why Do They Matter? Before we dive into the numbers, let’s clarify what just happened. In futures trading, investors use leverage—borrowed funds—to amplify their positions. However, if the market moves against them and their collateral falls below a required level, exchanges automatically close their positions to prevent further loss. This process is called liquidation. When it happens on a large scale, it can accelerate price movements and create a cascade of selling or buying pressure, impacting the entire market. A Breakdown of the $222 Million Crypto Futures Bloodbath The recent crypto futures liquidations event was not evenly distributed. Let’s look at which assets were hit the hardest and what the data tells us about trader sentiment. Bitcoin (BTC): The king of cryptocurrency led the liquidation tally with a massive $120 million. Crucially, 71.09% of these were short positions. This suggests many traders were betting on a price drop, but the market moved against them, triggering their liquidations. Ethereum (ETH): Following closely, Ethereum saw $88.95 million in liquidations. Interestingly, the majority here (64.81%) were long positions. This indicates traders expecting a price rise were caught off guard by downward movement. Solana (SOL): The altcoin recorded $13.10 million in liquidations, with 61.44% being short positions, mirroring Bitcoin’s pattern on a smaller scale. This split reveals a divided market. While leverage was heavily used on both sides of the trade, the dominant narrative was bears getting squeezed on Bitcoin and bulls getting liquidated on Ethereum. How Can Traders Navigate Future Volatility? Witnessing such significant crypto futures liquidations can be intimidating. However, it also provides valuable lessons for managing risk. First, always use stop-loss orders to define your maximum loss upfront. Second, be extremely cautious with high leverage; while it can magnify gains, it can also wipe out your capital instantly during swift market moves. Finally, never invest more than you can afford to lose, especially in the volatile crypto futures market. The Ripple Effect of Major Liquidations Large-scale liquidations don’t occur in a vacuum. They often create a feedback loop. For example, as long positions in Ethereum were forcibly closed (sold), it added selling pressure, potentially pushing the price down further and triggering more liquidations. Understanding this mechanism is key to reading market sentiment and anticipating potential short-term price swings following such events. In conclusion, the $222 million liquidation event is a powerful testament to the raw, unforgiving nature of cryptocurrency markets. It highlights the critical importance of risk management over speculative greed. For savvy traders, these periods of volatility are not just moments of danger but also opportunities to learn, adapt, and potentially identify the market’s next direction once the dust settles. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What causes a liquidation in crypto futures trading? A liquidation occurs when a trader’s position suffers losses that deplete their initial margin (collateral) below the maintenance margin requirement set by the exchange. To prevent the trader from owing more money, the exchange automatically closes the position. Why did most Bitcoin liquidations involve short positions? If the price of Bitcoin rose unexpectedly during this period, it would have moved against traders who had opened short positions (betting on a price drop). This price increase would have triggered their stop-losses or hit their liquidation prices, forcing the positions to close. Are large liquidations always bad for the market? Not necessarily. While painful for those liquidated, these events can help reset excessive leverage in the market. A “long squeeze” (where long positions are liquidated) can sometimes create a local price bottom, while a “short squeeze” can fuel a rapid price rally. How can I check current liquidation levels? Several data analytics websites like Coinglass or Bybit provide real-time liquidation heatmaps and charts, showing estimated liquidation prices across major cryptocurrencies to help traders gauge potential market stress points. What’s the difference between a partial and a full liquidation? A partial liquidation closes only enough of a position to bring the margin back above the required level. A full liquidation closes the entire position because the losses have completely wiped out the available margin. Do liquidations affect the spot market price of crypto? Yes, they can. Since liquidations involve the forced buying or selling of an asset, this activity on the futures market can create significant pressure that spills over and influences the price on regular spot exchanges.

The South Korean crypto exchange giant has announced a planned, temporary suspension of SCR deposits and withdrawals. This proactive move is due to an essential network upgrade for the Scroll blockchain. If you use Bithumb for your SCR transactions, here’s your complete, point-by-point guide to understand the timeline, reasons, and necessary steps. What Is the Bithumb SCR Suspension All About? Bithumb has officially notified its users that all deposit and withdrawal services for the Scroll (SCR) token will be temporarily paused. This Bithumb SCR suspension is scheduled to begin at 3:00 a.m. UTC on December 16. The primary reason cited is a mandatory network upgrade on the Scroll sidechain. Exchanges often implement these halts to ensure user funds remain secure during backend technical work, preventing any potential transaction errors or losses. Why Do Exchanges Like Bithumb Halt Transactions? You might wonder why a major platform would temporarily disable a core function. The answer is security and stability. During a blockchain network upgrade, the protocol’s rules change. If an exchange like Bithumb continued processing transactions, it could lead to: Failed Transactions: Deposits or withdrawals sent during the upgrade might get lost or stuck. Chain Splits: Incompatible software versions can cause confusion over the valid blockchain. Security Vulnerabilities: Temporary gaps could be exploited by bad actors. Therefore, this Bithumb SCR suspension is a standard, protective measure. It shows the exchange is following best practices for asset custody. Timeline and User Action Plan for the SCR Halt Mark your calendars. The suspension starts at 3:00 a.m. UTC, December 16 . Bithumb has not announced a specific end time, as it depends on the successful completion and stabilization of Scroll’s upgrade. Typically, such halts last a few hours but can extend if complications arise. Here’s your actionable checklist: Complete Pending Transactions: Initiate any SCR deposits or withdrawals well before the deadline. No Trading Halt: The suspension only affects moving SCR on and off the exchange. Trading SCR against other pairs on Bithumb’s spot market will likely continue as normal. Monitor Official Channels: Follow Bithumb’s official announcements for the resumption notice. Do not rely on third-party rumors. What Does This Mean for the Future of Scroll (SCR)? While a temporary service pause might seem inconvenient, it often signals positive, long-term development. Network upgrades usually aim to enhance scalability, security, or functionality. For Scroll, a zkEVM layer-2 solution for Ethereum, this upgrade could mean lower fees, faster transactions, or improved developer tools. This Bithumb SCR suspension is a short-term step for a potentially stronger network, which could benefit the token’s ecosystem and value proposition. Final Summary: Stay Calm and Prepared In summary, Bithumb’s decision to temporarily suspend SCR deposits and withdrawals is a planned, safety-first action. It is directly tied to Scroll’s network upgrade and is a common industry practice. For users, the path forward is clear: finalize any transfers before December 16, understand that trading may be unaffected, and wait for the official all-clear from Bithumb. This proactive management by a top-tier exchange ultimately contributes to a more secure and reliable crypto environment for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still trade my SCR on Bithumb during the suspension? A1: Yes, in most cases. The suspension typically applies only to depositing SCR into your Bithumb wallet or withdrawing it out to an external wallet. Trading SCR for other cryptocurrencies on the Bithumb exchange platform should continue normally. Q2: How long will the Bithumb SCR suspension last? A2: Bithumb has not provided a specific end time. The duration depends on the Scroll network upgrade. It could be a few hours or longer. Users should monitor Bithumb’s official website and announcement page for the resumption notice. Q3: Are my SCR funds safe on Bithumb during this time? A3: Yes. The suspension is a security measure to protect your funds during the technical upgrade. Your SCR balance in your Bithumb account remains secure and unaffected. Q4: What happens if I try to send an SCR transaction during the suspension window? A4: Any attempt to deposit or withdraw SCR during the suspension period will likely fail or be automatically rejected by Bithumb’s system. It is crucial to complete all transfers before 3:00 a.m. UTC on December 16. Q5: Will other exchanges also suspend SCR services? A5: Possibly. Other exchanges that support Scroll (SCR) may announce similar temporary suspensions to perform their own network upgrades and ensure compatibility. Always check the announcements from your specific exchange. Found this guide on the Bithumb SCR suspension helpful? Navigating exchange updates can be tricky.

That’s the stark reality France is considering for holders of self-custodied crypto. A new legislative proposal could force individuals to report holdings exceeding €5,000, sparking a fierce debate about freedom, privacy, and the future of digital ownership. What Does France’s Proposed Crypto Law Mean for You? The French government is actively discussing Bill 1649AC. This legislation would introduce a mandatory declaration system for non-custodial cryptocurrency assets. If passed, any individual holding more than €5,000 (approximately $5,400) in a personal wallet—like a Ledger hardware wallet or a MetaMask software wallet—must report those holdings to the authorities. The proposal originates from recommendations by two key French bodies: the Court of Audit (Cour des Comptes) and the Public Finance Committee (CPO). Their goal is to increase transparency and oversight in a rapidly growing asset class that currently operates with significant anonymity. Why Is This Bill Sparking Such Intense Criticism? Despite its regulatory intentions, the bill faces a backlash. Critics argue it represents a severe overreach. The core concern is that mandatory reporting for self-custodied crypto fundamentally infringes on personal financial privacy and autonomy. Consider these key points of contention: Privacy Erosion: The law would break the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions for declared amounts. Enforcement Challenges: Tracking assets in truly private, self-custodied wallets is notoriously difficult, raising questions about practical implementation. Chilling Effect: It may discourage legitimate adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) and personal asset management. Global Precedent: Other nations could follow suit, creating a patchwork of invasive reporting requirements worldwide. How Would the Self-Custodied Crypto Reporting Work in Practice? The mechanics of the proposed system remain unclear, which adds to the anxiety. Would it be a one-time declaration or an ongoing obligation? How would the value be calculated in such a volatile market? These unanswered questions create uncertainty for every French crypto user. Furthermore, the bill specifically targets self-custodied crypto —assets you control directly via private keys. This contrasts with funds held on centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, which already operate under know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. The law creates a distinction between ‘hosted’ and ‘non-hosted’ assets, placing the reporting burden squarely on the individual for the latter. What Are the Potential Consequences of Non-Compliance? While the amendment has not yet been voted into law, its potential impact is significant. Failure to report qualifying self-custodied crypto holdings could likely result in penalties. This moves cryptocurrency further into the realm of traditional financial assets, subject to state surveillance and tax enforcement. However, this push for control clashes with the foundational ethos of cryptocurrency: decentralization and individual sovereignty. The debate in France is a microcosm of a global struggle between regulatory oversight and digital freedom. Navigating the Future of Crypto Regulation The outcome of Bill 1649AC will be closely watched internationally. It represents a bold attempt to bring self-custodied crypto into the regulatory fold. For users, the message is clear: the era of complete anonymity for substantial holdings may be ending in some jurisdictions. Staying informed is crucial. Regulatory landscapes are shifting rapidly. Whether this French proposal becomes law or not, it signals a growing trend of governments seeking visibility into all corners of the digital economy, including your personal wallet. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is self-custodied crypto? A1: Self-custodied crypto refers to digital assets you hold and control directly through a private key, without relying on a third-party exchange or custodian. Examples include funds in hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor) or software wallets (MetaMask). Q2: Has the French law for reporting crypto been passed? A2> No, it has not. As of now, Bill 1649AC is a proposed amendment under discussion. It must go through the parliamentary process before becoming law. Q3: Does this affect crypto held on exchanges like Binance? A3> The proposed law specifically targets self-custodied wallets. Crypto held on centralized, KYC-compliant exchanges is already subject to reporting by the exchange itself and may not require an additional individual declaration under this bill. Q4: What happens if I own less than €5,000 in self-custodied crypto? A4> Based on the current proposal, holdings valued below the €5,000 threshold would not require mandatory reporting. However, the total valuation method (e.g., peak value, year-end value) is not yet specified. Q5: Why are privacy advocates concerned about this law? A5> Critics argue it violates financial privacy principles and sets a dangerous precedent for government surveillance of personal assets. They believe it undermines a key benefit of blockchain technology: user sovereignty. Q6: Could other countries adopt similar rules? A6> Yes, absolutely. France’s approach could inspire similar legislation in other European Union nations and beyond, as governments worldwide grapple with regulating decentralized assets.

Valued at approximately $223 million, this single transaction highlights the immense scale at which major players, or ‘whales,’ operate within the digital asset space. But what does such a massive USDT transfer actually signal for the broader market? Let’s dive into the implications of this noteworthy event. What Does a $223 Million USDT Transfer Signify? When a transaction of this magnitude occurs, it naturally sparks speculation. A USDT transfer of over $200 million to a centralized exchange like OKX typically suggests one of a few potential scenarios. The sender, often called a ‘whale,’ could be preparing to convert their stablecoin holdings into other cryptocurrencies. Alternatively, they might be moving funds for safekeeping or to provide liquidity for large-scale trading operations. This movement underscores the critical role major exchanges play as liquidity hubs in the crypto ecosystem. Why Should Crypto Investors Pay Attention to Whale Alerts? Transactions flagged by services like Whale Alert are more than just blockchain curiosities; they are vital market signals. Large USDT transfers to exchanges can sometimes precede increased buying or selling pressure. For instance, if this USDT is used to purchase Bitcoin or Ethereum, it could contribute to upward price momentum. Therefore, monitoring these flows offers valuable, real-time insight into the potential actions of large-scale investors, providing context that charts alone cannot. However, it’s crucial to avoid jumping to conclusions. A single transaction does not dictate market direction. The motives behind a USDT transfer remain private. The funds could just as easily be moved for custody, over-the-counter (OTC) trade settlement, or simple portfolio rebalancing. The key takeaway is awareness, not assumption. How Does This Impact Tether (USDT) and Market Stability? Tether (USDT) maintains its peg to the US dollar through reserves and market mechanisms. A transfer of this size is a powerful demonstration of the stablecoin’s utility for moving vast sums quickly and with minimal friction. It reinforces USDT’s position as the dominant stablecoin for institutional and whale-level transactions. For market stability, such movements are a double-edged sword: Liquidity Injection: It brings substantial capital onto a trading platform, potentially increasing market depth. Volatility Catalyst: If deployed rapidly, it can cause significant price swings in other assets. Network Confidence: It tests and demonstrates the robustness of the Tron network (where this transfer likely occurred) in handling high-value settlements. What Are the Practical Takeaways for Everyday Traders? For the average crypto enthusiast, news of a major USDT transfer should inform your strategy, not define it. Use this information as one piece of a larger puzzle. Consider it alongside other metrics like exchange inflows/outflows, futures market data, and broader macroeconomic trends. Remember, whale moves are a feature of a maturing market, not an anomaly. They highlight the growing institutional footprint in crypto, which can lead to both greater liquidity and new forms of volatility. In conclusion, the 222 million USDT move to OKX is a striking example of the scale and efficiency of modern crypto finance. While its immediate purpose is unknown, it serves as a clear reminder of the market’s dynamic nature and the importance of on-chain data. By understanding the context behind such transfers, investors can make more informed decisions, separating meaningful signal from everyday market noise. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Whale Alert, and how does it track these transactions? A1: Whale Alert is a blockchain tracking service that monitors public ledgers for large cryptocurrency transactions. It uses predefined thresholds to identify and report significant movements, like this 222 million USDT transfer, providing transparency into whale activity. Q2: Could this large USDT transfer cause the price of Bitcoin to change? A2: It has the potential to. If the USDT is used to buy a large amount of Bitcoin on OKX, it could create buying pressure and push the price up. However, if the whale’s intent is different, the impact may be negligible. The transfer itself is a precursor to potential action. Q3: Why are the wallets often labeled ‘unknown’? A3: A wallet is labeled ‘unknown’ when its owner has not publicly identified themselves or associated the address with a known entity like an exchange, company, or individual. Blockchain transactions are transparent, but participant identities are pseudonymous by default. Q4: Is moving $223 million in USDT safe? A4: On a technical level, yes. Blockchain networks like Tron or Ethereum are designed to securely process transactions of any size. The primary risks are not technological but relate to human error, like sending to a wrong address, or exchange-related issues like temporary withdrawal halts. Q5: What’s the difference between USDT being ‘transferred’ and ‘minted’? A5: A USDT transfer moves existing tokens from one wallet to another. ‘Minting’ refers to the creation of new USDT tokens by Tether Ltd. This event was a transfer of already-circulating stablecoins. Q6: Should I buy or sell crypto because of this whale move? A6: You should never make trading decisions based solely on one data point. Treat whale movements as important context. Always conduct your own comprehensive research, consider your risk tolerance, and develop a strategy based on multiple factors. Found this analysis of the major USDT transfer insightful?

After a brief two-day rally of net inflows, these popular investment vehicles experienced a collective net outflow of $78.35 million. This shift highlights the ongoing volatility and nuanced investor sentiment shaping the crypto market, even for institutional-grade products. What Drove the Bitcoin Spot ETFs Net Outflow? Data reported by Trader T reveals a day of conflicting signals within the Bitcoin spot ETF landscape. The headline figure is a clear step back, but the story beneath the surface is more complex. A significant withdrawal from several major funds overpowered a strong single performance, creating the overall negative flow. This tug-of-war between different fund managers provides a real-time snapshot of shifting investor confidence. A Closer Look at the Winners and Losers Not all Bitcoin spot ETFs moved in the same direction. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) stood out as a beacon of strength, attracting a substantial $75.7 million in new investments. However, this positive momentum was decisively countered by outflows from other key players: Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) saw the largest exit, with $103 million flowing out. Ark Invest’s ARKB experienced a withdrawal of $16.38 million. VanEck’s Bitcoin Trust (HODL) also faced outflows totaling $19.38 million. This divergence shows that investor choices are becoming more selective, moving capital between funds rather than exiting the asset class entirely. Why Should Investors Care About ETF Flows? Tracking the daily flows of Bitcoin spot ETFs is more than just watching numbers change. It serves as a crucial barometer for institutional sentiment. Consistent inflows generally signal growing confidence and adoption, which can be a supportive factor for Bitcoin’s price. Conversely, sustained outflows may indicate profit-taking, risk aversion, or a broader wait-and-see approach. The December 11th data, therefore, acts as a cautionary note, reminding market participants that the path to mainstream adoption is rarely a straight line. What’s Next for Bitcoin Spot ETFs? A single day of outflows does not define a trend. The critical question is whether this marks the beginning of a longer period of redemption or merely a brief pause in accumulation. Market observers will watch closely to see if funds like IBIT can continue to attract capital to offset outflows elsewhere. Furthermore, broader macroeconomic factors and Bitcoin’s own price action will heavily influence future Bitcoin spot ETF flow patterns. The interplay between these funds is now a fundamental piece of the crypto market puzzle. Conclusion: A Market in Constant Motion The $78.35 million net outflow from U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs is a powerful reminder of the market’s dynamic nature. It underscores that investor appetite, even through regulated vehicles, remains sensitive and can shift rapidly. For anyone involved in cryptocurrency, understanding these flow trends is essential for grasping the undercurrents of supply, demand, and institutional behavior that drive the market forward. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are Bitcoin spot ETFs? Bitcoin spot ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Bitcoin. They allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through a traditional stock brokerage account without needing to directly buy, store, or secure the cryptocurrency themselves. What does ‘net outflow’ mean for an ETF? A net outflow occurs when the total amount of money withdrawn from an ETF by shareholders selling their shares exceeds the total amount of new money invested by buyers. It indicates more selling pressure than buying pressure for that day. Why did some Bitcoin ETFs have inflows while others had outflows? Investors may move money between different funds based on factors like the fund’s expense ratio (fees), the reputation of the issuer (e.g., BlackRock vs. a smaller firm), liquidity, or personal investment strategy. It shows selectivity within the asset class. Is a single day of outflows a bad sign for Bitcoin? Not necessarily. One day of data is a snapshot, not a trend. Market flows are volatile. It’s more important to watch for sustained patterns over weeks or months to gauge true institutional sentiment. Where can I find daily Bitcoin ETF flow data? Data is compiled by various analysts and financial data firms. It is often reported by major financial news outlets covering cryptocurrencies and ETFs, such as CoinDesk, Bloomberg, and The Block. How do ETF flows affect Bitcoin’s price? Large, sustained inflows can create buying pressure on the underlying Bitcoin held by the funds, which can be a supportive factor for the price. Large, sustained outflows can have the opposite effect, as the fund must sell Bitcoin to return cash to exiting shareholders. Found this breakdown of Bitcoin spot ETF flows helpful?

This comes after a major policy shift from the White House earlier this year. On December 11, members of the House Financial Services Committee sent a formal letter to SEC Chair Paul Atkins. They urged him to update securities rules so that digital assets can be treated like other alternative investments in retirement accounts. Lawmakers say Americans saving for retirement deserve more investment choices . They argue that current rules are outdated and too restrictive, blocking millions from accessing new asset classes. Lawmakers push SEC to act on Trump’s retirement order The House Financial Committee’s push follows directly on the heels of an executive order signed by U.S. President Donald Trump in August 2025. The order, titled “Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors,” requires federal agencies to expand the investable choices available to retirement planners. It emphasizes that every American should be able to invest in alternative assets when it makes financial sense. It also notes that fiduciaries must assess risks, managers’ experience, and suitability before such choices are included in retirement plans. Notably, cryptocurrencies were specifically listed alongside real estate and private equity. This marked one of the most significant federal acknowledgments of digital assets as legitimate investment choices. In their letter, lawmakers praised the White House directive. They said the SEC must now take parallel action to ensure the policy becomes reality. They also highlighted the need to redefine who qualifies as an “accredited investor.” Strict rules about investor qualification currently restrict involvement in certain private and alternative investment markets. This program is often only available to wealthy or high-net-worth individuals. And Congress now wants to expand those rules to people with professional licenses, related job experience, or those who can pass a competency exam. These changes would ensure that a wider spectrum of workers, including teachers, nurses, engineers, and skilled laborers, would have access to investments that were once only available to wealthy Americans. The lawmakers also said the SEC should coordinate with the Department of Labor, which oversees retirement plan fiduciaries, to agree on the rules. Both agencies, they said, needed to figure out a way to safely and responsibly add alternative assets into 401(k) menus. SEC signals a shift in how crypto will be regulated The SEC has been more open on digital assets already under Chair Paul Atkins. He has abandoned the previous aggressive enforcement approach and initiated additional initiatives to clarify regulations. One of his significant projects is “Project Crypto,” a program he has developed to establish the classification, trading, and storage of digital assets. Atkins has stated in recent public remarks that a significant percentage of the cryptocurrencies traded on the market today are not securities. This distinction matters especially because, not being classified as securities, assets are subject to fewer restrictions and can be more readily included in retirement plans. The SEC is also considering sweeping reforms that might update the review, approval, and oversight of investment products. The official guidance includes investor protections, as well as clear disclosures for investors who may buy cryptocurrencies, and safeguards for retirement savers, officials say. Supporters say that if the changes become official, crypto-investing retirement options could gain traction. Digital assets will be included in standard 401(k) lineups alongside mutual funds and ETFs , at least until they are fully integrated into the market. However, critics argue that this move is risky. They say cryptocurrencies are prone to extreme price fluctuations and could expose retirees to unpredictable losses. Skeptics have warned that many workers do not fully understand the fluctuation seen in crypto markets. Even so, momentum is emerging. Companies that provide retirement solutions have seen an uptick in interest among younger workers who want digital assets integrated into their long-term savings plans. The move to include Bitcoin in 401(k) plans may push the asset to new highs.

55670356,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=244103,1765511411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Massive 222,692,703 USDT Transfer from OKX Sparks Market Speculation",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/massive-usdt-transfer-okx-unknown-wallet/,"BitcoinWorld Massive 222,692,703 USDT Transfer from OKX Sparks Market Speculation In a move that has captured the attention of the entire cryptocurrency community, blockchain tracker Whale Alert reported a staggering transaction: 222,692,703 USDT, valued at approximately $223 million, was transferred from the major exchange OKX to an unknown wallet. This colossal USDT transfer immediately raises critical questions about market intent, whale behavior, and the underlying stability of the world’s largest stablecoin. For investors and analysts, understanding the potential implications of such a move is crucial. What Does This Massive USDT Transfer Actually Mean? When a transaction of this magnitude occurs, it’s rarely a simple portfolio adjustment. A USDT transfer involving hundreds of millions of dollars typically signals strategic positioning by a major market player, often called a ‘whale’. These entities can influence prices and sentiment. The destination—an ‘unknown wallet’—adds a layer of intrigue, as it suggests the funds are moving into cold storage or a private wallet, away from immediate exchange trading. This could indicate a few potential scenarios: Strategic Accumulation: The whale may be preparing to purchase another asset, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, in large quantities. Risk Management: Moving funds off an exchange is a common security practice to mitigate counterparty risk. Institutional Movement: This could be part of a treasury operation for a large corporation or investment fund. Why Should Crypto Traders Care About Whale Movements? Whale transactions serve as a leading indicator for market trends. A large USDT transfer to an exchange often precedes a buying spree, potentially driving up prices. Conversely, a transfer *from* an exchange to private custody, like this one, can signal a holding pattern or preparation for a future large-scale market entry. Therefore, monitoring these flows provides valuable, albeit not definitive, insight. It’s a piece of the larger puzzle that includes on-chain data, derivatives market activity, and macroeconomic factors. Could This USDT Transfer Impact Tether’s Stability? Tether (USDT) maintains its 1:1 peg to the US dollar through reserves and market mechanisms. A single large withdrawal does not inherently threaten this peg. However, the transaction highlights the concentration of USDT holdings and the potential for large actors to create temporary liquidity shifts. The stability of USDT is paramount for the entire crypto ecosystem, as it is the primary trading pair on most exchanges. Observers will watch for any follow-on movements that could signal broader changes in stablecoin demand or confidence. Actionable Insights: How to Interpret Major Blockchain Transactions For the average investor, reacting to every whale alert is impractical. However, you can develop a smarter strategy. First, use tools like Whale Alert as a sentiment gauge, not a trading signal. Second, look for corroborating evidence. Was there a similar USDT transfer before a major market move? Third, consider the context. Is this happening during a market rally, a downturn, or a period of stability? By asking these questions, you move from speculation to informed analysis. The Bottom Line on This $223 Million Crypto Move The movement of 222 million USDT is a powerful reminder of the scale and opacity within cryptocurrency markets. While its immediate impact may be muted, it underscores the importance of transparency and the influential role of major holders. This USDT transfer is a significant data point that reinforces the need for investors to prioritize fundamentals and long-term strategy over reacting to single transactions. The true meaning will likely unfold in the days and weeks to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an ‘unknown wallet’ in crypto? A: An ‘unknown wallet’ is a blockchain address not publicly linked to a known entity like an exchange, company, or individual. It typically refers to a private, user-controlled wallet. Q2: Does a large USDT transfer mean the price of Bitcoin will change? A: Not necessarily. It is a potential indicator. If the USDT is moved to an exchange and used to buy Bitcoin, it could increase buying pressure. This transfer to an unknown wallet suggests preparation, not immediate action. Q3: How reliable is Whale Alert’s data? A: Whale Alert sources its data directly from public blockchain ledgers, making it highly reliable for reporting on-chain transactions. Their reporting is a trusted standard in the industry. Q4: Why would someone move so much USDT off an exchange? A> Primary reasons include enhanced security (avoiding exchange hacks), long-term holding strategy, or preparing the stablecoin for use in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols that interact with private wallets. Q5: Is my USDT safe if whales are moving large amounts? A: Yes. Tether’s stability is managed at the protocol level through its reserves. Individual large withdrawals are a normal function of liquidity and do not directly affect other users’ holdings or the asset’s peg. Q6: Can I track whale wallets myself? A> Yes, to an extent. You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan or BscScan to follow the movement of large wallets if you have the address. However, identifying the owner is usually impossible.

55670517,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=244119,1765511710,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Reversal: ETH Spot ETFs See First Net Outflow in Four Days as $42 Million Exits,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/eth-spot-etfs-net-outflow/,"BitcoinWorld Shocking Reversal: ETH Spot ETFs See First Net Outflow in Four Days as $42 Million Exits In a surprising twist for crypto investors, U.S. spot ETH ETFs recorded their first day of net outflows in four trading sessions. On December 11th, a total of $42.38 million exited these funds, according to data from TraderT. This shift breaks a short streak of inflows and raises questions about short-term sentiment toward Ethereum. Let’s dive into what happened and why it matters for your portfolio. What Caused the ETH Spot ETFs Outflow? The outflow wasn’t uniform across all funds. Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) led the retreat, with investors pulling out $31.22 million. Its Mini ETH fund followed, seeing $10.03 million in outflows. However, the picture wasn’t entirely negative. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) recorded zero net outflows, showing remarkable stability. Meanwhile, 21Shares’ Core Ethereum ETF (CETH) bucked the trend entirely, attracting a net inflow of $2.08 million. This mixed activity suggests the outflow wasn’t a broad-based rejection of Ethereum. Instead, it may reflect profit-taking or a rotation between different ETF providers. The concentration of outflows in Grayscale’s products is particularly noteworthy for market watchers. Why Should You Care About ETF Flows? Spot ETF flows act as a real-time gauge of institutional and large-scale investor sentiment. When money flows into ETH spot ETFs, it represents direct buying pressure on the underlying asset. Conversely, outflows can indicate selling pressure or a shift in capital allocation. Therefore, monitoring these trends provides actionable insights beyond just price charts. Consider these key implications of the recent data: Short-Term Sentiment: The break in the inflow streak suggests a potential cooling of immediate bullish enthusiasm. Provider Preference: The divergence between Grayscale and BlackRock highlights that investors are making nuanced choices between fund managers. Market Liquidity: Large outflows can impact market liquidity, potentially leading to increased volatility. Is This a Warning Sign for Ethereum? A single day of outflows does not necessarily spell trouble for Ethereum’s long-term prospects. Market flows are inherently volatile. However, it serves as a crucial reminder that the path of adoption is not a straight line upward. The resilience of BlackRock’s fund and the inflow into 21Shares’ product show that demand still exists, just in different places. For context, this event occurred amidst a broader crypto market that often experiences end-of-year portfolio rebalancing. Some analysts suggest the outflows could be tied to this seasonal activity rather than a fundamental shift in Ethereum’s outlook. The key is to watch if this becomes a sustained trend or remains an isolated event. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors How should you interpret this news? First, avoid panic. One data point is not a trend. Instead, use this information to inform a more strategic view. Watch the flow data over the coming week to see if outflows continue or reverse. Pay close attention to which ETH spot ETFs are gaining or losing assets, as this can signal shifting confidence in different financial products. Furthermore, compare ETF flow data with other on-chain metrics and broader market news. This holistic approach will give you a clearer picture than any single metric alone. Remember, informed decisions are always better than reactive ones. In conclusion, the first net outflow from U.S. spot ETH ETFs in four days is a significant market event worthy of attention. It highlights the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of crypto investment vehicles. While Grayscale saw notable exits, the stability of BlackRock and the inflow into 21Shares present a nuanced story. The overall takeaway is clear: vigilance and context are your best tools in navigating the crypto landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are ETH spot ETFs? ETH spot ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Ethereum (ETH). They allow investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price without directly buying and storing the cryptocurrency. Why did Grayscale’s ETHE have the largest outflow? Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) has a different structure and fee history compared to newer spot ETFs. Investors may be rotating into newer, potentially lower-cost funds, or taking profits after a period of gains. Does a net outflow mean the price of ETH will drop? Not necessarily. While outflows can create selling pressure, many other factors influence price, including overall market sentiment, Bitcoin’s movement, and macroeconomic conditions. A single day’s flow is rarely decisive. How often should I check ETF flow data? For most investors, monitoring flow data weekly is sufficient. Daily fluctuations are normal. Look for sustained trends over a week or more to identify meaningful shifts in capital. Where can I find reliable data on ETF flows? Data is reported by the fund issuers and aggregated by financial data platforms like Bloomberg, Reuters, and specialized crypto analytics firms like TraderT, which provided this report. Are spot ETH ETFs a good long-term investment? Like any investment, it depends on your goals and risk tolerance. Spot ETFs offer a regulated, convenient way to hold Ethereum. Their long-term success will be tied to Ethereum’s adoption and the overall growth of the crypto market. Found this analysis of the ETH spot ETFs outflow helpful?

55670697,643899,1765512012,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55670697.jpeg,Ethereum Leverage Hits Highest Level Ever – Market Enters Critical Risk Zone,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-leverage-hit-highest-level-market-critical/,"Ethereum has retraced below the $3,200 level following the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points, a move that initially boosted risk assets but quickly shifted market sentiment into uncertainty. While the broader macro backdrop now leans toward looser monetary conditions, Ethereum’s reaction suggests that traders remain cautious, especially after the sharp rally from the $2,800 region earlier this month. According to fresh data from CryptoQuant, Binance’s Ethereum Estimated Leverage Ratio has climbed to an all-time high of nearly 0.579. This signals that the ETH market has entered a highly sensitive and potentially unstable phase, as open leveraged positions have grown faster than the underlying spot holdings on the exchange. Such extreme leverage typically reflects heightened risk appetite—and often precedes periods of sharp volatility. This dynamic implies that a large portion of Ethereum’s recent price action has been driven not by organic demand, but by leveraged speculation. With funding structures stretched and traders aggressively positioning for upside, even a modest price swing could trigger a cascade of liquidations, amplifying market movements in either direction. As Ethereum hovers near key support, the combination of elevated leverage and post-FED uncertainty sets the stage for a volatile and decisive period ahead. Ethereum’s Leverage Structure Signals Growing Fragility Arab Chain explains that Ethereum’s historically high leverage ratio indicates a structural imbalance in the market. When the volume of open contracts funded by leverage grows faster than the actual spot ETH held on the platform, the entire ecosystem becomes more sensitive to abrupt volatility. In such conditions, traders face a heightened risk of liquidation from even moderate price swings—whether the move is upward or downward. Historically, peaks in this indicator have aligned with periods of intense price pressure, as excessive leverage magnifies the market’s reaction to relatively small shifts in demand or sentiment. At the same time, Ethereum is currently trading near $3,300, creating a concerning confluence: rising prices supported not by strong inflows or genuine spot demand, but by leverage-driven speculation. This type of rally is inherently unstable. If leverage continues climbing at these extreme levels, the market becomes increasingly vulnerable to a sharp liquidation-driven sell-off should prices pull back. However, there is an alternative path. If ETH’s price continues to build momentum while the leverage ratio cools slightly, the market could regain a healthier structure—providing a more durable foundation for a sustained upward trend. For now, the estimated leverage ratio remains one of the most critical indicators for evaluating Ethereum’s short-term direction. ETH Price Action Details Ethereum’s latest rejection near the $3,350–$3,400 zone highlights the challenges bulls face as the broader trend remains pressured. The chart shows ETH pulling back toward the $3,200 area after a sharp attempt to break above the 100-day moving average (red line). This level continues to act as a major dynamic resistance, repeatedly capping upside momentum throughout November and December. Despite the recent recovery from sub-$2,900 lows, ETH has not yet reclaimed the 50-day moving average (blue line) with conviction. The inability to close decisively above it reinforces the idea that this bounce remains corrective rather than impulsive. Meanwhile, volume on the latest push upward has been modest, suggesting that buyers are not entering aggressively at these levels. On the downside, the $3,050–$3,100 region is emerging as short-term support. A daily close below this zone could open a path back toward $2,900, especially if risk sentiment deteriorates post-FOMC. Conversely, reclaiming and holding above $3,350 would be the first sign of renewed bullish strength, potentially targeting $3,550 next.

The findings revealed that the vast majority of these firms are now grappling with substantial unrealized losses, prompting many to sell off considerable amounts of their Bitcoin holdings. Market Struggles Continue In a sample analysis of 100 companies with reliable cost basis measurements, approximately 65% purchased Bitcoin at prices that now exceed the current market value, leaving a considerable number of these treasuries with substantial unrealized losses. Bitcoin’s market downturn in late November pushed spot prices down towards $90,000, leaving many buyers from 2025 at a financial disadvantage. Related Reading: Bitcoin Outlook Post Fed’s 0.25% Rate Cut: Historical Patterns And Predictions Now, the market’s leading crypto has retraced below this key level on Thursday, even despite the Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cut announcement. Among the companies surveyed, about two-thirds are found to be sitting on unrealized losses based on current market values. But despite the volatility in pricing, some of the largest balance sheets continued to acquire Bitcoin. Notably, firms like Strategy (previously MicroStrategy) and Strive significantly contributed to net additions in November, with Strategy accounting for approximately 75% of all monthly purchases following their sell-offs. Mining companies remain steadfast as a cornerstone of public market Bitcoin holdings. In November, they represented about 5% of new additions to the market and around 12% of the total balances held by public companies. Bitcoin Demand Remains Strong Even as Bitcoin treasury stocks have shown softness compared to Bitcoin itself and broader equity benchmarks, many companies still pursued strategies to add BTC to their balance sheets while refining their capital-market approaches. BitcoinTreasury.Net’s analysis indicates that nearly 50 firms have managed to achieve gains of at least 10% over the last 6 to 12 months. Over time, losses have begun to soften for some. Currently, around 140 companies have experienced declines of at least 10% over a 1 to 3 month period, while about 105 companies have seen similar declines year-to-date. However, not all corporate holders opted to weather the storm of price fluctuations. In November alone, at least five companies decided to sell Bitcoin, with Sequans leading the charge by offloading roughly one-third of its holdings.

This figure is notably below the totals from each of the prior four quarters and aligns closely with the additions seen in the third quarter of 2024. The report concluded that despite a clear easing in the “summer buying frenzy,” demand for Bitcoin has not entirely diminished as public corporations are adapting to a more cautious and selective approach as they reassess their recent purchases. At the time of writing, BTC traded at $89,920, down over 2% in the previous 24 hours. This places the cryptocurrency 27% behind its all-time high of $126,000 set in October of this year.

Key Takeaways: The SEC granted DTC a rare no-action letter, clearing the way for tokenizing major US market assets. The tokenization service will launch in late 2026 and run on pre-approved blockchains for three years. The move signals a broader regulatory shift as the SEC shows greater openness to blockchain-based financial infrastructure. On Thursday, the DTCC confirmed that its subsidiary , the Depository Trust Company (DTC), received a rare “no-action” letter that allows it to begin tokenizing traditional securities in a controlled production setting. DTC to Tokenize Treasuries, ETFs and Russell 1000 Assets by 2026 Under the approval, the DTC plans to tokenize a basket of highly liquid instruments, including components of the Russell 1000 index, major index-tracking ETFs, and US Treasury bills, notes, and bonds. The service is scheduled for launch in the second half of 2026 and is designed to operate on pre-approved blockchains for a period of three years. The DTCC, which underpins much of the US securities market through its clearing and settlement operations, said the no-action letter confirms the agency will not pursue enforcement if the program is carried out as proposed. Market observers view the decision as a significant regulatory signal, as no-action letters are uncommon and typically reserved for projects with clear safeguards. DTCC CEO Frank La Salla welcomed the move, saying the tokenization effort could reshape how securities move across the financial system. He pointed to potential improvements such as faster collateral mobility, continuous market access, and new trading mechanisms enabled by programmable assets. In an historic milestone, DTC received a No‑Action Letter from the SEC to tokenize certain DTC‑custodied assets. By leveraging blockchain, DTCC aims to bridge TradFi and DeFi, advancing a more resilient, inclusive and efficient global financial system. https://t.co/yYNaHfvjcS pic.twitter.com/E4W47rWBIc — DTCC (@The_DTCC) December 11, 2025 According to the company, tokenized versions of these assets will carry the same ownership rights, investor protections, and entitlements as their traditional counterparts, providing a bridge between legacy market structure and emerging blockchain rails. The service will be available to DTC participants and their clients. The SEC has taken a noticeably more open stance toward blockchain initiatives over the past year. Two decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) projects received similar no-action treatment , and in late September, the agency cleared investment advisers to work with state trust companies serving as crypto custodians. In August, the agency issued a similar letter to Double Zero , surprising many in the industry and fueling optimism that the SEC, now led by Chair Paul Atkins, is taking a more measured approach after years of tension under former chair Gary Gensler. RWA Tokenization Gains Momentum On Monday, Libeara, the blockchain infrastructure platform backed by Standard Chartered’s venture arm SC Ventures, rolled out a new tokenized gold investment fund in Singapore, bringing one of the world’s oldest safe-haven assets onto digital rails. The fund, launched in partnership with FundBridge Capital, allows professional investors to gain exposure to gold through blockchain-based tokens issued on Libeara’s ledger. In a recent research, Web3 digital property firm Animoca Brands said that tokenization of RWAs could unlock a $400 trillion traditional finance market. Animoca researchers Andrew Ho and Ming Ruan said the global market for private credit, treasury debt, commodities, stocks, alternative funds, and bonds represents a vast runway for growth. “The estimated $400 trillion addressable TradFi market underscores the potential growth runway for RWA tokenization,” they wrote. Meanwhile, according to the 2025 Skynet RWA Security Report, the market for tokenized RWAs could grow to $16 trillion by 2030 .

In a significant market shift, BNB overtakes XRP , reclaiming its position as the world’s fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This move highlights the ongoing battle for dominance among major altcoins and underscores the powerful influence of ecosystem utility. Let’s break down what happened and why it matters for your portfolio. How Did BNB Manage to Overtake XRP? According to data from CoinMarketCap, BNB’s market cap reached approximately $122.9 billion, edging past XRP’s $122.7 billion. This seemingly small margin represents a major psychological and financial milestone. The shift isn’t just about a price pump; it’s a reflection of sustained growth and utility. BNB’s rise is deeply tied to the expansive Binance ecosystem, which includes the world’s largest crypto exchange, the BNB Chain network, and numerous real-world applications. Meanwhile, XRP’s price has faced headwinds despite a major legal victory against the SEC. The market is now signaling that utility and active use within a thriving ecosystem may carry more weight in the long run than regulatory clarity alone. This is a crucial lesson for investors focusing on fundamentals. What Does This Ranking Shift Really Mean? When BNB overtakes XRP , it sends a clear message about value drivers in crypto. Market cap rankings are a popularity contest powered by real money and belief in a project’s future. This change suggests investors are prioritizing: Ecosystem Strength: BNB is the fuel for Binance Smart Chain, transaction fees, and hundreds of projects. Utility Over Speculation: Its use case is clear and constantly expanding. Exchange Backing: The direct support from the world’s leading crypto exchange provides unique stability. For XRP, the challenge is to translate its legal wins into accelerated adoption and developer activity to reclaim its position. Can BNB Hold Its Position Against XRP? The battle for fourth place is likely far from over. Both assets have passionate communities and strong fundamentals. However, BNB’s position seems fortified by continuous development. Key factors that could help BNB maintain its lead include: The ongoing growth of decentralized applications (dApps) on BNB Chain. Binance’s quarterly token burns, which reduce BNB supply. New use cases like decentralized storage and computing. Conversely, a surge in cross-border payment adoption using XRP or another favorable legal ruling could see the tables turn again. Therefore, investors should watch both ecosystems closely. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors This event is more than just news; it’s a data point for your strategy. When a major token like BNB overtakes XRP , it’s a reminder to assess your holdings based on utility and ecosystem health. Don’t just chase rankings. Instead, consider: Diversification: Exposure to both ecosystem tokens (like BNB) and payment-focused assets (like XRP) can balance a portfolio. Long-Term Vision: Rankings change monthly. Focus on projects solving real problems. Staying Informed: Follow development activity and partnership announcements, not just price charts. In conclusion, the fact that BNB overtakes XRP is a testament to the dynamic and competitive nature of the cryptocurrency market. It underscores the growing premium placed on tokens with deep utility and active, thriving ecosystems. While rankings will continue to fluctuate, this shift emphasizes a move towards fundamental value over narrative alone. For savvy investors, it’s a call to focus on use cases, adoption metrics, and technological progress when evaluating any digital asset’s long-term potential. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean that BNB overtook XRP in market cap? A: It means the total market value of all BNB in circulation (price per coin multiplied by supply) is now higher than that of XRP, making it the fourth most valuable cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT. Q2: Is BNB a better investment than XRP now? A: “Better” is subjective and depends on your strategy. BNB is tied to the Binance ecosystem’s growth, while XRP is focused on cross-border payments. Both have different risk and reward profiles. Q3: Could XRP reclaim the fourth spot from BNB? A> Absolutely. Cryptocurrency rankings are highly volatile. Increased adoption of Ripple’s payment solutions or another positive price swing could easily push XRP back above BNB. Q4: Why is BNB’s market cap so high? A: BNB’s value is supported by its multifaceted utility across the vast Binance universe—paying for trading fees, powering the BNB Smart Chain, and participating in token sales, among other uses. Q5: Does this change affect the price of Bitcoin or Ethereum? A> Not directly. This is a competition within the “altcoin” market. However, it signals where investor capital and confidence are flowing within the broader crypto ecosystem. Q6: How often do these top 5 cryptocurrency rankings change? A: Changes among the top 3 (BTC, ETH, USDT) are rare, but positions 4 and below have seen more frequent shifts, especially between assets like BNB, XRP, and SOL, reflecting market sentiment.

The price is now struggling and faces resistance near the $2.040 resistance level. XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.050 zone. The price is now trading below $2.050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.040 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it settles below $2.00. XRP Price Struggles Near Resistance XRP price attempted a recovery wave above $2.150 but failed to continue higher, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price started a fresh decline below $2.080 and $2.050. There was a move below the $2.00 support level. A low was formed at $1.993, and the price recently started an upside correction. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.177 swing high to the $1.993 low. However, the bears are active near $2.040 and $2.050. There is also a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.040 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.050 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.040 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.080 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.177 swing high to the $1.993 low. A close above $2.080 could send the price to $2.012. The next hurdle sits at $2.150. A clear move above the $2.150 resistance might send the price toward the $2.1850 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.220 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.250. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.040 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.00 level. The next major support is near the $1.9880 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $1.9880 level, the price might continue to decline toward $1.920. The next major support sits near the $1.880 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $1.820. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level.

PayPal crypto head, May Zabaneh, confirmed to Fortune that the feature is live and currently limited to US-based users. A Google spokesperson confirmed to the outlet that creator payouts in PayPal’s stablecoin are now supported, while declining to provide further detail. YouTube already uses PayPal’s mass payout infrastructure to pay creators, gig workers and contractors. Big Tech’s Push Into Tokenized Money Grows As YouTube Adopts PYUSD Earlier in the third quarter, PayPal added an option that lets payment recipients take their money in PYUSD instead of cash balances. YouTube then decided to extend that choice to creators who receive a share of revenue from the ads and subscriptions their videos generate. Zabaneh said the structure means PayPal handles the crypto piece end-to-end. In practice, YouTube continues to interact with PayPal in fiat terms, while PayPal converts payouts into PYUSD for creators who opt in, reducing the technical and regulatory lift for the video platform. The change lands as Big Tech leans further into stablecoins and tokenized money. Google and its peers have shown growing interest in crypto infrastructure during a fresh wave of digital asset hype in Silicon Valley. For YouTube, letting creators earn in stablecoins adds another toggle to its monetization toolkit without redesigning the core product. Trump Era Stablecoin Rules And Mega Deals Propel Tokens Into Broader Finance Stablecoins such as PYUSD track assets like the dollar and have long been a core building block of crypto trading. Over the past year, they have pushed further into mainstream finance, helped by President Donald Trump signing new federal legislation on stablecoin oversight and by a run of high-profile corporate deals. Payments giant Stripe, for example, closed a $1.1B acquisition of stablecoin firm Bridge in February. PayPal has been one of the earlier movers among large tech and payments companies. It enabled buying and selling of Bitcoin, Ethereum and a handful of other tokens in 2020, then launched PYUSD in 2023. The token now has a market value of nearly $4B, according to CoinGecko, and sits at the centre of the company’s on-chain strategy. PYUSD Gains Reach As PayPal Pushes Its Stablecoin Into Everyday Payments Since launch, PayPal has threaded PYUSD through its ecosystem. Users can hold the token in PayPal’s main wallet and in Venmo, spend it at supported merchants and, from this year, use it as a settlement asset for small and medium-sized businesses paying vendors. The YouTube integration effectively extends that reach to millions of potential creators who may prefer to hold a dollar stablecoin rather than receive traditional bank payouts. This is not the first time Google has interacted directly with PYUSD. An executive at Google Cloud previously told Fortune that the cloud division had accepted payments from two customers in the PayPal stablecoin, signalling that the company is willing to experiment with on chain settlement where it fits into existing contracts.

The 10,000 to 100,000 BTC cohort has sold or redistributed 36,500 BTC (approx. $3.4 billion) since December 1, according to Glassnode data . The distribution coincides with Bitcoin’s struggle to break the $94,000 resistance level following Wednesday’s Federal Reserve rate cut. BTC traded at $92,250 (-0.2%) during the early Asian session Friday. The Data Points The Cohort: Entities holding 10k-100k BTC (often institutional custodians or early miners). The Volume: ~$3.37 billion in selling pressure over 12 days. The Trend: This marks a shift from accumulation to distribution for this specific class, contrasting with retail sentiment which remains elevated. Liquidity Drought Market depth is thinning. Stablecoin liquidity, a proxy for buying power, has dropped significantly. Data cited by FX Leaders notes a 50% decline in stablecoin inflows since August, suggesting the current price levels lack the fresh capital support needed for a breakout above $100,000. “Bitcoin is trading steadily near $92,000 as markets digest the Fed’s rate cut alongside its plan to inject liquidity by purchasing $40 billion in Treasury bills each month. While this liquidity boost will have a stronger long-term impact, near-term sentiment is also improving, supported by renewed institutional flows,” noted Akshat Siddhant, Lead Quant Analyst at Mudrex. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs saw more than $610 million in inflows over the past two days, signalling growing confidence. For BTC to push toward the $100,000 mark, a daily close above $94,140 is key, with $90,000 acting as immediate support. BTC Faces $88K Support Test This divergence is the signal to watch. While retail chases the “Fed pivot” narrative, the smart money (10k-100k BTC tier) is using the liquidity to exit. The $3.4B outflow from this cohort, combined with the 50% drop in stablecoin reserves, indicates the current range ($88k-$94k) is being used for distribution, not accumulation. Expect volatility to increase if BTC loses the $88,000 support handle.

55672809,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=244143,1765516211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revealed: Galaxy Digital’s Stunning $175 Million Bitcoin Transfer to a Crypto Whale,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/galaxy-digital-bitcoin-whale-transfer/,"BitcoinWorld Revealed: Galaxy Digital’s Stunning $175 Million Bitcoin Transfer to a Crypto Whale In a move that has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency community, Galaxy Digital, a leading crypto financial services firm, has executed a staggering Bitcoin transfer worth $175 million to a single anonymous address. This colossal movement of 1,900 BTC, culminating in a final $64.8 million transaction, spotlights the growing influence of institutional players and mysterious ‘whales’ in shaping the digital asset landscape. What does this massive Galaxy Digital Bitcoin transfer signal for the market’s future? What Is the Galaxy Digital Bitcoin Transfer All About? According to data from The Data Nerd, Galaxy Digital initiated a series of transactions over three days. The firm moved a total of 1,900 BTC, valued at approximately $175 million, to a new wallet address beginning with ‘bc1qp8’. The most recent transaction, involving 700 BTC worth $64.8 million, occurred just eight hours before reports surfaced. This isn’t a simple trade; it’s a strategic, high-value Bitcoin transfer from a known institutional entity to an unknown counterparty, often called a ‘whale’ in crypto parlance. Why Should This Massive BTC Movement Matter to You? While large transactions happen daily, a Galaxy Digital Bitcoin transfer of this magnitude from a publicly traded company demands attention. It provides a clear window into institutional behavior. Here are the key implications for everyday investors and the broader market: Institutional Confidence: Moving such a large sum suggests a strategic long-term plan, potentially involving custody solutions, over-the-counter (OTC) deals, or preparations for a new financial product. Market Sentiment: Whales can influence prices. A concentrated buy or sell order from a wallet holding hundreds of millions in BTC can create significant volatility. Transparency vs. Anonymity: The transaction is transparent on the blockchain, but the recipient’s identity is hidden. This highlights Bitcoin’s core duality: a public ledger with private participants. Who Could Be Behind the Receiving Whale Address? The destination address, ‘bc1qp8’, is a complete mystery. This anonymity fuels speculation. Could this Bitcoin transfer be for another institution, a wealthy individual, or a fund? Several possibilities exist: A New Institutional Client: Galaxy Digital may be moving assets for a hedge fund, family office, or corporation entering the crypto space. An Internal Treasury Move: The firm could be shifting funds between its own wallets for security or operational reasons. Collateral for a Financial Product: The BTC might be earmarked as collateral for lending, derivatives, or a forthcoming ETF-related activity. Without more context, the true purpose remains unclear. However, the sheer scale confirms that high-stakes crypto finance is operating in the background, largely unseen by retail traders. What Are the Practical Takeaways from This Event? For investors watching this Galaxy Digital Bitcoin transfer , the event is less about immediate price action and more about understanding market structure. Here are actionable insights: Monitor Whale Activity: Use blockchain explorers to track large wallet movements. They often precede major market trends. Assess Institutional Trends: Actions by firms like Galaxy Digital often reflect broader institutional sentiment toward Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Focus on Fundamentals: While whale moves are notable, long-term investment decisions should still be based on Bitcoin’s technological fundamentals and adoption curve. Conclusion: Decoding the Signal in the Noise The $175 million Galaxy Digital Bitcoin transfer is a powerful testament to the maturation of cryptocurrency markets. It demonstrates that institutional capital flows are now a dominant force, capable of moving billions seamlessly on a public blockchain. For the astute observer, this isn’t just a transaction; it’s a signal. It underscores Bitcoin’s entrenched role in global finance and reminds us that the most significant market moves often happen off the public exchanges, in the quiet corridors of institutional strategy. The whale may be anonymous, but its impact on the market’s depth and future is very real. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Galaxy Digital? A1: Galaxy Digital is a leading financial services and investment management firm dedicated to the digital asset and cryptocurrency sector. It is publicly traded and provides services like trading, asset management, and investment banking for institutions. Q2: What is a ‘whale’ in cryptocurrency? A2: A ‘whale’ is an individual or entity that holds a large enough amount of a cryptocurrency that their buying or selling activity can significantly influence the market price. Q3: Are large Bitcoin transfers like this normal? A3: Yes, large transfers between institutional wallets and exchanges are common. However, a transfer of this size from a major firm like Galaxy Digital to a new, anonymous wallet is noteworthy and often analyzed for potential market implications. Q4: How can I track large Bitcoin transactions? A4: You can use blockchain explorers like Blockchain.com, BTC.com, or specialized analytics platforms like Arkham Intelligence or The Data Nerd to monitor large wallet movements and transactions. Q5: Does this transfer mean Galaxy Digital is selling its Bitcoin? A5: Not necessarily. A transfer to another wallet does not equate to a sale on the open market. It could be for custody, collateral, or an OTC deal with a specific counterparty. The Bitcoin remains in circulation. Q6: Should I change my investment strategy based on this news? A6: Single transactions, even large ones, should not dictate your core investment strategy. They are data points for understanding market dynamics. Always base long-term decisions on thorough research and risk assessment. Found this analysis of the major Galaxy Digital Bitcoin transfer insightful?

55672878,https://cryptonews.com/?p=463033,1765516333,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/55672878.jpeg,Binance Adds New Trading Pairs for Trump Family’s USD1 Stablecoin,https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-adds-new-trading-pairs-for-trump-familys-usd1-stablecoin/,"Binance has widened access to the Trump family–linked USD1 stablecoin, adding new fee-free trading pairs as the token gains a larger foothold on the exchange. Key Takeaways: Binance expanded USD1 trading with new zero-fee pairs and will fully replace BUSD collateral with USD1. USD1 has rapidly grown to a $2.7B market cap, backed by US Treasuries and supported by major Abu Dhabi investment flows. The token’s rise comes amid renewed political attention and Binance’s regulatory gains in Abu Dhabi. The company confirmed on Thursday that users can now trade USD1 against Ether, Solana and BNB, joining its existing Bitcoin pair. Binance Retires BUSD, Makes USD1 Its Primary Collateral Asset The move deepens Binance’s integration of USD1 and comes as the exchange will convert all remaining BUSD collateral into USD1 at a one-to-one rate within a week. The decision effectively retires BUSD from Binance’s internal structure and positions USD1 as its primary dollar-pegged asset for collateral use. Binance said the conversion reflects a broader update to its collateral framework, describing USD1 as “an integral part” of the exchange’s ecosystem going forward. World Liberty Financial CEO Zach Witkoff welcomed the expansion, calling it a milestone for a stablecoin that launched only in March. USD1, backed by U.S. Treasury bills and issued on Ethereum and BNB Chain, has climbed to the seventh-largest stablecoin with a market value of $2.7 billion. Its rapid ascent was boosted in May when Abu Dhabi investment firm MGX deployed USD1 for a $2 billion investment on Binance. USD1 is integrating with the world’s largest exchange @binance to expand the global adoption of USD1 @worldlibertyfi See the press release below https://t.co/8INMRIH45d — Zach Witkoff (@ZachWitkoff) December 11, 2025 Despite early momentum, supply has dipped slightly from its $3 billion peak in late October, with no new tokens minted for several months, according to CoinGecko data. World Liberty Financial was co-founded by President Donald Trump and his sons, giving USD1 an unusually political profile in the stablecoin market. The involvement drew further attention after Trump pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao seven weeks ago. Zhao had been sentenced to four months in prison in April 2024 for failing to implement adequate anti-money laundering controls at the exchange. Trump later said he issued the pardon after hearing broad support for Zhao and insisting the offense “is not even a crime.” The move also comes as Binance has secured three new licences in Abu Dhabi , tightening its grip on one of the most ambitious digital asset hubs in the Middle East and giving the exchange a powerful regulatory base as it pushes to keep institutional money on side. The Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Abu Dhabi Global Market has approved Binance.com to operate through a trio of regulated entities that together cover exchange, clearing and broker dealer activities. Binance Eyes US Comeback After Trump Pardons Founder Changpeng Zhao Binance is reportedly exploring ways to re-enter the US market following Trump’s pardon of CZ. The exchange is weighing options such as merging its US affiliate with its global platform or allowing its main exchange to serve American users directly. Zhao’s pardon, granted after his 2023 guilty plea for anti–money laundering violations, has reignited scrutiny amid Binance’s $2 billion deal with Trump’s family-backed crypto venture, World Liberty Financial. The clemency removes prior legal barriers that had restricted his involvement in Binance operations. Legal experts say the move effectively reinstates Zhao’s ability to engage in business decisions, giving the company’s leadership a major boost as it eyes renewed US access. Zhao, whose net worth stands at $61.4 billion, remains one of the most powerful figures in crypto, overseeing an ecosystem with $8.7 billion in on-chain assets. The pardon comes as Trump continues to court the digital asset industry, with his family reportedly earning over $1 billion from crypto ventures .

This announcement, made on December 11th, marks a pivotal moment for SOLV, potentially unlocking new liquidity and visibility. But what does this strategic listing truly mean for investors and the broader DeFi landscape? Let’s dive into the details and implications. What is the Solv Protocol (SOLV)? Before understanding the impact of the listing, it’s crucial to grasp what Solv Protocol does. In simple terms, Solv Protocol is a decentralized platform focused on creating and managing financial instruments. Think of it as a toolkit for building complex DeFi products like bonds and vaults in a more efficient and liquid way. The SOLV token powers this ecosystem, used for governance, staking, and fee payments. Therefore, when Kraken lists Solv Protocol , it’s not just adding another token; it’s providing a gateway to a sophisticated segment of DeFi for its vast user base.

Kwon was openly remorseful and expressed a desire to serve part of his sentence in South Korea, where he could face additional charges and potentially decades more prison time. Do Kwon Sentenced to 15 Years Do Kwon, the co-founder of Terraform Labs, was sentenced to 15 years in a US federal prison after pleading guilty to wire fraud and conspiracy to defraud for his role in the catastrophic collapse of the Terra ecosystem. The 2022 implosion wiped out roughly $40 billion in market value and left thousands of investors financially devastated. During the sentencing hearing in the Southern District of New York, Judge Paul Engelmayer delivered a sharply worded rebuke of Kwon’s actions, and placed a lot of emphasis on the fact that the severity and duration of his deception required a substantial prison term. Kwon will receive credit for time served in the United States as well as 17 months spent in custody in Montenegro prior to extradition. Live court reporting from Inner City Press (Source: Bluesky ) Before the judge issued his decision, he heard from several victims who described in detail how Terra’s collapse upended their lives. Prosecutors said more than 16,500 people filed claims in Terraform’s bankruptcy proceedings. One victim, Tatiana Dontsova, recounted how she sold her apartment in Moscow and relocated to Tbilisi after investing in what she believed was a promising ecosystem. Her $81,000 investment collapsed to just $13, which left her homeless and without recourse. The judge mentioned these stories while pointing out that investor risk does not equate to accepting the possibility of fraud, and called Kwon’s conduct “unusually serious” and rooted in exploiting public trust. Do Kwon Kwon addressed the court by saying he spent years reflecting on the collapse and expressed a desire to serve his punishment in South Korea, where he has been separated from his family for three years. Engelmayer acknowledged his remorse but warned that leniency was not appropriate. He stated that without the guilty plea, the sentence would have been even harsher. Live court reporting from Inner City Press (Source: Bluesky ) The judge also dismissed both sides’ suggestions for shorter sentencing ranges, and found the prosecution’s recommended 12 years “unreasonable.” Under the terms of his sentence, Kwon may be extradited to South Korea after serving half of his US term, where he could face up to an additional 40 years in prison. His conviction is yet another major chapter in the legal reckoning facing high-profile crypto executives.

According to a compelling report from LD Capital, the evidence points toward genuine Ethereum long-term growth . The analysis highlights that solutions to scalability challenges and a maturing ecosystem are creating a powerful foundation for the future, attracting serious institutional interest in the process. What’s Driving Ethereum Long-Term Growth? LD Capital’s report makes a clear case. Blockchain technology is transforming industries, and Ethereum leads this charge with its unparalleled smart contract and decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem. However, the network’s journey hasn’t been without speed bumps. High transaction fees have been a persistent challenge, opening the door for competitors. The report argues that Ethereum’s strategic upgrades are directly addressing these issues to secure its future. The Merge: A Foundation for Efficiency A pivotal moment for Ethereum long-term growth was ‘The Merge.’ This transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) was more than a technical milestone. It fundamentally improved Ethereum’s framework in three key areas: Scalability: Laid the groundwork for future throughput enhancements. Security: Strengthened the network’s defenses. Energy Efficiency: Reduced its environmental footprint by over 99%, addressing a major concern for institutional investors. This upgrade demonstrated Ethereum’s capacity for evolution, a critical trait for any technology aiming for longevity. How Will Layer 2 Solutions and Sharding Unlock Potential? While The Merge set the stage, the report identifies Layer 2 solutions and the upcoming sharding upgrade as the main actors for solving scalability. Think of Layer 2s as express lanes built on top of the main Ethereum highway, processing transactions faster and cheaper. Sharding will then divide the network’s data into smaller, manageable pieces (shards), dramatically increasing its capacity. Together, these innovations are expected to resolve the fee issues that have hampered user experience. This technical roadmap is central to LD Capital’s bullish outlook on Ethereum long-term growth , as it directly tackles the network’s most significant barrier to mass adoption. Wall Street’s Growing Consensus on Ethereum The technical story is compelling, but the on-chain and financial data adds concrete evidence. LD Capital founder Jack Yi points to a shifting tide in traditional finance. He notes a growing Wall Street consensus for blockchain adoption, with Ethereum as a primary beneficiary. Several metrics support this shift: The EIP-1559 upgrade (“the Fusaka upgrade”) permanently removes ETH from circulation through transaction fee burning, increasing scarcity. Speculative leverage is at an all-time low, suggesting a healthier, less volatile market base. Exchange reserves hold only 10% of the supply, indicating strong holding sentiment rather than selling pressure. Yi concludes that in the current cycle of interest rate cuts, funds are flowing into ETH not for speculation, but for its tangible value as a productive technological asset. Conclusion: A Convergence of Factors The path to Ethereum long-term growth appears to be built on a powerful convergence. Technical upgrades are systematically solving scalability and efficiency problems. Meanwhile, a robust dApp ecosystem continues to drive real-world utility. Perhaps most tellingly, these fundamentals are now capturing the attention and capital of institutional investors, creating a new phase of maturation for Ethereum. The report from LD Capital suggests this isn’t mere optimism, but a trend grounded in measurable progress and financial logic. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What did LD Capital’s report say about Ethereum? The report states Ethereum is positioned for long-term growth due to its ongoing scalability solutions (like Layer 2s and sharding), efficiency gains from The Merge, and increasing institutional adoption. How did The Merge contribute to Ethereum’s growth? The Merge transitioned Ethereum to Proof-of-Stake, drastically improving its energy efficiency (over 99%), enhancing security, and providing a foundation for future scalability improvements. What are the main challenges for Ethereum mentioned? The primary challenge has been high transaction fees during periods of network congestion. The report states this is being addressed through Layer 2 scaling solutions and the planned sharding upgrade. What on-chain metrics support the growth thesis? Key metrics include a high ETH burn rate from EIP-1559, low speculative leverage, and only 10% of ETH supply held on exchanges, indicating strong holding sentiment. Is Wall Street interested in Ethereum? Yes. LD Capital’s founder highlighted a growing consensus on Wall Street for blockchain adoption, with funds flowing into Ethereum for its tangible value as a technological asset, especially during economic cycles favoring alternative investments. What is the role of Layer 2 solutions? Layer 2 solutions are secondary frameworks built on Ethereum that process transactions off the main chain. They are crucial for reducing fees and increasing transaction speed, solving key scalability issues in the short-to-medium term. Found this analysis on Ethereum’s future insightful?

A powerful signal just flashed across the Bitcoin network. In a stunning display of confidence, dedicated Bitcoin accumulation addresses scooped up a massive 75,000 BTC in just the first ten days of December. This isn’t casual trading; it’s a strategic, long-term bet on Bitcoin’s future. Let’s dive into what this means for the market and why you should pay attention. What Are Bitcoin Accumulation Addresses Telling Us? First, let’s clarify what we mean by Bitcoin accumulation addresses . These are not your average crypto wallets. According to analysis shared by CryptoQuant contributor DarkPost, these addresses have specific hallmarks that scream “diamond hands.” They have no history of withdrawals , only repeated deposits. Furthermore, analysts filter out wallets linked to exchanges, miners, or smart contracts. This leaves a pure sample of wallets held by entities buying Bitcoin to hold, not to trade. The recent activity from these wallets is nothing short of remarkable. The December Surge: A Closer Look at the Numbers The data reveals a compelling narrative. Between December 1st and 10th, these long-term focused Bitcoin accumulation addresses added 75,000 BTC to their coffers. To put that in perspective, that’s over $3.2 billion worth of Bitcoin at current prices. Even more striking is the pace of buying. A whopping 40,000 BTC of that total was purchased in just a 48-hour window between December 9th and 10th. This concentrated buying spree has pushed the total holdings of this tracked cohort to approximately 315,000 BTC, and the trend reportedly continues. This action highlights several key points: Institutional Confidence: Large, sustained purchases suggest deep-pocketed investors see current prices as a strategic entry point. Supply Shock Potential: When Bitcoin is moved off exchanges into these cold storage wallets, it reduces the liquid supply available for trading. Long-Term Horizon: The very definition of these addresses implies the buyers are in it for the long haul, not short-term gains. Why Does This Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Matter for Investors? For everyday investors, this trend is a crucial data point. While price charts show volatility, the behavior of Bitcoin accumulation addresses can reveal underlying strength. Think of it as the difference between weather and climate. Daily price swings are the weather—unpredictable and noisy. Accumulation patterns are part of the climate—a longer-term trend that shapes the landscape. When entities with proven holding discipline are buying aggressively, it often precedes periods of price appreciation. However, it’s not a guaranteed short-term signal. Markets are complex, and accumulation is just one piece of the puzzle. Other factors like macroeconomic conditions and regulatory news still play a dominant role. Actionable Insights: How to Use This Information So, what can you do with this knowledge? First, don’t panic sell based on short-term dips if the long-term accumulation trend is strong. Second, consider your own strategy. Are you trading or accumulating? If your goal is long-term growth, adopting a similar mindset to these Bitcoin accumulation addresses —consistent buying regardless of daily noise—can be a powerful strategy. Finally, always diversify and never invest more than you can afford to lose. On-chain data like this is a powerful tool, but it should inform your decisions, not dictate them entirely. The Bottom Line on Bitcoin’s Accumulation Phase The aggressive buying by Bitcoin accumulation addresses in early December is a potent vote of confidence. It suggests that sophisticated players are positioning themselves for the next market phase, potentially anticipating a reduction in sell-side pressure and future scarcity. While past performance never guarantees future results, understanding where the coins are flowing provides a clearer picture than price alone. The silent accumulation by these steadfast wallets may well be writing the prologue to Bitcoin’s next major chapter. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a Bitcoin accumulation address? A1: It’s a wallet address identified by analysts as belonging to a long-term holder. Key criteria include having no withdrawal history, a pattern of repeated deposits, and no links to exchanges, miners, or smart contracts. Q2: Does this mean the Bitcoin price will go up immediately? A2: Not necessarily. Accumulation is a long-term bullish indicator, but short-term price is influenced by many other factors like news, regulations, and overall market sentiment. Q3: Who is behind these accumulation addresses? A3: It’s typically impossible to know the exact identity, but they are likely large investors, institutions, funds, or extremely committed individuals with a long-term investment thesis. Q4: How can I track Bitcoin accumulation trends myself? A4: You can use on-chain analytics platforms like CryptoQuant or Glassnode, which provide data and charts on exchange flows, holder behavior, and wallet cohorts. Q5: Is 75,000 BTC a lot? A5: Absolutely. It represents over $3.2 billion at current prices and is about 0.35% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply, which is a significant amount for one cohort to absorb in just 10 days. Q6: Should I start accumulating Bitcoin too? A6> That’s a personal financial decision. This data shows what large, disciplined investors are doing. If it aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals, a dollar-cost averaging strategy can be a sensible approach. Found this analysis of Bitcoin accumulation addresses insightful?

The cryptocurrency market has witnessed the explosive rise of political meme coins, and none has captured attention quite like the TRUMP meme coin. As investors speculate about its future, the burning question emerges: Can $TRUMP really reach $50 by 2030? This comprehensive analysis examines the factors that could propel this controversial digital asset to unprecedented heights or send it crashing back to earth. What is the TRUMP Meme Coin? The TRUMP meme coin represents a unique fusion of cryptocurrency and political sentiment. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that focus on technological innovation, meme coins like $TRUMP derive their value primarily from community engagement, social media trends, and cultural relevance. The coin’s connection to former President Donald Trump creates a volatile mix of political enthusiasm and speculative trading that has captured both crypto enthusiasts and political supporters. Current Market Analysis of $TRUMP Understanding the TRUMP meme coin’s potential requires examining its current market position. The coin operates within the highly speculative meme coin sector, where prices can fluctuate dramatically based on social media trends, celebrity endorsements, and political developments. Key factors influencing its current valuation include: Community size and engagement levels Trading volume and liquidity metrics Political events and election cycles Overall cryptocurrency market sentiment Regulatory developments affecting meme coins TRUMP Meme Coin Price Prediction 2026 Looking ahead to 2026, several scenarios could unfold for the $TRUMP cryptocurrency price prediction. The coin’s performance will likely depend on multiple converging factors: Scenario Price Range Key Drivers Bullish $8-$15 Political victory, mainstream adoption, crypto bull market Moderate $3-$7 Steady community growth, moderate political relevance Bearish $0.50-$2 Regulatory crackdown, political setbacks, crypto winter 2027 Cryptocurrency Price Prediction for $TRUMP The 2027 outlook for the TRUMP meme coin becomes increasingly complex as political cycles and cryptocurrency market maturity intersect. By this point, the coin will have established either a sustainable niche or faded into obscurity. Critical considerations include: Potential integration with political fundraising mechanisms Development of utility beyond pure speculation Competition from other political meme coins Broader acceptance of cryptocurrency in political ecosystems Will $TRUMP Price Hit $50 by 2030? The $50 target represents an ambitious milestone that would require extraordinary circumstances. For the TRUMP meme coin to achieve this valuation, several conditions must align perfectly: First, the cryptocurrency market would need to enter a massive bull cycle, potentially driven by institutional adoption and regulatory clarity. Second, political developments would need to maintain or increase the coin’s relevance through the 2028 election cycle and beyond. Third, the meme coin would need to develop genuine utility or become integrated into political ecosystems in meaningful ways. While mathematically possible given cryptocurrency’s history of explosive growth, the $50 target represents an extreme outcome that would require unprecedented convergence of political and crypto market factors. Key Factors Influencing Meme Coin Analysis Successful meme coin analysis requires understanding the unique dynamics that drive this sector. Unlike traditional cryptocurrency evaluation based on fundamentals, meme coins operate on different principles: Social Media Virality: Twitter, Reddit, and TikTok trends can create overnight sensations Celebrity Endorsements: Public figures can dramatically impact prices with single posts Community Strength: Dedicated holders often determine long-term viability Market Timing: Alignment with broader crypto cycles amplifies effects Political Events: Elections, speeches, and policy announcements create volatility Risks and Challenges for Trump Cryptocurrency Investors Investing in the Trump cryptocurrency carries significant risks that every potential buyer must consider: The regulatory environment remains uncertain, with potential crackdowns on meme coins that could dramatically impact liquidity and accessibility. Political volatility creates unpredictable price swings that can wipe out positions quickly. The coin’s value remains almost entirely speculative, lacking the fundamental technological foundations of more established cryptocurrencies. Additionally, competition within the political meme coin space could fragment attention and capital. Comparative Analysis with Other Political Meme Coins The TRUMP meme coin exists within a growing ecosystem of politically-themed cryptocurrencies. Understanding its position requires comparison with similar assets: Coin Key Differentiator Market Position Risk Profile $TRUMP Direct political figure association Market leader in political coins Extremely high Other political coins Party or ideology focused Niche positions High Traditional meme coins Cultural or internet meme based Established communities Moderate to high Actionable Insights for $TRUMP Investors For those considering investment in the TRUMP meme coin, several strategic approaches may improve outcomes: First, allocate only risk capital you can afford to lose completely. Second, develop clear entry and exit strategies based on political calendars and crypto market cycles. Third, diversify within the meme coin sector rather than concentrating solely on $TRUMP. Fourth, stay informed about regulatory developments that could impact trading. Finally, maintain realistic expectations about the speculative nature of this investment. FAQs About TRUMP Meme Coin What makes the TRUMP meme coin different from other cryptocurrencies? The TRUMP meme coin derives its value primarily from political sentiment and community engagement rather than technological innovation or utility, making it more susceptible to political events and social media trends. How does political news affect $TRUMP price? Political developments, especially those involving Donald Trump , can create immediate and dramatic price movements. Positive news typically boosts the coin, while negative developments can trigger selloffs. Is $TRUMP considered a security by regulators? The regulatory status remains unclear. The Securities and Exchange Commission has increased scrutiny of meme coins, and any classification as a security would significantly impact trading. Can the TRUMP meme coin develop real utility? While currently speculative, potential utility could emerge through political fundraising, merchandise purchases, or exclusive access to events, though such developments remain uncertain. What are the tax implications of trading $TRUMP? Like other cryptocurrencies, $TRUMP transactions are typically subject to capital gains tax. Investors should consult with tax professionals familiar with both crypto and political donation regulations. Conclusion: The High-Stakes Future of Political Meme Coins The TRUMP meme coin represents one of the most fascinating experiments at the intersection of cryptocurrency and politics. While the path to $50 by 2030 appears challenging, the coin’s future will undoubtedly provide valuable insights into how digital assets interact with political movements. Investors must navigate this landscape with eyes wide open to both extraordinary opportunities and significant risks. The coming years will reveal whether political meme coins represent a lasting innovation or a passing phenomenon in the evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem.

The message gained interest because it focused on routine actions that allow customers to earn XRP without additional complexity. The central point was that the system functions through straightforward utility rather than promotional activity. XRP Rewards Through Direct Use Of Uphold Services In the video referenced in the post, Nancy Beaton outlined how users can earn XRP by engaging with Uphold’s existing features. She stated that users who choose to direct deposit part of their paycheck into their Uphold account can decide whether to spend through the Uphold card or trade on the platform. According to her explanation, doing so can provide up to 4% back in XRP. Combined with other reward mechanisms, she noted that users could potentially earn up to 10% back in XRP each month. Beaton emphasized that a segment of Uphold’s community consistently expresses interest in earning more XRP . She described the group as composed of committed digital asset users who frequently ask how they can generate returns on the asset through practical means. NANCY JUST NAILED IT The @UpholdInc CRO & CMO just explained $XRP rewards in the simplest, most real way. You pay, you live your life, and the #XRP comes back. No hype, no script, just utility that works. Sometimes the truth doesn’t need noise. pic.twitter.com/beSIpkuJpv — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) December 9, 2025 Introduction Of A New Partnership Focused On Yield Beaton also shared that Uphold plans to launch a partnership in the fourth quarter with the EXA Protocol, also known as the Exactly Protocol. This collaboration will expand options for users who want to lend their digital assets or access credit using their holdings as collateral. Through this product, users will be able to lend assets to a pool and earn yield in a structure similar to traditional DeFi lending models. She explained that the arrangement will also allow users to secure a credit card backed by their collateralized assets. This enables spending without liquidating holdings, while still maintaining the ability to earn yield. Importantly, XRP will be included among the supported assets, and Uphold intends to begin testing the feature in the fourth quarter before expanding availability to a wider user base. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Expectations Around Yield Rates When asked about the potential rates users might earn, Beaton clarified that the rates are not fixed. Because the product is based on a DeFi lending pool, yields can vary over time depending on market conditions. However, she noted that the lending side remains a meaningful opportunity for users looking to generate returns in ways that were not previously accessible on the platform. Squire’s post highlighted Beaton’s clear explanation of how everyday financial activity within the Uphold ecosystem can translate into tangible XRP rewards. Her comments also pointed to upcoming developments that may broaden earning options for users seeking yield while retaining control of their assets.

But between 2021 and 2025, this trust was repeatedly tested as major cloud providers experienced some of the most disruptive outages in their history — events that exposed the risks of centralization and triggered a structural shift in how organizations think about storage and resilience. Over several years, a series of major cloud failures signaled a growing dependence risk: 2021 (AWS): Regional outage disrupted Disney+, Netflix, Coinbase, DoorDash, and Ring services. 2022 (AWS): Additional failures froze airline reservations, banking dashboards, and logistics networks across North America. 2023 (GCP & Azure): Google Cloud networking outage affected Spotify, Snapchat, and payment processors, while Azure authentication issues locked enterprises out of critical systems. 2024 (Azure & GCP): Microsoft cloud misconfigurations brought down Teams, Outlook, and Office365; Google Cloud outages disrupted major fintech apps; government portals in Europe and the Middle East experienced downtime. 2025 (AWS, GCP, Azure): Multi-region AWS banking API failures, GCP storage breakdowns that halted enterprise AI workloads, and Azure identity service outages that left thousands unable to access internal systems. Together, these incidents made it clear that relying on a single cloud provider had become an unacceptable and increasingly costly operational risk. A structural awakening, primarily on the enterprise IT teams, was triggered by these events. The premise upon which the enterprise IT operations were built was fundamentally reviewed; the realization was that a centralized cloud architecture did not equate to operational continuity. The new consideration was not which cloud; rather, how to ensure their ecosystem would function in the face of failures from the larger cloud service providers (CSPs). This resulted in a definite change in the industry where multi-cloud shifted from optional to a necessity. With this change came a new interest in a previously niche approach, namely decentralized cloud storage. Decentralized networks such as StorX came to relevance not due to the hype of crypto, but because their design architecture exactly solved the problems that hyperscaler outages created. StorX fragments and encrypts data before distributing it to a worldwide network of independent nodes. No single operator, single region, or single datacenter control complete files, so outages or failures in a region can’t compromise access. Decentralized storage created geographical redundancy that was not dependent on a single corporate cloud, and so enterprises began to funnel in large media archives, compliance records, backup snapshots, training datasets, and unstructured files that previously routed into zero-tier storage. The efficiency and ease of connection that StorX offered to Google Workspace, LucidLink, Acronis, Veeam, Cloudinary, and S3 integrations for decentralized storage made it relatively easy and frictionless. Many CIOs viewed it as the missing piece that completed their multi-cloud system. With 2026 around the corner, many analysts expect decentralized storage to move from an emerging idea to a standard layer in cloud strategy. Research firms like IDC estimate that the global volume of data will reach well over 160–180 zettabytes by the end of 2025, driven by AI workloads, connected devices, and always-on digital services. At the same time, Gartner forecasts that more than half of multinational organizations will adopt some form of digital sovereignty or data-residency strategy by 2029, up from less than 10% today, as regulations tighten and jurisdictional risk becomes harder to ignore. Combined with forecasts showing strong double-digit growth in both cloud storage and AI-powered storage markets through the next decade, this points to a 2026 in which enterprises no longer optimize purely for convenience, but for resilience, sovereignty, and distributed architectures—conditions under which decentralized storage networks such as StorX are increasingly well positioned. (Source: Seagate , Gartner , CDInsights , Research and Markets , DataM Intelligence ) The last five years have proved, fragility is the consequence of centralization. The future of multi-cloud storage will be seamlessly integrated, distributed, and decentralized. Networks such as storX are at the center of that paradigm shift.

55674278,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=866070,1765519200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/55674278.jpeg,"Crypto Market Dips: The Reasons Behind Bitcoin Plunge Below $90,000 Despite FOMC Optimism",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/crypto-market-dips-the-reasons-behind-bitcoin-plunge-below-90000-despite-fomc-optimism/,"On Thursday, Bitcoin (BTC) once again fell below the critical $90,000 mark, even after what many had anticipated to be a bullish event stemming from the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) decision to cut rates by a quarter point. Analysts from Bull Theory note several factors contributing to this unexpected downturn. Bitcoin Sell-Off Amid Market Unease The analysts pointed out that the rate cut itself was largely anticipated by investors weeks prior, with a 95% probability already priced into the market. Ahead of the announcement, they identified that many positioned themselves in expectation of some form of liquidity support from the Fed, leading to a rally in Bitcoin prices. However, when the actual cut and the accompanying plan for $40 billion in monthly T-bill purchases were confirmed, many of these “whales”—large investors in the market—began to take profits. Related Reading: Strategy Calls For Withdrawal Of MSCI’s Exclusion Plan For Digital Asset Treasury Companies Adding to the market’s unease was Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s post-announcement press conference, where he highlighted persistent weaknesses in the labor market and ongoing inflation concerns. Furthermore, the Fed’s dot plot projections indicated the likelihood of only one additional rate cut in 2026. The situation was compounded by disappointing earnings results from Oracle, which reported its second quarter’s financials after the market’s close. The tech giant missed its adjusted revenue estimates, and higher capital expenditure projections led the stock to plunge by more than 11% in after-hours trading. This drop also negatively impacted US stock futures, as concerns grew that the artificial intelligence (AI) boom may be peaking. The widespread fear from Oracle’s results quickly spread from equities into the cryptocurrency space. Ultimately, all three factors converged to create a significant sell-off: the rate cut was already factored into the market, liquidity trades had been preemptively enacted, and Powell’s remarks did not provide the strong easing signal that some traders had hoped for. Positive Liquidity Conditions Expected In 2026 Interestingly, Bull Theory analysts assert that the crypto market’s recent decline is not indicative of a fundamental shift towards bearish conditions but rather an overreaction based on high expectations leading up to the Fed’s announcement. The Fed has now enacted rate cuts three times in as many meetings, and their plans to purchase $40 billion in T-bills over the next month are designed to inject liquidity into the markets. Moreover, Powell indicated that further rate hikes are not on the horizon as a base case, and forecasts for solid economic growth next year remain intact.

The current market movements illustrate that the dumping of assets was largely driven by overly optimistic expectations rather than any deterioration in underlying fundamentals. Looking ahead, the analysts believe that next year is expected to be more favorable for Bitcoin and broader crypto prices in terms of liquidity, contrasting sharply with the conditions projected for 2025.

Members of the House of Lords have launched a fierce opposition to the Bank of England’s proposed stablecoin holding limits , warning the plan could backfire spectacularly. This internal debate puts the UK’s ambition to become a global crypto hub directly in the crosshairs. What Are the Proposed Stablecoin Holding Limits? The Bank of England, as the UK’s central bank and financial regulator, previously outlined a plan to impose strict caps on how much stablecoin individuals and businesses can hold. Their proposal includes: A limit of £20,000 (approximately $25,300) for individual investors. A much higher, but still restrictive, cap of £10 million (around $12.7 million) for corporate holdings. The central bank’s stated goal is to mitigate systemic risk. They argue that without limits, a sudden loss of confidence in a major stablecoin could trigger widespread financial instability. However, critics now argue this defensive move could itself become a source of instability. Why Are UK Lords Sounding the Alarm? In a significant intervention, prominent members of the House of Lords, including financier Peter Cruddas, have written directly to Chancellor Rachel Reeves. Their core argument is stark: the proposed stablecoin holding limits are more likely to cause capital flight than prevent risk. They contend that by imposing such restrictive caps, the UK would inadvertently push innovative companies, investment, and talent to more welcoming jurisdictions like the European Union or Singapore. This would undermine the government’s own strategy to attract crypto business. The Lords are urging the Chancellor to oppose the Bank’s plan, framing it as a critical decision for the UK’s economic future. Could Limits Actually Increase Risk? This debate goes beyond simple policy disagreement. It touches on a fundamental question in crypto regulation: does strict control foster safety or fragility? The Lords’ position suggests that overly rigid stablecoin holding limits could have several unintended consequences: Driving Activity Underground: Users might seek unregulated, offshore alternatives with no consumer protections. Stifling Legitimate Use: Businesses relying on stablecoins for efficient cross-border payments could be hampered. Erooding Competitiveness: The UK could lose its first-mover advantage in establishing clear crypto rules. The fear is that by trying to wall off risk, the Bank might simply export both the risk and the opportunity elsewhere. What’s Next for UK Stablecoin Regulation? The ball is now in the court of the Chancellor and the government. They must weigh the Bank of England’s caution against the Lords’ warnings of economic self-sabotage. This tension highlights the delicate balance regulators worldwide are trying to strike. The outcome will send a powerful signal. Will the UK embrace a pragmatic approach that fosters innovation within a guarded framework? Or will precautionary principles lead to rules that the industry views as unworkable? The decision on these stablecoin holding limits will be a landmark moment, defining the UK’s regulatory character for years to come. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Crypto in Britain The opposition from the House of Lords throws a major curveball into the UK’s crypto regulatory journey. It exposes a deep rift between the instinct to control and the desire to compete. The proposed stablecoin holding limits are no longer just a technical consultation point; they have become a political litmus test. The government’s response will reveal whether “innovation-friendly” is a genuine commitment or just a slogan, ultimately determining if the UK can truly become the digital finance hub it aspires to be. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a stablecoin? A: A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to have a stable value, typically pegged to a reserve asset like the US dollar or a basket of assets. They are widely used for trading and transfers in the crypto ecosystem. Q2: Why does the Bank of England want to limit stablecoin holdings? A: The Bank of England is concerned about financial stability. They worry that if a widely held stablecoin failed, it could cause a cascade of losses across the financial system, similar to a bank run. Q3: What is the main argument against the holding limits? A: Opponents, like the UK Lords, argue the limits are too low and will drive businesses, investment, and innovation out of the UK to countries with more favorable regulations, harming the UK’s economic competitiveness. Q4: Has this policy been finalized? A: No, it has not. The Bank’s proposal is part of an ongoing consultation. The letter from the House of Lords is a formal attempt to influence the government, specifically the Chancellor, to reject the plan before it becomes law. Q5: How do other countries handle stablecoin limits? A: Approaches vary. The EU’s MiCA regulation does not set specific holding caps but imposes strict reserve and governance requirements on stablecoin issuers. The US is still developing its federal regulatory framework. Q6: What can individuals do if the limits are enacted? A: If enacted, individuals holding over £20,000 in stablecoins would likely need to move excess funds to a different asset or use multiple wallets/entities, though the latter might be restricted. The rules would necessitate careful portfolio management. Found this analysis of the UK’s stablecoin debate insightful?

With Rail now fully integrated, Ripple Payments emerges as the industry’s most comprehensive end-to-end stablecoin solution, unifying issuance, movement, compliance, liquidity, and settlement in one seamless ecosystem. No other stablecoin issuer or blockchain firm offers a comparably powerful, vertically integrated stack. Ripple has spent years engineering a future where stablecoins move effortlessly across borders and institutions. With Rail now integrated, that vision is fully in motion. Rail brings advanced compliance automation, seamless on/off-ramps, deeper fiat connectivity, and real-time transaction intelligence, the critical infrastructure needed to scale stablecoin adoption at an institutional level. Ripple’s latest milestone “makes us the end-to-end stablecoin leader,” a bold claim backed by real infrastructure. By combining RLUSD, its enterprise-grade stablecoin, with XRP’s high-speed settlement rails, Ripple has created a dual-asset, dual-network system built for maximum flexibility. Banks can issue their own stablecoins, fintechs can execute instant global payouts, and enterprises can access transparent, compliant settlement, all within a single, unified ecosystem that Ripple now controls from start to finish. This isn’t just an upgrade to Ripple’s product suite, it’s a fundamental reshaping of the competitive landscape. While most stablecoin issuers depend on external partners, fragmented integrations, and third-party compliance layers, Ripple now owns the full value chain, from minting to movement to final settlement. That vertical integration boosts efficiency, minimizes risk, and delivers the seamless experience institutional clients increasingly expect. Notably, the global demand for stablecoin infrastructure is surging, and traditional finance is racing toward tokenization, interoperability, and real-time value movement. Ripple’s timing is perfect. By integrating Rail’s infrastructure with its own global payment network and strong regulatory footprint, Ripple positions itself as the premier provider for institutions seeking a seamless, compliant bridge between digital assets and fiat systems. Therefore, Ripple’s acquisition of Rail is more than expansion, it’s a statement of intent. Ripple isn’t just joining the stablecoin race; it’s positioning itself to lead it. With the deal now officially closed, Ripple stands firmly at the center of the next era of global payments. Conclusion Ripple’s acquisition of Rail is more than an upgrade, it’s a fundamental reset of the global payments landscape. By consolidating every essential layer of stablecoin infrastructure under one platform, Ripple moves beyond competition and steps into the role of industry standard-setter. The combined force of RLUSD, XRP’s instant settlement network, and Rail’s compliance and fiat-connectivity stack forms a unified, institution-ready ecosystem built for scale. As markets accelerate toward tokenization and real-time settlement, Ripple is now uniquely positioned to lead that evolution.

For hundreds of investors in Japan, this became a stark reality last year. The National Tax Agency (NTA) has just announced a record-breaking collection from individual crypto investors, signaling a major crackdown. This move highlights the critical importance of understanding crypto taxes Japan regulations, whether you’re a local trader or watching from abroad. What’s the Big Deal About Japan’s Record Crypto Tax Haul? Japan’s National Tax Agency collected a staggering ¥4.6 billion, which is about $29.7 million, in back taxes from individual cryptocurrency investors. This figure comes from 613 separate tax audits conducted last year. Therefore, this represents a massive 31.4% increase compared to the previous year’s collections. The sheer scale of this enforcement action sends a clear message: the authorities are paying close attention. Moreover, this record haul demonstrates the growing maturity and scrutiny of the cryptocurrency market within the country’s financial ecosystem. How Does Japan Currently Tax Cryptocurrency Profits? Currently, Japan treats profits from cryptocurrency trading and investing as “miscellaneous income.” This classification has significant implications for investors. Here are the key points of the current system: Progressive Tax Rates: Profits are added to your total annual income and taxed at progressive rates. High Top Bracket: The tax rate can soar as high as 55%, including national and local inhabitant taxes. Reporting Burden: Investors must self-declare all crypto gains on their annual tax returns. This system, while lucrative for the tax agency, is often criticized for being overly burdensome and potentially discouraging investment. The high rates apply regardless of whether the gains are short-term trades or long-term investments. Why Is Japan’s Crypto Tax System Poised for Change? The record collection has intensified an ongoing debate. The Japanese government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party are actively pursuing a plan to overhaul the system. Their goal is to move cryptocurrency profits out of the “miscellaneous income” bracket. Instead, they propose a separate taxation category, similar to how stocks are treated. This potential reform aims to create a more favorable environment. A separate, flat tax rate could simplify filing and make Japan a more competitive hub for crypto innovation and investment. This push for change reflects a global trend where nations are balancing the need for tax revenue with the desire to foster technological advancement in the digital asset space. What Are the Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors? Japan’s situation offers crucial lessons for crypto investors everywhere. First, regulatory clarity is advancing rapidly. Tax authorities worldwide are enhancing their tools to track crypto transactions. Consequently, maintaining detailed records of all your trades, purchases, and sales is no longer optional—it’s essential. Second, understanding your local tax obligations is paramount. The rules for crypto taxes Japan are specific, but every country has its own approach. Proactive compliance is always cheaper and less stressful than facing a back-tax bill, penalties, or an audit later. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Regulation Japan’s record $29.7 million tax collection is more than just a headline. It is a watershed moment that underscores the end of the “wild west” era for cryptocurrencies. As the market matures, so does governmental oversight. For Japan, this enforcement surge coincides with a promising move toward a more rational and potentially investor-friendly tax framework. The global crypto community will be watching closely as these reforms develop, offering a potential blueprint for other nations. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How does Japan define “cryptocurrency” for tax purposes? A1: Japan’s tax authorities define cryptocurrency broadly as property values recorded electronically on an electronic device, which can be used to pay unspecified persons. This includes major coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as altcoins and tokens. Q2: Do I have to pay taxes on crypto if I only hold it and don’t sell? A2: Under Japan’s current rules, you generally only incur a tax liability when you realize a profit, such as by selling crypto for yen, trading it for another crypto, or using it to purchase goods or services. Q3: What happens if a crypto investor in Japan doesn’t declare their profits? A3: Failure to declare can result in the NTA conducting an audit, issuing a bill for back taxes owed plus interest, and imposing additional penalties. The recent record collection shows the NTA is actively enforcing these rules. Q4: When might Japan’s proposed separate crypto tax system take effect? A4: While the ruling party is pushing for change, no official implementation date has been set. Tax reforms typically require legislative processes, so any new system would likely be announced well in advance of taking effect. Q5: Are losses on cryptocurrency investments deductible in Japan? A5: Currently, under the miscellaneous income classification, crypto losses cannot be deducted from other types of income (like salary). However, they can be carried forward for three years to offset future crypto profits. Q6: How can crypto investors in Japan ensure they are compliant? A6: Investors should keep meticulous, timestamped records of every transaction, use reputable exchanges that provide transaction histories, and consider consulting with a tax professional in Japan who understands cryptocurrency regulations.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-says-xrp-is-built-for-this-heres-why/,"XRP-focused Market Strategist Levi Rietveld used a recent video of the JPMorgan Chase CEO to emphasize that the financial system is moving toward technologies designed for efficient, high-volume transactions. The developments described by the banking executive align closely with the type of infrastructure XRP was created to support, and he highlighted this connection directly. $XRP is built for this!! pic.twitter.com/cuifMdg7xC — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) December 9, 2025 What the JPMorgan CEO Highlighted In the clip, the JPMorgan CEO discussed the scale at which the bank already operates. He explained that the institution recently moved sixteen trillion dollars in a single day through its compliance, fraud, sanctions, and risk systems. He described these systems as fast and cost-effective, emphasizing that the bank usually relies on technology to improve transaction efficiency for clients. From there, he turned to tokenization and blockchain. He stated that tokenization is real and becoming increasingly effective as the industry finds ways to make it faster and more cost-effective. He acknowledged that both permissioned and non-permissioned designs are now proving useful, and he said smart contracts are likely to become a practical component of future financial infrastructure. He also confirmed that JPMorgan is working on initiatives related to stablecoin. According to him, the bank already has a tokenized deposit model in place, which functions like a digital representation of a deposit.

He explained that if these tools allow the bank to deliver better, faster, and cheaper services, they will be used. How Levi Rietveld Interpreted the Remarks Rietveld framed these comments as evidence that major financial institutions are now openly embracing the type of technology that supports rapid settlement and high-volume processing. He pointed to the executive’s statements on speed, cost efficiency, and tokenized payment systems as a reflection of the direction the industry is taking. In his view, the characteristics described by the CEO align with the technical strengths of XRP . Rietveld emphasized that XRP is designed to handle fast, low-cost transactions and is built with the throughput required for modern settlement systems. By linking the CEO’s statements to XRP’s capabilities, he suggested that XRP fits naturally into the environment these institutions are moving toward, one with solutions that provide speed , efficiency, and scalability.

Key Takeaways: Binance froze only 17% of the stolen Upbit funds despite an urgent request from police and the exchange. Hackers used complex laundering tactics across multiple chains, with most funds eventually reaching Binance service wallets. Korean experts say faster, coordinated freeze mechanisms are needed to limit losses in future attacks. According to investigators, only 17% of the assets flagged for freezing were actually locked down, local news outlets reported on Friday . Security analysts tracking the breach say the hacking group behind the attack used an elaborate laundering strategy on the morning of November 27, quickly scattering the stolen assets across more than a thousand wallets. Binance Froze Only 17% of Upbit Hack Funds The attackers repeatedly broke the funds into smaller portions, moved them through multiple chains, and relied on token bridges and swaps to obscure the trail. Most of the laundered assets eventually landed in service wallets on Binance, authorities said. Upbit and police requested an immediate freeze on roughly 470 million won (about $370,000) worth of Solana confirmed to have hit Binance. However, the exchange froze only 80 million won (about $75,000), saying it needed additional verification before taking broader action. The freeze was confirmed around midnight on the day of the incident, roughly 15 hours after the original request. When questioned by Korean broadcaster KBS about the limited scope of the freeze and the delay, Binance declined to address specifics, citing its policy around active investigations. Upbit got hacked and paused withdrawals, but Koreans are pumping alts since arbitrage bots are no longer running. pic.twitter.com/Y1AnRDqrgz — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) November 27, 2025 The exchange said only that it “continues to cooperate with the relevant authorities and partners in accordance with appropriate procedures.” That explanation has not satisfied experts in South Korea. Cho Jae-woo, director of Hansung University’s Blockchain Research Institute, argued that rapid intervention is essential to minimize losses. “To prevent damage from hacking, a swift initial freeze is essential, but exchanges often cite litigation risks as an excuse for being hesitant,” he said. He added that the industry should consider establishing a global emergency hotline between exchanges or a coordinated body empowered to impose immediate freezes in crisis situations. Investigators say most of the stolen assets have since been converted from Solana to Ethereum, a move likely aimed at improving liquidity given Ethereum’s deep markets. Upbit Moves 99% of Customer Assets to Cold Storage After $30M Hack As reported, Upbit is shifting nearly all customer assets into cold storage after hackers stole 44.5 billion won (about $30 million) from its Solana hot wallet, marking one of the strongest security responses yet by a major exchange. Operator Dunamu said the platform will raise its cold wallet ratio to 99% and reduce hot wallet exposure to effectively zero, far above South Korea’s legal requirement that 80% of user funds be stored offline. The exchange already held 98.33% of assets in cold storage at the end of October, the highest among domestic platforms, but accelerated its overhaul following the breach. Meanwhile, South Korean authorities have launched an investigation, and local reports have cited early intelligence assessments that allegedly connect the intrusion to North Korea’s Lazarus Group.

The upgrade has enabled Venmo-like send, deposit and withdraw cryptocurrency within the World Wallet and virtual accounts. The new World App: secure chat, global payments and Mini Apps for everyone. pic.twitter.com/MzmwB8djjb — World (@worldcoin) December 11, 2025 The new App supports USDC, EURC and wrapped Bitcoin, Ethereum, and additionally supports 100+ cryptocurrency tokens, the Thursday announcement read. World ‘Super App’: End-to-End Encryption, Crypto Integration World formally launched its app in 2023 and said at the time that the mission is to provide tools to verify human identity in an era of AI manipulation. The app upgrade was revealed on Thursday at World’s headquarters in San Francisco, where Altman and World co-founder and CEO Alex Blania briefly spoke about the innovations. Developers termed the new upgrade a “super app” before the product team explained its features. “It’s really hard to identify unique people while preserving privacy,” said Altman, a Mezha report noted . To ensure conversation privacy, the chat messages display blue bubbles for “verified humans” and gray bubbles for those who haven’t verified. Further, profile photos are checked against the Orb image stored on the user’s device. World App Updates With Virtual Bank Accounts and Expanded Crypto Features In May, World launched its iris-scanning project to US customers . The process involves users scanning their face and iris in about 30 seconds, creating a unique “IrisCode” to verify their identity. Besides, the World already functions as a digital wallet; however, the new version introduces virtual bank accounts. “Users can receive their salary directly in the World App, make deposits from bank accounts, after which funds can be converted into cryptocurrency,” the report added. Besides swap and trade across more than 100 supported assets, World Chain native tokens and a RWA assets like tokenized gold are also available, the company said in the statement. The new version of the app underscores the firm’s intention to expand partnerships and build a more integrated ecosystem focused on the ease of crypto usage.

XRP Transaction Fee Has Dropped To 650 Tokens Per Day In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed the latest trend in the Total Transaction Fees indicator for XRP. This metric measures, as its name suggests, the amount of fees that senders on the XRP network attach to their transactions every day. On blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the transaction fee goes to the network validator who added the associated move to the next block. In the case of BTC, the network runs on a consensus mechanism called the proof-of-work (PoW) , with validators called miners competing against each other using computational resources to get the chance to add the next block to the chain. While for ETH, validators known as stakers handle consensus by locking in an ETH amount known as the “stake.” This mechanism is known as the proof-of-stake (PoS) . XRP takes an approach that differs from both digital asset giants. In the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol, network validators maintain a list of other validators that they trust. Validators propose and vote on transactions, with consensus being reached when more than 80% of trusted nodes agree on the validity of the transactions. The key difference is that in this system, there are no block/staking rewards, and validators aren’t compensated with transaction fees, either. Instead, the fee that users pay is destroyed. This means that every time a transaction occurs, a tiny part of the asset’s supply exits from circulation. While the destination of the transaction fees is different for XRP when compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, the network dynamics can still be similar. In other words, high traffic can push the Total Transaction Fees metric up, while low activity periods can lead to a drop in it. Now, here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the 90-day simple moving average (SMA) of the XRP Total Transaction Fees over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP Total Transaction Fees witnessed a surge to an extreme level in early 2025. Users were paying 5,900 tokens per day as transfer fees at the peak of this explosion in February. Since then, however, the blockchain has witnessed a rapid decline in the indicator. Today, the network is witnessing just 650 tokens per day in fees, reflecting a decrease of about 89% from the February high. The 90-day SMA Total Transaction Fees haven’t been this low for the asset since December 2020. XRP Price XRP has gone downhill during the last couple of days as its price has returned to the $2.00 level.",XRP|XRP Activity|XRP Fees|XRP Transaction Fees|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-12 07:00:49

His latest update ties together gold’s renewed monetary role, the weakening of traditional debt-based assets, and the growing importance of compliant digital assets such as XRP . The video shared includes commentary from a former BlackRock portfolio manager, explaining how these developments are shaping a new global financial structure. Former BlackRock portfolio manager says gold is money. I couldn't agree more. We’re moving toward a hybrid collateral model with gold as neutral collateral and XRP as the neutral settlement layer moving value across borders. Watch how it’s being done: https://t.co/hFnfkQxJxt pic.twitter.com/YfpXg8hMHu — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) December 10, 2025 Gold Reclaims a Central Role in Global Finance The update begins with the former BlackRock portfolio manager explaining that gold has effectively become money again after being restored as a tier-one asset under Basel III standards. He notes that this shift is now reflected in U.S. banks and has been underway globally for years. His view is that the world is nearing the end of a long economic cycle, and major institutions are preparing for the eventual transition to a new monetary system. Aljarrah builds on this by pointing out that gold crossing $4,000 is not a short-term event but part of a broader structural change. He highlights that banks now hold more gold than U.S. Treasuries, which signals a significant move away from paper-based debt instruments. He also notes that the U.S. dollar has already lost over 8% of its purchasing power this year, calling it a clear sign of ongoing erosion. According to Aljarrah, the bond market—once the foundation of global stability—is now under serious strain, and this is why regulators have repositioned gold as a zero-risk, tier-one asset. He argues that gold is being reintroduced into the monetary system as collateral rather than simply an investment. How Gold and Digital Assets Converge The core of Aljarrah’s message is that the world is shifting toward a hybrid financial model in which physical assets, such as gold, form the collateral base, as compliant digital assets provide the infrastructure for global settlement. He notes that institutions such as the World Gold Council, IMF, BIS, and World Bank have all acknowledged the same direction: a system where tokenized assets , stablecoins, and central bank reserves operate within an interoperable digital framework. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Aljarrah identifies XRP as the digital asset best positioned for this role. He describes XRP as the institutional layer of the new system, supporting fast and efficient cross-border settlement and enabling liquidity without the need for pre-funded accounts. He explains that RippleNet provides the infrastructure, while XRP acts as the settlement mechanism that moves value across borders. He also places XLM as the retail layer, designed for accessibility and global inclusion, and SHX as the infrastructure layer linking digital finance with regulated fiat on-ramps. Together, he says, they form a three-part structure capable of supporting a fully integrated financial ecosystem. Where the Transition Is Heading Aljarrah concludes that gold’s rise toward $5,000 is part of a long-term trend driven by structural pressures, not speculation. He maintains that the ongoing shift reflects a financial system that is moving back toward tangible value while adopting digital rails for global settlement. In this framework, gold serves as neutral collateral, and compliant digital assets provide the speed and interoperability needed for modern finance.

That’s the surprising reality on the Solana blockchain today. However, a revolutionary proposal aims to change everything. Anza, a core development firm for Solana, has put forward a plan to drastically reduce Solana account creation fees by a staggering 90%. This move could unlock a wave of dormant SOL and fundamentally improve network accessibility for everyone. What’s the Big Deal About Solana Account Creation Fees? To understand the impact, you first need to know how Solana works. Every program, token, or NFT on the network requires a dedicated data storage space called an “account.” Creating this account isn’t free; it costs a small fee in SOL. While these Solana account creation fees are designed to prevent spam and secure the network, they’ve created an unintended consequence. Brennan Watt, Vice President of Core Engineering at Anza, identified a critical issue. He proposed SIMD-0389, which suggests cutting the current fee from 0.0015 SOL to just 0.00015 SOL. Why such a drastic cut? The answer lies in dormant assets. How Can Lower Fees Unlock Dormant SOL? Here’s the clever part of the proposal. Many users have tiny amounts of SOL trapped in old or unused accounts. The current fee to create a new account and recover or move these funds is often higher than the value of the SOL itself. Therefore, it’s not worth the cost to reclaim them. This leaves SOL effectively lost forever. By slashing the Solana account creation fees by 10x, the economic barrier disappears. Suddenly, it becomes viable to: Recover lost or forgotten SOL from old wallets and accounts. Consolidate tiny balances into a single, usable amount. Encourage more experimentation with new dApps and tokens without a high upfront cost. Watt argues this change would enable the recovery of dormant SOL without compromising the network’s security—a true win-win scenario. What Are the Broader Benefits for the Solana Ecosystem? This proposal is about more than just cleaning up digital couch cushions. A significant reduction in Solana account creation fees has profound implications for the entire ecosystem’s health and growth. First, it dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for new users and developers. Building on Solana becomes cheaper and less risky. Second, it improves capital efficiency by bringing “dead” SOL back into circulation, increasing liquidity. Finally, it demonstrates responsive governance, where core developers listen to community pain points and propose practical, data-driven solutions. What’s Next for the Fee Reduction Proposal? The proposal, SIMD-0389, is now in the hands of the Solana community. Key stakeholders, including validators and major dApp developers, will review and debate it. The process highlights the decentralized nature of blockchain governance. If adopted, the change would be implemented in a future network upgrade, potentially unlocking value for countless users. This move could set a precedent for other blockchains struggling with similar issues of accessibility and dormant assets. It shows that sustainable growth often comes from fine-tuning economic parameters, not just chasing raw performance. Conclusion: A Small Fee Change with a Massive Impact Anza’s proposal to cut Solana account creation fees is a masterclass in pragmatic blockchain engineering. It addresses a real user problem, unlocks tangible economic value, and strengthens the network’s foundation—all with a single, well-calibrated adjustment. This isn’t just about saving a few cents; it’s about making the Solana ecosystem more inclusive, efficient, and resilient for its next chapter of growth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Anza’s role in the Solana ecosystem? A1: Anza is a key development and maintenance firm spun out from Solana Labs. It focuses on core engineering, client development (like the Agave validator client), and proposing improvements to the network’s protocol and economics. Q2: What is SIMD-0389? A2: SIMD-0389 is the formal proposal number for the suggested 10x reduction in the Solana account rent-exempt minimum fee. SIMD stands for Solana Improvement Document, which is the standard process for suggesting changes to the network. Q3: Will lowering fees make Solana less secure? A3: According to the proposal’s author, Brennan Watt, the reduction is carefully calculated to still deter spam and malicious account creation while removing the economic barrier for legitimate users. The core security model remains intact. Q4: How much dormant SOL could this unlock? A4: While an exact figure is hard to pinpoint, estimates suggest billions of dollars worth of SOL could be trapped in uneconomical accounts. This change would make recovering those funds feasible. Q5: When will this change happen? A5: There is no set timeline. The proposal must go through community discussion, technical review, and ultimately be voted on and adopted by network validators before being included in a scheduled upgrade. Q6: Do I need to do anything to recover my dormant SOL? A6: If the proposal passes, you would need to use a compatible wallet or tool that allows you to interact with the old account and pay the new, lower fee to create the necessary accounts to move your funds.

However, apart from a few cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, the crypto market, as a dollar-denominated offshore equity-like market, struggles to compete with precious metals and stock indices due to investors' limited risk appetite. Therefore, further reducing its allocation may be a better option. A Not-So-Dovish Decision Yesterday, the Federal Reserve announced the outcome of its final FOMC meeting of the year. Although officials delivered a rate cut for the third consecutive meeting, there is unusual discord within the ranks regarding whether inflation or the labour market poses the greater concern. Consequently, officials have signalled little appetite for further easing. Public comments from Fed officials in recent weeks reveal a committee so deeply divided that the final decision may well hinge on how Chair Powell chooses to steer the ship. With Powell's tenure set to expire next May, he will preside over only three more FOMC meetings. Sticky price pressures coupled with a cooling labour market present the Fed with an invidious trade-off—a dilemma not encountered in decades. During the ""stagflation"" era of the 1970s, when faced with a similar predicament, the Fed's ""stop-start"" response allowed high inflation to become entrenched. Against this backdrop, several Fed actions warrant close attention: firstly, the removal of the aggregate cap on the Standing Repo Facility (SRF); and secondly, the purchase of Treasury bills (T-bills)—and, if necessary, other US Treasuries with a remaining maturity of up to three years—to maintain ample reserves. The Fed's objective is crystal clear: it is not to provide premium liquidity for equity and crypto markets but to stabilise short-term liquidity levels within the banking system and alleviate market shortages. The projected purchase of $40 billion in T-bills this month, combined with the relaxation of the SRF, objectively helps to steady equity markets, yet is unlikely to fuel a broad-market rally comparable to that of 2021. Powell also emphasised that current T-bill purchases are solely for ""reserve management,"" implying the primary aim of the Fed's balance sheet expansion is to maintain stability, not to unleash further liquidity to stimulate the economy and asset prices. What is the Smart Money Thinking? In the rates market, traders are pricing in more conservative expectations than they were before the FOMC meeting. Markets now anticipate only two cuts in 2026, of 25bps each, with no further easing expected until January 2028, leaving the terminal rate hovering around 3.4%. Bond market pricing is even more explicit: since late October, only yields on Treasuries with maturities under three years have fallen, whilst the 10-year yield remains stubbornly above 4.1%, and T-bond yields have actually risen significantly. This implies that long-term financing costs remain elevated, and riskier markets and assets will continue to face a liquidity drought for the foreseeable future. Source: CME Group Source: ustreasuryyieldcurve.com In the crypto options market, traders' long-term bearish stance on BTC ( BTC-USD ) and ETH ( ETH-USD ) has not shifted; if anything, it has entrenched. Bullish sentiment is confined to short-term speculation in 0DTE options. Notably, the previously persistent far-month bullishness for ETH has evaporated, with sentiment shifting into ""neutral-to-bearish"" territory. This suggests that traders view ETH's short-term rebounds not as a reflection of improving fundamentals, but rather as a product of speculative flows. Given that ETH's implied forward yield sits at just 3.51%—compared to roughly 4.85% for BTC—current valuations do not represent a ""reasonable investment proposition"" for institutions, whilst BTC is viewed, at best, as a ""hold"". Source: Amberdata Derivatives So, What is the Trade? For the crypto market, the Fed's stance is hardly welcome news. In the current environment, sustained, large-scale rallies rely more on a deluge of long-term liquidity than on short-term relief measures. Meanwhile, elevated long-term rates will keep long-term investors cautious and on the sidelines, leaving price action to be dictated primarily by short-term speculators. Short-term rebounds and long-term bearish expectations will coexist. For assets where traditional institutional pricing power is dominant (BTC, XRP ( XRP-USD ), SOL ( SOL-USD )), long-term bearish expectations will continue to weigh on prices. However, for assets where institutional influence is weaker (such as ETH and altcoins), leverage-induced short-term rallies will drive price movements. Therefore, incorporating far-month put protection for crypto assets remains a prudent strategy. However, the cost of hedging warrants reconsideration. Yields from the crypto carry trade can no longer cover the cash flow requirements for put protection. Consequently, holding assets that are still in a robust uptrend (e.g., the ""Mag 7"") and using their gains to fund ""insurance premiums"" appears to be a sound approach. The beta of the Mag 7 is typically lower than that of BTC and ETH, meaning that when equities rise, their gains can offset option premiums. Conversely, if markets fall, the higher sensitivity of crypto assets means that far-month puts will generate superior returns. Of course, reducing exposure to crypto risk is also essential. With BTC's implied forward yield now virtually indistinguishable from T-bond yields, holding crypto assets per se offers little comparative advantage. If one must maintain long exposure, consider the following structures: Risk Reversal : Use a portion of previous profits to enter a risk reversal structure expiring in 30-60 days (i.e., sell a put and buy a call with the closest absolute delta), whilst retaining ample cash. Roll Over : Once the price rises significantly and appropriate gains are secured (at the investor's discretion), roll the position over. Capture the Skew : If price movement is muted, investors can still profit from the spread between the two options near expiry due to the significant negative skew before rolling over. Buy the Dip : If prices fall significantly, use the cash collateral to accumulate the underlying asset at lower levels. The implied forward yield of ETH has not been as good as that of T-bills. (Source: Amberdata Derivatives) Furthermore, considering the risk of USD depreciation, holding Euros as a cash reserve is a proper alternative. With the Fed still in a cutting cycle, the Euro's long-term outlook remains constructive. Simultaneously, as European inflation shows signs of a slight rebound, the ECB is likely to lean towards holding rates steady, whilst the Bank of Japan may intervene to sell USD to combat a weak Yen and inflation. This significantly increases the probability of the Euro appreciating in the near term. In summary, the rate cut has not fundamentally altered the crypto landscape. Any sharp rally lacking fundamental support should be viewed as a risk rather than an opportunity. Closely monitoring leverage indicators, such as open interest, and tightening risk parameters may be the optimal strategy for navigating this uncertain festive season. Adopting a defensive posture is also advisable. After all, in this market, ""survival"" takes precedence over betting on a ""Santa rally"".

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now on the radar of traders as a potentially spectacular player having already proved high early token appreciation and just behind the curtain of Phase 6. What Investors Are Watching Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum finance is developing a decentralized loaning protocol that has two interlocked markets. The Peer to Contract market is a market in which users provide their assets lent out in the form of either ETH or USDT and get issued with mtTokens. Repayment of interest by borrowers leads to an increment of these mtTokens. Peer to Peer market provides direct access to borrowers. The rates of borrowing vary with liquidity. Borrowing remains affordable when there is a high level of liquidity. Increased rates arise when the liquidity becomes weak. Loan to value regulations provide threshold limits of collateral security. Liquidation can take place in case of a large decline of collateral. Partial payment of debt is made by the liquidators who obtain discounted collateral. This is used to safeguard the system in a fast moving market. Price Performance and Lifting Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launched in early 2025 at a price of $0.01. The token currently has a price of $0.035, which is 250% token appreciation. The project has gathered $19.250M in the form of funds, which grew to 18,500 holders and sold 815M MUTM. The total supply is 4B, out of which 1.82B records are corresponding to 45.5% of the presale stages. Phase 6 already has above 96% allocated with 4% of the tokens remaining at the present price prior to the Phase 7 rise. The next crypto phase will increase the price of the token by close to 20%. Phase 1 purchasers are positioned for 500% MUTM appreciation on listing given the official launch valuation at $0.06. Everyday activity is also very high with a 24 hour leaderboard where the best contributor wins $500 in MUTM. This constant inflow of involvement makes this project observable and appeals to users who track trends of buying now in the cryptocurrency activities. V1 Testnet Mutuum Finance had confirmed in its official X account that V1 testnet would be operational in Q4 2025. V1 consists of the lending pool, mtTokens, liquidation and the debt engine. The initial supported assets will be Eth and USDT. This will be a point at which the development ends and live testing starts; this will also be the point at which the need is likely to go up as the users start to interact with the lending system. Security preparation is significant in the traction of the project. The CertiK audit of Mutuum Finance has a 90/100 score on the Token Scan. Halborn Security is considering contract behavior in various conditions of liquidity as well as collateral. There is a $50K bug bounty on third-party testing to identify code edge cases until V1. Due to this auditing depth and indications of a pre-emerging trend, some analysts assessing crypto predictions believe Mutuum Finance could be left with the basis of an excellent growth when borrowing commences. It has been estimated that the token might end up between 5x to 7x in case it is adopted as per expectations over the initial entire activity cycle of the token. Long-Term Upside Potential Mutuum Finance focuses on producing a USD-pegged stablecoin that uses the interest of borrowers according to the official roadmap. Stablecoins are beneficial in the lending market since they minimise volatility and the number of people who can take up loans. They also can enhance the liquidity that can enhance the mtToken yield system-wide. The project also intends to increase over layer-2 networks. L2 implementation reduces the costs and enhances processing speed. The lending policies should be updated rapidly on the collateral terms and liquidation instruments. Mutuum Finance has a competitive edge in the imminent scaling with wider integration in DeFi. The industry analysts who model the long-term performance are of the view that these upgrades could make a difference of an 8x to 10x MUTM growth by 2027 in case users activity increases with the adoption of stablecoins and expansion of lending volume. The project is in one of the critical stages. The window of early entry is narrowing with 4% of the tokens still at the current levels of $0.035. Mutuum Finance is capable of card payment which means onboarding is easy with new users. As V1 approaches, the growing popularity of the project, increased attention to the development and the review of the security, the project is taking leading positions in the list of the potential best crypto coins to buy in the next cycle. At the current rate, Mutuum Finance might not last beneath $0.04 pretty soon, with Phase 7 and the $0.06 launch price in proximity.

At the Solana Breakpoint global conference, the team announced plans to bring XRP to Solana through Hex Trust and LayerZero. These partners will bridge and issue Wrapped XRP (wXRP), unlocking deep liquidity and expanding XRP’s role in decentralized finance. Integration with Solana promises faster transactions, lower costs, and access to a thriving DeFi ecosystem, creating new opportunities for investors and developers alike. Solana’s integration of XRP highlights a key trend in crypto: pairing established digital assets with high-performance blockchains to boost liquidity and utility. As a trusted settlement and bridge currency, XRP’s move to Solana could accelerate adoption across DeFi, including lending, staking, and decentralized trading. This major update follows Solana’s playful engagement with the XRP community earlier in the week, from a Monday post featuring the beloved “589” to nods at the iconic “flipping the switch” meme. These cultural touches underscore Solana’s strategy of merging technical innovation with community excitement. Beyond fun interactions, the collaboration signals a powerful convergence of two established networks: XRP’s proven reliability and deep liquidity combined with Solana’s high throughput and scalability. Analysts note that this synergy could boost transaction efficiency, unlock new DeFi opportunities, and draw both institutional and retail participants to the combined ecosystem. As wXRP launches on Solana, it will be important to track liquidity and DeFi adoption closely. By bringing XRP into Solana’s high-speed ecosystem, this cross-chain collaboration could redefine how digital assets move, settle, and interact across blockchains. Conclusion XRP landing on Solana is a watershed for cross-chain DeFi. Deploying wXRP on Solana marks a pivotal step in blockchain interoperability. By combining XRP’s long-standing liquidity and reliability with Solana’s low-latency, high-throughput architecture, this move unlocks new cross-chain utility, expands DeFi possibilities, and promises materially improved transaction efficiency, creating fertile ground for developers, investors, and the broader crypto ecosystem.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|SOL|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-12 07:31:44

This finalized deal, first announced in August, is far more than a simple purchase. It represents a strategic masterstroke, granting Ripple direct control over a network that processes a staggering 10% of all global B2B stablecoin payments. For anyone tracking the evolution of institutional crypto, this Ripple acquisition is a watershed moment. Why is the Ripple Acquisition of Rail Such a Big Deal? To understand the impact, you must look at what Rail brings to the table. The startup isn’t just another fintech player; it’s a critical piece of infrastructure. By specializing in B2B stablecoin payments, Rail provides the reliable, compliant rails that large companies need to move value. Therefore, this Ripple acquisition instantly plugs Ripple into a massive, existing flow of enterprise capital. It’s a classic case of buying market share and expertise, not just technology. Building an Empire: Ripple’s 2024 Acquisition Spree This is not an isolated event. The Rail deal is the latest in a series of strategic purchases by Ripple this year, each carefully chosen to build a comprehensive financial ecosystem. Let’s break down their acquisition strategy: Hidden Road (now Ripple Prime): Acquired to offer prime brokerage services, catering to institutional traders and funds. GTreasury: A corporate finance SaaS provider, bringing deep treasury management and risk tools into Ripple’s fold. Palisade: A crypto wallet and custody firm, securing the vital ‘last mile’ of asset storage for clients. When you connect these dots, a clear picture emerges. Ripple is systematically assembling a full-stack, institutional-grade platform for digital asset management and cross-border payments. The Ripple acquisition of Rail is the keystone, providing the high-volume payment network that makes the entire ecosystem viable. What Does This Mean for the Future of Enterprise Crypto? The implications are profound. For businesses, Ripple is now positioned to offer a one-stop-shop: from treasury management with GTreasury, to secure custody with Palisade, to prime brokerage services, all connected by Rail’s efficient B2B payment network and settled on Ripple’s ledger. This level of integration promises to reduce friction, cost, and complexity for corporations exploring digital assets. However, challenges remain. Regulatory clarity, especially in the U.S., continues to be a headwind for Ripple. Furthermore, integrating multiple acquired companies into a seamless culture and product suite is a monumental operational task. The success of this Ripple acquisition strategy hinges on execution. Conclusion: A Calculated Leap Towards Dominance Ripple’s finalized purchase of Rail is a powerful statement of intent. It moves the company beyond its origins as a cross-border payment protocol for banks and into the heart of global corporate finance. By acquiring Rail, Ripple doesn’t just add a service; it captures a significant portion of the existing stablecoin payment market. This strategic masterstroke, combined with its other 2024 acquisitions, positions Ripple as perhaps the most vertically integrated player serving institutional crypto needs. The race to build the foundational plumbing for the future of finance is intensifying, and Ripple has just laid down a formidable piece of track. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly did Ripple acquire in the Rail deal? A1: Ripple acquired Rail, a stablecoin startup that specializes in processing business-to-business (B2B) payments. Notably, Rail’s network handles about 10% of all global B2B stablecoin payment volume. Q2: How much did Ripple pay for Rail? A2: The acquisition was finalized for $200 million. The deal was first announced in August and has now been officially closed. Q3: Why is this acquisition important for Ripple’s business? A3: This acquisition gives Ripple direct access to a massive, existing stream of enterprise payments. It is a key piece in Ripple’s strategy to build a comprehensive platform for institutional crypto services, complementing its other recent acquisitions in custody, treasury management, and prime brokerage. Q4: What other companies has Ripple acquired recently? A4: In 2024, prior to Rail, Ripple acquired prime brokerage firm Hidden Road (renamed Ripple Prime), corporate finance SaaS provider GTreasury, and crypto custody firm Palisade. Q5: How does this affect XRP, Ripple’s native cryptocurrency? A5> While the acquisition focuses on stablecoin payments, a more robust and widely adopted Ripple enterprise network could increase overall utility and demand for its underlying infrastructure, potentially benefiting XRP’s long-term ecosystem value.

The CFTC opened the door for BTC, ETH, and USDC to serve as regulated collateral in derivatives markets. DTCC secured SEC approval to tokenize U.S. securities with full shareholder rights. Major financial institutions began introducing more specialized Bitcoin-linked products. The CFTC’s new pilot program allows select firms to use BTC ( BTC-USD ), ETH ( ETH-USD ), and USDC ( USDC-USD ) as regulated collateral in U.S. derivatives markets, a shift that is expected to create a new steady source of demand for BTC and ETH. The core financial infrastructure provider DTCC has received SEC approval to launch a tokenization service that will allow U.S. securities to be issued on approved blockchains with full legal rights and protections. Traditional finance firms are beginning to roll out more specialized Bitcoin-linked products, such as JPMorgan’s structured IBIT note and the proposed AfterDark ETF. CFTC Opens Door to Digital Asset Collateral in Derivatives Markets The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has launched a pilot program that, for the first time, allows bitcoin, ether, and certain stablecoins such as USDC to be posted as collateral in U.S. derivatives markets. The pilot is limited to futures commission merchants that meet specific eligibility standards. Participating firms may accept approved digital assets as margin for futures and swaps but must adhere to heightened operational requirements. For the first three months, weekly disclosures on digital asset holdings are mandatory, along with immediate notification to the CFTC if any custody or risk issues arise. In practice, this could mean a registered firm accepting bitcoin as collateral for a leveraged swap tied to commodities, while the CFTC monitors the operational risks and custody arrangements behind the scenes. Key Take In derivative markets, trading firms and institutions need to post collateral to back their positions in futures, swaps, or other derivative instruments. They normally maintain sizable reserves of assets that regulators deem safe and liquid enough to serve as collateral, typically U.S. Treasuries or cash-like instruments. Bitcoin can now be accepted as a margin for futures and swaps. This creates direct incentives for institutions, including hedge funds, market makers, and FCMs, to maintain meaningful BTC balances. They will need readily accessible Bitcoin reserves to maintain trading flexibility, like meeting margin calls and managing intraday exposure. As institutions begin using bitcoin as collateral, this could create a new source of steady demand, reduce available float in spot markets, and further entrench bitcoin’s position as a mainstream, regulated financial instrument rather than a purely trading asset. DTCC Receives SEC Approval to Tokenize U.S. Securities The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the core post-trade infrastructure behind U.S. securities markets, has received a No-Action Letter from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The No-Action Letter authorizes the company to launch a controlled production-level tokenization service beginning in the second half of 2026. The approval allows DTC, a subsidiary of DTCC, to create tokenized versions of assets it already custodies, including securities in the Russell 1000, major index-tracking ETFs, and U.S. Treasuries, on pre-approved blockchains over a three-year period. These digital representations will carry the same legal rights, investor protections, and ownership entitlements as their traditional counterparts, while operating within DTCC’s established standards for safety and resilience. This is the first time the SEC has permitted a systemically important market structure company to tokenize core U.S. securities in a live environment. DTCC positions the initiative as a foundation for improving collateral mobility, enabling around-the-clock access, and supporting programmable asset workflows. Key Take DTCC is the central post-trade infrastructure for U.S. securities markets, responsible for clearing, settlement, and custody for the majority of equities and bonds traded in the United States. It is one of the most systemically important financial institutions in global markets. Under today’s broker-mediated system, DTCC holds securities in centralized custody while shareholder rights, such as voting and corporate action participation, flow through brokers to investors; DTCC’s role ensures the integrity of ownership records and the proper transmission of these rights across the market infrastructure. Most tokenized stocks today offer only price exposure and do not grant shareholder rights, but DTCC’s new tokenization framework is designed to issue digital representations that carry the full entitlements, investor protections, and ownership rights of traditional securities. New Bitcoin-Linked Financial Products Emerge In recent weeks, several traditional finance firms have introduced new Bitcoin-linked products, signaling that interest is now moving beyond straightforward spot ETFs. JPMorgan has filed to issue a structured note tied to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ). The product outlines several predefined payout scenarios: investors receive a fixed return if the ETF reaches a target price by 2026, while a separate payoff structure offers upside participation through 2028 with partial downside protection. Separately, the Nicholas Bitcoin and Treasuries AfterDark ETF has been submitted for SEC review. The fund proposes a time-based allocation model: during daytime trading hours, it would hold U.S. Treasuries, shifting into Bitcoin exposure overnight. The structure aims to capture periods when Bitcoin historically shows higher volatility outside of U.S. market hours. These products show how traditional institutions are experimenting with different ways to package Bitcoin exposure, using structured payoffs and time-based allocation models to appeal to a wider range of investor preferences. Key Take For most investors, a straightforward spot ETF is sufficient to gain Bitcoin exposure. However, this does not meet the needs of many sophisticated market participants. The structured note market in the US has developed very rapidly in recent years, driven by investor demand for customized risk-reward profiles. These products can be designed to match specific market views, offering flexibility and risk mitigation strategies that align with sophisticated investment goals. The JPMorgan's IBIT-linked note is designed for investors who want exposure to Bitcoin’s upside but require guardrails around volatility and drawdowns. It delivers a structured, asymmetric payoff: modest guaranteed return in the near term, leveraged upside long term, and a defined drawdown risk in 2028. Bitcoin trades 24/7, but its performance is not uniform throughout the day; in this cycle, and one notable phenomenon is that most of the gains have occurred outside the U.S. market hours. The AfterDark ETF is designed for investors who want exposure specifically during the periods when Bitcoin has historically shown the most movement, rather than holding the asset around the clock. Weekly Market Chart: Hyperliquid Dominates Blockchain Fee Capture According to data from The Block, Hyperliquid now captures roughly 50% of all blockchain fees, a steep climb from about 10% at the beginning of the year. This growth has come largely at the expense of Ethereum and Solana. Together, those two networks now represent only about 20% of the total fee share, down from more than half at the start of 2025. As we mentioned in our recent article, Whale’s Digital Asset View: Top Two at a Crossroad , emerging top decentralized applications this cycle, including Hyperliquid for perps and Polymarket in prediction markets, are not built on Ethereum. While Ethereum is a more decentralized network, and that is more attractive for large capital store assets for safety reasons, its high TVL does not directly lead to more economic activity or fee generation, challenging the value accrual thesis for ETH as an asset.

In a recent post on X, the official Solana account revealed that XRP is coming to the Solana network. Interest in cross-chain assets continues to rise as developers seek scalable pathways for value movement. The launch of wXRP, the wrapped version of XRP, positions the asset for wider activity in DeFi and exposes it to a new community of potential users. BREAKING: XRP is coming to Solana pic.twitter.com/LabnKkLs71 — Solana (@solana) December 12, 2025 Launch Details Hex Trust will issue and custody wXRP, which matches XRP at a 1:1 ratio. The company stated that each unit is “1:1-backed” with native XRP held in segregated custody accounts. It will mint and redeem the asset through authorized merchants in a controlled environment. Hex Trust noted that users gain access to opportunities in DeFi while keeping redemption rights for native XRP. Hex Trust revealed that the launch has more than $100 million in Total Value Locked to support liquidity. This level of locked value aims to promote stable pricing across markets where wXRP trades. Hex Trust highlighted that the tokens remain redeemable for XRP held in its regulated custody, which provides auditability and insurance coverage. Will This Help XRP Grow? The introduction of wXRP can affect XRP’s market structure because every wrapped token requires native XRP to remain locked in custody. This process will reduce XRP’s rapidly shrinking circulating supply and can tighten liquidity during periods of active demand. While this does not guarantee price appreciation, supply conditions often influence how assets respond to market interest. The expansion of XRP’s utility across Solana and other supported chains may also attract new users who want a regulated way to participate in DeFi. Increased activity can boost transaction volumes on the XRP Ledger. Ripple executives have praised Solana , and this integration strengthens XRP’s role in cross-chain value transfer. These factors can support healthier market conditions for XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Outlook The development expands XRP’s utility into sectors that focus on speed, volume, and capital efficiency. Utility can influence market interest and price movements, and exposure to the Solana network supercharges XRP’s utility . DeFi participation may also create new demand for XRP as users shift assets across chains for swaps or liquidity opportunities. Solana benefits as well. Additional liquidity and asset diversity can support growth in activity across DeFi platforms. WXRP expands activity for both ecosystems and creates new routes for liquidity movement. The development signals a further step toward a more unified cross-chain utility for XRP. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The framework is expected to amend key laws related to digital financial assets and the securities market, while potentially prohibiting new digital asset purchases for most investors. New Crypto Framework Could Ban New Purchases On Thursday, Vladimir Chistyukhin told Russian news media outlet RIA Novosti that the Central Bank of Russia, the Ministry of Finance, Rosfinmonitoring, and other federal agencies have been discussing proposals to regulate the crypto market. The executive affirmed that the new framework will provide rules on how and through whom crypto transactions will be carried out. He detailed that these will likely be executed only by existing market participants under existing licenses. As reported by Bitcoinist, CBR’s First Deputy Chairman previously announced that local banks would be allowed to engage in limited crypto operations under strict regulatory conditions. Nonetheless, the executive has noted that they will need to consider whether exchanges should be included in a separate category that enables them to be eligible for a new license. In the case of investors, he informed that they are stepping away from their initial Experimental Legal Regime (EPR), introduced at the start of the year. The EPR proposed allowing only “highly qualified investors” to transact directly with digital assets. Currently, cryptocurrencies are used not only as an investment but also as a means of cross-border payments. This is a very important point that cannot be ignored. Of course, we want to protect Russian retail investors as much as possible from transactions with such a risky asset. On the other hand, we understand that in the current circumstances, in some cases, international payments can only be made using cryptocurrencies. Therefore, the discussion continues. Now, they are looking to allow qualified investors into the market after passing certain tests, although discussions are not final. There are only about one million qualified investors in Russia, Chistyukhin added, which could place millions of retail investors in the country in a “gray” zone. Unqualified investors who already acquired cryptocurrencies “will be able to either keep them, sell them, or exchange them for some fiat currency or other assets. There are no restrictions on exiting crypto assets – neither in terms of time nor volume. Only new purchase transactions will be restricted,” he stated. Russia To Adopt Regulations ‘As Quickly As Possible’ Chistyukhin affirmed that the Russian financial market has “all the necessary infrastructure to work with cryptocurrencies.” Although it will be “essential to amend the laws on digital financial assets, the securities market, and banking legislation.” Chistyukhin explained that the authorities believe it is “fundamentally important” to legitimize the crypto sector and ensure that it is compliant with the law. To achieve this, regulators are considering establishing strict restrictions and prohibitions. “Anything that falls outside this framework will be considered illegal activity.” Discussing why the financial authorities decided not to experiment with and test crypto rules, he noted that the country needs to adopt regulations quickly due to “international attention” and “scrutiny.” The issue of cryptocurrency regulation is attracting serious international attention, primarily from the FATF. (…) We need to adopt regulations as quickly as possible. (…) We simply do not have the time to experiment first and then spend several years analyzing it and launching something permanent. Therefore, the executive revealed that the legislation could be passed during the spring of 2026 and be enacted before the end of next year. However, Russian watchdogs are preparing transitional periods to give market participants time to move out of the regulatory “gray” zone and into the new legal framework. Liability for illegal operations is expected to come into effect in mid-2027.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Centra Bank of Russia|Crypto legislation|Crypto Market|crypto regulation|Russia crypto exchange|Russia Crypto legislation|Russian authorities|Russian crypto law,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-12 08:00:12

His comments emphasize the importance of RLUSD distribution, the involvement of prime brokers, and the increasing presence of major financial institutions in Ripple’s ecosystem. He presents these developments as signs that Ripple is moving into a more advanced phase, where large, established players become central to its progress rather than retail participation. RIPPLE IS GOING FULL INSTITUTIONAL RLUSD distribution + Prime brokers + Wall Street liquidity = A whole new era for crypto Big players don’t dance alone… they bring partners. $XRP is entering the big league https://t.co/TcWCcnrANJ pic.twitter.com/mRk9RLJ0OC — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) December 10, 2025 The Industry Transition In the video attached to the tweet, Christopher Perkin, president of CoinFund, explains that the broader crypto industry is going through a similar transition. He states that the market is shifting from a retail-driven environment toward one that is shaped by institutions. According to him, this transition includes RLUSD being distributed through prime brokers, reflecting practices that are already standard in traditional finance. Perkin stresses that institutional growth requires reliable partners who can supply liquidity, operational support, and large-scale participation. He says that major institutions are needed to help accelerate this move into the institutional space. He adds that RLUSD is positioned to become widely used and that many participants may adopt it sooner than expected. He also notes that Ripple Prime will play a key role by giving institutions a professional-grade execution and settlement channel. Throughout his remarks, Perkin outlines a vision centered on structure and readiness. He describes a business model that aims to support institutions at scale and believes the pieces are being assembled to meet that goal. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 How This Connects to XRP’s Position Xaif Crypto links these developments directly to XRP . He argues that as RLUSD distribution grows, with more prime brokerage involvement and stronger liquidity connections, XRP is entering what he calls a more competitive and institutionally focused environment. His view is that these elements create the foundation required for the asset to operate in larger financial settings where stability and efficiency matter most. He frames this shift as a combination of multiple ongoing steps rather than a single announcement. By pointing to the adoption of RLUSD, the importance of liquidity partners, and the role of Ripple Prime, he suggests that the overall direction is clear: Ripple is building an ecosystem designed for institutional use. Overall, the tweet and accompanying video present Ripple’s current direction as part of a broader industry movement.

Scaramucci’s Solana Prediction Not in the Twitter-war, zero-sum, “ETH is dead” kind of way. More like: same league, different growth curve, and Solana ends up with the bigger market cap. “I think it will flip Ethereum, but that doesn’t mean Ethereum’s going down or anything like that. I think there’s going to be market share for Ethereum. I think they could both grow, but I think from a market capitalization perspective, I think Solana will end up growing faster,” Scaramucci told CoinDesk Live on Dec. 11. That’s been his line for a while. This time it came with a prop: his new book, Solana Rising, which dropped Dec. 9 and — according to Scaramucci — quickly hit the top of Amazon’s “new releases” list for investment management/investment strategy. He framed the book as something for the skeptics, or at least for the friends of the believers. Related Reading: Solana Enters Bear Territory: Realized Loss Now Outweighs Profit The pitch is familiar if you’ve been anywhere near crypto conferences this year, but Scaramucci’s version is unusually blunt: Solana is the fastest-growing chain, it’s stacked with activity, it’s cheap to use, and it’s easy to build on. Then you add staking, and you’ve got what he keeps calling “great tokenomics.” And yes, he’s heavily aligned. “Full disclosure,” he said, “I have a large personal holding in Solana. I have it on the firm’s balance sheet.” How large? On SkyBridge’s balance sheet, he put it at “probably 60%,” with the firm sitting on “north of a nine figure balance sheet.” His personal portfolio allocation, he estimated, is around “6% 7%.” Big, but not “I sold the house for SOL” big. Notably, Scaramucci emphasized that he’s not “chain monogamous.” He likes Avalanche. He likes Ethereum. He’s not doing maximalism. He’s doing a portfolio. “In fact, who is chain monogamous?” he joked. Related Reading: Solana Hits Critical Demand Zone — Is A Surprise Bottom Loading? The Skybridge Capital founder added: “It’s not an amorous thing. It just has to do with the realities of investing. It’s like owning a lot of stocks in your portfolio. But to me, I just think that it is the fastest growing chain. That’s the most activity of like the top 50 chains combined. It’s got lots of use cases, lots of versatility. It’s easy to develop on and it’s very low fees to transact on and it’s got great tokenomics if you want to stake your Solana like I do.” He also pointed to the debut of the first spot Solana ETF in the United States — “first staking ETF,” in his words — as another signal that we’re still early. Then came the price talk, because of course it did. Could SOL hit $300–$400 by the end of next year? “Sure,” he said, tying it to a more constructive US regulatory backdrop — specifically his hope that the CLARITY Act gets passed and unlocks “the full utilization of tokenization.” Longer term, he went bigger: “Is Solana go to $1,000 over the next five years? I really do believe that.” He also revisited Bitcoin. Same vibe: right call, wrong calendar. “I’ve been right about Bitcoin, but I’ve been wrong about timing,” Scaramucci said, sticking with a $150,000–$200,000 target, and arguing a friendlier rate environment next year could help. At press time, SOL traded at $139.14.

This expiry event is pretty much the same as last week’s, which had no impact on spot markets. The US Federal Reserve dropped rates by a quarter percent this week in a move that was largely priced in by markets, hence the lack of reaction. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 1.1, meaning that the shorts slightly outnumber the longs. Max pain is around $90,000, according to Coinglass. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of Bitcoin options contracts yet to expire, is highest at $100,000, which has $2.7 billion at this strike price on Deribit. There remains around $2 billion in OI at $80k and $85k targeted by short sellers. Total BTC options OI across all exchanges is at $54.6 billion, according to Coinglass. Bitcoin positioning is tightly centered around the $90,000 level, reported Deribit. “Call and put interest sit in near balance, suggesting traders expect a contained expiry after the recent range-bound tape. The clustering around 90K reflects a market waiting for the next catalyst rather than leaning into directional conviction.” Options Expiry Alert.

Market activity tends to be subdued, limiting the near-term momentum for any sustained rally.” In addition to today’s batch of Bitcoin options, around 247,000 Ethereum contracts are also expiring, with a notional value of $768 million, max pain at $3,100, and a put/call ratio of 1.24. Total ETH options OI across all exchanges is around $12 billion. “Positioning has shifted into a more neutral distribution, yet call concentration hints that traders remain willing to price in larger ETH moves if volatility reawakens,” said Deribit. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $4.3 billion. Spot Market Outlook Markets have been mostly flat with a slight tick up in total capitalization over the past few hours, as it reached $3.2 trillion. Bitcoin topped $93,000 again, but hit resistance again, and fell back to the $92,000 level during early trading in Asia on Friday. Ether prices have traded in a tight range around the $3,200 level over the past day. Meanwhile, the altcoins were mostly sideways with minor gains for Solana, Bitcoin Cash, and privacy coins Monero and Zcash.

He didn’t just talk about technical specs or price predictions—he redefined what Solana decentralization truly means. Forget the old notion of leaderless chaos; Yakovenko envisions a future where every participant becomes a leader. This perspective could fundamentally change how we build and interact with decentralized networks. What Does Solana Decentralization Really Mean? When most people hear “decentralization,” they imagine a structure without any clear authority. However, Anatoly Yakovenko presents a more nuanced vision. He argues that true Solana decentralization doesn’t eliminate leadership but distributes it among all participants. Imagine a symphony where every musician leads their section while contributing to the harmony. This approach creates a resilient system where responsibility and initiative spread across the entire network. Yakovenko’s personal goal reveals the depth of this philosophy. He wants to reach a point where he can “blend into the audience” without special privileges like GitHub commit permissions. This isn’t about stepping away from responsibility but about building a system so robust that no single person’s access controls its destiny. The network matures when founders become ordinary participants. How Does Everyone Become a Leader in Practice? The concept of universal leadership might sound idealistic, but Solana’s architecture makes it achievable. Let’s break down what this looks like in real-world applications: Validator Independence: Anyone can run a node and participate in consensus Governance Participation: Token holders vote on proposals that shape the network’s future Development Contributions: Developers build applications without central approval Community Moderation: Users collectively maintain network standards and culture This distributed leadership model creates what economists call “anti-fragile” systems—networks that grow stronger under stress. When challenges emerge, multiple leaders can propose solutions simultaneously, creating a competitive environment for the best ideas. The recent Solana network upgrades demonstrate this perfectly, with various teams collaborating and competing to improve performance. What Challenges Does This Decentralization Model Face? While the vision is compelling, implementing universal leadership presents significant hurdles. First, coordination becomes more complex when everyone has agency. Decision-making can slow down without clear hierarchies. Second, quality control requires new mechanisms when anyone can contribute code or proposals. Finally, security concerns multiply with increased participation points. However, Solana’s approach addresses these challenges through technological design. The network’s high throughput allows for rapid consensus even with numerous participants. Smart contract audits and formal verification tools help maintain quality without central gatekeepers. Most importantly, the economic incentives align individual leadership with network health—validators earn more by acting honestly and efficiently. Why Does This Matter for Blockchain’s Future? Yakovenko’s perspective on Solana decentralization represents more than just technical philosophy—it’s a blueprint for the next generation of digital communities. Traditional organizations concentrate power at the top, creating single points of failure. Distributed leadership models like Solana’s create resilient networks that can adapt and evolve organically. Consider how this applies beyond cryptocurrency. Social media platforms struggle with content moderation because decisions come from distant corporate offices. A decentralized approach could empower communities to set their own standards while maintaining interoperability. The principles Yakovenko describes could reshape everything from supply chain management to democratic voting systems. How Can You Participate in This Decentralized Future? You don’t need to be a blockchain expert to contribute to Solana decentralization . The network welcomes various forms of participation: Run a validator node with modest hardware requirements Stake your SOL tokens to help secure the network Build applications using Solana’s developer tools Participate in governance discussions and votes Educate others about decentralized technologies Each contribution, no matter how small, strengthens the network’s distributed leadership. Remember Yakovenko’s goal of blending into the audience—the ultimate success metric is when no single person’s participation feels essential because everyone’s contribution matters equally. The Bottom Line on Solana’s Leadership Revolution Anatoly Yakovenko’s vision transforms decentralization from an abstract ideal into a practical framework for collective action. True Solana decentralization isn’t about removing leaders but about empowering everyone to lead in their domain. This approach creates networks that are more resilient, innovative, and equitable than traditional hierarchical systems. As blockchain technology matures, this distributed leadership model may become its most valuable export to other industries. The future belongs to networks where founders can disappear into the crowd because they’ve built systems that don’t depend on any individual. That’s the ultimate test of decentralization—and Solana is leading the charge toward that reality. Frequently Asked Questions What did Anatoly Yakovenko mean by “everyone is a leader”? He meant that in a truly decentralized system, every participant has agency and responsibility. Rather than having no leaders, the system distributes leadership roles across all network participants through validation, governance, and development contributions. How is Solana’s decentralization different from other blockchains? While many blockchains aim for decentralization, Solana emphasizes technical architecture that enables high participation rates. Its focus on scalability allows more users to run nodes and participate in consensus without compromising performance. Can anyone really contribute to Solana without permission? Yes, that’s the core principle. Anyone can run a validator node, build applications, or participate in governance without seeking approval from a central authority. The network’s rules are enforced by code rather than individuals. What are the risks of distributed leadership in blockchain? Primary risks include coordination challenges, potential for conflicting decisions, and slower response times in emergencies. However, Solana’s design uses economic incentives and fast consensus to mitigate these issues. How does Solana prevent bad actors in a leaderless system? The network uses proof-of-stake consensus where validators must stake SOL tokens. Malicious behavior leads to slashing (loss of staked tokens), creating strong economic disincentives for harmful actions. What’s the practical benefit of this decentralization model for users? Users benefit from increased network resilience, censorship resistance, and innovation diversity. When multiple teams can build without permission, they create more solutions to user problems than any single company could develop. Found this perspective on Solana decentralization enlightening?

That’s the promise of prediction markets, and a major new alliance just brought this future a giant leap closer. In a landmark move, decentralized prediction market platform Kalshi has announced the formation of the Coalition for Prediction Markets (CPM), uniting industry titans like Coinbase , Robinhood , Crypto.com, and Underdog. This powerful coalition signals a pivotal moment for the adoption and legitimacy of prediction markets within the mainstream financial and crypto ecosystems. What Are Prediction Markets and Why Do They Matter? Before diving into the coalition, let’s clarify what prediction markets are. In simple terms, they are exchange-traded platforms where people can buy and sell shares based on the outcome of future events. The price of a share reflects the crowd’s collective wisdom on the probability of that event happening. For example, a share priced at $0.70 for “Will the Fed raise rates?” suggests a 70% perceived chance. Therefore, these markets are powerful tools for aggregating information and forecasting . The formation of this coalition is a direct response to the regulatory and public perception hurdles these markets face. By banding together, these companies aim to advocate for clear rules and demonstrate the legitimate utility of prediction markets beyond simple gambling. Who’s Who in the Prediction Markets Coalition? The CPM’s membership roster reads like a who’s who of modern finance. Each member brings a unique strength to the table: Kalshi : The initiator and a leading regulated platform focused on event-based trading. Coinbase : A cryptocurrency exchange giant with immense regulatory experience and user trust. Robinhood : A pioneer in retail investing, known for its massive, engaged user base. Crypto.com : A major global crypto platform with a strong brand and international reach. Underdog : A prominent player in the fantasy sports and betting space, connecting to a related audience. This diverse alliance combines expertise in crypto, traditional brokerage, retail engagement, and sports betting. Their collective goal is to shape a future where prediction markets are seen as a valuable source of economic and social insight. What Are the Potential Benefits of This Alliance? The collaboration could unlock several transformative benefits for users and the market as a whole. First, it could lead to increased liquidity and more accurate pricing across platforms as user bases potentially interconnect. Second, a unified voice is far stronger when engaging with regulators like the CFTC and SEC to establish a clear legal framework. Moreover, for the average person, this could mean access to sophisticated hedging tools. Imagine a farmer using a prediction market to hedge against drought or a business owner hedging against supply chain disruptions. The coalition aims to move these markets from niche curiosities to mainstream financial instruments. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Prediction Markets? Despite the excitement, the path forward isn’t without obstacles. The primary challenge remains regulatory uncertainty . U.S. regulators have historically viewed event-based markets with skepticism, often associating them with gambling. The coalition’s success hinges on its ability to reframe this narrative towards one of information aggregation and risk management. Another hurdle is public perception and education. Many people are unfamiliar with how prediction markets work. The coalition members will need to invest in clear communication to build trust and demonstrate the practical utility of these platforms to a broad audience. The Future Forecast: What Could This Coalition Change? If successful, the Coalition for Prediction Markets could fundamentally alter how we interact with uncertainty. We might see these markets used to forecast corporate earnings, gauge the impact of climate policies, or even provide real-time sentiment on geopolitical events. The integration with major platforms like Coinbase and Robinhood could introduce millions of users to this concept seamlessly. This isn’t just about creating a new trading product; it’s about building a more informed and resilient economy. The collective data from these markets could serve as a powerful, decentralized oracle for various blockchain applications and traditional decision-making processes. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Collective Intelligence The formation of the Coalition for Prediction Markets, spearheaded by Kalshi and backed by giants like Coinbase and Robinhood, is a watershed moment. It represents a coordinated push to bring the power of crowd-sourced forecasting into the financial mainstream. While regulatory battles and educational efforts lie ahead, the alliance has the firepower and credibility to potentially reshape how we understand and manage future risk. The ultimate prediction? That this coalition will make the once-niche world of prediction markets impossible to ignore. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Coalition for Prediction Markets (CPM)? The CPM is an advocacy group formed by Kalshi, Coinbase, Robinhood, Crypto.com, and Underdog. Its primary goal is to promote the responsible development and regulatory clarity for prediction markets in the United States. Are prediction markets legal? The legality is complex and varies by jurisdiction. In the U.S., most prediction markets operate in a regulatory gray area. The CPM aims to work with regulators like the CFTC to establish clear, legal frameworks for markets based on economic events, distinguishing them from sports gambling. How are prediction markets different from sports betting? While both involve wagering on outcomes, prediction markets are often framed as tools for information aggregation and hedging on real-world events (e.g., inflation rates, election results), not just sports entertainment. The trading and pricing mechanisms also function more like a financial market. Can I trade on Kalshi’s prediction markets now? Yes, Kalshi is a currently operating, regulated platform (with CFTC approval as a designated contract market) where eligible U.S. residents can trade on event outcomes.
