In fact, the whole market is ablaze with anticipation after Bitcoin smashed through its previous all-time high to touch $122,838 just last month. Following 2024’s halving event, fresh signs of regulatory progress in the U.S. could provide the catalyst for widespread crypto adoption across the globe. See, last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced Project Crypto , a sweeping reform initiative aimed at updating securities laws for crypto. The pro-crypto SEC Chair Paul S. Atkins described it as the regulator’s “guiding star” in advancing President Trump’s ambition to position the United States as the leading hub for cryptocurrency innovation. With momentum building, here are the assets ChatGPT-5 predicts could generate some of the most impressive returns as we move into the year’s final stretch. XRP (Ripple): ChatGPT-5 Predicts a Run Towards $10 Before New Year According to ChatGPT’s projections, Ripple’s native token, XRP (XRP) , could rally to $10 by late 2025—representing a potential 211% upside from its current level near $3.22. XRP has been one of the year’s strongest performers. On July 18, it posted a new record high of $3.65, surpassing the peak it set in 2018. Over the past 30 days, the token has gained 36%, outclimbing Bitcoin and most major altcoins and meme tokens. With growing partnerships with major banks and peculation surrounding a possible XRP spot ETF, there are strong narratives driving this coin up. Renowned for its ultra-fast settlement speeds, negligible fees, and ability to facilitate global transfers without intermediaries, XRP has become a favorite for enterprise-level payments. In 2024, the United Nations Capital Development Fund named it a preferred choice for cross-border remittance solutions. A turning point arrived in 2023 when a U.S. court ruled that XRP’s retail transactions did not meet the definition of securities. The SEC closed its investigation in early 2025, removing a major obstacle for the token’s future trajectory. Currently trading about 12% under its ATH, XRP could hit $5 if it clears current resistance at $3.50, and in a more optimistic scenario, ChatGPT believes it might even reach $10, but it would need cultivation from US authorities Technically, XRP’s RSI is climbing from 58, suggesting the rally is ongoing as the token keeps challenging resistance. Over the past 12 months, XRP has delivered a staggering 432% gain, more than quadruple Bitcoin’s 97% advance in the same period. Pepe (PEPE): ChatGPT Predicts 450× Potential Upside by December Launched in April 2023 and inspired by Matt Furie’s iconic internet frog, Pepe ($PEPE) has quickly risen to become one of the top three meme coins by market capitalization, now valued at $4.7 billion and leading all non-dog-themed meme assets. Despite intense rivalry in the meme coin arena, PEPE thrives thanks to its strong community support and deep liquidity. Elon Musk has hinted at holding PEPE alongside Dogecoin, occasionally dropping cryptic nods on his X account, including briefly making Pepe his profile picture last year. At the moment, PEPE trades near $0.00001116, up 9% in the past month and 3% in the last 24 hours, outperforming Bitcoin in both timeframes. ChatGPT anticipates a possible climb to $0.005 by December, a fraction above 448x higher than current levels, which would also leave its current ATH of $0.00002803 from late 2024 in the dust. While this is one of ChatGPT’s more outlandish predictions, anything can happen in a fully-fledged bull market, so its fair to say that a new ATH is achievable by fall. A review of PEPE’s chart reveals a descending wedge pattern from November through March, a formation that often precedes bullish breakouts. If market optimism continues and the regulatory climate improves, PEPE could be flipping the $7.5 billion cap Shiba Inu ($SHIB) for second place among meme coins. Dogecoin ($DOGE): Could the Original Meme Coin Outpace the Dollar? Debuting in 2013 as a parody, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has matured into a major digital asset with a market cap exceeding $33.2 billion, buoyed by a loyal meme-driven community and steadily growing real-world utility. While DOGE’s price generally moves in step with Bitcoin, its enthusiastic fan base and high liquidity have helped it weather multiple market cycles. Currently valued at about $0.2204, DOGE has risen 28% over the past month and is showing stability after a strong rally. Its RSI has cooled from an overheated 80 in mid-July to around 53, although its uptrending as bulls buy back in to ride the crest of the wave of current market optimism. In the past day, DOGE has gained 3.2%, slightly trailing the meme coin sector’s 5.6% bounce. The total market capitalization for meme coins now stands at $75.8 billion, which means Dogecoin corners almost half of the entire sector. Charts reveal a falling wedge formation between November and April, a technical setup often linked to bullish reversals. ChatGPT’s upper-end forecast sees DOGE climbing to $1.00 by New Year. If this happens, the self-styled “Doge Army” will be more than happy, as they’ve long dreamed of rivalling the greenback. It would also send their favourite meme coin just over 4× above its current price. Adoption also continues to grow: Tesla accepts Dogecoin for certain purchases, and platforms such as PayPal and Revolut have integrated DOGE transfers—strengthening its case as a viable payment method. Maxi Doge Approaches $500K in Presale. Are We Looking At The Next DOGE? For meme traders seeking bigger upside than established names like DOGE and PEPE, there are some unmissable opportunities lurking in the presales market. One of the latest to make waves is Maxi Doge (MAXI) , an ERC-20 token that has already pulled in close to $500,000 during its presale, remarkable given it only launched this week. Maxi Doge’s premise is straightforward: build a strong community of traders who actively support its token and other promising altcoins. The project plans to maintain active Telegram and Discord channels, hosting trading contests and events to grow awareness and engagement. A quarter of the MAXI’s’s 150.24 billion MAXI total supply will go into the “Maxi Fund,” aimed at forging partnerships and boosting marketing reach. Holders will also have the option to stake MAXI for passive earnings, adding a potential income stream for long-term investors. The presale is currently live, with tokens priced at $0.000251, though this will increase in under 48 hours. Interested investors can join by visiting the Maxi Doge website and connecting a wallet such as MetaMask or Best Wallet .

49769818,https://cryptonews.com/?p=406029,1754692200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/49769818.jpeg,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 8 August – XRP, Stellar, Chainlink",https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-price-prediction-today-8-august-xrp-stellar-chainlink/,"Bitcoin surged to a never-before-seen price peak of $122,838 last month, prompting speculation that the delayed post-halving crypto bull run may soon get here. This upward momentum has reignited interest in leading altcoins and some of the best meme coins alike. Over the past year, tokens such as XRP, TRON, Solana, Sui Network, Pepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin have each set record highs. Adding to the sense that a major gold rush is about to begin, U.S. regulators are moving closer towards introducing long-awaited rules for the crypto industry. Just last week, the SEC revealed Project Crypto , an ambitious framework aimed at modernizing securities regulation and bringing long-sought clarity to the digital asset sector. With bullish signs flashing “buy” or “HODL”, many analysts believe the following crypto altcoins could smash through previous price ceilings in the near-term. Ripple (XRP): Backed by Banks and the UN, Could This Cross-Border Payments Crypto Set Another Price Record Before 2026? On July 18, Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) hit a fresh record high of $3.65, overtaking its previous 2018 milestone of $3.40. Prices have since eased to around $3.33, a decline of roughly 8.8%, but with a staggering 8% rebound over the past day, momentum appears to be returning. XRP’s edge lies in its lightning-fast settlement times, negligible transaction costs, and global payments infrastructure that bypasses traditional banking intermediaries. Its efficiency has attracted institutional adoption and even endorsements from major organizations, including the United Nations. A landmark moment arrived in 2023 when a U.S. court ruled that XRP’s retail sales do not constitute securities, removing a key legal cloud over the asset. That lawsuit was formally closed earlier this year, fuelling renewed investment. Over the last 12 months, XRP has skyrocketed by 441%, quadrupling Bitcoin’s 104% gain during the same period. Technical indicators support further strength: the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at 62, suggesting heavy buying momentum. Additionally, XRP has surged 41% in the last month, handily beating Bitcoin’s 7% rise. July saw XRP trade consistently above its 30-day moving average, driven by heavy buying pressure. Now, with solid support forming near $3, downside risk is minimal. A bullish flag pattern that developed between late 2024 and early 2025 hints at the possibility of a breakout toward the $4 mark in the weeks ahead. Stellar (XLM): Another UN-Backed Crypto Could Set a New Record Price Soon Launched in 2014, Stellar ($XLM) ranks among the crypto market’s longest-standing projects. Built for fast, affordable cross-border transactions, Stellar targets similar use cases to Ripple’s XRP and Bitcoin Cash, though it’s powered by a distinct technical design. These attributes have also led XLM to be endorsed in the same breath as XRP by the United Nations, which reported at the end of last year that the two payments coins could have a place in a future intermediary-free global payments network. Rather than using Bitcoin’s energy-heavy Proof-of-Work system, Stellar employs the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), which relies on a network of trusted validators to confirm transactions without the need for competitive mining. With a market capitalization exceeding $14.5 billion, Stellar is the 14th-largest cryptocurrency. If U.S. lawmakers finalize clear regulations by the close of the year, XLM could enter a blinding rally. A bullish flag pattern from late 2024 to the end of March indicates a possible breakout, which we then saw through mid-July with the assistance of some whale orders. A similar thing is happening now, with XLM shooting up 13% overnight to trade at $0.446 as of this writing Expect resistance near $0.50, though a sustained rally could push the token toward $0.80 by October. From that point, it is all but likely to succeed in surpassing its former ATH of $0.8756 set way back on January 03, 2018. Chainlink ($LINK): The Crypto Bringing Interoperability to Blockchain Surged 12% Overnight One standout mover today is Chainlink (LINK) , which climbed an impressive 12% over the past 24 hours to trade at $19.32. At its core, Chainlink operates as a decentralized blockchain oracle network, essentially a system that transfers real-world, off-chain data into blockchain-based smart contracts. By doing so, it enables seamless connections between existing data systems and virtually any public or private blockchain. Many industry leaders say that interoperability will be the key to global crypto adoption. With that in mind, Chainlink stands as a key bridge not just between real-world data and blockchain, but between all blockchains. So it’s no wonder the project has partnered with SWIFT . $LINK could rally to $30 by month’s end, a projection the charts suggest is within reach. From January through mid-March, price movements have formed a descending wedge pattern, a technical setup that often precedes a bullish breakout. Chainlink’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently sitting near 64, reflecting persistent buying that is likely to cool off as the token continues to appreciate in value. It will also find resistance at $25 and $30. However, given its strong technical outlook and the budding narrative of US regulatory support, $LINK currently stands to make some of the highest gains in the altcoin category. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): Meme Energy Meets Layer 2 Innovation Beyond established altcoins, some enticing early-stage presale projects could be at the forefront of global crypto adoption. Enter Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the first Layer 2 protocol for Bitcoin, blending viral internet culture with technical innovation to enhance transaction speeds and scalability. It aims to expand Bitcoin’s use cases while keeping a playful, community-driven edge. The project has already attracted around $7.7 million in its presale stage, with some market watchers predicting a potential 10× price surge after its official launch. By integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper addresses Bitcoin’s long-standing scalability issues, offering high-performance smart contracts without the bottlenecks of slow transaction processing and high fees. Its Canonical Bridge technology enables near-instant BTC transfers through its proprietary Layer 2 network, while ultra-low gas fees make it suitable for decentralized apps (dApps), meme tokens, and payment platforms. A recent Coinsult audit found no vulnerabilities in its smart contracts, further boosting investor trust. The native $HYPER token underpins the entire ecosystem, functioning as the medium for staking rewards, transaction fees, and access to exclusive platform benefits. Early presale buyers can earn annual yields of up to 139% and enjoy governance rights, giving them a direct say in the platform’s evolution.

In a bid to stabilize its price, the team has been aggressively buying back tokens using SOL, with one of its largest buybacks to date looking to be recorded. On August 8, on-chain tracker Arkham reported that Pump.fun had sent 33,000 SOL to the wallet it uses for strategic buybacks. Worth $5.6 million in SOL, the launchpad is looking to buy approximately 1.77 billion PUMP at the current market price. PUMP IS BUYING PUMP PumpFun just sent another $5.6M SOL to a new address where they are buying back PUMP. So far they have bought back $6.68M PUMP on this address, and sent $5.72M of that to a Squads Vault. Address: 88uq8JNL6ANwmow1og7VQD4hte73Jpw8qsUP77BtF6iE pic.twitter.com/i2fS7YJddt — Arkham (@arkham) August 8, 2025 In total, that wallet has already purchased $6.68 million worth of PUMP, with $5.72 million of it already moved into a Squads Vault. PUMP Faces Pressure as Presale Holders Exit and Trading Volume Declines PUMP’s dip comes as pressure mounts from insiders and large holders offloading their tokens. Just hours before the recent buyback activity, another on-chain tool, Onchain Lens, flagged a single wallet dumping 1.11 billion PUMP tokens , worth around $3.79 million. The trade earned the seller a $362,000 profit, indicating the high-stakes exits occurring behind the scenes. Presale holders have also been rapidly reducing their exposure. Since July, nearly 60% of their tokens have been sold, flooding the market with supply. According to Lookonchain, one investor lab eled “Whale 6wB5A2” recently cut losses, offloading 130 million PUMP for $424,700 in USDC at a price of $0.0033. Whale 6wB5A2 cut losses 6 hours ago, selling 130M $PUMP for 424.7K $USDC at $0.0033. He previously spent 4M $USDC to buy 1B $PUMP in the public sale, and another 1.25M $USDC to buy 305.68M $PUMP at $0.0041. He still holds 1.17B $PUMP ($3.92M), with a ~$898K loss.… pic.twitter.com/TgR9REgadd — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) August 8, 2025 The whale previously spent $5.25 million across multiple purchases during the public sale and still holds around 1.17 billion PUMP, with unrealized losses of roughly $898,000. Pump.fun has tried to counter this by introducing transparency into its economic strategy. On August 4, it launched a real-time dashboard allowing users to track daily revenue and token purchases. introducing the pump fun revenue dashboard pump fun's daily revenues & $PUMP purchases can now be tracked in real time using https://t.co/fxyCTVUuBj in the past 6 days, pump fun purchased ~8,740 SOL worth of $PUMP , equating to 102% of total revenue over that time period. pic.twitter.com/xWxy85en7t — pump.fun (@pumpdotfun) August 4, 2025 Also, over the past few days, the platform has bought back roughly 8,740 SOL worth of PUMP, effectively using more than 100% of its revenue during that stretch to support the token’s price. At the time of writing, PUMP is trading at $0.003344, up 1.6% in the past 24 hours. It has seen a 25.9% price increase over the last seven days, outperforming the broader crypto market, which is up around 6.1%. Still, PUMP is down over 50% from its all-time high of $0.006812 and sits roughly 48% above its lowest recorded price of $0.002283. Source: Coingecko The 24-hour trading volume for the token has dropped to around $278 million, a 10.9% decline from the previous day. That dip in activity, combined with consistent sell pressure, has raised questions about whether the current buyback strategy can hold. For now, Pump.fun appears determined to absorb the sell-off and reassert control. Pump.fun Launches Glass Full Foundation Amid Resurgence in Solana Meme Coin Activity Pump.fun recently introduced the Glass Full Foundation (GFF), a new initiative focused on providing liquidity support for promising projects within its ecosystem. The foundation is expected to help stabilize the platform’s rapidly evolving memecoin sector, with selected tokens receiving ongoing capital injections to support growth and market activity. The launch of GFF follows an uptick in platform momentum. After trailing behind rival letsBONK.fun for several weeks, Pump.fun regained its lead in the Solana memecoin space on August 6, outperforming across multiple metrics, including trading volume, revenue, token graduations, and new mints. @pumpdotfun has reclaimed the lead from @letsBONKfun in Solana meme coin activity, topping daily trading volume, revenue, and token launches. #Solana #MemeCoins https://t.co/2T5wbQjZyV — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 6, 2025 Pump.fun recorded $144.5 million in token graduation volume that day, more than four times that of letsBONK.fun. Revenue also surged, with the platform pulling in $1.38 million, well ahead of its competitor’s $282,000. Pump.fun leads in 24-hour trading volume, generating nearly $144 million, compared to $19 million on letsBONK.fun. It also outpaces in token graduations and user engagement. According to Pump.fun, the foundation has already started deploying capital, with early recipients receiving liquidity support. The goal, the team says, is to foster the most committed communities and help expand the Solana ecosystem’s reach. Source: DefiLlama Despite its resurgence, the broader meme coin market is showing signs of fatigue, as shown in Pump.fun’s monthly revenue. The revenue dropped to a 2025 low in July, generating just $24.96 million, an 80% decline from its January peak.

DOGE is now up 8.5% on the week , 30% over the past month , and a massive 123% in the past year , showing powerful long-term strength that continues to outpace expectations. Technical analysis suggests DOGE may be sitting at the very beginning of a major breakout , with the potential to push toward new all-time highs as bullish sentiment floods back into the market. With the broader crypto rally gaining speed and Dogecoin still leading the meme coin narrative, the setup points to a very bullish long-term Dogecoin price prediction – one that could surprise even the most optimistic holders. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Biggest Whale Buy Since 2024 – Could This Be the Smart Money Signal? Analyst Ali Martinez has tracked a considerable increase in whale accumulation in recent days, with large investors accumulating 1 billion DOGE in the 24 hours leading up to August 6 (Wednesday). Whales bought over one billion Dogecoin $DOGE in the last 24 hours! pic.twitter.com/qdGrIE6Gez — Ali (@ali_charts) August 6, 2025 In fact, Martinez followed up this post with another earlier this morning, showing that whales are still at it, having bought 230 million DOGE in the past 24 hours. This is hugely bullish for DOGE, since even with some big buys earlier in the week, whales still have an appetite for the meme token. It has benefitted from the market-wide rally today, which in turn appears to have followed from yesterday’s news that Ripple has acquired stablecoin platform Rail for $200 million . While this news is obviously of direct relevance only to Ripple and XRP, it was the major catalyst in today’s rally, with prices following XRP’s aggressive surge. As such, demand is higher across the board, and this includes demand for Dogecoin, which is enjoying a boost in momentum. As its chart shows, its indicators are rising quickly from oversold levels, with its relative strength index (yellow) touching 70 today. Source: TradingView Its MACD (orange, blue) has also very recently turned positive, with the indicator having more space to rise before it enters an overbought position. This is very encouraging for Dogecoin, which has also seen its trading volume double in the past couple of days, from $1 billion to just over $2 billion. And some analysts are predicting a big medium- and long-term push, with Ali Martinez suggesting yesterday that it’s trading in “ a historically strong buy zone .” Dogecoin $DOGE is trading within a historically strong buy zone, which has repeatedly triggered major bull runs in past cycles! pic.twitter.com/oYZF8BVKmE — Ali (@ali_charts) August 7, 2025 The Dogecoin price could therefore hit $0.30 by the end of the month, and higher toward $1 by the end of the year. Could This Be the Meme Coin That Outruns Dogecoin? While Dogecoin is expected to rise alongside the broader market, it’s unlikely to be the top-performing meme token in the months ahead. Given its already massive size, newer meme coins are far more likely to deliver outsized gains, especially presale tokens entering their first growth phase. That’s why many traders are turning to early-stage opportunities like Maxi Doge (MAXI) , an ERC-20 token that recently launched its ICO and is quickly gaining momentum. Maxi Doge has already raised nearly $500,000 in its presale, despite launching just a week ago, a sign of the strong momentum building around this project. Fully embracing its meme coin identity, Maxi Doge is creating a high-energy community of traders who will help fuel its growth through engagement, competition, and shared conviction. The project’s Telegram and Discord channels will serve as hubs for trading challenges and competitions, where holders can earn rewards by staying active and outperforming others. This gamified approach aims to keep the community engaged, attract new traders, and build lasting demand for the token. A key part of the project’s growth strategy is the Maxi Fund , which will hold 25% of the total supply (150.24 billion MAXI). It will be used to boost liquidity, form partnerships, and support the token’s long-term expansion. This gives Maxi Doge the potential to be one of the biggest new meme coins of the year, with investors able to join its presale at its official website . MAXI is currently selling for $0.000251, although this will rise in two days and will continue to rise periodically for the entire sale.

The U.S. has kept that position since then, but reports now claim that China is close to making a comeback. China nearly overtook the United States to become Germany’s largest trading partner in the first half of 2025, according to preliminary data from the German statistics office, as German exports to the U.S. suffered amid higher tariffs. America was ultimately able to defend its position, although the lead over China in German trade is now “razor-thin,” Vincent Stamer, economist at Commerzbank said. The US remains in the lead, but only by a thin margin China’s attempt to overtake the United States as Germany’s largest trading partner was driven by a 3.9% decline in German exports to the U.S., a side effect of new U.S. tariffs introduced under the Trump administration. Meanwhile, imports from China rose by 10.7% year-on-year in the first half, crossing the 80 billion euros threshold. Commentators think the surge is proof China has started redirecting trade from the U.S. to Europe. The goods are cheaper thanks to a significant undervaluation of the yuan against the euro, which makes the relationship profitable. German exports to China fell 14.2% to 41.4 billion euros as exporters struggled amid increased competition from Chinese manufacturers. The sharp decline in exports to China, as well as the surging imports, has led to a record trade deficit of 40 billion euros, similar to the one from 2022. However, observers think things could get worse. “As the year progresses, losses in German exports to the U.S. are likely to continue and even intensify,” Juergen Matthes, head of international economic policy at the Cologne Institute for Economic Research said. Commerzbank now expects new U.S. tariffs to slow down German exports by 20% to 25% over the next two years. This gives China even more opportunities to reclaim the top spot among Germany’s trading partners over the course of the year. Global trade is going through a realignment The world has drastically changed since Donald Trump became POTUS as he introduced sweeping reforms as well as tariffs that have upset the norm and forced global trade realignments. Those tariffs have significantly weakened transatlantic trade and has left countries no choice but to be diplomatic, as they seek to protect their interests without crossing Trump who has shown he is willing to use the tariffs as a control tool. In April, the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) sounded a warning about the state of things, revealing global merchandise trade is expected to decline by 0.2% this year, with North America facing a significant 12.6% drop in exports. It claimed the decline could be even worse, increasing to 1.5%, should trade tensions worsen. Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala spoke about the global impact: “The enduring uncertainty threatens to act as a brake on global growth, with severe negative consequences for the world, particularly for the most vulnerable economies.” The Brookings-FT Tracking Indexes for the Global Economic Recovery shared a similar sentiment and also came up with related findings that saw one analyst forecast a bleak future for “every open economy that relies on trade” as they are reportedly expected to get squeezed.

The executive order which is set to be signed this week, Trump is pushing to allow 401(k) retirement accounts to invest in crypto, private equity, and other non-traditional assets. The decision marks a major shift away from decades of conservative financial planning, potentially unlocking trillions in sidelined capital. This action builds on Trump’s growing embrace of digital assets. Over the past few months, he has hosted blockchain innovators at the White House, proposed a federal crypto advisory role, and even called for the U.S. to build a national Bitcoin reserve. With lawsuits against key platforms like Coinbase and Uniswap dropped, it’s clear that crypto policy under Trump is entering a friendlier phase. And now altcoins are gaining traction. The broader crypto market cap sits at around $3.76 trillion, and while Bitcoin still leads, its dominance has dropped to 60.7%, a clear signal that altcoins are starting to take the spotlight. Signs of Early Altseason Ethereum overshadowed Bitcoin’s performance with its Q2 2025 performance. Ethereum’s outperformance is often an early sign of capital rotating into altcoins—something that historically precedes full-blown altseasons. Altcoin-related metrics also support this narrative. According to CryptoQuant, weekly altcoin deposits on Binance have surged past 45,000, the highest in nearly a year. Technical signals are flashing green as well—the altcoin market cap just printed a golden cross, and the Altseason Index has climbed from 26 to 37, indicating a growing appetite for higher-risk assets. Current conditions are quite similar to the pre-bull market phase of 2021, where many altcoins created fortunes for a lot of investors. The Altcoin That Was Rated the Top Early-Stage Gem With the early signs of the altcoin season, MAGACOIN FINANCE has come out as a great opportunity for investors looking to gain an exposure to a project before it becomes mainstream. The project’s rapid rise has drawn incredible attention, especially since it offers more than just hype. With an expanding ecosystem, continuous development, and multiple sell-out early rounds , it’s quickly earning a reputation as 2025’s best crypto opportunity. What’s driving this buzz? Investor demand is skyrocketing, and the project is gaining traction across top-tier communities looking for the next 50x+ opportunity . Early supporters have already seen returns up to 7,800%, and with broader altcoin adoption accelerating, MAGACOIN FINANCE is well-positioned to ride the wave. Altcoin Momentum is Surging The numbers don’t lie—Ethereum’s dominance, on-chain flows, and altcoin market activity all point to a rising tide. While a full-scale altseason hasn’t officially begun, the early ingredients are there. Traders and analysts are watching closely, and many are already positioning themselves ahead of a potential breakout. With Trump’s crypto-friendly pivot and new access to retirement capital, Web3 could become a serious contender in traditional finance portfolios—something that would have seemed impossible just a few years ago. Final Words Trump’s executive order may be the biggest policy shakeup crypto has seen in years. By opening up 401(k) access to alternative assets like crypto, he’s creating the conditions for major capital inflows. At the same time, Ethereum’s strong Q3 and a wave of altcoin signals are setting the stage for a major rally. And as excitement builds, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to attract attention as the top altcoin presale to watch —giving early investors a shot at extraordinary gains before the next leg of the bull market kicks in.

Coins with clear functions are rising fast. Whether it’s earning back on gas fees or powering fast transactions, a few names are getting serious attention. This article covers four such projects: Cold Wallet, Stellar, Uniswap, and Hedera. Each brings something different, be it enterprise-level scale or tools for everyday use. You’ll find recent price updates, their core use cases, and why many see them as the top crypto to buy now. Let’s explore how these four coins are proving their worth in today’s market and why Cold Wallet has taken a lead role in this utility-first shift. 1. Cold Wallet: Earn Every Time You Use Crypto Cold Wallet flips the usual model on its head. Instead of paying high gas fees with nothing in return, users earn cashback for every transaction they make, whether they’re swapping coins, bridging assets, or transferring funds. This self-custody wallet lets users retain full control of their digital assets, with no third-party interference. Holding $CWT unlocks better rewards. Top holders can get up to 100% cashback on gas and 50% on swaps and ramps. Positioned as a top crypto to buy now, Cold Wallet ($CWT) offers a simple loop; use the wallet, earn $CWT, hold more, and unlock even greater returns. The presale is ongoing in Stage 17, with a current price of $0.00998. The coin is set to launch at $0.3517, offering a potential ROI of over 3,600%. With 691.3 million coins already sold and $5.7 million raised, momentum is clearly building. 40% of the total supply is set aside for presale and another 25% for ongoing rewards. This ensures long-term utility and real-world cashback incentives. Cold Wallet’s use-first model, steady growth, and presale stats make it a standout pick for 2025. 2. Stellar: Reliable, Fast, and Low-Cost Transfers Stellar (XLM) remains one of the strongest platforms for affordable and fast cross-border payments. Priced today at roughly $0.412, the coin has moved within a range of $0.396 to $0.428 in the last 24 hours, holding steady on trading charts. A mainnet vote on Protocol 23 is planned for late August 2025. This upgrade is expected to bring more power to the network and could pull in new developers and projects. The Stellar Development Foundation is also focusing on user growth through in-app reward strategies and grant support. With features suited for real-world adoption, Stellar continues to support remittances and stablecoin usage with minimal costs. If your priority is functional payment solutions, Stellar checks the box as a top crypto to buy now with long-term relevance. 3. Uniswap: The Backbone of Decentralized Exchanges Uniswap (UNI) has set the standard for decentralized exchanges. The coin currently trades at $9.67, staying within the $9.54 to $10.21 range during the last 24 hours. Its automatic liquidity protocol allows fast and permissionless trades, with millions of transactions processed regularly. Though no major updates have launched recently, the Uniswap Foundation has rolled out fresh documentation for Unichain, which may enable future cross-chain activity. As one of the top crypto to buy now, Uniswap continues to attract developers who value its open architecture and long-term adaptability. Thanks to solid volume, high security, and a user-driven governance model, Uniswap has secured its place in DeFi’s core stack. It remains a strong choice for users focused on decentralized access and non-custodial control. 4. Hedera: Designed for Enterprise-Level Applications Hedera (HBAR) runs on hashgraph, a technology known for fast, cheap, and energy-efficient transactions. HBAR’s price today sits around $0.2625, showing strong activity within the $0.2475 to $0.278 range throughout the day. On July 30, Hedera shared updates about its involvement in Project Acacia, a wholesale CBDC pilot with the Reserve Bank of Australia. It also played a key role in a UK-based FX trade with Lloyds and abrdn. Developer-focused updates include the launch of Agent Kit v3 and namespace shifts under “Hiero.” These technical improvements highlight Hedera’s drive to serve enterprise use cases. Its high-speed, low-cost infrastructure is winning favor among institutions. If you’re tracking the top crypto to buy now, Hedera’s traction with governments and banks makes it one to watch. Key Takeaway Picking the top crypto presale to buy now in 2025 means looking beyond price alone. Cold Wallet leads this group with a cashback model that returns value to users, not just platforms. Its presale data and reward-based design push it ahead of typical wallets. Stellar delivers low-cost, fast transfers. Uniswap offers a decentralized, reliable trading engine. Hedera caters to big players with real financial use cases. Together, these four projects bring a mix of practical value, adoption, and scalability. For those eyeing real-world use, each of these coins serves a strong purpose in today’s maturing market, and Cold Wallet stands out by making every crypto action rewarding.

Which Is The Top Crypto of 2025?",https://thecoinrise.com/cardano-approves-70m-upgrade-xlm-rallies-blockdag-offers-entry-at-0-0016-until-august-11-which-is-the-top-crypto-of-2025/,"The momentum across the crypto market is shifting. While most assets remain stagnant, a few are starting to show strong movement. Stellar (XLM) is rising after a major technical breakout, and Cardano (ADA) is gaining renewed attention thanks to a huge $70 million community-approved funding upgrade. At the same time, BlockDAG (BDAG) is giving buyers one final chance before a confirmed 17x price jump. This isn’t a typical presale. BlockDAG has already raised $364 million and is offering BDAG at $0.0016 until August 11. After that, the price resets to $0.0276, closing the current discounted window. Unlike the technical hype around ADA or XLM, BlockDAG focuses on early access and real tools. As the market begins to define the top crypto coins for 2025, BDAG’s time-sensitive pricing is becoming impossible to ignore. XLM Breaks Out Above $0.40: What’s Next? Stellar (XLM) is holding above $0.40 after a 7% increase in early August. A breakout from a falling wedge pattern has flipped sentiment. The coin now trades above its 50- and 200-period EMAs. Volume has spiked by over 50% in a single day, hinting at rising institutional interest. The big catalyst is Stellar’s new partnership with Visa. The payments giant is using Stellar’s blockchain to settle stablecoin transactions. This move could fuel broader use of XLM in real-world payments. Analysts are eyeing $0.50 as the next level. If it breaks, targets between $0.52–$0.60 come into play. Some predictions even suggest a run toward $1.50 by the end of the year, depending on broader market performance. Still, even with this bullish setup, Stellar’s upside is largely speculative. BlockDAG, in contrast, offers a 17x discount that’s live for just a few more days. ADA Eyes Breakout After $70M Upgrade Cardano is back in focus after the community approved a $70 million treasury fund for core upgrades. The upgrades aim to improve Cardano’s scalability, interoperability, and developer tools. These changes strengthen its standing among the top crypto coins to watch for 2025. From a charting perspective, ADA is currently testing the $0.75 resistance zone. This level used to act as major support and could unlock higher gains if broken. Technical signals are leaning bullish; the MACD crossover and the rising RSI suggest momentum is building. If confirmed, upside targets include $0.84 and $0.94, with some patterns hinting at a push to $1.10. While the outlook is strong, progress may take time. BlockDAG, on the other hand, has built momentum that delivers immediate benefits; its price window is already live and rapidly closing. BlockDAG Offers 17x Upside Before August 11! BlockDAG has now raised $364 million and sold 24.7 billion coins. Its GLOBAL LAUNCH release gives access to BDAG at $0.0016 until August 11. After that, the price resets to $0.0276, the Batch 29 rate. This creates a short window for a 17x pricing opportunity before the launch price hits $0.05. What separates BDAG is its working product. Dashboard V4 is live and offers simulated trading, real-time portfolio tracking, and charts. It also supports a hybrid blockchain-DAG design, EVM compatibility, and a low-code tool to build smart contracts quickly. Another major feature is its 10 BTC Giveaway. Every BDAG purchase before August 11 enters users into a prize pool. Higher purchase amounts increase the odds of winning. This giveaway adds extra incentive at the final price level. Beyond crypto, BlockDAG is working with sports teams like the Seattle Orcas and Seattle Seawolves. These partnerships are launching fan NFTs, tokens, and loyalty campaigns. This global sports angle gives BDAG more real-world value than most projects. While ADA and XLM ride chart trends, BlockDAG stands out with working tools, strong capital, and an offer that disappears after August 11. Final Thoughts Stellar’s strong setup and Visa deal have brought in fresh momentum. Cardano’s $70 million upgrade could drive future growth. Both are key players among 2025’s top crypto coins. But neither project offers a 17x discount alongside working features and a time-based price lock. BlockDAG delivers all three. The tools are ready, the capital is there, and the cutoff is clear. Once August 11 arrives, the $0.0016 offer ends and buyers miss out. In crypto, timing is everything. XLM and ADA might rise, but BDAG is launching, both on-chain and in price. This is the moment before takeoff.

49771035,https://timestabloid.com/?p=77458,1754694359,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Projected Price for 2040 If It Maintains 2% Monthly Rally,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-projected-price-for-2040-if-it-maintains-2-monthly-rally/,"XRP is currently trading at $3.36 after recovering from recent market volatility. The asset’s rebound followed a significant legal development in the ongoing Ripple vs. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dispute. Both parties filed to withdraw their respective appeals, bringing an end to a legal process that lasted nearly five years. Despite the recovery, XRP’s performance in the current month reflects only a modest 1.43% gain. Although this has reversed earlier losses, many analysts and investors continue to view the cryptocurrency as undervalued given its technological utility and adoption prospects. Assessing the Impact of Steady 2% Monthly Growth To evaluate XRP’s long-term potential, a growth model was applied assuming a consistent 2% price increase per month beginning in September 2025 and continuing until July 2040. Based on this calculation, XRP would finish 2025 at $3.64, reflecting an 8.3% increase from its starting point. This result would be lower than the yearly high of $3.66 already reached in July 2025 and falls significantly short of market analyst Alex Cobb’s projection of $22.54 by the same year-end. While the short-term returns from a modest growth rate may appear limited, the compounding effect over several years creates substantial long-term appreciation. Under this scenario, XRP would rise to $4.61 by December 2026 and $5.86 by December 2027, marking a 74% increase within two years. Long-Term Price Projections Through 2030 and 2040 Continuing at the same pace, the model estimates XRP would reach $12.01 by December 2030. This figure closely aligns with asset management firm Bitwise’s base-case target of $12.68 for that year, which assumes a 27% annualized growth rate. In a more optimistic projection, Bitwise’s bull case envisions XRP trading at $29.32 by 2030 . If the 2% monthly growth persisted beyond 2030, XRP would surpass the $100 threshold by January 2040, reaching approximately $101.67. By July 2040, the projection places the price at $119.81, representing a 3,465% increase from its August 2025 value. This estimate is consistent with Telegaon’s forecast, which predicts a minimum price of $119.08 and a maximum of $160.34 for XRP in 2040. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Potential Investment Returns and Practical Limitations Under this growth model, an investment of $10,000 at the current price of $3.36 would acquire approximately 2,976 XRP. Holding this position until July 2040 at the projected price of $119.81 would yield more than $356,000 in value. However, maintaining a steady 2% monthly increase for 15 consecutive years is highly improbable. Historical data shows XRP’s longest streak of uninterrupted monthly gains lasted only four months, between March and June 2017. The asset’s price history also indicates a tendency toward sudden, sharp increases during isolated periods, such as in November 2024 and January 2025, rather than sustained incremental growth. While a fixed 2% monthly growth rate would produce exceptional returns over time, XRP’s historical volatility and inconsistent growth patterns make such an outcome unlikely. Nevertheless, the projection demonstrates the long-term potential of sustained price appreciation, even under conservative growth assumptions.

XRP Takes Center Stage Again Ripple’s cross-border token once again made the headlines thanks to its significant price increase. It pumped by 12% on a 24-hour scale, hitting almost $3.40 (its highest point since the end of July). XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko The main reason behind the resurgence is the official conclusion of the legal tussle between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which began in December 2020. With that chapter now closed, many analysts believe XRP faces fewer obstacles on its path to reaching new peaks in the near future . X user Bark said “ the manipulation is over” and envisioned a price explosion to as high as $10. They also predicted that “this weekend will be historic.” JAVON MARKS was also bullish, albeit setting a more modest target. Next wave up into ~$4.80 could already be in-effect for $XRP ! https://t.co/noxq64p64U pic.twitter.com/krICGo7AH9 — JAVON MARKS (@JavonTM1) August 7, 2025 What’s Next for ADA? Cardano’s native cryptocurrency is also well in the green today (August 8), jumping by 8% to $0.80 (per CoinGecko’s data). ADA Price, Source: CoinGecko Earlier this week, the popular analyst Ali Martinez forecasted a potential price increase to an eight-month peak of $1.30. However, he believes ADA must first confirm a breakout above $0.84. CryptoBullet and JAVON MARKS were even more optimistic. The former expects ADA to rise to $1.60, while the latter predicts a possible surge to $2.90. What to Expect From BTC? The primary cryptocurrency also headed north, briefly surpassing $117,500 and later retracing to its current level of $116,500. Some key factors suggest BTC has yet to rally hard this month. For example, August has historically brought gains when it follows a halving year. Recall that the latest halving occurred in the spring of 2024 and slashed the miners’ rewards for adding new blocks in half. The analyst, using the X moniker CRYPTOWZRD, set $120,000 as the next key resistance target, following which “we should see a rapid rally” to $131,000.

Recent filings reveal that Harvard University, one of the globe’s most prestigious educational institutions, has made an astonishing Harvard investment of $120 million into BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF . This significant move, initially highlighted by Unfolded on X, marks a pivotal shift, especially considering Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas’s observation that endowments rarely allocate funds to exchange-traded funds. What Does This Harvard Investment Signify for Crypto? This substantial Harvard investment into a Bitcoin ETF is more than just a financial transaction; it sends a powerful signal. Historically, large university endowments like Harvard’s are known for their conservative and meticulously researched investment strategies. Their decision to allocate such a significant sum to a cryptocurrency-linked product underscores a growing confidence in the long-term viability and legitimacy of digital assets. It represents a strong vote of confidence from traditional finance. This move could encourage other major endowments and institutional investors to explore similar opportunities, driving further institutional adoption . It validates the structure and regulatory clarity offered by spot Bitcoin ETFs, making them more accessible to large-scale investors. Why Did Harvard Choose BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF? The choice of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is also noteworthy. BlackRock, a global asset management giant, brings immense credibility and a robust infrastructure to the cryptocurrency space. Their iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) offers institutional investors a regulated and straightforward way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. The benefits for an institution like Harvard are clear: Accessibility: ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, simplifying the investment process for large funds. Security: The ETF structure manages the complexities of custody and security, a major concern for large-scale digital asset holdings. Regulation: Being a regulated product, it aligns with the stringent compliance requirements of university endowments. This strategic choice by Harvard highlights the increasing appeal of regulated investment vehicles for traditional financial powerhouses looking to enter the crypto market . What Are the Broader Implications for the Crypto Market? Harvard’s significant entry into the Bitcoin ETF space has profound implications for the entire crypto market . It could act as a catalyst, potentially triggering a domino effect among other institutional investors who have been on the sidelines. When an institution with Harvard’s reputation makes such a move, it often sets a precedent. We might see: Increased capital inflows into other Bitcoin ETFs and potentially other digital asset products. Enhanced mainstream acceptance and reduced skepticism around cryptocurrencies. A potential shift in market dynamics as more traditional money enters the space. While the immediate impact on Bitcoin’s price is always a topic of discussion, the long-term effect of such high-profile institutional adoption is undeniably positive for the ecosystem’s maturity and stability. Are There Any Challenges or Considerations? Despite the overwhelmingly positive sentiment, it is important to acknowledge that the cryptocurrency landscape, even with regulated products like the BlackRock ETF , still presents unique considerations. Volatility remains a characteristic of the crypto market , and institutional investors must account for this in their long-term strategies. Furthermore, the regulatory environment continues to evolve. While spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a regulated pathway, the broader digital asset space is still navigating various legal and compliance frameworks globally. Harvard’s move signals confidence, but prudent investors will continue to monitor these developments closely. In conclusion, Harvard’s $120 million investment in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is an undeniable milestone. It solidifies the trend of institutional adoption and underscores the growing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. This unprecedented Harvard investment sets a powerful example, paving the way for more traditional capital to flow into the digital economy and reshape the future of finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Bitcoin ETF? A Bitcoin ETF, or Exchange-Traded Fund, is an investment vehicle that allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency. It trades on traditional stock exchanges, making it accessible through standard brokerage accounts. Q2: Why is Harvard’s investment in a Bitcoin ETF significant? Harvard’s $120 million investment is highly significant because university endowments are typically very conservative investors. Their decision signals strong confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class and could encourage other major institutional investors to follow suit, driving further institutional adoption. Q3: What is BlackRock’s role in this investment? Harvard invested in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). BlackRock is one of the world’s largest asset managers, and their involvement brings a high level of credibility, regulatory compliance, and robust infrastructure to the Bitcoin ETF, making it an attractive option for large institutions. Q4: How might this affect the broader crypto market? This major institutional investment could lead to increased capital inflows into the crypto market, enhance mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies, and potentially contribute to greater market stability and maturity over the long term. It validates the asset class for a wider range of investors. Q5: Are there risks associated with investing in Bitcoin ETFs? While Bitcoin ETFs offer regulated exposure, they are still subject to the volatility inherent in the cryptocurrency market. Investors should be aware of price fluctuations and the evolving regulatory landscape, even with the benefits of an ETF structure. Share This Milestone!

As traders scan the horizon for the Top Crypto Presale of 2025, they’re comparing every metric, feature, and community signal. The verdict? Both are powerful contenders, but only one can deliver the most profits this cycle. Pepe Dollar (PEPD): The Top Crypto Presale for Layer-2 DeFi and Meme Utility Pepe Dollar (PEPD) stands out not just as another meme coin, but as a complete payment ecosystem built on Ethereum Layer-2. The Top Crypto Presale is live now, with over 252 million PEPD tokens sold in Stage 1, more than 90% filled at just $0.004688 per PEPD (launch price $0.03695). Investors rushing to the Top Crypto Presale get access to features including QR-based payments, a no-code minting platform (pepedollar.fun), and an aggressive 29% Federal Burn mechanism designed to reward early holders. Pepe Dollar (PEPD’s) ecosystem is uniquely built for the meme economy: play-to-earn games, DeFi micro-loans, and credit scoring for users who stake and transact. Audited by Coinsult and verified for security, the Top Crypto Presale is attracting Ethereum whales and retail buyers alike—especially with a live 20% instant bonus using the code Pepe_Powell20 .

With more than $14.6 million raised and 9 presale stages sold out, LILPEPE is focused on creating the fastest, cheapest meme coin Layer-2. Its launchpad will mint the next wave of Ethereum meme tokens, with robust security and a major $777K giveaway for presale participants. LILPEPE is already audited, with a growing community and a strategy to dominate the meme coin sector’s next expansion to a $250 billion market cap. The roadmap is packed with utility: staking, NFT tools, and multiple Tier-1 exchange listings in the pipeline. Who Will Deliver More Profits in 2025? The answer may lie in timing and execution. Pepe Dollar’s Top Crypto Presale offers a built-in deflationary mechanism and a thriving DeFi ecosystem, making PEPD attractive to those looking for both short-term gains and long-term utility. With the presale almost sold out, and the Layer-2 Pay-Fi economy gaining traction, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is positioning itself as the must-have for meme coin whales and everyday investors seeking the Top Crypto Presale of the year. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has speed and hype on its side, but some utilities (like staking and NFT tools) are still in development. It’s built for scale, and the mega giveaway is drawing FOMO-driven buyers in droves. For pure upside, early LILPEPE buyers could see explosive returns—but long-term utility may favor PEPD if adoption outpaces competitors.

Both have the vision, tech, and community to make millionaires—but only those who act during the Top Crypto Presale will secure the biggest upside.

Market analysts are closely monitoring this zone, noting that SHIB’s ability to maintain support here could determine whether it embarks on a significant rally over the coming months. According to market analyst Crypto Nuclear, the price range between $0.00001090 and $0.00001190 is a critical demand area. This zone has been tested multiple times over the past three years and has consistently absorbed selling pressure. The analyst notes that the current retest could be decisive for SHIB’s trajectory in 2025. As of report time, SHIB is trading near $0.00001328, reflecting a 4.64% increase in the past 24 hours and a 7.77% gain over the past month. If buying momentum strengthens and the price remains above $0.00001190, the next resistance levels are projected at $0.00001580, $0.00001940, $0.00002400, and $0.00003338. For the longer term, Crypto Nuclear has identified $0.00007870 and $0.00008836 as major upside targets. Achieving these levels would represent gains of approximately 514% to 589% from current prices and would place SHIB near historical highs. However, the analyst stresses that such targets would require sustained demand and broader market support. Risk Factors and Downside Scenarios While the current structure suggests potential for a bullish breakout, analysts also caution about the possibility of a downward move. A decisive drop below $0.00001090 could indicate weakness in the current trend, potentially leading to declines toward $0.00000900, $0.00000700, or even $0.00000550. Crypto Nuclear also points out that the current pattern shows similarities to a Wyckoff-style spring, a setup that can precede a strong rally but is not guaranteed. This pattern involves a temporary break below support followed by a sharp recovery, but if the recovery fails, the risk of extended losses increases. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additional Analyst Perspectives Other analysts share varying levels of optimism. Javon Marks has identified a bullish divergence on SHIB’s two-day chart, projecting a potential move to $0.000032, about 156% higher than the confirmation level near $0.00001250. This price was last reached in March 2024. Jonathan Carter observes that SHIB is consolidating between $0.00001050 and $0.00001250, a range that has historically attracted strong buying interest. He describes this phase as accumulation, suggesting that holding above this zone could lead to a sustained upward move. Carter lists resistance points at $0.00001400, $0.00001750, $0.00002050, and $0.00002500. Separately, Jake Gagain projects that SHIB could reach $0.00007636 if its market capitalization climbs to $45 billion, representing a 516% rise from current levels and a 660% gain from June’s low of $0.00001004. Similarly, Hunters Company maintains a bullish stance, citing SHIB’s resilience at key support levels. The consensus among analysts is that SHIB’s position in this demand zone will be crucial in determining its next major price movement . A strong defense of support could open the path to multi-hundred-percent gains, while a breakdown may result in extended weakness.

Recently, Eric Trump, the second son of the U.S. president, shared his satisfaction regarding ETH shorts experiencing significant losses. This brief statement, reported by Watcher.Guru on X, highlights the often dramatic and unpredictable nature of the crypto market trends and the specific dynamics around short selling in the Ethereum ecosystem. It’s a reminder that every market move has winners and losers, and public figures sometimes weigh in on these outcomes. Understanding Short Selling and Its Impact on Ethereum Price What exactly does it mean for ETH shorts to “take a hit”? In simple terms, short selling is a trading strategy where an investor borrows an asset, sells it on the open market, and then buys it back later at a lower price to return it to the lender, profiting from the price drop. Traders engage in shorting when they anticipate a decline in the asset’s value. For Ethereum, a surge in its Ethereum price means that those who bet on its decline (the shorts) face losses, sometimes substantial ones. How Short Selling Works: Investors borrow an asset, sell it immediately, hoping to buy it back cheaper later to repay the loan and profit. The Risk: If the price rises instead of falls, the potential for losses can be unlimited, leading to margin calls. Market Impact: A “short squeeze” can occur when rising prices force short sellers to buy back, further driving up the price due to increased demand. Why Eric Trump’s Comment on ETH Shorts Matters Amidst Market Volatility Eric Trump’s public expression of pleasure regarding ETH shorts facing losses isn’t just a casual remark; it underscores the broader sentiment around certain market movements. While his exact reasons are not detailed, it implies a favorable view towards Ethereum’s upward trajectory or a general anti-bear stance. In a period characterized by significant market volatility , such comments from influential individuals can sometimes resonate with a segment of the audience, highlighting the emotional and psychological aspects of trading. The cryptocurrency space is known for its rapid price swings, making it a high-stakes environment for strategies like short selling . When the market moves against short positions, it often indicates underlying strength or positive sentiment for the asset, in this case, Ethereum, making it a challenging environment for bearish bets. Navigating Crypto Market Trends and Ethereum’s Trajectory The reaction to ETH shorts suffering losses is part of the larger narrative within the crypto market trends . Ethereum, as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, plays a pivotal role. Its ecosystem continues to evolve, with ongoing developments in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and scalability solutions. These advancements can contribute to a positive outlook for the Ethereum price , challenging bearish sentiments and often leading to painful outcomes for those betting against it. Understanding these broader trends is crucial for any participant in the crypto space. It’s not just about individual trades but also about recognizing the foundational shifts and community sentiment that drive the market, impacting long-term viability and short-term movements. What This Means for Investors and Future ETH Price Action For investors, the struggles of ETH shorts serve as a powerful reminder of the inherent risks in predicting market downturns, especially in a growth-oriented asset like Ethereum. While short selling can be a lucrative strategy, it demands precise timing and a deep understanding of market dynamics. When influential figures like Eric Trump publicly acknowledge the pain of short-sellers, it highlights a moment of triumph for the bulls and potentially signals broader confidence in Ethereum’s future. This situation reinforces the importance of: Thorough Research: Always understand the fundamentals of an asset before making investment decisions. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and use stop-loss orders for short positions. Long-Term Vision: Consider the long-term potential of projects like Ethereum rather than just short-term price fluctuations, especially given market volatility. The ongoing battle between bulls and bears continues to define the crypto landscape, and comments like Eric Trump’s add another layer to the public discourse surrounding digital assets. The crypto world remains a dynamic arena where market sentiment, technological advancements, and even public commentary can significantly influence outcomes. Eric Trump’s observation regarding ETH shorts facing losses underscores the high stakes and rapid shifts characteristic of this exciting space. As the Ethereum price continues its journey, understanding the various forces at play, from complex trading strategies like short selling to broader crypto market trends and moments of extreme market volatility , becomes paramount for anyone looking to navigate this digital frontier successfully. It’s a testament to the resilience of the market and the constant dance between optimism and caution. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are ETH shorts? ETH shorts refer to positions taken by traders who believe the price of Ethereum (ETH) will fall. They borrow ETH, sell it, and plan to buy it back at a lower price to profit. 2. Why did Eric Trump comment on ETH shorts? While his specific motivations aren’t detailed, Eric Trump’s comment expressed satisfaction that those betting against Ethereum (ETH shorts) were losing money, implying a positive sentiment towards Ethereum’s price performance. 3. What is a short squeeze in crypto? A short squeeze occurs when the price of a shorted asset rapidly increases, forcing short sellers to buy back the asset to cover their positions, which further drives up the price in a self-reinforcing cycle. 4. How does market volatility affect short selling? High market volatility significantly increases the risk for short sellers. Rapid, unpredictable price swings can quickly turn a profitable short position into a substantial loss, potentially leading to forced liquidations. 5. Is short selling risky for investors? Yes, short selling is considered a high-risk strategy. Unlike long positions where losses are limited to the initial investment, losses in short selling can theoretically be unlimited if the asset’s price continues to rise indefinitely.

With total market capitalization surging and on-chain activity heating up, investor sentiment is turning bullish once again. Amid this upswing, smart money is eyeing a new wave of altcoins with long-term growth potential – XRP, Cardano, and one emerging name gaining traction fast: МAGACOIN FINANCE. The renewed momentum follows the passage of the GENIUS Act in the U.S., marking the first comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins. Paired with a more cooperative stance from the SEC and record-breaking inflows into Ethereum ETFs, the market is entering what many see as a more mature, sustainable growth cycle. As institutional adoption deepens and traditional finance merges with crypto infrastructure, top altcoins are primed to benefit. XRP XRP is once again drawing attention as clarity around its legal status gives the token room to breathe. With Ripple’s ongoing expansion into cross-border settlements and partnerships with central banks, the coin is reclaiming its spot among high-utility assets. Analysts are watching closely for a potential retest of $3.2, especially if market conditions hold and demand for real-world tokenization continues to grow. MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming one of the most discussed altcoins of 2025. Following a strong presale phase and increased community engagement, the project’s new round has launched after the previous stage filled in record time. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its aggressive roadmap and ecosystem utility that appeals to both retail and whale investors. With whispers of a potential 42x return, early adopters are scrambling to secure their positions before listings begin on major exchanges. Cardano Cardano continues to push forward with its smart contract infrastructure and real-world use cases, particularly in the education and identity sectors. While it’s seen slower price movement compared to some competitors, ADA’s long-term potential remains intact. The launch of new dApps, partnerships with academic institutions, and its commitment to sustainability keep it on the radar of long-term investors. A clean break above the $0.80 level could signal a fresh leg higher. Conclusion The broader crypto recovery looks to be more than just a temporary bounce. With new regulatory frameworks, rising ETF inflows, and surging DeFi and AI innovation, the foundation appears stronger than in past cycles. XRP and Cardano continue to impress with their expanding ecosystems, while MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a major opportunity amid this next phase of crypto adoption.

Industry analysts are now considering how the publication of these agreements might influence the price of XRP. End of Legal Proceedings Ripple’s legal dispute with the SEC officially concluded after both parties agreed to withdraw their appeals , ending nearly five years of litigation. This outcome has removed a significant source of uncertainty for the company and the XRP market. With no ongoing court challenges, Ripple now has greater freedom to reveal details of its business activities that were previously kept confidential. The Scope of Ripple’s Confidential Agreements Between 2013 and 2020, Ripple entered into more than 1,700 non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) with a wide range of organizations, including global banks, payment providers, and technology companies. These agreements enabled Ripple to hold private discussions on integrating XRP into existing financial infrastructures while protecting proprietary and commercially sensitive information. The existence of these NDAs became public during the SEC case, where they were used to demonstrate that many XRP transfers took place under contractual arrangements for specific commercial purposes. Ripple argued that these transactions were not securities offerings, but rather operational uses of its digital asset. With legal restrictions now lifted, market observers believe Ripple could choose to reveal details about some of these agreements. Public confirmation of institutional adoption could be viewed as a significant milestone, potentially boosting confidence among both retail and institutional investors. To explore possible market outcomes, the AI model Grok from xAI provided a set of price projections based on the assumption that Ripple announces one or more of these agreements. At the time of the analysis, XRP was valued at $3.34. Price Scenarios from Grok’s Assessment Short term (1–3 months): $5 to $8, representing a 50%–140% increase from the reference price. This range assumes immediate investor interest and an increase in trading activity following the announcements. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Medium term (6–12 months): $8 to $15, contingent on ongoing positive sentiment, potential approval of XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and measurable institutional usage. Long term (by 2030): $20 to $50 , dependent on XRP’s widespread adoption for settlement, cross-border payments, and tokenized asset transactions. According to Grok, if XRP captures even a small share of the $700 billion monthly stablecoin market or the $18 trillion tokenized asset market projected by 2033, its market capitalization could reach multi-trillion-dollar levels, supporting the higher end of its forecast. These projections are hypothetical and assume several favorable developments, including regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions, broad institutional participation, and tangible transaction volumes generated through XRP’s use in financial systems. Without these conditions, price growth could be more limited. Ripple’s decision to disclose details of its 1,700 NDAs could become a pivotal moment for XRP’s market trajectory. While Grok’s projections outline optimistic scenarios, actual outcomes will depend on the scale of institutional engagement, the credibility of disclosed information, and broader market conditions.

According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Griffin’s hedge fund Citadel has acquired 3,824,329 shares of NioCorp Developments Ltd (NB), a company advancing critical minerals development in the United States. NioCorp’s flagship project in Nebraska aims to produce rare earth minerals like niobium, scandium and titanium. Citadel’s holdings of NB represent 5.4% of its total portfolio, and 5.2% of the total outstanding shares. NB, with a market cap of just $229 million, is trading at $3.16 after opening the year at $1.41 in January – a gain of 124% so far. Citadel’s positioning in the company appears to underscore a focus on the energy sector, given its recent win on Chevron’s $53 billion takeover of competitor Hess Corporation. Citadel Advisors, Adage Capital and HBK Investments were part of a group of investors betting on the acquisition as part of a merger arbitrage strategy, which involves betting on the outcome of a merger or acquisition, typically by taking long and/or short positions in the stocks of the companies involved. Citadel and HBK each had the equivalent of $1 billion in shares, according to the firms’ latest filings, says Bloomberg.

The stake, disclosed in a Friday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, represents roughly 1.9 million shares as of June 30, 2025. This position ranks as Harvard’s fifth-largest equity holding—behind Microsoft, Amazon, Booking Holdings, and Meta—and even surpasses its $102 million stake in the SPDR Gold Trust. According to the filing, Harvard is now the 29th-largest institutional holder of IBIT among about 1,300 investors. The investment comes from Harvard Management Company (HMC), which oversees the university’s $53.2 billion endowment, the largest among U.S. universities. It marks a notable shift toward cryptocurrency-linked assets for a fund traditionally focused on equities, bonds, and alternative investments such as real estate and private equity. Universities expand crypto exposure Harvard’s allocation follows a broader trend of prestigious universities entering the regulated crypto investment space. Brown University disclosed a $13 million IBIT stake during the same reporting period. Emory University took an earlier leap in 2024, acquiring 2.7 million Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust shares, valued at over $15 million. Due to volatility, custody challenges, and governance hurdles, most university endowments steered clear of direct crypto holdings for years. The emergence of spot Bitcoin ETFs has changed the equation. These funds are SEC-approved, exchange-traded, and professionally custodied, making them easier to integrate into large, compliance-heavy portfolios. Harvard’s move also reflects growing confidence in Bitcoin’s role as both a diversification tool and a growth asset. The timing comes after a strong start to 2025 for Bitcoin, with institutional inflows helping push prices higher. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust has seen explosive growth since its launch in January 2024 , when the SEC approved it alongside ten other spot Bitcoin ETFs. IBIT has since amassed over $86 billion in net assets, holding around 738,000 bitcoins—roughly 3.5% of the cryptocurrency’s total supply. The continuation of institutional adoption has been a domino effect on this growth. Hedge Funds, Pension Funds, and University Endowments use IBIT to own Bitcoin without incurring the operating complexities of owning it directly. Industry analysts, including those at State Street, expect North American crypto ETFs to be the third-largest this year behind equities and fixed income, eclipsing precious-metal ETFs. That IBIT is now one of the largest and certainly most-tracked by Wall Street algorithms, in Harvard’s endowment, speaks to how far Bitcoin has ventured from a fringe, speculative asset. It is not long before it takes its place alongside the likes of big tech in some of the world’s most conservative (and influential) portfolios. SEC rule changes boost market appeal While the SEC’s approval spot for Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 was a landmark, regulators are still adjusting to shape the market. Earlier this week, the SEC allowed 25000 options contracts per ETF. The addition of IBIT to the roster as such opens this new rule up for some more multi-directional trading and hedging strategies typically favored by institutional investors. Analysts believe the move will help channel further liquidity into Bitcoin ETFs, building on top of their obvious appeal. Harvard has already increased the amount of its endowment allocated to IBIT each year, and the change certainly strengthens. Harvard’s investment adds to the growing list of prominent institutions that believe bitcoin will play an essential long-term role in the world economy. What was once a speculative experiment is increasingly becoming a standard part of diversified, forward-looking portfolios—even for the world’s oldest and most established academic endowments.

Recently, this crucial indicator dipped slightly to 67, yet it comfortably remains within the ‘Greed’ zone. While this might seem positive, understanding what drives such shifts in crypto market sentiment is essential for any participant. This index provides a snapshot of the collective psychological state of the crypto market. It helps investors gauge whether the market is overly optimistic or pessimistic. Consequently, it can offer valuable insights into potential market movements, though it is not a direct trading signal. What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reveal? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by Alternative, is a widely referenced tool in the digital asset space. It ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 indicates ‘Extreme Greed’. Currently, the index stands at 67, a slight decrease from the previous day but still firmly in the ‘Greed’ territory. This suggests that despite a minor dip in enthusiasm, the prevailing investor sentiment remains positive, perhaps even bordering on overconfidence. When the index shows ‘Extreme Fear’, it often means investors are too worried, potentially presenting a buying opportunity. Conversely, ‘Extreme Greed’ can signal that the market is due for a correction, as assets might be overvalued. Therefore, understanding its implications is key. How is Crypto Market Sentiment Measured? The index is not based on a single factor but aggregates data from six different sources to provide a comprehensive view of crypto market sentiment . Each factor contributes a specific weight to the overall score: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with average values over 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often indicates fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This factor analyzes the current volume and market momentum, comparing it with the last 30 and 90-day averages. Strong, consistent buying volume typically suggests greed. Social Media (15%): The index scans various social media platforms for crypto-related hashtags and measures the speed and quantity of posts. High engagement can indicate a hyped market. Surveys (15%): These polls, though currently paused, gather direct feedback from investors on their market outlook. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This metric assesses Bitcoin dominance in the overall crypto market capitalization. An increasing dominance can signal fear, as investors might be moving from altcoins to Bitcoin, which is perceived as safer. Google Trends (10%): Analyzing search queries for crypto-related terms on Google provides insight into public interest and potential market excitement or panic. These diverse inputs allow the index to paint a nuanced picture of the emotional state driving the market, helping to explain periods of heightened market volatility . Navigating the Greed Zone: Implications for Investors A score of 67, while not ‘Extreme Greed’, still points to a strong level of optimism. This level of ‘Greed’ suggests that many investors are confident in continued price increases. However, it also serves as a subtle warning. Historically, periods of sustained ‘Greed’ can precede market pullbacks or corrections. When investor sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, there’s a risk of irrational exuberance leading to inflated asset prices. Therefore, it is wise to exercise caution and avoid impulsive decisions during such times. Consider this: if everyone is already optimistic and has bought in, who is left to buy and push prices higher? This is why a high ‘Greed’ score can sometimes indicate a local top or a period of consolidation. Monitoring Bitcoin dominance alongside the index can provide additional context, revealing whether funds are flowing into the broader altcoin market or consolidating in Bitcoin. Actionable Insights for Understanding Crypto Trends While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool, it should not be your sole guide for investment decisions. Instead, integrate it into a broader analytical framework: Complement with Research: Always combine sentiment analysis with fundamental and technical analysis of specific cryptocurrencies. Understand the Context: A high ‘Greed’ score doesn’t automatically mean a crash is imminent, but it does suggest increased risk. Likewise, ‘Fear’ can present opportunities. Monitor Key Metrics: Keep an eye on factors like Bitcoin dominance and overall market capitalization trends to get a complete picture. Manage Risk: During periods of high ‘Greed’ and potential market volatility , consider rebalancing your portfolio or taking profits to manage risk effectively. By using the index thoughtfully, you can gain a deeper understanding of market psychology and make more informed decisions. In conclusion, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains a powerful indicator of prevailing emotions in the crypto market. Its current standing at 67 in the ‘Greed’ zone highlights continued optimism, but also reminds us to approach the market with a balanced perspective. By understanding its components and implications, investors can better navigate the often-turbulent waters of cryptocurrency and make more strategic choices based on nuanced investor sentiment . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the primary purpose of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A1: The primary purpose is to measure the overall emotional state of the cryptocurrency market, indicating whether investors are feeling fearful or greedy. This helps gauge collective market sentiment. Q2: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? A2: The index is typically updated daily, providing a fresh snapshot of market sentiment based on the latest data points. Q3: Does a high ‘Greed’ score always mean the market will crash? A3: Not necessarily. A high ‘Greed’ score suggests that the market might be overheated or overvalued, increasing the risk of a correction, but it doesn’t guarantee an immediate crash. It serves as a caution rather than a definitive prediction. Q4: Why is Bitcoin dominance a factor in the index? A4: Bitcoin dominance is included because it can indicate investor behavior. When Bitcoin dominance rises, it often suggests investors are moving from riskier altcoins into Bitcoin, which is perceived as a safer haven during uncertain times, thus reflecting fear. Q5: Can I use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for trading signals? A5: The index is a sentiment indicator, not a direct trading signal. It should be used as a complementary tool alongside fundamental and technical analysis to make more informed investment decisions, rather than as a standalone guide for buying or selling.

While Solana (SOL) and PUMP continue to make headlines with technical momentum and trading volume, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is quietly attracting high-stakes whales who see in it something rare in crypto today: staying power. Pepe Dollar (PEPD) Official Presale Links : Pepe Dollar Website: https://pepedollar.io/ Pepe Dollar Telegram: https://t.me/pepedollarcommunity PEPD Coinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pepe-dollar PUMP Rises—But Volatility Looms Pump.fun (PUMP) recently flipped LetsBonk in daily meme coin launches and is holding steady above the 100-period EMA, showing strong near-term bullish signals. Despite being up over 36% in August, analysts warn of downside risk due to its extreme volatility. While breakout potential remains, PUMP’s rise is also a reminder of how fast meme coins can fall. In contrast, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) offers a slower, more calculated approach. The Top Crypto Presale isn’t trying to win with speed—it’s winning with structure. Backed by a detailed whitepaper, Ethereum Layer-2 deployment, and deflationary mechanics, PEPD is drawing attention from whales who want long-term exposure without sacrificing meme-driven upside. Why Solana Whales Are Buying PEPD Solana (SOL) whales are no strangers to risk—but they’re also pragmatic. With Pump.fun’s coins offering quick gains but little utility, more whales are allocating to Pepe Dollar (PEPD) to hedge against short-term volatility. Telegram and Discord trading channels show increasing wallet flows into Pepe Dollar (PEPD) presale wallets, with large buys signaling confidence in the token’s roadmap. What’s attracting them? Transparent staking mechanics, no private sale dilution, and a memecoin ecosystem built around parodying the U.S. dollar—with actual use cases. Top Crypto Presale Utility: Staking, Gaming, and Memes Unlike Pump.fun tokens that vanish in a few days, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is designed to evolve. The project will introduce meme-styled mobile games, Web3 meme-based staking rewards, and NFT integrations. The satire-driven narrative is reinforced by actual utility, giving PEPD real traction with degens and serious investors alike. This Best Crypto Presale doesn’t just rely on hype—it offers a framework. Token burns reduce supply. Staking rewards incentivize holding. Meme culture keeps the brand viral. It’s the trifecta that even PUMP and SOL-based launches struggle to achieve. PUMP & PEPD—Two Sides of the Meme Coin Market While Pump.fun (PUMP) brings the adrenaline, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) brings the stability. And together, they represent two ends of the meme coin spectrum: one chaotic, one calculated. With both gaining attention simultaneously, whales are wisely diversifying across the two—PUMP for immediate flips, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) for long-term plays. As PUMP breaks resistance and Pepe Dollar (PEPD) smashes through presale goals, the meme coin market is entering a new phase. It’s no longer about single-token dominance. It’s about ecosystems—and PEPD is building one brick by brick. Conclusion: PEPD Is the Top Crypto Presale to Watch As Pump.fun pushes into new trading zones, don’t miss what’s happening behind the scenes. Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is fast becoming the Top Crypto Presale in the eyes of seasoned traders. Its structure, satire, and staking model offer the kind of stability this chaotic market rarely delivers. Solana (SOL) and PUMP might own the spotlight—for now—but PEPD is quickly becoming the stage.

A recent update from CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index has sparked significant discussion, indicating a clear shift in the market dynamics. Currently, the Altcoin Season Index stands at 34 as of August 9th, a two-point drop from the previous day. This figure is a strong signal that the market is firmly entrenched in what we call Bitcoin Season , moving away from a period where altcoins might see explosive gains. For anyone tracking crypto market trends , this is a vital piece of information. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Reveal? The Altcoin Season Index , tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), is a simple yet powerful metric. It measures the percentage of the top 50 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) that have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. Here’s what the numbers typically signify: Above 75: Strong Altcoin Season. Below 25: Clear Bitcoin Season. Between 25 and 75: Mixed or undecided market. With the index currently at 34, it clearly indicates that Bitcoin has been the dominant performer. This doesn’t mean altcoins aren’t moving, but rather that Bitcoin is leading the charge and absorbing a larger share of market capitalization. Why Are We Experiencing Bitcoin Season Now? The current Bitcoin Season is often driven by several factors. When investors perceive increased uncertainty in the broader financial markets or even within the crypto space, they often flock to Bitcoin. It’s seen as a more stable, less volatile asset compared to many altcoins. This flight to quality increases Bitcoin’s dominance and its price performance relative to the rest of the cryptocurrency market . Historically, Bitcoin tends to lead bull runs, with altcoins catching up later. This period allows Bitcoin to solidify its position and often sees capital flow from smaller cap altcoins into BTC, or new capital entering the market flowing directly into Bitcoin. Observing these crypto market trends is essential for strategic planning. Navigating the Altcoin Market During This Period So, what does a strong Bitcoin Season mean for your altcoin holdings? It’s important not to panic, but rather to reassess your strategy. While some altcoins might still see individual pumps, the overall altcoin market may experience: Underperformance: Many altcoins will likely lag behind Bitcoin’s gains. Consolidation: Prices might stabilize or even dip as focus shifts. Increased Volatility: Smaller altcoins can be more susceptible to rapid price changes. This period can be an excellent time to evaluate your portfolio, perhaps trimming underperforming altcoins or accumulating strong projects at lower prices, anticipating the next altcoin resurgence. Actionable Insights for the Cryptocurrency Market For those navigating the current cryptocurrency market , here are some practical tips: Focus on Bitcoin: Consider increasing your Bitcoin allocation or dollar-cost averaging into BTC. Research Quality Altcoins: Identify projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases. These are more likely to perform well when the tide turns for the altcoin market . Manage Risk: Use stop-losses, avoid over-leveraging, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on the Altcoin Season Index and other key indicators to spot potential shifts. Understanding these dynamics helps you make informed decisions, regardless of whether it’s Bitcoin Season or Altcoin Season. Conclusion: Adapting to Market Rhythms The Altcoin Season Index at 34 clearly signals that the crypto world is currently in a Bitcoin Season . This natural rhythm of the cryptocurrency market highlights Bitcoin’s dominance and its role as a primary driver of overall market sentiment. While the altcoin market might be taking a backseat for now, savvy investors use this period to refine their strategies, focusing on long-term growth and robust projects. Staying informed and adaptable is key to thriving in the ever-evolving digital asset landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric from CoinMarketCap that tracks the percentage of the top 50 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) that have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. It helps indicate whether the market favors altcoins or Bitcoin. Q2: How does the Altcoin Season Index at 34 indicate Bitcoin Season? An index reading below 25 generally signifies a strong Bitcoin Season. While 34 is not below 25, it’s significantly lower than the 75+ needed for Altcoin Season, indicating that Bitcoin is currently outperforming most altcoins, thus suggesting a Bitcoin-dominant period. Q3: Does Bitcoin Season mean altcoins will not perform well at all? Not necessarily. While many altcoins may underperform Bitcoin during a Bitcoin Season, individual projects with strong fundamentals or specific catalysts can still see gains. However, the broader altcoin market trend will likely be less favorable compared to Bitcoin. Q4: How long does a Bitcoin Season typically last? The duration of a Bitcoin Season varies widely and depends on numerous factors, including macroeconomic conditions, Bitcoin’s halving cycles, institutional adoption, and overall market sentiment. There’s no fixed timeline, making continuous monitoring of crypto market trends essential. Q5: What should I do with my altcoins during Bitcoin Season? During Bitcoin Season, consider reviewing your altcoin portfolio. You might choose to rebalance towards Bitcoin, identify and accumulate strong altcoin projects at potentially lower prices, or simply hold your positions if you have a long-term conviction in them. Risk management is always paramount. Q6: Where can I track the Altcoin Season Index? You can track the Altcoin Season Index directly on CoinMarketCap’s website, which provides real-time updates and historical data on this crucial market indicator.

Following a wave of renewed accumulation, bullish sentiment, and heightened on-chain activity, the token is experiencing one of its strongest momentum surges of the year — and traders are now asking a familiar question: What’s the next crypto gem poised to explode? With XRP testing multi-month highs and community optimism surging, many investors are taking profits and rotating into early-stage opportunities with asymmetric upside potential. For August 2025, the market is zeroing in on a shortlist of breakout tokens — and among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE is making a strong case for attention. XRP momentum signals bullish continuation XRP’s renewed breakout has been fueled by a combination of legal clarity, global banking integrations, and rising demand for fast, cross-border settlement infrastructure. Whale wallets have been aggressively accumulating since mid-July, and XRP’s trading volume on major exchanges has spiked 43% in the past seven days. Technical analysts are now watching a critical breakout level around $0.85–$0.88, with the next resistance band sitting near $1.00. If volume continues to build, XRP could reclaim a psychological milestone not seen since early 2022 — a move that would further validate its comeback narrative in the broader altcoin cycle. But while XRP remains a powerful long-term play, many traders are now seeking earlier-stage, low-cap opportunities that haven’t yet rallied — and that’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE is starting to dominate discussion threads. MAGACOIN FINANCE: the meme coin with real infrastructure What began as a politically inspired meme coin has transformed into a community-backed protocol gaining serious traction in presale circles. MAGACOIN FINANCE is fully audited, earning trust from a strong investor community. These factors, combined with its consistent transparency, are drawing in a growing wave of savvy investors. Analysts tracking Telegram engagement and wallet flow trends have flagged MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top rotation candidate in August, especially as exchange listings draw near. Other contenders to watch While MAGACOIN FINANCE dominates the narrative, other tokens are also gaining traction. Projects like Qubetics, which focuses on AI and blockchain infrastructure, and Ravi, a zk-native SocialFi platform, are quietly building solid communities. Final thoughts: the XRP wave is spilling over XRP’s surge has re-energized crypto markets, and that enthusiasm is spilling into presales and small-cap ecosystems. MAGACOIN FINANCE, with its audit-backed design and rapidly expanding community, is emerging as one of the most credible breakout tokens of the month.

Pi Network and XRP are currently gaining attention with their bullish signs and fast-moving speculation. Meanwhile, Cold Wallet is taking a different route, focusing on working systems, steady rewards, and a new listing on CoinMarketCap (CMC) that brings transparency. Unlike Pi and XRP, it’s not running on headlines. The PI network price surge appears to come from expectations around possible listings, while the XRP price prediction is backed by technical signals and growing optimism. But when measured against Cold Wallet’s direct model built on rewards and real use, each option offers something different. Let’s look at the details to see which might fit a long-term crypto portfolio. PI Network Rises on Speculation, but Real Use Still Lags The PI network price surge is more than random movement. With trading volume climbing, the price of Pi has jumped by 1.5%, marking a 195% rise in recent sessions. Analysts link this move to possible Binance listing news, which often drives short-term excitement in the market. Still, some limits remain. Pi Network is not yet on top exchanges, and the open mainnet isn’t live. Most users are holding placeholder assets rather than tokens they can trade. That means the current PI network price surge may be more about short-term moves than long-term support. The project still needs real developments to offer lasting value. Pi may be a fit for traders who want quick plays. But those searching for the best crypto to buy right now may find more confidence in tokens that are already working, trading, and providing actual use cases. XRP Builds a Bullish Case, but Key Questions Stay XRP has made slow but steady progress. Market watchers point to a support level near $0.62 and a setup that could send it above $0.70 if current patterns hold. The XRP price prediction has gained a bullish tone thanks to stable volume and momentum in its RSI. Yet, XRP still faces larger issues. Ongoing legal uncertainty and less visible growth in its network make it harder to compare with other Layer 1 platforms. The XRP price prediction might hold up in the short term, but many still wonder if it can return to a leading position in the crypto space. So while traders may act on its current setup, long-term value is still unclear. When newer platforms like Cold Wallet give rewards for basic activity, it brings a different angle to the debate on the best crypto to buy right now. CoinMarketCap Listing Brings Cold Wallet’s Model Into Focus Cold Wallet is not built on trends or old names. It is a self-custody wallet created with one idea in mind: users should earn, not lose, when they take part in crypto. Now that Cold Wallet is listed on CoinMarketCap, it has public visibility and tracking that many new projects still lack. What makes Cold Wallet different is its reward feature. It is more than just a storage app. When users pay gas fees, make swaps, or move funds using Cold Wallet, they earn $CWT tokens. More activity and holding leads to more rewards. This changes the usual crypto approach. Instead of paying fees and losing value, users gain value by staying active. There is more. Cold Wallet is fully non-custodial. It does not allow central access or background control. People hold their own keys. The interface is also built for ease of use, helping both beginners and experienced users. With its CoinMarketCap listing, Cold Wallet now allows users to track prices and volume in real time. That kind of data is still not live for Pi Network. At the same time, XRP continues to search for new use cases. Cold Wallet already offers a reason for daily use. Right now, Cold Wallet’s native token $CWT is in stage 17 of its presale at a price of $0.00998. The total raised has crossed $5.8 million. For anyone comparing options and asking what’s the best crypto to buy right now, Cold Wallet stands out by offering usability, data access, and regular rewards. Evaluating Pi, XRP, and Cold Wallet From a Utility Standpoint The recent PI network price surge shows how rumors can drive short-term interest. But for long-term success, a project must be listed and fully active. Right now, Pi is still limited by the use of IOUs and an unfinished mainnet. XRP’s charts suggest a possible price rise, with recent volume giving hope to traders. Still, the lack of strong use cases remains a concern. Price movement without lasting value can fade fast. Cold Wallet offers a contrast. It is already active, listed, and giving users direct rewards. Compared to Pi and XRP, it is the only one showing real usage with working tools and open access. For those thinking about the best crypto to buy right now , Cold Wallet’s simple reward system and real-time tracking offer something more stable and useful than the others at this point.

They’re searching for stable payouts, clear dashboards, and simple commission models. Delayed payments and complicated tiered systems are no longer acceptable. This guide highlights the seven most affiliate-friendly crypto betting platforms that truly deliver. It focuses on payout speed, clarity of data, and commission consistency, features that directly impact revenue. Whether promoting through content, SEO, or social media, choosing the right crypto casino can mean steady passive income or constant frustration. Here’s who stands out, and who just blends in. 1. Spartans: Real-Time Crypto Payouts with Zero Guesswork Spartans ranks first for one reason: it simplifies affiliate earnings. Unlike many crypto casinos with layered commissions and slow approvals, Spartans runs a clean system that focuses on performance. Affiliates can pick from CPA, RevShare, or Hybrid models, with zero guesswork or delays. As soon as earnings hit, they’re available for instant crypto withdrawal. No waiting, no middle steps. Its real-time dashboard gives a live view of player activity, wagers, and commissions. No delays, no support tickets, and fully mobile-friendly. Spartans also boosts referral value with over 5,900 games, 43+ providers, and a unified wallet for casino and sportsbook users. Current promos like Lamborghini giveaways and crypto deposit bonuses increase user sign-ups, improving affiliate returns. For affiliates needing instant payouts, reliable tracking, and total transparency, Spartans remains the strongest choice in 2025. 2. Stake.com: Big Brand Recognition with Tiered Commission Limits Stake.com continues to attract affiliates with its global name, multi-crypto support, and huge daily traffic. Its affiliate backend is sleek and offers multiple payout structures. The catch is its tiered system. Commissions rely not just on referral count, but on reaching set thresholds. Smaller affiliates may find earnings slow to accumulate, and initial approval or payouts can take time. This model suits high-volume promoters but may deter smaller or newer affiliates looking for quick returns. While the brand is strong, the system favors scale over simplicity. 3. BC.Game: Flexible Affiliate Deals, but Weak on Reporting BC.Game stands out for its gamified casino interface and broad crypto compatibility. Affiliates can choose between CPA and RevShare, and there are bonus features through internal promo tools. The drawback? Tracking and reporting tools aren’t as precise. Some affiliates mention delayed data updates or weak support channels. It works best for those already involved in the BC.Game network or those willing to monitor stats manually. While flexible, it demands more active oversight than competitors like Spartans. 4. Roobet: Solid Brand, Slower Affiliate Payment Cycles Roobet is known for its vibrant brand and engaging live content. Its affiliate program offers scalable revenue share models, increasing as referred users engage more. However, the platform doesn’t offer real-time payouts. Commissions follow a set payment cycle, and some affiliates may need to request payments manually. For those willing to wait, Roobet still has potential. But for affiliates looking for immediate earnings and real-time reporting, it lacks the speed and automation seen in other platforms. 5. Bet365: Reliable Legacy Platform with Limited Crypto Reach Bet365 brings strong global reputation and competitive earnings in fiat markets. Affiliates promoting to traditional sports betting audiences will find solid traction here. Still, crypto support is minimal. Payouts are processed through banks, and there’s limited blockchain integration. It’s a dependable option for fiat affiliates but may feel outdated to those building in crypto-centric spaces. The trust factor is there—just not the technical flexibility. 6. Betano: Strong Regional Presence, Basic Affiliate Tools Betano performs well in regulated European markets and pays affiliates on time. The system is functional and straightforward but lacks innovation. Its tools are basic, with minimal customization or advanced tracking. Crypto payouts aren’t a strong focus, and the setup may feel limiting to affiliates outside its regional core. While it remains a solid choice for traditional markets, Betano doesn’t offer much for crypto-native or high-volume affiliates looking for growth tools. 7. Gamdom: Streamer Appeal, but Inconsistent Affiliate Tracking Gamdom appeals to younger users and Twitch viewers with its slick interface and crypto-friendly games. Its affiliate system leans heavily on code-based rewards and community interaction. It’s less conventional, focused more on social reach than raw numbers. Reports of inconsistent tracking and limited support access create friction, though. Affiliates with a Twitch or gaming-focused audience could see results here, but should be ready to monitor performance closely. It’s niche and hands-on. Why Spartans Sets the 2025 Affiliate Standard Crypto affiliate programs vary wildly in how they treat promoters. While some offer sleek designs or big names, only a few deliver on fast payouts and clear data. Spartans leads in 2025 with its instant earnings, transparent deals, and detailed dashboards. Other platforms like Stake.com or Roobet offer reach but come with extra hurdles. Affiliates serious about growing their crypto revenue should align with platforms that offer full control, fair payouts, and real-time insights. For that, Spartans stands out as the smartest partner this year.

Avax appears to be losing speed as it approaches key resistance near $30, while Tron has filed a $1 billion shelf registration, reflecting an ambitious long-term strategy for TRX. In contrast, BlockDAG (BDAG) is already executing. With $365.5 million raised and a 10 BTC Auction now live, its momentum stands out in a crowded market. Anyone still wondering which crypto will explode next is paying attention to these developments. Avax (AVAX) Price Analysis: Rally Slows as Key Resistance Approaches The latest Avax (AVAX) price analysis shows an 8% climb to $27, with the rally losing steam near major resistance. Trading volume crossed the $1 billion mark, indicating strong interest but also signaling that buyers may be hesitating. While recent upgrades and partnerships have helped Avalanche gain traction, key indicators now suggest a pullback may be forming. Short-term data shows weakening momentum. The candles are compressing, and volume deltas are dropping. The current price pattern is forming a rising wedge, which typically signals reversal risk. If buying pressure fades, Avax could retrace toward $16.50. To continue higher, bulls need to step in decisively. Tron (TRX) Future Plans Include $1B SEC Registration and Reserve Expansion Tron (TRX) future plans took shape with a $1 billion shelf registration filed with the U.S. SEC. This move doesn’t guarantee immediate capital raising, but it gives Tron the option to issue securities as needed, based on market timing. A key component of this strategy is Tron’s expansion of its Treasury Reserve Policy, which already holds 365 million TRX. The firm treats TRX as a long-term asset with multiple use cases, such as staking and yield-generating mechanisms. This aligns with Tron’s existing business, which includes licensing revenue from branded physical goods across the entertainment sector. The filing signals intent, not just compliance. It reflects a broader goal to maintain flexibility and financial leverage in changing conditions. BlockDAG’s 10 BTC Auction Draws Buyers as $365.5M Presale Accelerates While other projects are building for the future, BlockDAG is capitalizing on the present. The newly launched 10 BTC Auction rewards all BDAG coin purchases made before the August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH release , based on total spending. There are no random winners, allocation is proportional. Buyers who contribute more receive a bigger portion of the Bitcoin pool. Results will be announced on August 15, ensuring a transparent process. The auction incentivizes real support, making participation more meaningful than standard presale entry. Meanwhile, BlockDAG’s presale is one of the biggest in 2025 so far. With $365.5 million raised and over 24.7 billion coins sold, the project has moved through 29 batches, climbing from $0.001 to $0.0276. Yet, a temporary $0.0016 rate is still available, offering a rare discount before pricing increases post-launch. Even ahead of the launch, BDAG buyers are engaging with its platform. The live dashboard replicates trading conditions, with buy, sell, charting, and order book tools. This helps users test market functionality and builds familiarity before BDAG hits public exchanges. These developments have led some analysts to predict a future price target as high as $5, driving attention from anyone considering which crypto will explode next. Concluding Thoughts The current Avax (AVAX) price analysis suggests a potential cool-off as it nears technical resistance, while Tron (TRX) future plans reveal a thoughtful long-term strategy with flexible capital deployment. Both are important moves, but neither offers the immediate market presence BlockDAG currently enjoys. With its limited-time $0.0016 entry price, live trading tools, confirmed auction rewards, and more than $365.5 million raised, BlockDAG is already achieving milestones most projects aim for post-launch. For traders and buyers evaluating which crypto will explode , BlockDAG’s momentum, pricing, and infrastructure offer a strong case for near-term and long-term upside.

Nasdaq-listed social media marketing company Thumzup Media Corporation (TZUP) recently announced a pivotal strategic move: a new share offering designed to fund ambitious Thumzup crypto investment initiatives. This announcement, detailed in a press release via PR Newswire, signals a growing trend of established companies exploring the vast opportunities within the cryptocurrency space. Why is Thumzup Venturing into Cryptocurrency Investments? Thumzup’s decision to launch a share offering to back its foray into digital assets is a clear indicator of its long-term vision. This funding mechanism allows the company to raise capital by selling new shares to investors, providing the necessary liquidity for its new ventures without solely relying on existing cash flow. For a Nasdaq-listed company like Thumzup, such a move reflects a strategic pivot, aiming to diversify its revenue streams and potentially capitalize on the dynamic growth of the crypto market. Strategic Diversification: Expanding beyond traditional social media marketing. Capitalizing on Growth: Tapping into the high-growth potential of digital assets. Innovation Alignment: Positioning the company at the forefront of emerging technologies. Unpacking Thumzup’s Digital Asset Strategy: Crypto and Mining The press release specifies two primary areas for this significant Thumzup crypto investment : direct cryptocurrency investments and the acquisition of crypto mining equipment . This dual approach suggests a comprehensive strategy to engage with the digital asset ecosystem. Direct cryptocurrency investments involve purchasing various digital currencies, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, with the expectation that their value will appreciate over time. This can offer a pathway to substantial returns, though it also comes with inherent market volatility. Investing in crypto mining equipment , on the other hand, represents a more operational approach. Mining involves using specialized computers to solve complex computational problems, which validates transactions on a blockchain and, in return, rewards miners with new cryptocurrency. This can provide a consistent stream of digital assets, but it requires significant upfront capital for hardware and ongoing operational costs like electricity. What Are the Potential Benefits of This Bold Move? Thumzup’s entry into the crypto world via a share offering could unlock several advantages. Firstly, it offers a pathway to potentially significant financial returns if the value of its cryptocurrency investments appreciates. Secondly, owning and operating crypto mining equipment could provide a steady, self-sustaining source of digital assets, reducing reliance on market purchases. Furthermore, this strategic shift could enhance Thumzup’s brand image as an innovative, forward-thinking company willing to embrace new technologies. For investors, this could represent an opportunity to gain exposure to the crypto market through a publicly traded, Nasdaq-listed company , potentially offering a more regulated and traditional investment vehicle compared to direct crypto ownership. This move might attract a new segment of investors interested in both traditional equities and the digital asset space. Are There Challenges and Risks for a Nasdaq-listed Company Entering Crypto? While the opportunities are compelling, Thumzup’s venture into cryptocurrency investments and mining is not without its challenges. The crypto market is notoriously volatile, subject to rapid price swings driven by regulatory news, technological developments, and broader economic sentiment. Such volatility could impact the value of Thumzup’s digital asset holdings and, consequently, its financial performance. Moreover, operating crypto mining equipment involves significant energy consumption and maintenance, alongside the need to navigate evolving regulatory landscapes concerning digital assets. Companies entering this space must also consider the technical expertise required and the security implications of holding large amounts of cryptocurrency. Thumzup will need to carefully manage these risks, ensuring robust security protocols, clear accounting practices for digital assets, and adherence to all relevant financial regulations. The success of this initiative will largely depend on their ability to navigate these complexities effectively. The Broader Trend: Traditional Companies Embracing Digital Assets Thumzup’s announcement is part of a broader trend where traditional companies, particularly Nasdaq-listed company entities, are increasingly exploring or integrating digital assets into their operations. From major tech firms holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets to payment processors adopting crypto for transactions, the digital asset ecosystem is steadily gaining mainstream acceptance. This growing institutional interest lends further credibility to the space and suggests a long-term shift in corporate investment strategies. Thumzup’s unique position as a social media marketing company venturing into direct crypto and mining investments highlights the diverse applications and opportunities that businesses are identifying within this innovative sector. It underscores the belief that digital assets are not just a passing fad but a foundational element of the future economy. In conclusion, Thumzup Media Corporation’s strategic share offering to fund substantial Thumzup crypto investment and crypto mining equipment purchases marks a significant step for the Nasdaq-listed company . This bold move positions Thumzup at the forefront of integrating traditional business models with the burgeoning digital asset economy. While promising potential rewards, it also brings inherent challenges that will require careful navigation. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, Thumzup’s journey will be one to watch, potentially paving the way for more companies to embrace the future of finance.

He claimed it was an advanced model – smarter, faster, and capable of thinking at a “PhD level.” The company positioned that launch as a major step forward for ChatGPT — one meant to lead to intelligence improvements in coding, reasoning, and accuracy. But early reactions paint a muddier picture . Developers praised the model for understanding complex prompts and outputting well-structured code. Early tester Simon Willison described GPT-5 as “competent” and “occasionally impressive”, but not a huge leap from GPT-4. Others were less impressed. Several posts on social media quickly turned to complaints about numerous factual errors, weak math skills, and — in a few cases — even basic spelling mistakes. Noah Giansiracusa, a math professor at Bentley University, called the release “underwhelming,” noting that the updates in question felt “more marginal than I would’ve hoped.” Part of the confusion was due to the architecture of the model. GPT-5 would include an ‘autoswitcher’ for the various model sizes , depending on its task. This saves processing and means you are not always touching the full GPT-5, which back-doored many people. Upon answering a question incorrectly with the system, the agent it was working with instructed it to “think harder” about how many “b” letters are in blueberry. After that feedback, it got the answer right when queried. Users push back—and OpenAI responds The frustration could spill onto Reddit and X by Friday. And while some users hated the fact that they wouldn’t know who or even which model the text came from, many felt like hell was just an inference, and GPT5 replaced old favorites they trusted. A few said the quality has been affected, writing is not as good as GPT-4.5 , which you agreed should be, and some creative and technical things felt worse. This chat led the CEO of OpenAI to participate in a Reddit “Ask Me Anything” that would address the backlash. He said a bug in the autoswitcher meant GPT-5 ran below its full potential on day one. He promised to be more transparent in future model transitions: “from today on, GPT-5 should look increasingly smarter. OpenAI also promised to redeploy earlier models such as GPT-4o for those who expressed a preference, an effort to appease the loudest critics. That it needed to act this quickly highlights just how big the stakes were. Today, OpenAI is in a breakneck race with competitors such as Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and even Elon Musk’s xAI. With all this competition, a little slip-up, and soon your competitor is taking a step ahead of you. Competition intensifies in the AI race Even with such differences, the reception to GPT-5 was lukewarm, but that did not stop it from being funneled up to the top spot on LMArena, a user-driven leaderboard for training models. While it wasn’t what we would consider today as programmable, it was extremely fast and expressive, supporting large, complex queries. However, other benchmarks showed a different, more challenging problem landscape. Grok 4 from Musk’s xAI scored so high on ARC-AGI-2 (a set of tests for advanced reasoning) that it presented a significant challenge to OpenAI’s supremacy. Some industry analysts speculate it will be at least a day before the effects of GPT-5 are fully understood, similar to previous breakthroughs by the firm, such as GPT-3. GPT-5 and GPT-4 received significant backlash before they saw improvements in updates and other use cases. The model has the potential to succeed (or fail) depending on how useful it is for people’s everyday workflow, and there are nearly 700 million weekly ChatGPT users around the globe. In the words of Wharton professor Ethan Mollick: “GPT-5 just does stuff, sometimes amazing things, sometimes puzzling things, entirely on its own. That is what renders it so intriguing. It’s still a technocratic, slightly creepy approach to calling things like this part of the public health sphere “interesting” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

This prominent Bitcoin mining company recently announced a substantial drop in its Core Scientific mining revenue for the second quarter, signaling a challenging period for the sector. What led to this significant decline, and what does it mean for the future of this industry giant? Understanding the Core Scientific Mining Revenue Plunge Core Scientific, a major player in the Bitcoin mining company landscape, reported a striking 62% decline in its Core Scientific mining revenue for the second quarter. Their earnings reached $62.4 million, a sharp contrast to previous periods. This figure highlights the severe crypto mining challenges faced by the company during this timeframe. Key figures: $62.4 million in Q2 mining revenue. Percentage drop: A significant 62% decline quarter-over-quarter, as detailed in a Business Wire press release. This substantial reduction reflects broader market pressures and operational hurdles impacting the profitability of large-scale mining operations. Indeed, many companies in the sector are grappling with similar pressures, making Core Scientific’s situation a bellwether for the wider industry. Navigating Core Scientific’s Share Sale Delay: What’s Next for the CoreWeave Deal? Adding another layer to their recent Core Scientific Q2 financial results , Core Scientific also postponed a planned Core Scientific share sale to GPU cloud provider CoreWeave. This transaction, initially anticipated to provide much-needed capital, now requires shareholder approval. The company stated this approval is a necessary step before proceeding. Transaction: Planned sale of shares to CoreWeave, a strategic move to raise funds. Reason for delay: The necessity of obtaining formal shareholder approval. Implication: This pause could affect the company’s immediate financial strategies and liquidity. The need for shareholder endorsement indicates a critical point for the company, as it seeks to navigate its financial landscape amidst current crypto mining challenges and secure its future trajectory. Broader Crypto Mining Challenges and Market Dynamics Why are Bitcoin mining company operations like Core Scientific experiencing such a downturn? Several factors contribute to the challenging environment for crypto miners globally. The price volatility of Bitcoin itself plays a crucial role; lower Bitcoin prices directly impact revenue generated from mining, reducing the value of newly minted coins. Furthermore, increasing network difficulty means miners need more computational power to earn the same amount of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin price fluctuations: Direct impact on mining profitability. Network difficulty increase: Requires more powerful and costly equipment. Volatile energy costs: A significant and unpredictable operational expense. These external pressures create a tough operational climate, making consistent profitability a considerable challenge for companies relying on mining operations, directly influencing their Core Scientific Q2 financial results . What Does This Mean for Core Scientific’s Future? The recent Core Scientific Q2 financial results and the postponed Core Scientific share sale underscore a period of significant adjustment for the company. Moving forward, Core Scientific will likely focus on optimizing its operations, reducing energy consumption, and exploring alternative strategies to bolster its financial position. This might include exploring different revenue streams or divesting non-core assets. Operational efficiency: A key focus to reduce costs and improve output. Strategic partnerships: Exploring new collaborations or investments beyond the CoreWeave deal. Shareholder engagement: Crucial for the CoreWeave deal and for maintaining investor confidence. Their ability to adapt to ongoing market shifts and secure necessary approvals will be vital for their long-term stability and growth within the competitive Bitcoin mining company landscape. The decisions made in the coming months will undoubtedly shape their path. Conclusion: Navigating a Turbulent Market Core Scientific’s Q2 financial results paint a clear picture of the hurdles facing large-scale Bitcoin mining operations today. The significant drop in Core Scientific mining revenue , coupled with the delayed Core Scientific share sale , highlights the volatile nature of the crypto industry. As the company navigates these complex waters, its strategic decisions and adaptability will be paramount to overcoming current crypto mining challenges and charting a stable course for the future. The eyes of the industry remain fixed on how this Bitcoin mining company will respond to these formidable obstacles.

Experts are Shifting Focus to This New Utility Token,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cp_aggregates/is-1-dogecoin-doge-realistic-in-2025-experts-are-shifting-focus-to-this-new-utility-token/,"As the crypto market braces for another volatile chapter in 2025, Dogecoin (DOGE) finds itself once again in the spotlight, with speculators wondering if it can finally hit $1. While opinions remain split, a new coin has quietly been reshaping the conversation. Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising utility-driven token that’s gaining traction among analysts and retail investors alike. Priced at $0.035, the new DeFi project has managed to attract attention. Investors who enter at phase 6 presale of MUTM will obtain a 300-400% return on investment when the project launches. Mutuum Finance has hit over $14.1 million and over 14,900 investors. As the broader market recalibrates, the narrative seems to be shifting from Dogecoin to Mutuum Finance. Dogecoin (DOGE) Nearing $0.20 as Focus Shifts to Utility-Driven DeFi Dogecoin is currently trading around $0.199 USD, down approximately 5% from yesterday’s $0.2105, having pulled back from July highs above $0.27. While DOGE remains a top-ten coin by market cap, with community hype and occasional social media surges, its momentum is cooling amid declining volume and mixed technical indicators. As investor attention increasingly gravitates toward utility-focused decentralized finance platforms, emerging projects like Mutuum Finance are starting to capture notice for their real-world applications and next‑gen lending narrative. Mutuum Finance Launches Token Presale Round 6 Mutuum Finance has launched Round 6 of its presale with tokens trading at $0.035, a 16.17% increase from the last round. The next price pump will drive the token up another 14.29% to $0.04.

Peer-to-Contract involves self-executing smart contracts that carry out the lending automatically without human intervention whatsoever. They already have been programmed to operate on dynamic rates in the market with an unspecified rate of interest based on the current demand and supply of an in-real-time interest. Peer-to-Peer model reduces intermediaries and allows market to directly communicate with lenders and borrowers.

These tokens are now jointly worth 47% more at a value of $255 billion since Donald Trump was declared the victor in the 2024 U.S. presidential election last November. Analysts linked the jump to investor excitement, greater regulatory clarity, and new corporate use cases. Stablecoins are finally delivering on their long-touted promise : offering a faster, simpler, and cheaper alternative to outdated payment systems. This shift is especially transformative for countries sidelined by major banks and payment networks, where transfers that once took days can now be completed in minutes—unlocking fresh opportunities for both consumers and businesses. Despite the hype, stablecoins have not solved the foreign exchange (FX) costs that have plagued cross-border payments for years. Even converting one fiat currency into another—for example, euros to Hong Kong dollars—is still accompanied by spreads, conversion fees, middleman fees, and slippage. These costs also hold for crypto-based transfers, particularly during the on- and off-ramp when monies are transitioning between blockchain and traditional bank accounts. Mike Robertson, the CEO of FX infrastructure provider AbbeyCross, said the crypto industry often assumes technology can solve all problems, which he described as a naive view when it comes to foreign exchange. He noted that each currency operates under different dynamics and pointed out that if money is being made in a particular area, its value remains. Robertson added that most banks and payment providers earn revenue from FX rather than transaction fees. That fact continues to dampen one of the main selling points for stablecoins: they can offer genuine, cheap cross-border transactions. Startups target ‘exotic’ routes London-based payments startup BVNK is focusing on often underserved channels, such as transfers from Sri Lanka to Cambodia. Sagar Sarbhai, the firm’s APAC managing director, explained that such routes typically require several intermediaries, making them expensive and slow. He said stablecoins simplify the process, noting that while they are not cheap, they are faster and more capital-efficient. BVNK currently processes around $15 billion annually. Other companies, such as Thunes in Singapore and Aquanow in Canada, are working to link blockchain trades with “last mile” provision into local currencies and wallets by partnering with stablecoin issuers or large corporates. Regulation spurs institutional growth The question is whether the industry is moving toward a future shaped by the GENIUS Act, signed into U.S. law on July 18, 2025. Circle’s Secure team, the company behind the USDC21 proposal to regulate stablecoins, is closely watching developments. This week, new legislation offering federal assurance on stablecoins was introduced in both the House and Senate. The proposal requires that stablecoins be fully backed 1:1 with high-quality assets, undergo regular audits, and maintain consistent transparency. Banks have responded quickly. In the short term, Bank of America projects that these rules could add anywhere from $25 billion to $75 billion in stablecoin supply. The payments behemoth Visa is looking at “stablecoin sandwiches”—tokens between two fiat currencies to avoid networks like SWIFT and settle in minutes. The platform Visa launched in October 2024, allowing banks to generate, redeem, mint, and burn fiat-backed tokens (including stablecoins). Companies are beginning to move as well. Ripple buys Stablecoin payment platform Rail for $200 million, which adds to the cross-border ecosystem. Thunes, based in Singapore and raising $150 million in April, intends to become more deeply integrated with stablecoin networks. Industry leaders predict NFT usage will surge as regulation, infrastructure, and institutional participation advance toward mainstream adoption. BVNK’s Sagar Sarbhai said hockey-stick growth is only beginning, noting that the foundation took five years to build but could expand dramatically within the next 12 months.

Every time a wallet is used, coins swapped, or funds bridged, value disappears in fees. These costs are so common that many accept them as a necessary evil. Cold Wallet is changing this story by giving back fees in the form of its own coin, Cold Wallet (CWT) , attracting serious attention from the market. Having raised more than $5.78 million, Cold Wallet’s CWT coin is currently priced at $0.00998 in Stage 17. This presale phase is turning the usual wallet model upside down. Instead of users losing money to gas and transaction costs, Cold Wallet rewards users instantly with CWT coins for each action. This cashback system is driving a rapid rise in demand because it solves one of crypto’s biggest pain points. Crypto Fees Take Value Cold Wallet Gives It Back With 100% Gas Refunds Most wallets quietly take fees when sending coins, swapping, or bridging. Cold Wallet reverses this by rewarding users with CWT cashback for every transaction. The more CWT held, the bigger the rewards. Top-tier users receive a full 100% refund on gas fees and 50% cashback on swaps and ramping activities, all paid automatically. No need for staking, locking funds, or managing complicated DeFi contracts. Users simply hold CWT in their wallet and earn rewards in real time based on their tier level. This approach changes wallets from passive holders into active money-making tools, gaining strong interest from the crypto community. Cold Wallet offers four reward levels: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Diamond, that grow with the amount of CWT held. The system is straightforward, transparent, and designed to last. A dedicated reward pool and a halving schedule help control the number of new coins released over time. The presale has 150 stages, starting at $0.007. Now at Stage 17, the price is $0.00998 with an expected launch price of $0.3517. This means buyers now could see a gain of about 3,700% when CWT hits the market. A $1,000 purchase today buys roughly 108,225 CWT. At the launch price, this would be worth more than $38,000 before any future growth. If market demand pushes the price to $5 or even $10, that $1,000 could be worth hundreds of thousands. Early buyers know time is critical. Stage 16 sold out quickly and Stage 17 is advancing fast. Each stage makes the price higher and reduces the number of coins available per purchase. Waiting means paying more and earning less later. Referral Rewards Add 15% Bonuses Growing User Base To 2 Million Cold Wallet’s ecosystem is not only about cashback but also about expansion. A referral program offers real USDT rewards now and CWT bonuses during the presale: 10% for referrers and 5% for referees. These rewards come from a special referral pool to support coin accumulation and boost reward levels. This network is growing fast. Cold Wallet acquired Plus Wallet for $270 million, bringing over 2 million active users into its system before CWT even lists. This large user base increases transaction volume, making rewards bigger for early participants. The referral effect is strong and visible. Buyers are not just getting a coin but joining a system where every action pays back and each referral adds extra benefits. Wrap Up! Cold Wallet addresses a real challenge in crypto by turning fees into rewards. Instead of draining value, it builds it. With $5.78 million raised, 2 million users active, and a working product delivering cashback, this is more than speculation, it is a functioning platform. At the current price of $0.00998, buyers can access both high returns and instant utility. As stages finish and coin supply decreases, the chance to join shifts. Entry now offers cashback rewards plus capital gain potential, rare in the crypto world. Cold Wallet is advancing quickly.

This article begins with BlockDAG, which is currently offering a special $0.0016 price during its GLOBAL LAUNCH release, along with live trading tools and Bitcoin rewards that are gaining attention. Then, it covers SEI, Polkadot, and Dogecoin ,each unique in its approach. From fast, trading-friendly blockchains to popular meme coins, these cryptos are poised to make an impact when the market moves upward again. Readers will find up-to-date prices, key features, and reasons why these four deserve a close look before the next surge. These top cryptos to watch offer a balanced mix of innovation and momentum to prepare for 2025’s market shift. 1. BlockDAG: Presale Innovation With Real-Time Tools and Bitcoin BlockDAG stands out among the top cryptos to watch for the next bull run by offering a presale experience that combines deep discounts with practical, interactive features. Until August 11, BlockDAG is selling BDAG at a special price of $0.0016 as part of its GLOBAL LAUNCH release. After this period, the price will return to batch pricing starting at $0.0276. The project has already raised $365 million, with over 24.8 billion coins sold and a target cap of $600 million if all batches are completed. A unique aspect of BlockDAG is its Dashboard V4 interface. This is a live trading simulator that mirrors real exchange actions, providing users with real-time BDAG/USD charts and a working order book. Buyers can place buy and sell orders that instantly update their wallet balances, even before the official listing. This hands-on system is designed to help both newcomers and experienced traders practice strategies in a risk-free environment. Additionally, BlockDAG offers a 10 BTC auction, worth around $1.14 million, which rewards participants based on how much BDAG they purchase before August 11. This Bitcoin reward is an immediate benefit, not just a promise of future value. The presale has already produced a 2,660% return on asset for those who bought in Batch 1 compared to the Batch 29 price. If buying now at $0.0016 during the GLOBAL LAUNCH release, returns could reach 3,025% when compared to the original $0.05 launch price. This combination of early discounts, advanced tools, and Bitcoin rewards makes BlockDAG a standout option in the search for the best crypto for the next bullrun. 2. SEI: A Layer-1 Chain Built for High-Speed Trading SEI is trading at around $0.28, showing a slight dip of 3–6% in recent 24 hours, with a market cap near $1.65 billion and daily volume exceeding $200 million. It is designed as a high-performance Layer-1 blockchain optimized for decentralized exchanges and fast order execution. Its main appeal lies in supporting heavy trading volume while keeping fees low. Growing adoption is evident with more than 600,000 active wallets, showing steady use even during market pauses. SEI focuses on infrastructure and real-world trading needs, setting it apart from many broader blockchain projects. This specialization makes SEI one of the top cryptos to watch as the market gears up for the next major rally, especially for those looking beyond mainstream chains. 3. Polkadot: Connecting Chains For Scalable Blockchain Solutions Polkadot (DOT) is currently trading around $3.60, with active daily volume between $220 million and $230 million and a market cap near $5.5 billion. It is well-known for enabling secure cross-chain communication by connecting multiple independent chains, called parachains, to its main relay chain secured by nominated proof-of-stake. As demand grows for scalable blockchain solutions and cross-chain dApps, Polkadot’s role as a foundational infrastructure platform strengthens. This makes DOT one of the top cryptos to watch for the upcoming bullrun, appealing to those who focus on long-term network growth and ecosystem expansion. Despite a significant price drop from its all-time high near $55, Polkadot’s current position provides room for upward movement if developers continue building across its parachains. Its steady staking rewards and ongoing ecosystem support further add to its potential. 4. Dogecoin: Meme Culture Driving Short-Term Moves Dogecoin is trading near $0.20, fluctuating between $0.199 and $0.204, with a market cap around $30 billion and daily volume close to $1.5 billion. After a dip to about $0.191 in early August, DOGE quickly bounced back to $0.210 before settling near current levels, showing strong community support. Though Dogecoin lacks the technical depth of Layer-1 platforms, it often benefits from cultural momentum during bullish cycles. Backed by an active community and high-profile endorsements, Dogecoin’s price may reach $0.215 to $0.23 soon, with some forecasts pointing beyond $0.30 later in the bull run. Some even predict a possible $1 by the end of 2025, depending on ETF approvals and social trends. As a result, Dogecoin remains one of the top cryptos to watch for short-term price action tied to community-driven hype. However, its large supply and inflation may limit its long-term upside compared to newer projects. Final Thoughts Choosing the top cryptos to watch for the next bull run depends on the kind of opportunity desired. BlockDAG’s current $0.0016 price, paired with its advanced Dashboard V4 tools and 10 BTC rewards running until August 11, offers a rare early-stage chance. SEI’s focus on high-speed trading infrastructure at about $0.28 gives it a solid use case. Polkadot, trading near $3.60, keeps building an essential cross-chain ecosystem. Dogecoin’s $0.20 price point provides cultural relevance and short-term momentum. Together, these four represent different strengths: early discount and innovation, trading speed, blockchain connectivity, and viral popularity. For those preparing for the market’s next rise, these top cryptos to watch combine utility, technical progress, and market buzz, making them worthy of attention heading into 2025.

Recent data highlights a remarkable trend: significant Ethereum institutional adoption , with major players pouring billions into the ecosystem. This signals a new era for digital assets, moving beyond early adopters to embrace broader financial participation. Understanding this trend is key to grasping the future of crypto. What’s Driving This Remarkable Ethereum Institutional Adoption? This year, the world has witnessed an incredible surge in investment into Ethereum. According to Nate Geraci, CEO of U.S. asset manager The ETF Store, Ethereum-holding firms and spot ETFs have collectively purchased a staggering $19 billion worth of Ethereum so far. This monumental figure includes $7 billion acquired by dedicated Ethereum ETFs and an even larger $12 billion by various companies. This influx demonstrates growing confidence from traditional finance and corporate entities in Ethereum’s long-term potential. It’s not just a fleeting interest; it’s a strategic move by major players recognizing Ethereum’s foundational role. The interest stems from several factors. Ethereum’s robust network, its pivotal role in decentralized finance (DeFi), and its upcoming scalability improvements are all attractive points for large-scale investors. These firms are not merely speculating; they are investing in the infrastructure of tomorrow’s digital economy. This level of commitment speaks volumes about the perceived stability and future growth of the asset. Such substantial crypto institutional investment highlights a maturation of the digital asset landscape. Is Bitcoin’s Dominance Shifting? The Impact on the Ethereum Market For years, Bitcoin has held the top spot in terms of market dominance. However, industry experts like VanEck’s Matthew Sigel suggest this dynamic is beginning to change. He points to the increasing adoption of stablecoins by banks, fintech firms, and corporates. Many of these stablecoins are settled on open-source blockchains, with Ethereum being a primary choice. This reliance on Ethereum for stablecoin settlements underscores its foundational role in the evolving digital economy. It highlights Ethereum’s utility beyond speculative investment, solidifying its position as a critical infrastructure layer for the future of finance. The growth of crypto institutional investment is clearly diversifying beyond just Bitcoin, influencing the broader Ethereum market . This shift indicates that institutions are looking for more than just a store of value. They seek programmable blockchains that can support complex financial applications and provide efficient settlement layers. Ethereum, with its smart contract capabilities, fits this need perfectly. This expanding utility is a significant driver of its institutional appeal. This widespread interest could significantly reshape the dynamics of the entire Ethereum market . Benefits of Growing Digital Asset Adoption Through Ethereum The substantial Ethereum institutional adoption brings several key advantages to the broader crypto market, influencing the entire landscape of digital asset adoption : Increased Legitimacy: When large financial institutions and corporations invest, it lends significant credibility to the asset class, potentially attracting more mainstream investors and reducing perceived risk. Enhanced Liquidity: More capital flowing in means deeper markets, making it easier to buy and sell Ethereum without significant price impact, which benefits all participants. The substantial investment from Ethereum ETFs and corporate entities underscores a strong belief in its future. Infrastructure Development: Institutional interest often spurs further development and innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem, leading to better tools, more secure platforms, and improved services. Regulatory Clarity: As institutions engage more deeply, there’s often increased pressure for clearer regulatory frameworks. This can lead to a more stable and predictable environment for the entire crypto space, fostering further growth. Broader Utility: Institutional use cases, such as stablecoin settlements, showcase Ethereum’s practical applications beyond trading, reinforcing its long-term value. This trend is a strong indicator of accelerating digital asset adoption across various sectors. This growing trend indicates a maturing market, moving beyond early adopters to embrace wider financial participation and integration into global finance. What Does This Mean for the Future of Ethereum? This significant inflow of capital suggests a robust future for Ethereum. It indicates that these entities view Ethereum not just as a speculative asset, but as a vital component of the future financial infrastructure. The adoption of Ethereum for stablecoin settlements further solidifies its utility. As more banks and corporations integrate Ethereum-based solutions, its value proposition strengthens considerably. This trend could potentially lead to greater price stability and less volatility in the long run, as institutional investors tend to have longer investment horizons and strategic objectives rather than short-term gains. This level of crypto institutional investment is transformative. For individual investors, this trend suggests a validation of Ethereum’s long-term potential. While market volatility remains a factor, the increasing institutional footprint provides a layer of fundamental support. Staying informed about these developments can help you understand the evolving dynamics of the digital asset space. The impressive $19 billion acquisition of Ethereum by firms and ETFs in 2024 to date marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency world. This substantial Ethereum institutional adoption underscores a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views digital assets. It highlights Ethereum’s critical role in the evolving landscape, particularly with the rise of stablecoins and the increasing demand for robust, open-source blockchain infrastructure. As institutions continue to integrate Ethereum into their strategies, its position as a cornerstone of the future digital economy seems increasingly secure, promising a more mature and integrated financial ecosystem.

The move brings an end to a multi-year legal battle that has weighed heavily on XRP’s market performance. Market analysts say the resolution has reignited interest among traders and investors. XRP Futures Activity Surpasses Solana In the past 24 hours, XRP futures trading volume surged more than 200% to $12.4 billion, surpassing Solana’s $9.6 billion, according to on-chain data from Glassnode. A sharp rise in futures volume is often linked to heightened speculative trading, particularly after significant news developments. XRP open interest, reflecting the value of unsettled futures contracts, also increased 15% to around $5 billion. Glassnode data showed XRP’s daily funding rate at 0.01%, indicating a tilt toward long positions as traders bet on continued price gains. However, the analytics firm warned that heavy long positioning can magnify downside risks, with overleveraged traders vulnerable to forced liquidations if prices turn lower. Key Support Levels Identified Cost basis distribution data highlights the $2.80–$2.82 price range as a critical area of support. More than 1.70 billion XRP tokens were acquired within this band, suggesting many holders are likely to defend their positions if prices decline. Market watchers note that such concentrated buying zones can provide strong price floors. Technical Patterns Point to 35% Upside XRP’s recent price rally pushed it above the upper trendline of a bull flag formation. Trading volumes have risen in tandem, supporting the breakout momentum. Based on traditional chart analysis, the pattern suggests a potential move to over $4.50 — a gain of roughly 35% from current levels — by September or October. Expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September could further fuel appetite for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Multiple analysts have issued bullish forecasts. Mikybull Crypto has predicted XRP could climb to between $5 and $8 by the end of 2025, while another analyst, Dom, has projected a price of $10.",Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-08-09 02:12:30

A bold new proposal has emerged, suggesting a unique Montenegro crypto strategy that could reshape the country’s economic future. Former Justice Minister Andrej Milović has put forth an ambitious plan: establishing a national treasury to accumulate significant holdings of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). The Vision: A National Bitcoin Treasury for Growth Andrej Milović’s innovative concept centers on creating a dedicated national treasury. This entity would be tasked with strategically purchasing leading digital assets. The former minister specifically recommended a substantial investment, proposing the issuance of €500 million ($540 million) in five-year bonds to finance this pioneering initiative. He projects that these acquired assets could potentially appreciate dramatically, reaching an impressive valuation of $3 billion to $5 billion within the same five-year timeframe. This forward-thinking approach aims to leverage the potential of the cryptocurrency market for national economic benefit. It’s a direct move towards a more diversified and technologically advanced financial portfolio for the state. The idea of a national Bitcoin treasury is gaining traction globally, and Montenegro could become a significant player. Why Bitcoin and Ethereum? Understanding Montenegro ETH Accumulation The selection of Bitcoin and Ethereum is not arbitrary. These two cryptocurrencies represent the largest and most established assets in the digital economy. Bitcoin, often dubbed “digital gold,” is seen as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. Ethereum, on the other hand, powers a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and the burgeoning DeFi (Decentralized Finance) sector. Milović’s proposal for Montenegro ETH accumulation highlights a strategic understanding of the crypto market’s landscape. Investing in these foundational assets could provide Montenegro with: Long-term Value Appreciation: Both assets have shown significant growth potential over time. Diversification: A non-traditional asset class to complement existing national reserves. Technological Edge: Positioning Montenegro as a forward-thinking nation in the digital age. Andrej Milović’s Credibility: A Familiar Face in Crypto Circles The proponent of this groundbreaking plan, Andrej Milović, is no stranger to the complexities of the cryptocurrency world. His involvement adds significant weight to the proposal. Milović previously spearheaded the investigation and legal proceedings against Do Kwon, the former CEO of Terraform Labs. Kwon was arrested in Montenegro after fleeing the dramatic collapse of the Terra-Luna ecosystem. This background demonstrates Milović’s deep familiarity with the crypto space, its risks, and its potential. His insights are informed by direct experience, making his call for a national Andrej Milović crypto strategy a well-considered one, rather than a speculative gamble. Unlocking Potential: Benefits of Government Crypto Investment Embracing a strategy of government crypto investment could yield multiple advantages for Montenegro. Beyond the potential for financial returns, such a move could: Boost Economic Growth: Attract foreign direct investment and foster a vibrant local crypto industry. Enhance National Wealth: Grow the nation’s reserves through smart asset management. Promote Innovation: Encourage blockchain technology adoption and and development within the country. Attract Talent: Position Montenegro as a hub for crypto professionals and entrepreneurs. Diversify Revenue Streams: Create new avenues for national income beyond traditional sectors. This bold step could signal Montenegro’s readiness to embrace the future of finance and technology. Navigating the Challenges: What Are the Risks? While the potential benefits are compelling, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent risks associated with such a venture. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and prices can fluctuate wildly. Any Montenegro crypto strategy must account for these potential downsides. Key challenges include: Market Volatility: The value of BTC and ETH can experience significant swings, impacting the treasury’s holdings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, posing potential compliance issues. Security Concerns: Safeguarding large national crypto holdings requires robust cybersecurity measures to prevent hacks and theft. Public Perception: Gaining public and political consensus for such an unconventional investment can be challenging. A successful implementation would require careful risk management, clear regulatory frameworks, and secure storage solutions. Global Precedents and Montenegro’s Forward Path Montenegro would not be the first nation to explore significant crypto integration. El Salvador, for instance, adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, though its approach differs from Milović’s treasury proposal. Other countries and sovereign wealth funds are also quietly exploring digital asset investments. Milović’s vision for a national Montenegro crypto strategy represents a proactive step towards embracing a new economic paradigm. It highlights a growing recognition among policymakers that digital assets could play a significant role in national financial strategies. In conclusion, Andrej Milović’s proposal for a national Bitcoin and Ethereum treasury presents a fascinating and potentially transformative path for Montenegro. By leveraging strategic bond issuance for a substantial national Bitcoin treasury , the nation could unlock significant financial gains and position itself as a leader in the digital economy. While challenges exist, the potential rewards of this innovative government crypto investment are undeniable, marking a pivotal moment in Montenegro’s financial evolution.

Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) is making headlines with its upcoming NIGHT token airdrop and a fresh $71 million in funding. Both developments are stirring excitement, but one name continues to outpace the buzz: BlockDAG . With $365 million already raised, BDAG’s presale is one of the largest this year. And now, ahead of its GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11, users can still grab BDAG at $0.0016, a price offering serious return potential. Dogecoin Rises After Dip: Can It Hold? Dogecoin’s price movement over the last day shows a rise to $0.2065 (IDR 3,375), up 1.35%, after touching a low of IDR 3,280 and peaking at IDR 3,466. This activity follows a prior trading average of $0.20 and a volume near $1.4 billion. In just 24 hours, volume surged 38% to $1.74 billion, showing renewed energy in DOGE trades. DOGE’s next move depends on whether it holds above $0.20. Technical indicators like RSI crossing above 50 are also being closely watched. If these signals align, a short-term rally could kick in. Otherwise, DOGE may stay in accumulation mode. With community support still strong and meme coin enthusiasm rising again, traders are keeping close tabs on DOGE’s next bounce point and potential breakout zone. Airdrop Hype and Funding Fuel ADA Cardano is trending again thanks to talk of a NIGHT token airdrop. Over a million wallets are likely eligible, creating a surge in ADA interest. The airdrop talk is lighting up crypto channels and drawing new attention to ADA’s potential. But this isn’t just about hype. Cardano also received approval for $71 million in funding. These funds will be used to enhance transaction speeds, improve developer tools, and enable better cross-chain support. That gives the project serious utility and not just social buzz. The combo of technical progress and a high-profile airdrop is giving ADA strong upward pressure. More users are joining in, and the price surge reflects this wave of optimism. Cardano’s roadmap looks stronger than ever going into the next quarter. BlockDAG Sees Buying Rush Before GLOBAL LAUNCH! BlockDAG has raised $365 million and sold 24.8 billion coins ahead of its GLOBAL LAUNCH release set for August 11. While Batch 29 is priced at $0.0276, the limited-time $0.0016 offer is still active, giving users a shot at a 3,025% return based on its confirmed $0.05 launch price. The numbers are catching attention. Buyers in Batch 1 have already seen 2,660% gains. Now, with just days left before the price jumps, demand is ramping up fast. BlockDAG is built on PoW-DAG tech, offering high speed, security, and scalability. It’s more than a coin; it’s a working network. Tools like a live trading simulator and the X1 smartphone mining app are already live, giving users actual utility before the coin hits exchanges. Over 200,000 holders have already joined. As part of the GLOBAL LAUNCH release push, BlockDAG is seeing a massive uptick in traction and visibility. Analysts say this momentum, combined with its $0.0016 entry point, sets up BlockDAG to be one of the top crypto assets of 2025. With future listings confirmed and community size growing daily, BDAG is no longer a hidden gem; it’s a top contender for exponential growth this cycle. Final Thoughts With the current trends of increasing institutional interest, these three coins can prove beneficial for long-term as well as short-term buyers. Dogecoin emerged and took a flight up many stairs, proving that its value has still not diminished. On the other hand, Cardano has big plans for a NIGHT token airdrop, which can prove beneficial for the many wallets that are eligible for the airdrop. Along with its $71M funding coming up to improve the technology for the developers and users. But above both of these rises, BlockDAG, with its impressive rise in popularity with surpassing over $364M funds before its GLOBAL LAUNCH release. Over 200,000 unique holders have already acquired BDAG, proving it to be one of the top crypto assets of 2025.

It is now more about spotting tokens with strong use cases, active users, and clear goals. As the crypto world grows and changes, more people are choosing projects that bring real value and not just short-term gains. This year, a few projects are catching attention for the right reasons. Some are leading in DeFi, others are changing how wallets are used, and some are making progress in real-world use. This list highlights four projects to follow closely: Cold Wallet , VeChain, Chainlink, and Aptos. Each one is heading in a different direction, but all show they are working on long-term success. If you want to understand crypto better this year, these are the names worth knowing. 1. Cold Wallet: A Tool That Rewards Activity Cold Wallet is more than a basic wallet. It is built to keep users active by rewarding them. Instead of charging high gas fees, it gives CWT tokens back for every action like swaps or transfers. The cashback idea is simple: the more you use it, the more you get. Some users can earn up to 100% of their gas fees back. At a time when many avoid using blockchain due to costs, this approach feels more user-friendly. The presale is getting attention as well. There are 150 stages, and each CWT is priced at $0.00998. A clear vesting schedule helps early users know what to expect. Over $5.8 million has already been raised, showing strong demand. About 40% of all CWT will be sold during presale, giving the community a big share. A referral system is also active, offering a 20% bonus to the person who shares and 10% to the new user. Cold Wallet is trying to shift how people view wallets. Instead of seeing them as just a place to store crypto, it turns them into a tool that pays users back. If you are searching for real use and growth in one place, this might be the project to follow. The presale stage is limited, and with public listings and rewards coming in 2026, this could be a rare chance to get in early on one of the highest potential cryptos in 2025. 2. VeChain: Driving Enterprise Blockchain Adoption VeChain has shown it can withstand market ups and downs, but what stands out now is its ongoing tech upgrades and stronger partnerships. Its recent PoA 2.0 update merges Byzantine Fault Tolerance and Nakamoto consensus, giving VeChainThor speed, security, and scalability for enterprise use. Its focus on sustainability also draws companies aiming to monitor carbon emissions and streamline supply chains. Deals with Walmart China, BMW, and Franklin Templeton keep VeChain relevant in the enterprise space. As of early August 2025, VET trades near $0.02268, with short-term expectations ranging between $0.0202 and $0.0306. Longer projections suggest an average of $0.0475 later in 2025, with possible gains into 2026. As global demand for practical blockchain tools grows, VeChain seems well placed to expand its presence. It is not just another speculative asset; it offers core infrastructure. For those selecting from the highest potential cryptos in 2025, VeChain gives a strong mix of reliability and growth. 3. Chainlink: Powering On-Chain Access to Real-World Data Chainlink has long made its case for decentralized oracles, and its latest rollout points to an even larger vision. With the August 2025 launch of Chainlink Data Streams, users can now access live U.S. equity and ETF data across 37 chains. This creates new paths for tokenized products such as synthetic stocks and on-chain futures. GMX and Kamino are among the first to use the service, which could speed up Data Streams adoption across DeFi platforms. LINK is trading near $16.28, with key levels between $13.50 and $17. If it breaks above $18, the next stop might be $25, though forecasts for now suggest a likely range of $17 to $19. What matters more is that institutions are taking note. In early August, Chainlink was named in a U.S. White House report as a core blockchain technology. That kind of recognition points to its growing role in secure, connected systems. If you are weighing options among the highest potential cryptos in 2025, Chainlink holds a strong position for its unique data layer. 4. Aptos: Advancing Fast Blockchain Execution and Storage Aptos is making progress in the race for scalable blockchain performance. Its upgrade path includes Shardines, a parallel processing engine targeting 1 million transactions per second across 30 shards. Alongside this, the Shelby low-latency storage system, made with Jump Crypto, is expected to launch a devnet by year-end. Together, they aim to give Aptos both speed and developer-friendly tools. The Aptos ecosystem is also growing, with the launch of Decibel’s devnet in early August. The platform combines spot, perpetual, and yield trading in one setup, showing how DeFi can mimic CEX functionality. APT’s price in early August sits between $3.00 and $4.27, with year-end targets near $3.19. Some predictions for 2026 reach as high as $6 to $11. With DeFi total value locked around $1 billion and more tech upgrades coming, Aptos earns its place on the list of highest potential cryptos in 2025 for those seeking future-ready chains. Final Takeaway Picking the highest potential cryptos in 2025 means going deeper than headlines. Cold Wallet is reshaping user rewards, VeChain is scaling with global companies, Chainlink connects live data to blockchains, and Aptos is speeding up both transactions and storage. Each project offers something distinct, from enterprise value to on-chain innovation. For those building a solid strategy, it is not about riding short-term spikes. It is about focusing on real-world use and lasting impact. These four projects are already doing that in ways that matter.

On August 8, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs experienced a truly remarkable day, drawing in a combined net inflow of $455.84 million. This surge marks the fourth-largest daily inflow ever recorded for these products and continues a positive streak of four consecutive trading days with significant Ethereum ETF inflows . This consistent investor interest highlights a growing confidence in digital assets and their potential for long-term growth. It signals a pivotal moment for Ethereum’s journey towards mainstream financial integration. What’s Driving These Massive Ethereum ETF Inflows? This recent influx of capital into spot Ethereum ETFs signals a robust appetite among investors for direct exposure to Ethereum without the complexities of self-custody. Data from Trader T on X confirms the scale of this activity. Such substantial movements often reflect broader market sentiment and institutional conviction in the underlying asset, Ethereum. Investors are clearly seeking regulated pathways to participate in the crypto economy, valuing the transparency and security offered by these exchange-traded funds. BlackRock’s ETHA led the charge with an impressive $249.35 million in inflows, showcasing significant institutional confidence. Fidelity’s FETH followed closely, securing $132.35 million, reinforcing its position as a major player. Grayscale’s mini ETH attracted $38.25 million, demonstrating diversified interest beyond the largest funds. Even the established Grayscale’s ETHE saw a healthy $26.84 million in new funds, indicating sustained interest in existing vehicles. Bitwise’s ETHW added $7.83 million, and Invesco’s QETH brought in $1.22 million, contributing to the overall positive momentum. These figures underscore a collective push into the Ethereum ecosystem through these regulated investment vehicles. The remaining ETFs reported no change, indicating a concentrated interest in funds from prominent asset managers. A Closer Look at ETH ETF Investment Leaders The performance on August 8 vividly illustrates the competitive yet thriving landscape within the ETH ETF investment space. BlackRock and Fidelity, major players in traditional finance, are quickly establishing dominance in the broader crypto ETF market . Their substantial contributions to the daily inflows suggest strong institutional backing and investor trust in their established brands and operational expertise. This trend is pivotal for the long-term maturation of the digital asset sector, as it brings in capital from a wider pool of investors. The continued performance of these funds provides crucial insights into market dynamics. Large inflows from reputable asset managers often attract more conservative investors who might otherwise hesitate to directly purchase cryptocurrencies. This provides a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the evolving digital asset economy. It also signifies growing comfort with the regulatory frameworks surrounding these products, making them a more appealing option for both retail and institutional portfolios. What Do These Crypto ETF Market Trends Mean for Ethereum? The consistent inflow into crypto ETF market products, particularly those tracking Ethereum, carries significant implications. Firstly, it provides a powerful validation of Ethereum as a legitimate and valuable asset class, recognized by established financial institutions. Secondly, it suggests increasing institutional adoption, which can bring more stability and liquidity to the market. This shift from purely speculative trading to regulated investment vehicles is a crucial step for mainstream acceptance and broader financial integration. Moreover, these trends could potentially influence Ethereum’s price action by increasing demand. As more capital flows into these ETFs, the underlying Ethereum assets must be acquired, putting upward pressure on ETH’s value. While the benefits are clear, potential challenges include market volatility inherent to cryptocurrencies and the evolving regulatory landscape. Investors should remain aware that even regulated products are tied to an asset known for price swings. This positive feedback loop, however, could attract even more investors, further solidifying Ethereum’s position in the global financial landscape. Navigating the Digital Asset ETFs Landscape For investors looking to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly holding the assets, digital asset ETFs offer a compelling solution. These funds provide a regulated, accessible, and often more liquid way to participate in the growth of the crypto economy. A key benefit is simplified access; investors can buy and sell shares through traditional brokerage accounts. However, it is essential for investors to understand the nuances of each ETF, including management fees, tracking error, and the specific underlying assets or derivatives they hold. Diversification within the digital asset space, perhaps by combining different types of crypto ETFs, can also be a prudent strategy. The surge in spot Ethereum ETFs inflows is a clear indicator that the market is evolving rapidly. As more institutional players enter this space, we can anticipate further innovation and diversification in product offerings. Staying informed about these developments is key to making strategic investment decisions in this dynamic environment. Always conduct thorough research, understand the associated risks, and consider your financial goals before investing in any digital asset product. The impressive $455.84 million in net inflows into U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on August 8 is more than just a number; it represents a significant milestone in the journey of digital assets towards mainstream acceptance. This sustained investor confidence, particularly from major players like BlackRock and Fidelity, underscores the growing institutional appetite for Ethereum. As the market continues to mature, these regulated investment vehicles will likely play an increasingly vital role in bridging traditional finance with the innovative world of cryptocurrencies. This truly is a transformative period for the crypto market, paving the way for wider adoption and deeper integration into the global financial system. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are spot Ethereum ETFs? A1: Spot Ethereum ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Ethereum (ETH) as their underlying asset, allowing investors to gain exposure to ETH’s price movements without directly buying and storing the cryptocurrency themselves. Q2: Which ETFs saw the largest inflows on August 8? A2: BlackRock’s ETHA led with $249.35 million in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FETH with $132.35 million, and Grayscale’s mini ETH with $38.25 million. Q3: Why are these inflows significant for the Ethereum market? A3: These significant inflows indicate increasing institutional and retail investor confidence in Ethereum, provide market validation, and can contribute to increased demand and potentially price stability for ETH by bringing more regulated capital into the ecosystem. Q4: How do spot Ethereum ETFs differ from futures ETFs? A4: Spot Ethereum ETFs hold actual ETH, directly tracking its price. Futures ETFs, on the other hand, hold futures contracts that bet on Ethereum’s future price, not the asset itself. Spot ETFs typically aim to provide more direct price exposure. Q5: What is the general outlook for ETH ETF investment? A5: The outlook for ETH ETF investment appears positive, with consistent inflows suggesting growing mainstream acceptance and demand. As more financial institutions offer these products, they are likely to become a key avenue for traditional investors to access the crypto market.

Analysts highlight $0.18 as a demand zone; a breakout could push price near $0.30. Whales bought 1B DOGE in 24 hours, now holding nearly half of total circulating supply. Dogecoin Finds Support After Pullback Dogecoin is trading near $0.21 after a 3% increase in the past 24 hours. Over the last week, it is still down around 8%. Trading volume for the day is estimated at $1.2 billion. The price had dropped steadily from a local high of $0.25. Before that, DOGE had surged from $0.08 to $0.21, then rallied again to reach $0.25. The recent decline found support near $0.18, where buyers stepped in. That level has now become a key zone for price stability. On the 4-hour chart, DOGE has bounced around 29% from the $0.18 level. The move shows buyers reacting near support, with current price holding above $0.20. BitGuru noted that the market is showing signs of recovery after the pullback. The price structure remains open, but holding above $0.18 may keep the path clear for a move toward the $0.22 to $0.25 range. A push above those levels would confirm a change in direction. $DOGE Waking Up for Another Run? #DOGE first pumped hard from 0.07587 to 0.21309, showing strong momentum. After a small dip, it rallied again to 0.24965, but then dropped in a steady downtrend. The market is now trying to bounce back from the support zone near $0.18. pic.twitter.com/ekAxZVH71t — BitGuru (@bitgu_ru) August 7, 2025 Chart Setup Points to Possible Breakout Bitcoinsensus shared a daily chart view showing higher highs followed by equal lows near $0.18. This setup can act as a liquidity zone, where larger orders are filled before price moves again. The chart suggests that, if $0.18 is held, DOGE may reach $0.30 in the short term. A failure above recent highs will be a sign of faded momentum. For now the market is waiting to see for how long can the current bounce hold above support. Whales Accumulate as Market Reacts Data from analyst Ali Martinez shows large holders added one billion DOGE over the past day. The value of the purchase was near $200 million. These wallets now hold about 73 billion DOGE, nearly half of the supply in circulation. Meanwhile, such activity may lower the supply of coins available to trade. Assuming that purchasing goes on and demand remains high, it could reinforce the ongoing recovery.

Most tokens launch with buzz but lose steam fast. Only a few projects offer strong use cases, growing demand, and token models that give value back to users. If you’re looking for the best crypto presale for high potential, now is the time to take a closer look. These four projects are not just trending. They show signs of lasting appeal. Getting in early can make a big difference. Leading the group is Cold Wallet, already gaining attention by combining real features and active users to create strong results. Cold Wallet: A Wallet That Gives Instead of Takes Cold Wallet is more than just a place to store crypto. It’s a self-custody wallet that changes how users interact with blockchain tools. Instead of making users pay, it gives them rewards. Each transaction, swap, or bridge action gives cashback in CWT, the project’s own token. That’s what makes it one of the best crypto presales for high-potential projects in the current market. Now in stage 17, Cold Wallet has already raised $5.8 million. Each CWT is priced at $0.00998, with a planned listing at $0.3517. That sets up a possible return of 37x, even before counting gains from future exchange listings or rising demand. What really makes Cold Wallet different is that the product is already running. It also just finalized a $270 million deal to buy Plus Wallet, instantly adding 2 million users to its system. The cashback setup and bonus rewards increase actual use, boosting activity, token burn, and long-term holding. This isn’t about guessing. It’s about tracking real progress. Cold Wallet stands out for those searching for the best crypto presale for high potential. It supports steady growth, while giving something back every step of the way. DexBoss: A New Trading Model That Rewards Volume DexBoss is aiming to become a top decentralized platform for active DeFi traders, but it brings something different to the table. Rather than collecting fees like most exchanges, it gives part of those fees back through a trader-rewards setup. Its native token, DBX, is still in early presale stages and is expected to launch alongside its custom-built routing system. One unique feature is DexBoss’s built-in analytics tool, offering traders live insights and pairing those with fee kickbacks based on how much they trade. Though the platform is still in the building phase, the roadmap includes smart liquidity tools and rebate levels that aim to keep users engaged. The current presale pricing opens the door for a possible strong start after launch, making it a contender among the best crypto presales for high potential if it delivers on its plans. AurealOne: Audio Streaming With DeFi Features AurealOne is exploring the connection between music and crypto: a platform where listening and earning go hand in hand. It allows users to earn AUR tokens by streaming songs, building playlists, or rating content created by others. Now in its best crypto presale for high potential phase, AUR tokens are being offered at a low entry price before the full audio experience goes live later this year. While still testing its concept, support from indie artists and Web3 creators is helping it gain early interest. What makes AurealOne worth watching is how it turns passive music consumption into a chance to earn. If this catches on, AUR could become a real use case at the cross-section of DeFi and music culture. It’s one of the few presales exploring entertainment with serious upside. Lightchain AI: Smarter Trades Through Automation AI is showing up across crypto, but Lightchain AI is building tools aimed at performance, not just trend-following. Instead of chatbots, it delivers ready-to-use strategies powered by AI. These can be deployed instantly for yield farming, DEX trading, and more. The presale token, LCAI, unlocks these features, letting users run AI bots, use custom models, and get early access to new tools. The team behind Lightchain says results will improve through user feedback linked to blockchain activity. That’s a big promise, but if it holds true, it could lead to real returns. Right now, early buyers are securing LCAI tokens before the platform’s full launch. It’s still a work in progress, but by combining AI, DeFi, and smart contract tools, Lightchain AI could be one of the best crypto presales for high potential if the models prove effective in action. Final Thoughts: Which Presale Shows Real Progress? Many crypto presales make headlines but deliver little. The ones that stand out offer real use, growing interest, and fair token systems. Cold Wallet leads this cycle, with a working product, cashback rewards, and a current price that points to a possible 37x increase. Time is key. The best crypto presale for high potential does not stay under the radar for long.

With markets moving fast, identifying the top altcoin to watch in 2025 goes beyond social media buzz. The real signals lie in tech development, user growth, and strong market momentum. Today’s top contenders are proving their value through adoption, utility, and consistent delivery. From meme-powered ecosystems to regulated payment systems, each project here brings something different. Shiba Inu, Cardano, and XRP are showing progress that deserves attention, while BlockDAG continues to outperform expectations with its expanding presale, technical build, and ecosystem incentives. Here’s what’s putting them on the radar. 1. BlockDAG: Massive Presale, Real Tools, & Strong Ecosystem Growth BlockDAG is reshaping the Layer 1 conversation by combining Proof-of-Work reliability with DAG-based scalability. This architecture isn’t just theoretical; it’s powering a mobile mining app with over 2 million users, deploying ASIC hardware, and backing a presale that has already brought in $365 million, selling 24.8 billion BDAG at the current rate of $0.0016. Its advantage as the top altcoin to watch lies in its delivery pace: EVM support, a drag-and-drop smart contract builder, and a transparent rewards framework already in motion. The GLOBAL LAUNCH release, which ends August 11, gives buyers access to the final presale batch before prices shift to $0.05. Security audits from CertiK and Halborn, plus listings secured on MEXC, BitMart, CoinStore, and XT.com, reinforce the seriousness of its launch. BlockDAG’s airdrop strategy also offers real value, 100 million BDAG across four activity zones: testnet, presale, social sharing, and referrals. You can gain rewards by building, buying, promoting, or inviting. Hardware mining units (X30, X100, X10) are currently shipping, and extra perks are unlocked through QR-based campaigns. With potential 25x gains still on the table, BlockDAG brings more than a price point, it offers a full network for users to participate in. Among current contenders, it clearly ranks as the top altcoin to watch for those looking ahead. 2. Cardano: Long-Term Build & Steady DeFi Growth Signal Potential Cardano (ADA) remains a staple for forward-thinking users. Priced around $0.46, with a market cap near $16.5 billion, ADA is backed by a steady increase in smart contract activity and user participation, which highlight its continued network strength. Cardano maintains its role as a serious top altcoin to watch due to its consistent rollout of enhancements. The Chang hard fork has added decentralized governance and broader support for decentralized apps. Real-world partnerships, especially in Africa, are also helping Cardano attract interest from governments and institutions. Whale interest is climbing, and Cardano’s total value locked in DeFi has grown 15% in just one week. With a roadmap focused on scalability and interoperability, and a history of avoiding disruption during upgrades, ADA is showing long-term promise. At today’s price levels, many see it as an opportunity worth acting on before the next cycle kicks off. 3. Shiba Inu: Rising Activity & Expanding Use Cases Push It Forward Shiba Inu (SHIB) is moving past its meme beginnings. Trading at $0.000017, with a $10 billion market cap, SHIB continues to gain traction through multiple fronts, its ShibaSwap DEX, new NFT projects, and the growth of Shibarium, its Layer 2 solution. SHIB is being watched closely as a top altcoin to watch due to recent whale accumulation and a noticeable increase in burn volume, both of which helped lift the price 12% in the past week. Wallet growth has also accelerated, with Shibarium’s user count now exceeding 1.5 million. Speculation around additional DeFi features and potential listings is adding to the buzz. SHIB still offers high volatility, but for those following crypto sentiment, it remains a top pick. Its marketing strategy, growing user base, and steady development make it a strong candidate for users seeking momentum and upside in the meme category. 4. XRP: Renewed Confidence After Legal Milestones & New Deals XRP is gaining renewed strength, trading at $0.61 with a $33 billion market cap. Following a favorable outcome in its long SEC battle, XRP is finally benefiting from legal clarity, which has revived institutional interest and lifted market sentiment. Those watching the top altcoin to watch list should note XRP’s expanding network through RippleNet, especially in Asia and the Middle East. New banking relationships and integrations with global payment systems continue to grow. Meanwhile, the XRP Ledger is seeing more activity in NFTs and DeFi. Resistance is expected near $0.68, but if momentum holds, a breakout could follow quickly. Backed by strong partnerships and a clear legal position, XRP remains a key choice for those interested in real-world financial infrastructure and regulatory stability. Why Timing Matters for These Altcoins Finding the top altcoin to watch in 2025 isn’t about following the crowd. It’s about spotting long-term value and recognizing which projects are already building what others are still promising. BlockDAG stands out for delivering a scalable network, integrated rewards, and high upside while still in presale. Shiba Inu blends meme culture with growing adoption, Cardano continues to build with real-world intent, and XRP has re-entered the conversation with legal wins and strategic reach. While each project serves different needs, BlockDAG offers one of the clearest growth setups with its GLOBAL LAUNCH release, real use features, and structured airdrop model. These projects are not just holding ground, they’re preparing for what’s next. Keep your focus here as the market builds toward another breakout.

Technical Analysis Overview XRP falls 5% in the 24-hour period ending August 9, dropping from $3.34 to $3.20 before recovering to $3.30. The move spans a $0.17 range, marking 5.24% volatility. Selling pressure peaks between 14:00-15:00, when price collapses from $3.36 to $3.20 on 209.67 million volume — the largest single-hour print of the session. Buyers defend the $3.20 zone, triggering a rebound to $3.33 by 19:00. Resistance forms at $3.31-$3.33, with support locked at $3.20. News Background The Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple Labs have officially ended their five-year legal battle, jointly dismissing their appeals in the XRP case. The Second Circuit Appeals Court recognized the filing, with both parties bearing their own costs. “Following the Commission’s vote today, the SEC and Ripple formally filed directly with the Second Circuit to dismiss their appeals,” Ripple’s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty said on X.

Players no longer settle for just flashy branding; they want fast platforms, transparent RTPs, smooth gameplay, and instant payments. The hype factor is fading, and the leaders now are those delivering genuine performance and user-focused design. This ranking highlights five standout crypto gambling sites this year: Stake.com, Roobet, BC.Game, BetMGM, and Spartans . Each was evaluated for user interface quality, crypto compatibility, payout reliability, and overall gameplay feel. You’ll see how each performs, and why Spartans.com might be the hidden powerhouse among them. Spartans: Lightning-Fast Gameplay and Transparent Features Though new to the scene, Spartans.com is quickly beating big-name rivals where it matters most. Built specifically for crypto play, it supports BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, and AVAX with near-instant deposits, withdrawals, and wallet syncing, all without mandatory KYC for basic access. The clean, intuitive interface blends minimalism with depth, letting users switch between casino games, live tables, and sports betting without confusion. Spartans excel in RTP transparency and gameplay smoothness. Every slot and live dealer title runs flawlessly, even on mobile browsers, with no load delays. Sports bettors benefit from the real-time betslip calculator and live stats dashboard, while crash and game show titles feel designed for crypto-native users. Promotions are competitive too, with daily reload bonuses, regular offers, and even a Lamborghini giveaway under clear terms. While Stake.com dominates in visibility, Spartans is proving that speed, clarity, and reliability keep players coming back. Stake.com: Global Brand Power and Community Reach Stake.com remains a top-recognized name in crypto gambling, boosted by celebrity deals and a highly engaged user base. The interface is streamlined, especially on desktop, and its bet slip system is still one of the best for multi-bets. Stake’s strength lies in its social features, including live chat and community betting, giving it the feel of a social hub as well as a gaming platform. Its crypto handling is strong, with support for BTC, ETH, LTC, and XRP, and transaction speeds are generally quick. However, RTP consistency varies between providers, and the platform has been slower to embrace newer Web3 wallet integrations. For brand-focused players, it’s still a top choice, but those wanting precision and top-tier speed may lean elsewhere in 2025. Roobet: Wide Game Selection but UI Overload Roobet delivers in game variety, offering thousands of titles from leading providers and in-house favorites like “Roobet Crash.” It processes BTC, ETH, and USDC payments quickly and has introduced limited smart contract withdrawal options. Gameplay runs well most of the time, and licensing adds a layer of trust. However, the interface can feel cluttered, especially on mobile devices. The layout lacks the sharp responsiveness of newer platforms, and high-traffic periods sometimes cause noticeable lag. While its loyalty program and long-standing market presence are assets, Roobet would benefit from a more streamlined user experience. BC.Game: Packed with Features but Overwhelming for Newcomers BC.Game is one of the most feature-rich crypto gambling platforms, supporting a massive range of cryptocurrencies and offering its own integrated utility coin for bonuses. It has probably fair titles, community jackpots, and mini-games that keep seasoned users engaged. That said, the platform can feel chaotic for beginners. Pop-ups, bonus wheels, and constant chat activity can overshadow actual gameplay. While it scores well for RTP consistency and transaction speeds, the interface’s busyness impacts overall fluidity. BC.Game suits experienced crypto gamblers but may overwhelm those looking for a simpler layout. BetMGM: Reliable Brand with Limited Crypto Speed BetMGM’s reputation comes from its strong presence in traditional betting, and its crypto integration has been gradual. The sportsbook design is among the cleanest, and casino lobbies are well-organized with titles from providers like Evolution and NetEnt. Still, crypto support is limited to major assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, and withdrawals can take hours or require ID checks. RTP performance is steady across licensed games, but in terms of rapid crypto processing and wallet efficiency, BetMGM lags behind its newer competitors. It’s a safe, regulated choice but not the fastest mover in the crypto gambling sector. Why Spartans Could Be the Smartest Bet in 2025 Crypto gambling in 2025 has no shortage of options, but only a few are pushing performance and design in ways that matter to active players. Stake.com still leads in community and visibility. Roobet and BC.Game excel in variety and gamification, while BetMGM appeals to those who want a trusted, regulated environment. Then there’s Spartans, a platform stripping away the fluff to focus on speed, transparency, and clean performance. For those wanting a high-quality crypto betting experience without the clutter, Spartans is emerging as one of the smartest picks this year.

49783369,551143,1754715613,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49783369.jpeg,Head And Shoulders Formation Predicts Solana Price Breakout To $219,https://bitcoinist.com/head-and-shoulders-solana/,"Solana has continued to fluctuate between bullish and bearish momentum with no definite break in a particular direction. Amid this, there have been retests of both resistance and support levels with no outcome, and this has contributed to the formation of a head and shoulders pattern. With this development, the Solana price is now looking in one of two possible directions, both of which could carry major implications for investors of the altcoin. Solana Head And Shoulders Pattern Could Trigger Rally Crypto analyst Melikatrader pointed out that Solana has completed a Head and Shoulders formation on its 1-Day chart. This formation can go either way, but for Solana specifically and how the price has performed recently, it could point to a more bullish movement than a bearish one. After completing the left and right shoulders and the head, the price now looks toward the neckline as the next determinant. This neckline, as outlined by the crypto analyst, has been broken after the price crashed below the $160 level. What could happen next from here is that the Solana price could move upward to retest this neckline again. Being able to reclaim it would trigger an uptrend and kickstart a move toward $200 . There is also the trendline that suggests that the Solan price could be in an ascending trend . So far, there have been multiple higher lows, the presence of which is still bullish for the altcoin regardless of current market sentiment. If this holds, then the likelihood of an upward continuation becomes higher. The analyst further explains that taking into account the head and shoulders formation and the neckline that was broken, it is more likely that the price shoots up from here. The target is placed at $219.84, as long as the momentum holds. Otherwise, there could be bearish implications for the cryptocurrency. “Based on the pattern and technical analysis, the potential target for the price could be around $219.84, as indicated by the box in the upper right corner,” the analyst explained. “This target aligns with the upward trend continuation from the broken neckline.” An inverse scenario would be a situation where the price fails to hold above the neckline. A reversal here could lead the Solana price to find better bounce-off points at lower support levels. Amid these, the $136.34 support level would be the one to watch in the case of a bearish scenario, as it would provide the most opportunity to buy.",Solana|SOL|SOL news|SOL price|solana|Solana news|Solana price|solusd|SOLUSDT,EN,0,0,TRADING|SOL|ALTCOIN|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-09 05:00:13

DeFi Protocol CrediX’s Team Vanishes Following $4.5 Million Exploit,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/exit-scam-defi-protocol-credixs-team-vanishes-following-4-5-million-exploit/,"The team behind the DeFi protocol CrediX is suspected of an exit scam following a recent $4.5 million security breach. The team has reportedly “vanished” from the project’s official channels despite promising refunds, leaving customers empty-handed. Related Reading: Ethereum Breakout Is ‘Imminent’ Amid $3,850 Retest – Analyst Eyes $5,000 For This Quarter DeFi Protocol Suffers $4.5 Million Exploit On Friday, security firm CertiK reported that the DeFi lender CrediX’s team had disappeared following the platform’s recent exploit, leaving its website offline since the August 4 incident and suddenly deleting the official X account. For context, the Sonic-based DeFi lender suffered a security breach on Monday after a potential wallet compromise led to the theft of $4.5 million from the protocol’s liquidity pool. Blockchain security firm PeckShield explained that the alleged hack was due to a compromised admin account, which allowed the exploiter to abuse its BRIDGE role to mint unbacked acUSDC (Sonic USDC) tokens, borrow against them, and drain the pool, before bridging the assets from Sonic Network to Ethereum. Notably, SlowMist found that the CrediX multisig wallet added an attacker as an admin and bridge role via ACLManager six days before, which raised concerns among investors. The DeFi lender’s team acknowledged the incident on X, stating that they had disabled the website to prevent users from depositing. Later, the team informed its community that it had allegedly “reached successful parley with the exploiter, who agreed to return the funds within the next 24-48 hours.” According to the now-deleted post, posted on CrediX’s official Telegram account by a user, the attacker agreed to return the funds “in return for money fully paid by the credix treasury.” The team affirmed that they would airdrop the funds to the affected users’ addresses in “the respective timeframe.” CrediX Goes Dark The following day, the team addressed the exploit on Telegram, stating, “We are truly sorry for this devastating incident and the impact it may have on our community,” and affirmed that they would keep users updated on the next steps before disappearing and deactivating the official X account. On Thursday, the Sonic-based Stability DAO confirmed on its Discord server that CrediX had “gone dark and disappeared,” directly affecting the protocol’s users. The exploit affected Stability DAO’s Metavaults as the project had recently integrated with CrediX. In the message, the protocol announced that all the affected teams, including Sonic Labs, Euler, Beets, and Rines Protocol (Trevee), were in communication and actively working on “filing a formal legal report with the authorities in hopes of recovering lost funds.” Additionally, they have obtained information on two of the DeFi lender’s members, which would be added to the report alongside the rest of the evidence. “A full incident report will be shared with the community soon, outlining everything that happened and what steps are being taken,” the message vowed.

The report states that approximately 99% of the over 26,000 tokens currently in existence are expected to disappear over the next ten years. This prediction was drawn from a broader analysis of the evolving financial infrastructure and the role that tokenization is expected to play in reshaping both traditional finance and blockchain applications. BANK OF AMERICA: 99% OF CRYPTO ASSETS IN EXISTENCE TODAY WILL DISAPPEAR Of course it’s documented. https://t.co/UYVSDqqs7f pic.twitter.com/9znGD0HOcJ — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) August 7, 2025 The Context: Tokenization and Infrastructure Transformation The report emphasizes that today’s financial systems are still largely reliant on centralized, outdated infrastructure that lacks interoperability. It highlights the limitations this creates for efficiency, innovation, and capital allocation. According to BofA Global Research, despite early advances in asset digitization, such as Nasdaq’s move to electronic trading in the 1970s, many financial institutions continue to rely on systems that are over two decades old. The report anticipates a significant transformation over the next five to fifteen years as tokenization becomes more prominent in both financial and non-financial sectors. Tokenization, as defined by the report, involves creating digital programmable versions of real-world assets that can be exchanged and tracked using blockchain or other distributed ledger technologies. Bank of America views this as a long-term infrastructure evolution, comparable to the adoption timelines of innovations like radio and television. The institution projects that both public and private markets will increasingly adopt tokenized frameworks over time. Not All Tokens Are Equally Necessary One of the central distinctions made in the research is between “crypto” tokens and tokenized traditional assets. The report stresses that tokenized assets should not be conflated with cryptocurrency. Instead, it points out that distributed ledger systems can be used in a permissioned, private manner without relying on public networks or crypto incentives. These systems can facilitate secure, regulated interactions for financial institutions while minimizing reliance on intermediaries. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Crypto tokens, in contrast, are necessary for public blockchain ecosystems. They reward participants for validating transactions and maintaining the network’s integrity. However, the report downplays the long-term utility of most existing crypto tokens, describing many as unnecessary or redundant. The prediction that 99% of crypto assets will disappear is grounded in the view that most tokens do not provide lasting utility and exist primarily for speculation or short-term experimentation. BofA’s Role and the Broader Implications The report from BofA Global Research appears to support a vision where tokenization becomes embedded into regulated, permissioned systems, particularly through the use of distributed ledgers that do not rely on public cryptocurrencies. This reflects a broader trend among financial institutions that aim to harness blockchain efficiency without embracing the volatility and decentralized nature of crypto markets. If BofA’s forecast is accurate, it implies a consolidation of utility across a small number of projects with strong fundamentals, while the majority of current tokens may ultimately fade from relevance or disappear entirely.

This rapid unwinding of positions sent ripples through the trading community, contributing to an even larger sum of $339 million in liquidations over the past 24 hours. If you are involved in crypto trading, especially with leverage, understanding these events is crucial. This article breaks down what happened and how you can navigate such volatile conditions. What is Crypto Futures Liquidation and Why Does It Happen? When we talk about crypto futures liquidation , we are referring to the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange. This occurs because the trader’s margin balance has fallen below the minimum required level to maintain the open position. Essentially, the market moved against their bet, and they ran out of collateral to cover the potential losses. These large-scale liquidations are often a direct consequence of the inherent cryptocurrency market volatility . Prices can swing wildly in short periods, especially in the derivatives market where traders use borrowed funds to amplify their potential gains. While leverage can boost profits, it also significantly magnifies losses, making positions highly susceptible to sudden price movements. The Perils of Leveraged Trading Dangers: Are You at Risk? Leveraged trading allows you to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. For instance, with 10x leverage, a $1,000 investment can control $10,000 worth of crypto. However, this comes with significant leveraged trading dangers . If the market moves against your position by even a small percentage, your entire initial margin can be wiped out, leading to liquidation. The recent $138 million liquidation event serves as a stark reminder of these risks. Many traders likely saw their positions forcibly closed, resulting in substantial losses. It highlights how quickly fortunes can change in a highly leveraged environment, emphasizing the need for robust risk management strategies. How Does a Liquidation Cascade Affect the Market? A single liquidation can trigger a chain reaction, known as a liquidation cascade . When a large number of leveraged positions are liquidated simultaneously, the forced selling pressure can push prices down even further. This downward spiral then triggers more liquidations, creating a domino effect that exacerbates market downturns. This is why a $138 million liquidation in an hour can have a much broader impact than just the immediate losses. This cascade effect contributes heavily to market instability and can create panic among traders. Understanding this mechanism helps you anticipate potential market movements and react more strategically, rather than getting caught off guard by rapid price drops. Mitigating Futures Trading Risks: Smart Strategies for Traders Navigating the unpredictable waters of cryptocurrency requires careful planning, especially when engaging in futures trading. Here are some actionable insights to help you manage futures trading risks and protect your capital: Use Stop-Loss Orders: Always set a stop-loss order to automatically close your position if the price reaches a certain level, limiting your potential losses. Manage Your Leverage: Avoid excessively high leverage. While tempting, it drastically increases your risk of liquidation. Consider lower leverage ratios, especially if you are new to futures trading. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your capital into one highly leveraged position. Spread your investments across different assets and strategies to reduce overall risk. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, technical analysis, and macroeconomic factors that can influence crypto prices. Knowledge is your best defense against unexpected volatility. Practice Emotional Discipline: Avoid making impulsive decisions based on fear (FUD) or greed (FOMO). Stick to your trading plan and risk management rules, even when the market is chaotic. The recent significant crypto futures liquidation underscores the inherent volatility and risks in the derivatives market. While these events can be alarming, they also serve as crucial lessons for traders. By understanding the mechanics of liquidations, acknowledging the dangers of excessive leverage, and implementing sound risk management practices, you can better navigate the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape. Always prioritize capital preservation and make informed decisions to stay resilient in this exciting yet challenging market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly is crypto futures liquidation? Crypto futures liquidation is when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s leveraged position because their margin (collateral) is no longer sufficient to cover potential losses from adverse price movements. How does leverage contribute to liquidations? Leverage amplifies both gains and losses. With high leverage, even a small price movement against your position can deplete your margin quickly, triggering a liquidation as you no longer have enough collateral to maintain the trade. Can I completely avoid liquidation in crypto futures trading? While you cannot eliminate all risk, you can significantly reduce your chances of liquidation by using proper risk management, such as setting stop-loss orders, avoiding excessive leverage, and maintaining sufficient margin in your account. Are large liquidations always bad for the overall crypto market? Large liquidations can signal increased volatility and often lead to price drops in the short term due to forced selling. However, they can also ‘cleanse’ the market of over-leveraged positions, potentially setting the stage for more stable price action in the long run. What are the signs of high cryptocurrency market volatility? Signs of high volatility include rapid and unpredictable price swings, large trading volumes, significant changes in funding rates for futures contracts, and major news events impacting the crypto space.

According to a Ripple-backed report, since 2020, banks around the world have invested over $100 billion into blockchain infrastructure. This trend, backed by data and institutional momentum, strategically positions Ripple to capture a portion of the $155 trillion cross-border payments market currently facilitated by SWIFT. As of 2025, 345 banks have incorporated blockchain-based technology into their financial operations. According to Ripple’s recent findings , institutions such as HSBC, Goldman Sachs, and SBI Holdings are leading the charge. HSBC is leveraging blockchain to digitize gold trading, while SBI is actively developing a quantum-resistant digital currency. These efforts highlight how blockchain is not merely a peripheral experiment for banks but is becoming central to their modernization efforts.

A key aspect of this strategy includes pursuing a banking license in the United States, which would allow Ripple’s integration into the regulated financial landscape. The company’s XRPL platform, with its focus on speed, compliance, and scalability, stands out among blockchain systems considered viable for replacing or complementing SWIFT’s aging cross-border payment network. Ripple’s technology is especially well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for real-time settlements and programmable money. The company has increasingly emphasized the role of stablecoins—digital assets pegged to fiat currencies—for instant payments. According to data from CB Insights, the global stablecoin market is expected to grow tenfold between 2024 and 2025. The anticipated surge in usage of RLUSD, USDT, and USDC aligns with Ripple’s ambitions in both payment processing and liquidity provisioning. Ripple’s Potential Stake in SWIFT’s Market The $155 trillion handled annually by SWIFT is under scrutiny from financial leaders worldwide, many of whom recognize the potential for blockchain-based solutions to reduce costs and increase transparency. Ripple’s XRP Ledger has been identified as one of the top blockchain platforms capable of playing a major role in this market shift. As banks move to modernize their payment infrastructure, Ripple’s ongoing push for institutional adoption could align with the broader financial sector’s goals. CB Insights’ contribution to the joint report emphasizes the alignment between financial institutions and blockchain innovators. “Over 90% of financial industry leaders acknowledge that blockchain and digital assets are now critical to the financial landscape,” the report states. This indicates a strong consensus among institutions, which positions Ripple’s solutions as potentially foundational to next-generation payment infrastructure. Implications of the Institutional Shift The influx of more than $100 billion into crypto and blockchain infrastructure by financial institutions over five years illustrates the scale of transformation already underway. This is not speculative capital, but rather targeted investment in the development of regulated, scalable systems capable of supporting mainstream financial activity. Ripple’s inclusion in the top 25 most valuable tech firms, alongside companies such as Discord, Epic Games, and Canva, further underscores its strategic market position. As blockchain adoption grows among banks and stablecoin use rises, Ripple appears ready to capitalize on a rapidly evolving financial ecosystem. @Ripple now ranks among the Top 25 most valuable private companies in the world with a $15B+ valuation, per CB Insights! #23 on the list right behind the giants. #XRP #Ripple pic.twitter.com/I5PK6rfzzv — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) August 4, 2025 With regulatory developments advancing and institutional alignment increasing, Ripple is emerging as one of the most credible blockchain-based solutions aiming to secure a meaningful share of SWIFT’s global transaction volume.

During a recorded segment, the SWIFT speaker noted that the organization serves as a registration authority for ISO 20022, carrying out development and maintenance work while emphasizing that the standard is not exclusive to the SWIFT network. The official explained that many market infrastructures and institutions already use ISO 20022 outside of SWIFT’s systems, and that its utility extends beyond any single network. The SWIFT official further clarified that while ISO 20022 is often linked with XML syntax, it is, in fact, syntax agnostic. This allows for adoption across multiple technological formats, enabling broader interoperability. The representative also pointed to the growing trend of APIs and blockchain developments leveraging the ISO data dictionary. By noting that blockchains are already being built using ISO 20022’s framework, SWIFT has effectively acknowledged the convergence between traditional financial messaging standards and emerging distributed ledger technologies.

This universal model would unify financial communications across different infrastructures, both domestically and cross-border. The SWIFT official referred to ongoing migration processes, where cross-border systems and domestic infrastructures are transitioning to ISO 20022 in parallel. This shift is designed to standardize messaging formats globally, providing greater efficiency and compatibility between different financial systems. What stands out is the explicit recognition that ISO 20022 can be integrated with blockchain, marking a notable development for interoperability between conventional banking systems and decentralized networks. By stating that the ISO data dictionary is already forming the basis for blockchain development, SWIFT has reinforced the possibility of a future where digital assets and traditional payment systems operate within the same standardized communication framework. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Reaction to SWIFT’s Remarks In response to the remarks, X user Darius Ellis commented that the acknowledgment represents a significant step forward. According to Ellis, SWIFT’s direct association of blockchain with ISO 20022 demonstrates that traditional financial infrastructure and digital asset systems are moving closer to full interoperability. This reflects a growing recognition among established financial institutions of blockchain’s potential in mainstream payment processing and data exchange. As migrations progress and more institutions adopt ISO 20022 in blockchain applications, the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset economy may continue to narrow, paving the way for more seamless cross-platform transactions in the global financial system.

But in recent times, WIF and BONK have failed to deliver serious profits. Instead, they’ve depreciated and fallen out of favour amongst investors. That is why the arrival of Layer Brett (LBRETT) is drawing loads of attention. According to veteran industry watchers, this new project promises up to 30,000% ROI and this article explains why experts believe it could happen. Why crypto experts are getting behind Layer Brett Crypto experts are bullish about LayerBrett because of three major reasons. Firstly, LBRETT stands tall amongst meme coins by offering real-world utility. Backed by Ethereum’s sturdy network, it allows anyone to make lightning fast transactions at an extremely cheap rate. In this manner, LBRETT helps scale Ethereum whilst offering exposure to meme virality. In addition to that, LayerBrett offers its users a mouth-watering staking rewards to the tune of 25,000% APY . This reward has proven irresistible to the crypto world and it explains how LBRETT is rapidly gaining traction online. Launched barely a month ago, it is getting mentioned on major tabloids and looks set to go viral at any moment. Finally, crypto experts are backing LayerBrett because of its tremendous ROI potential. Being a new meme token with real-world utility, LBRETT has loads of room for growth. Even though it is still in presale, it has already made its way to the portfolios of numerous investors. As a result, industry watchers have predicted a potential return of 30,000% for early LBRETT investors. But given how sensational LBRETT’s presale has been, there’s a decent chance the actual profit overshadows this prediction. BONK coin struggles as institutional sell-off triggers sharp decline In the first week of August, over $59 billion worth of BONK tokens was dumped on the open market. This liquidation triggered cascading sell-orders, tanking BONK price by over 20% in less than 24 hours. BONK price in the last year. Source: CoinGecko This crash represents a 41% from BONK coin’s July peak of $0.00004074. BONK currently struggles to maintain support above $0.00002345 and based on its recent performance, the future looks concerning for BONK. BONK price predictions for the rest of 2025 remain modest. But there’s little optimism amongst BONK holders given its lack of momentum. That is why they are moving on to greener pastures. WIF faces critical resistance test as momentum wanes Like BONK and other Solana meme coins, Dogwifhat is also experiencing serious selling pressure. WIF is down by almost 75% year-to-date with its price fluctuating wildly in the last couple of months. Source: WIVERIDERS/CoinMarketCap Dogwifhat is currently trading in a bearish channel, with little suggestion the tide might turn anytime soon. It is testing a resistance zone around $0.94 with analysts placing critical support at $0.87. A breakout might signal renewed buyer strength, and if sustained, could help WIF recover the grounds it lost over the last couple of months. The bottom line – BRETT trumps BONK, WIF, other Solana meme coins In the end, smart money will always move to superior projects, and right now, they’re gravitating towards LayerBrett. Unlike BONK, WIF and most Solana meme coins, it packs real-world utility and promises mouthwatering benefits for early users. That is why its presale , available at a token of just $0.004 is selling out fast. It’s hardly surprising that experts are banking on it to rake in a profit of 30,000% for early investors! Don’t just watch the next big thing happen, stake your claim early. Visit Layer Brett to get your $LBRETT before the crypto presale ends.

Recently, one such ETH whale , known by the wallet address 0x3c9E, has captured attention with a fascinating sequence of trades that could offer insights into current market sentiment and the future Ethereum price trajectory. Decoding the ETH Whale’s Bold Moves About a week ago, this particular ETH whale executed a substantial sell-off. On-chain analyst Lookonchain reported that the wallet offloaded a staggering 38,582 ETH. This transaction was valued at approximately $136.9 million, with each token sold at an average price of $3,548 during a notable market downturn. Such a large move naturally sparked discussions about potential further price dips. However, the narrative took an intriguing turn. As Ethereum began its recent impressive recovery, the very same whale made a decisive return to the market. They purchased 1,800 ETH for roughly $7.22 million, this time at a higher average price of $4,010 per token. This sequence of selling low and buying high, or rather, selling before a dip and buying back after a recovery, raises many questions about their strategy. What Does This Crypto Trading Strategy Imply? The whale’s actions provide a compelling case study in advanced crypto trading . Selling a large position during a market slump and then re-entering at a higher price point suggests several possibilities: Risk Management: The initial sell-off might have been a calculated move to de-risk during perceived instability, protecting a substantial portion of their capital. Profit Taking and Re-positioning: It’s possible the whale locked in profits from earlier, lower entry points and then decided to re-enter, perhaps anticipating further gains or seeing new opportunities. Market Conviction: Buying back at a higher price indicates strong conviction in Ethereum’s long-term value and an expectation of continued market recovery . They might believe the recent dip was merely a temporary correction. This kind of sophisticated play is common among experienced traders who utilize deep on-chain analysis to inform their decisions, looking beyond immediate price fluctuations. Impact on Ethereum Price and Investor Psychology The actions of significant players like this ETH whale often ripple through the broader market. When such a large entity buys back into an asset, it can instill confidence among other investors, potentially contributing to further upward momentum for the Ethereum price . It suggests that even those with immense capital believe in the asset’s future, reinforcing a positive sentiment. For individual investors, this event serves as a powerful reminder: Whales are not infallible: While their moves are noteworthy, they are not always predictive of future price action. They operate on different scales and with different risk tolerances. Long-term vision: The whale’s re-entry, despite a higher buy-in price, hints at a long-term bullish outlook for Ethereum. Importance of research: Always conduct your own thorough research (DYOR) before making investment decisions. Navigating the Waves: Actionable Insights for You Understanding the moves of large players can be insightful, but it’s crucial to adapt these observations to your own investment strategy. Don’t blindly follow. Instead, consider: Monitoring On-Chain Data: Tools for on-chain analysis can provide valuable context, showing how large holders are moving assets. This can help you gauge overall market sentiment. Risk Assessment: Always assess your personal risk tolerance. What works for a whale with millions might not work for a smaller investor. Diversification: Spreading your investments across various assets can mitigate risk, rather than putting all your eggs in one basket, even if an ETH whale seems confident. This whale’s latest maneuver underscores the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the crypto market. Their decision to re-engage with Ethereum at a higher valuation, following a massive sell-off, speaks volumes about their confidence in Ethereum’s continued ascent and the broader market recovery . In conclusion, the strategic re-entry of this significant ETH whale into the Ethereum market is a compelling event. It highlights the intricate dance of large-scale crypto trading , driven by calculated risk management and strong belief in future appreciation. While their actions offer a glimpse into institutional-level conviction, individual investors should always prioritize their own research and risk parameters when navigating the volatile yet promising world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Who is the ETH whale mentioned in the article? The ETH whale refers to a large investor whose wallet address begins with 0x3c9E. Their substantial holdings and trading volumes can significantly influence market dynamics. 2. Why did the ETH whale sell and then buy back at a higher price? The whale’s strategy likely involved risk management during a market downturn and then re-entry with strong conviction in Ethereum’s future. They may have taken profits or repositioned their portfolio, anticipating further market recovery . 3. What is on-chain analysis and how does it relate to this event? On-chain analysis involves examining transactions recorded on a blockchain. Analysts like Lookonchain use this data to track the movements of large holders, providing insights into their strategies and potential market impacts. 4. How might this whale’s actions affect the Ethereum price? When a large ETH whale buys back into Ethereum, it can signal confidence in the asset, potentially encouraging other investors and contributing to positive momentum for the Ethereum price . 5. What can individual investors learn from this ETH whale’s strategy? Individual investors can learn the importance of risk management, long-term vision, and conducting thorough personal research (DYOR) rather than blindly following large investors’ moves in crypto trading .

This key metric, which tracks Ethereum’s performance against Bitcoin, briefly soared to 0.036, reaching its highest level since February, according to data from Binance. Currently sitting around 0.03575, this represents a notable 4.02% increase over the past 24 hours. This movement holds crucial implications for the Ethereum price , Bitcoin’s overall Bitcoin dominance , and could signal significant shifts within the broader cryptocurrency market . Why Does the ETH/BTC Ratio Matter So Much? Understanding the ETH/BTC ratio is essential for any crypto enthusiast or investor. It provides a clear snapshot of whether Ethereum is gaining strength relative to Bitcoin, or vice-versa. When this ratio rises, it suggests that capital might be flowing from Bitcoin into Ethereum, and potentially into other altcoins. Market Sentiment: A rising ratio often indicates growing confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem and its potential. Altcoin Performance: Ethereum’s strength can act as a bellwether for the wider altcoin market, sometimes preceding an Altcoin season . Portfolio Diversification: Investors use this ratio to assess their exposure to different assets within their crypto portfolio. A sustained increase in the ratio challenges the narrative of unwavering Bitcoin dominance , suggesting a more diversified and mature crypto landscape. What’s Fueling Ethereum’s Impressive Ascent? Several compelling factors contribute to the recent surge in the ETH/BTC ratio . While the exact reasons are multifaceted, market observers point to a combination of technical developments and fundamental strength. These elements are collectively bolstering the Ethereum price and its standing against Bitcoin. Continuous Network Upgrades: Ethereum’s consistent roadmap of network advancements, including scalability solutions, continues to build strong developer and user confidence, aiming for faster and cheaper transactions. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Backbone: Ethereum remains the undisputed foundation for a vast majority of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols. Sustained growth in DeFi drives persistent demand for ETH, not only for transaction fees (gas) but also as collateral. NFT Market Activity: Renewed interest and significant trading volumes in Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), largely built on the Ethereum blockchain, boost network activity and demand for ETH. Staking Yields: The attractive staking yields offered to participants who lock up their ETH to secure the network also provide a compelling incentive for holding Ethereum, reducing selling pressure. These powerful elements collectively strengthen Ethereum’s position, making it an increasingly attractive alternative to Bitcoin for some investors. This dynamic shift is certainly capturing widespread attention across the entire cryptocurrency market . Navigating the Dynamic Cryptocurrency Market: What’s Next for Investors? The current significant movement in the ETH/BTC ratio prompts important questions for every investor. Is this the definitive start of a sustained trend, or merely a temporary fluctuation within a volatile market? While no one can predict the future with absolute certainty, understanding the underlying dynamics and potential scenarios can empower you to make more informed investment decisions. Consider these critical points as you assess the landscape: Inherent Volatility Remains: The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile. Price movements, including the Ethereum price , can reverse quickly and unexpectedly. Always exercise caution and manage risk effectively. Bitcoin’s Enduring Influence: Despite Ethereum’s recent gains, Bitcoin still holds significant sway as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Its performance often dictates the overall direction and sentiment of the broader cryptocurrency market . Potential for an Altcoin Season: If the ETH/BTC ratio continues its upward trajectory and sustains its strength, it could indeed signal the broader arrival of an Altcoin season , where many smaller cryptocurrencies often experience substantial gains as investor confidence and capital flow into the wider altcoin ecosystem. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic conditions, interest rate policies, and global regulatory developments also play a crucial role in shaping crypto market trends. Monitoring key on-chain indicators, technical analysis patterns, and staying updated on global macroeconomic news is paramount. While the recent surge in the ETH/BTC ratio is undoubtedly exciting, maintaining a balanced perspective on both potential rewards and inherent risks remains crucial for long-term success. A Pivotal Shift in the Crypto Landscape? The recent spike in the ETH/BTC ratio to its highest point since February marks a truly significant moment in the current cryptocurrency market cycle. This powerful movement highlights Ethereum’s growing strength, its increasing utility, and its undeniable potential to challenge the long-standing narrative of absolute Bitcoin dominance . As the crypto ecosystem continues to evolve at a rapid pace, the intricate interplay between these two digital asset giants will undoubtedly continue to shape market trends and create new, compelling opportunities for investors globally. Whether this signals a definitive and prolonged Altcoin season or represents a temporary but impactful shift, it unequivocally underscores the dynamic, complex, and ever-changing nature of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does the ETH/BTC ratio signify? A1: The ETH/BTC ratio indicates Ethereum’s price performance relative to Bitcoin’s. A rising ratio means Ethereum is gaining value faster than Bitcoin, while a falling ratio suggests Bitcoin is outperforming Ethereum. Q2: Why is the ETH/BTC ratio hitting its highest level since February important? A2: This milestone suggests a significant shift in investor sentiment, potentially indicating increased confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem and a possible rotation of capital from Bitcoin into altcoins. It challenges the prevailing narrative of complete Bitcoin dominance. Q3: Does a rising ETH/BTC ratio always mean an Altcoin Season is coming? A3: While a rising ETH/BTC ratio is often a strong indicator and precursor to an Altcoin Season, it’s not a guarantee. Other market factors, such as overall cryptocurrency market sentiment and macroeconomic conditions, also play a role. It suggests increased appetite for riskier assets. Q4: How does Ethereum’s price relate to the ETH/BTC ratio? A4: The ETH/BTC ratio directly influences the perception and relative strength of Ethereum’s price. When the ratio increases, it implies that Ethereum’s price is either rising faster than Bitcoin’s or falling slower, making ETH a more attractive asset in that period. Q5: What are the key factors supporting Ethereum’s recent strength? A5: Ethereum’s strength is primarily supported by ongoing network upgrades, its dominant role in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem, continued activity in the NFT market, and attractive staking yields offered to network participants.

Analysts are revising their Ethereum price predictions, saying the ETH price will increase as ETH 2.0 scaling upgrades continue to roll out. Also, recent upgrades and improvements in the blockchain and reduced gas fees have convinced many that Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin in the next leg of the bull market. Ethereum Price Prediction: What Analysts Are Seeing? Market sentiment is good at the moment. ETH price pushed past $3,500 resistance with more than $5 billion weekly inflows to ETH ETFs in the past month. According to analysts, if ETH 2.0 scales, Ethereum may revisit its all-time high of nearly $4,900 before the end of 2025. Other analysts believe the ETH price will peak at a new all-time high of 10,000 and as high as 12,000 by next summer. A few hours ago, Ali Martinez revealed that more than 1.8 million Ethereum tokens were purchased last month. This amount of purchase means the whales are buying and positioning ahead of a massive uptrend. Source: Ali_chart via X. All Ethereum price predictions from almost all ends are bullish. And beyond ETH 2.0, rapid adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and Layer 2 solutions is also one of the key drivers of a bullish sentiment While Ethereum price predictions are bullish, investors are instead investing in projects with smaller market caps and high-growth opportunities that can deliver massive returns.

ChatGPT Gives Bullish Predictions for DOGE and MAXI,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/dogecoin-to-1-before-2026-chatgpt-gives-bullish-predictions-for-doge-and-maxi/,"ChatGPT’s ability to analyze data and predict trends has greatly improved this year, and it’s becoming an essential tool for analysts working on crypto price predictions. So with Dogecoin up 6% today and showing renewed momentum, we asked ChatGPT how high it might go before the end of the year. Specifically, we wanted to know if it could finally reach the coveted $1 mark. The chatbot provided an optimistic outlook for the leading meme coin, while also highlighting emerging Dogecoin competitor Maxi Doge as a higher-potential alternative. This is because smaller, viral meme coins often outperform larger ones due to the lower liquidity required to pump up their prices, as well as investors’ increased appetite for risk in bull markets. Dogecoin Set to Rally as Retail Investors Return Dogecoin has exhibited impressive momentum this year with a 112% increase, and it is also performing well on shorter timeframes with a 6% gain today. ChatGPT points out that it’s surpassing most other major altcoins, which is a promising sign for its upcoming potential. The chatbot then highlights a renewed retail interest in the meme coins space. An easy way to see this is through Google Trends data, which shows a clear spike for the search term ‘meme coins’ since July. Moreover, ChatGPT notes that Elon Musk continues to tease integrating $DOGE for payments into X. If that happens, it would likely boost demand significantly, driven both by actual utility and by FOMO-fueled speculation. Finally, the chatbot suggests that if the Dogecoin developer community releases a roadmap or new utilities, it could help drive up its price. Although there are no signs of this happening yet, the team might be waiting for the perfect announcement moment, like when excitement is at its peak, in an effort to maximize impact. ChatGPT’s Dogecoin Price Targets and Potential Risks Ultimately, ChatGPT’s Dogecoin price forecast is overwhelmingly bullish. It highlights that Dogecoin remains the world’s largest meme coin, a trendsetter, and a first mover. This gives it an inherent advantage to rally as the market climbs, especially with support from Elon Musk. Regarding its growth potential, ChatGPT predicts a short-term increase to $0.35–$0.45 by October, followed by a parabolic mid-term move to between $0.75–$1.00 by the end of 2025. Regarding risks, ChatGPT identified two main concerns. The first is that the meme coin market is highly competitive, with hundreds of promising alternatives available. Many meme coins could outperform $DOGE during bullish periods due to their lower market caps, which diverts investor attention and dampens Dogecoin’s parabolic potential. Second, Dogecoin’s supply is inflationary, which means it gradually grows over time. This conflicts with crypto’s core principle of fixed supply and inflation-resistant tokenomics. So, while Dogecoin is indeed bullish, there’s a real chance that investors are leaving gains on the table unless they’re diversifying into other meme coins. ChatGPT mentioned Maxi Doge as an alternative that could be a strong performer. Let’s explore its $MAXI price prediction. Trending Meme Coin Presale ‘Maxi Doge’ Poised to 195X, Says ChatGPT While ChatGPT predicts a 5x increase for Dogecoin in the most optimistic scenario, that same scenario could lead to an astonishing 195x, or 19,500% rally for Maxi Doge , according to the chatbot. ChatGPT highlights several factors that it believes make Maxi Doge one of the top opportunities on the market today. First, the project is currently undergoing a presale and has raised $440,000 in its first week. It’s off to a strong start with plenty of investor demand, but its early presale stage means there’s plenty of room left to pump. Additionally, Maxi Doge aligns well with the new meme coin “degen” trend. ChatGPT explains, “Dogecoin, while still relevant, increasingly feels like a boomer meme in a space obsessed with novelty. Maxi Doge, by contrast, leans into the modern meme trend.” It also notes that the project has a fixed supply, making it scarce and enabling its price to “move exponentially faster.” Considering the project’s utilities, such as staking, integrations into futures trading platforms, and community giveaways, ChatGPT suggests that $MAXI could reach $0.03 in a “meme supercycle.” Even in a conservative scenario, the chatbot targets $0.012, which would be a 47x increase from its current price. Such gains would be nearly impossible for Dogecoin due to its massive $30 billion market capitalization. Whether or not $MAXI achieves these returns remains to be seen, but the project’s strong narrative and early-stage position certainly indicate significant growth potential.

Remember, the crypto market is dynamic; always invest responsibly and only what you can afford to lose. Consider these actionable insights: Diversify: Don’t put all your funds into one asset. Research: Understand the technology and purpose of each crypto. Long-Term View: Focus on projects with strong fundamentals for sustained growth. Risk Management: Only invest what you are comfortable losing. The surpassing of the $4 trillion crypto market cap is a clear indicator of the digital asset space’s growing maturity and undeniable impact. It signifies a new era where cryptocurrencies play an increasingly vital role in global finance.

It underpins vast ecosystems like DeFi and NFTs, driving innovation and utility in the digital asset space. 4. What factors influence digital asset valuation? Factors influencing digital asset valuation include network utility, developer activity, user adoption, tokenomics (how a token is designed and managed), supply and demand dynamics, and overall market sentiment. 5. Is it a good time for crypto investment given this milestone? While the $4 trillion milestone shows strong growth, all crypto investment carries inherent risks due to market volatility. It is crucial to conduct thorough research, diversify your portfolio, and only invest funds you are prepared to lose. This milestone indicates potential, but responsible investing remains paramount.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with exciting news! BNB, the native token of the Binance ecosystem, has just achieved a monumental milestone. Its BNB market cap has surged past the $112 billion mark, reaching an impressive $112.2 billion. This remarkable achievement, as reported by 8marketcap, positions BNB as the 191st largest global asset. It also means that this prominent BNB cryptocurrency has officially surpassed established traditional financial entities like DBS Bank and Strategy in terms of valuation. This is more than just a number; it signifies a powerful shift in the financial landscape. BNB Market Cap Reaches New Heights: What Does This Remarkable Achievement Mean? When the BNB market cap crosses such a significant threshold, it sends a clear signal across the entire financial world. Surpassing a well-established institution like DBS Bank, a major player in traditional finance, highlights the increasing influence and acceptance of digital assets. This isn’t just about BNB; it reflects a broader trend in the crypto market cap , where cryptocurrencies are steadily gaining ground and legitimacy. For investors and enthusiasts, it reinforces the potential for substantial growth and innovation within the blockchain space. What makes this milestone particularly noteworthy? Growing Confidence: It shows increasing investor confidence in BNB’s utility and the Binance ecosystem. Market Maturity: Such valuations indicate a maturing crypto market, attracting more mainstream attention. Global Recognition: BNB is now recognized among a wider array of global assets, not just within the crypto niche. Understanding the Drivers Behind BNB’s Impressive Digital Asset Valuation How has BNB managed such impressive BNB growth to achieve this staggering digital asset valuation ? Several key factors contribute to its success and robust market position: Binance Ecosystem Utility: BNB is integral to the Binance ecosystem, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. It’s used for transaction fee discounts, participation in token sales on Binance Launchpad, and more. This strong utility creates consistent demand. BNB Burning Mechanism: Binance regularly conducts BNB burning events, permanently removing a portion of BNB from circulation. This deflationary mechanism reduces supply, which can naturally increase the value of the remaining tokens. Strategic Partnerships and Development: Continuous development of Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and strategic partnerships expand BNB’s use cases beyond the exchange, driving further adoption and value. These elements combined create a compelling narrative for BNB’s sustained growth and its rising stature among global digital assets. Is the Crypto Market Cap Reshaping Global Finance? The rise of the BNB market cap is a microcosm of a larger phenomenon: the increasing challenge cryptocurrencies pose to traditional finance. The fact that a digital asset can quickly surpass long-standing banks in valuation signals a fundamental shift in how wealth is perceived and generated. The broader crypto market is constantly evolving, presenting both opportunities and challenges. While volatility remains a factor, the continuous innovation and adoption of blockchain technology suggest a future where digital assets play an even more central role in the global economy. This shift encourages us to reconsider traditional investment paradigms and embrace the potential of decentralized finance. The impressive BNB growth serves as a powerful reminder that the financial world is undergoing a significant transformation. In conclusion, BNB’s astonishing achievement of a $112 billion market cap is far more than just a number. It’s a testament to the incredible potential of BNB cryptocurrency and the broader digital asset space. It underscores the ongoing shift in global finance, where innovative blockchain technologies are increasingly challenging and redefining traditional valuations. This milestone not only celebrates BNB’s success but also highlights the growing mainstream acceptance and impact of cryptocurrencies worldwide. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is BNB cryptocurrency? BNB (Build and Build, formerly Binance Coin) is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance ecosystem. It was initially launched as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain but later migrated to its own blockchain, the Binance Chain, and then to Binance Smart Chain (BSC), now known as BNB Chain. It serves various utilities, including paying transaction fees, participating in token sales, and more. How is BNB’s market cap calculated? A cryptocurrency’s market capitalization is calculated by multiplying its current circulating supply by its current market price. For example, if there are 100 million BNB tokens in circulation and each token is priced at $1,122, the BNB market cap would be $112.2 billion. Why is BNB surpassing traditional banks significant? BNB surpassing traditional financial institutions like DBS Bank in market capitalization is significant because it illustrates the rapid growth and increasing legitimacy of digital assets. It shows that cryptocurrencies are no longer niche investments but are becoming major players capable of rivaling established global financial entities. What factors contribute to BNB’s growth? Several factors contribute to BNB’s consistent growth, including its extensive utility within the Binance ecosystem, the regular BNB burning mechanism that reduces supply, and the continuous development and expansion of the BNB Chain (formerly Binance Smart Chain), which drives adoption and new use cases for the token. Is BNB a good investment? Investing in any cryptocurrency, including BNB, carries inherent risks due to market volatility. While BNB has shown significant growth and has strong utility within the Binance ecosystem, it’s crucial for potential investors to conduct their own thorough research, understand the risks, and consider their financial situation before making any investment decisions.

49786277,https://timestabloid.com/?p=77553,1754720197,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Google Gemini Predicts Cardano (ADA) Price for August 31, 2025",https://timestabloid.com/google-gemini-predicts-cardano-ada-price-for-august-31-2025/,"Cardano (ADA) has recently shown notable upward momentum, currently trading at $0.80, representing a 2.2% increase over the last 24 hours. Against this backdrop, we’ve asked Google’s Gemini AI for insight into ADA’s potential price movements in August and price targets for August 31. Gemini outlined three distinct scenarios for ADA, basing its analysis on the current market conditions, developments, and historical patterns. Its analysis begins by placing the prediction within the broader cryptocurrency market cycle. According to the chatbot, Bitcoin is in its post-halving bullish phase. Altcoins historically trail Bitcoin’s major moves before experiencing their surges, and Bitcoin hit a new all-time high in July. Following this logic, Gemini expects massive growth from ADA in August. Gemini highlights governance upgrades in the Voltaire era and the growing use of DeFi and stablecoins on the network as positive drivers. However, the AI also notes that competition from other prominent assets could hold ADA back, keeping projections realistic rather than overly speculative. Cardano (ADA) Bearish Scenario Under the bearish case, Gemini assumes that Bitcoin stagnates and macroeconomic conditions worsen. In this situation, Cardano’s price could fall between $0.65 and $0.80 by August 31, 2025. This range implies a potential decline from current levels, but also a chance that ADA will remain stagnant. The AI suggests ADA could still perform better than many smaller-cap cryptocurrencies because of its strong community and ongoing development . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Cardano (ADA) Base Case Scenario The base case is described as the most likely outcome by Gemini. It assumes a bullish but not euphoric market environment, with Cardano successfully delivering its upgrades without major setbacks. Under these circumstances, ADA is projected to trade between $0.95 and $1.30. This range would represent a gain of roughly 19% to 51% from its current price. Other analysts have predicted similar targets for ADA , and Gemini states that the “base case feels most realistic.” It places ADA at around $1.05 by the target date, with the possibility of moving toward the higher end of the range if the broader market remains strong through late 2025. Cardano (ADA) Bullish Scenario In the bullish case, Gemini envisions a strong altseason coinciding with further Bitcoin growth. In this environment, Cardano could see significant adoption in both decentralized finance and enterprise applications. Under such conditions, ADA’s price could rise to between $1.40 and $1.80, marking potential gains of 76% to 126% from current levels. With ADA currently trading below $0.80, Gemini’s base case target of $1.05 suggests moderate but meaningful upside potential over the next month.

This bold prediction comes after Ethereum decisively broke past its crucial $4,000 double-top resistance, signaling strong bullish momentum and setting the stage for a potential crypto bull market . What Drives Jack Yi’s Ethereum Prediction? Jack Yi, a prominent figure and founder of LD Capital, shared his insights on X, highlighting the significant breakout of Ethereum above the $4,000 mark. This technical milestone is a key indicator for many analysts, suggesting further upside potential for Ethereum prediction . His analysis extends beyond just the price, also eyeing a specific ratio against Bitcoin, reinforcing the optimistic crypto bull market sentiment. Yi’s forecast isn’t just a round number; it’s rooted in market dynamics and technical analysis. He believes that reaching a record high of $5,000 for Ethereum is now a tangible goal, a key part of his overall ETH price target . Moreover, he expects the ETH/BTC ratio to climb to 0.1, indicating a strengthening of Ethereum’s position relative to Bitcoin. This ratio is crucial for many investors, as it often precedes periods of significant altcoin outperformance. Navigating the Crypto Bull Market: A Strategy for Success Even in a strong uptrend, market movements are rarely linear. Jack Yi anticipates that the climb towards his $5K ETH price target will include natural pullbacks. This perspective informs his favored strategy for the current crypto bull market : buying on dips. This approach aligns perfectly with the opportunities presented by a burgeoning altcoin season . What does ‘buying on dips’ mean for investors in this exciting phase? Strategic Entry: Instead of chasing pumps, investors wait for temporary price corrections to acquire assets at lower valuations, optimizing their entry points in the crypto bull market . Risk Management: This approach can help reduce the average cost of holdings and potentially improve overall returns, even as we eye the ambitious ETH price target . Long-Term Vision: It aligns with a belief in the asset’s fundamental strength and future growth, even amidst short-term volatility, supporting a long-term Ethereum prediction . Furthermore, the broader economic landscape plays a significant role in Yi’s outlook. With growing expectations for interest rate cuts, a more favorable environment for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, could emerge. This sentiment fuels the anticipation of an ‘altcoin season’. Is an Altcoin Season on the Horizon? LD Capital’s Insights The term ‘altcoin season’ excites many in the crypto community, referring to a period when alternative cryptocurrencies see substantial gains, often outperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum. Jack Yi firmly believes that with rate-cut expectations building, conditions are ripe for this phenomenon, presenting immense opportunities for investors. This outlook is a key part of LD Capital’s analysis . LD Capital’s research report sheds light on specific projects they consider ‘high-conviction tokens’ with potential for tenfold upside. These are projects that could particularly benefit from Ethereum’s anticipated gains and the overall positive sentiment in the market during an altcoin season . ENA: Ethena, a synthetic dollar protocol, is highlighted. Positive news regarding its treasury could provide additional catalysts for growth. AAVE: A decentralized lending protocol, Aave stands to gain from increased activity and liquidity within the DeFi ecosystem as Ethereum flourishes, contributing to the broader crypto bull market . UNI: Uniswap, a leading decentralized exchange, is central to DeFi trading. A thriving Ethereum ecosystem directly benefits UNI through increased trading volumes and user engagement, aligning with the positive Ethereum prediction . These tokens represent just a few examples of the diverse opportunities available in a potential altcoin season, aligning with LD Capital’s analysis and supporting the ambitious ETH price target . Jack Yi’s bold Ethereum prediction of a $5,000 ETH and a 0.1 ETH/BTC ratio underscores a strong bullish outlook for the crypto market. His emphasis on strategic ‘buying on dips’ and the anticipation of an altcoin season , driven by macroeconomic factors like rate cuts, provides a compelling roadmap for investors. As the market evolves, keeping an eye on high-conviction tokens like ENA, AAVE, and UNI, as highlighted by LD Capital’s analysis , could prove highly rewarding within this exciting crypto bull market . The journey to the ambitious ETH price target appears to be gaining significant traction, inviting investors to prepare for potential surges. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Jack Yi’s ETH price target? Jack Yi, founder of LD Capital, has set an ambitious target of $5,000 for Ethereum (ETH), alongside an ETH/BTC ratio of 0.1. Why is $5,000 ETH a significant target? Breaking the $4,000 double-top resistance signals strong bullish momentum, making $5,000 a new record high and a key psychological and technical level for Ethereum’s valuation. What is an “altcoin season” and why is it expected? An altcoin season is a period where alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) significantly outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum. Jack Yi expects it due to building expectations for interest rate cuts, which typically create a more favorable environment for risk assets like altcoins. Which tokens does LD Capital highlight for potential upside? LD Capital’s research report highlights high-conviction tokens such as ENA, AAVE, and UNI, which are expected to benefit from Ethereum’s gains and the overall positive market sentiment. What is the “buy on dips” strategy? “Buying on dips” is a bull-market strategy where investors purchase assets during temporary price pullbacks or corrections, rather than chasing rising prices, aiming for better entry points and reduced average costs.

Notably, Glassnode co-founders Jan Happel and Yann Allemann said on X that Ethereum is likely in for a “wild ride” once it flips $4,000 into support. They also noted that Fridays and Saturdays have typically been accumulation days over the past month, hinting that the real rally could kick off on Sunday or Monday. With the token already up more than 19% in the past week , the potential for even greater – and possibly parabolic – upside puts the spotlight on the altcoin segment, which could paint the town green in the days ahead. Keep reading to explore Ethereum’s bullish signals and the best altcoins to buy now to ride this wave. Top Reasons to Be Bullish on Ethereum Alongside Glassnode’s optimistic outlook on Ethereum, Michaël van de Poppe, co-founder of MN Trading Capital, is forecasting a 200%-500% altcoin rally over the next 2-4 months . He says Ethereum’s recent momentum “is the first step forwards to a more risk-on appetite.” Moreover, with $ETH now breaking decisively above $4K, more than $817M in short positions could soon be liquidated , potentially triggering a short squeeze that drives prices even higher as forced buy-backs add momentum to the rally. Even better? ETH/BTC ratio has jumped 67% over the past 3 months, signaling a shift in capital from Bitcoin toward Ethereum and altcoins. All in all, with $ETH looking stronger than ever, now’s the perfect time to scoop up undervalued tokens that could surge alongside it in the coming altcoin wave. Here are our carefully selected top 3 picks and suggestions. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Building Bitcoin Layer 2 for Fast, Cheap Transactions & Web3 Compatibility Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) plans to turbocharge the Bitcoin blockchain by building a brand-new Layer 2 that integrates with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Simply put, this will bring Solana-like performance – high transaction speeds, low fees, and full Web3 compatibility – to the otherwise slow, expensive, and incompatible Bitcoin environment. Think of $HYPER’s Layer 2 as a fast side lane that helps a busy highway (Bitcoin) handle traffic, while also removing the high toll fees along the way. And a decentralized, non-custodial canonical bridge supports Hyper in its mission to bring Bitcoin more in line with modern blockchains. It links Bitcoin’s Layer 1 with Hyper’s Layer 2, allowing users to convert their native $BTC into ‘wrapped’ $BTC that’s fully compatible with the Layer 2. Then, you can use these wrapped tokens to explore Hyper’s SVM-powered Web3 ecosystem, engaging in high-speed DeFi trading, NFT platforms, DAO governance, lending, staking, swapping, and gaming dApps. Bitcoin Hyper is currently in the early stages of its presale ($7.8M+ raised), which is why you can scoop it up for a super-low price of $0.0126. Here’s how to buy $HYPER . And according to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction , it could hit $0.32 by the end of 2025 – a potential gain of 2,400% from its current price. Visit Bitcoin Hyper for more information. 2. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Powering a Telegram Trading Bot for Sniping Meme Coin Liquidity An altcoin boom will likely see numerous low-cap meme coins getting listed and rocketing to the moon during their initial pumps. That’s why Snorter Token ($SNORT) is one of the best cryptos to buy now . $SNORT powers Snorter Bot, a Telegram trading bot built specifically to help retail traders snipe liquidity in freshly listed meme coins. It will launch with full Solana compatibility and will soon extend support to Ethereum, Polygon, BNB, and Base as well. How does Snorter work? Simply place your buy/sell limit/stop orders by sending messages in Telegram chat. Snorter will then automatically execute those orders as soon as liquidity kicks in. This auto-execution will allow you to undercut institutional players, who typically eat up all the liquidity using advanced tools. And if you’re worried about security, don’t be. Snorter will come packed with protective mechanisms against a wide range of on-chain threats, including rug pulls, honeypots, and Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) attacks. Buying $SNORT , the bot’s native cryptocurrency, won’t just help you ride Snorter’s potential market adoption, but it’ll also unlock a slew of exclusive perks. These include the lowest trading fees in the industry (just 0.85%), no daily sniping limits, advanced analytics, and generous staking rewards (currently yielding an impressive 150%). According to our Snorter Token price prediction , the token can surge 830% by year-end, potentially hitting $0.94. One $SNORT is currently available for just $0.1007, and the project has in total raised over $2.8M in early investor funding so far. Visit $SNORT’s official presale website. 3. Dogecoin ($DOGE) – Iconic Meme Coin Riding Fresh Momentum If you want to build a diversified crypto portfolio while giving yourself a touch of degen exposure, consider investing in a proven meme coin like Dogecoin ($DOGE). The largest meme coin by market cap, $DOGE has surged over 16% in the past week – and 7% in just the last 24 hours. Why? Because it’s riding both fundamental and technical tailwinds, positioning it perfectly to capitalize on the upcoming altcoin boom. For starters, there’s over a 90% chance that the SEC could greenlight a DOGE ETF in Q3, which could trigger a significant influx of institutional and retail capital. And then there are upcoming infrastructure upgrades, like the integration of a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) verification system . On the technical side, Dogecoin has just closed above the 10 and 20 EMAs on the daily chart with a strong bullish candle, rebounding from the key 0.5-0.618 Fibonacci retracement zone (drawn from the $0.14287 low) – often referred to as the ‘golden pocket.’ This confluence suggests the odds are stacked in favor of continued upward momentum. With $0.50 potentially on the radar for $DOGE this year, its current price of $0.2338 provides a significantly discounted entry point. Conclusion With Ethereum on the verge of a major breakout, the stage is set for an altcoin mania, one that could propel low-cap, high-upside tokens like $HYPER and $SNORT to explosive new highs as traders hunt for the next 1000x crypto . That said, kindly remember that altcoin investments are highly risky due to the market’s volatility.

The agreement gives the startup a pre-funding valuation of $1 billion. Sources, however, claimed Periodic Labs had earlier selected OpenAI to lead the round, but turned toward Andreessen Horowitz because it believed the firm could provide more support. Nonetheless, OpenAI will still be involved in the funding and possibly collaborate further with the startup. OpenAI’s Fedus established Periodic Labs, joining other alumni who launched startups Liam Fedus, a former OpenAI research leader instrumental in ChatGPT’s creation, teamed up with ex-DeepMind scientist Ekin Dogus Cubuk to launch Periodic Labs. Together, they were hoping to use AI to analyze materials and uncover new ones. Back in March, Fedus even posted, “But I’ve gotten really excited about AI for science,” sharing his desire to work with OpenAI as a partner. Fedus is now part of a swelling circle of OpenAI veterans creating startups — a group that’s drawn parallels to the famed “PayPal mafia” of Elon Musk and Peter Thiel. Anthropic , for instance, was founded by siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, while Thinking Machines Lab, now valued at $10 billion, was started by Mira Murati, another OpenAI alum. Investors are now clamoring to buy into startups created by ex-OpenAI employees and other AI veterans, willing to pay premium prices for what they consider exceptional talent. Collectively, former OpenAI staffers have raised over $42 billion to fund their startups. Now, people familiar with the matter says A16z will lead a $200 million financing for Periodic Labs, adding to the investment count AI startups received 37% of VC funding in July During Q2 2025, 11 AI startups raised more than $1 billion, absorbing more than a third of the quarter’s $91 billion venture capital total. Moreover, this July, the top startup fundraising went to xAI, which secured $5 billion in a round headed by Musk’s SpaceX. The deal was also the year’s third-biggest, surpassed only by OpenAI’s $40 billion round with SoftBank in March and Meta’s $14.3 billion bet on Scale AI in June. In July, $200 million-plus rounds collectively hit $11.4 billion — nearly 38% of all private venture-backed funding. Most were spearheaded by corporate players, private equity, or alternative investors, with OpenEvidence and Lovable the only exceptions, led purely by venture capital firms. Overall, U.S. startups have attracted more than $17 billion in funding in July alone, representing 58% of global venture capital. AI also captured 37% of VC funding, ahead of healthcare and biotech at $5.7 billion. Financial services posted $4.6 billion in investment, marking a year-over-year doubling. Nonetheless, venture capital activity cooled in July, easing off from the pace seen in June. The VC funding for July 2025 ($29.7 billion) was about the same as it had been in the same month the previous year, but down from June’s $43 billion. Seed-stage ventures received 10% of July’s VC dollars, early-stage firms took around 30%, and late-stage companies secured 60%.

The latest major endorsement comes from one of the world’s most prestigious universities — Harvard. In a recent SEC filing, it was revealed that Harvard University’s investment portfolio acquired $117 million worth of shares in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF by the end of the second quarter of 2025. This move places Harvard among a growing list of influential institutions integrating Bitcoin into their long-term treasury strategies. The BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF, now managing $84 billion in assets under management, has quickly become a dominant vehicle for institutional exposure to BTC. Harvard’s decision highlights a broader shift in capital allocation strategies , where Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty and a high-conviction growth asset. Institutional participation at this scale not only boosts market credibility but also reinforces Bitcoin’s position as a core asset in diversified portfolios. Harvard Ranks Bitcoin ETF Among Top Portfolio Holdings According to Harvard University’s recent Form 13F filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), its $117 million position in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF ranks as the institution’s fifth-largest investment. This allocation places Bitcoin just ahead of the university’s holdings in major technology giants such as Alphabet, Google’s parent company, and NVIDIA. At the end of the reporting period, Harvard held nearly $114 million worth of Alphabet stock, underscoring the significance of its Bitcoin exposure within its broader portfolio. The decision to prioritize Bitcoin over some of the most established names in global technology signals a notable shift in institutional thinking. For decades, elite endowments like Harvard’s have been known for their conservative, long-term investment approach, focusing on assets with proven resilience and growth potential. Including Bitcoin at this level shows that the university views the digital asset as not only a speculative opportunity but also as a strategic reserve holding with long-term value. Harvard’s move reflects a growing consensus among leading institutions that BTC is emerging as a core asset for diversification, inflation protection, and asymmetric upside potential. The fact that Bitcoin now sits alongside — and in some cases above — blue-chip equities in major portfolios highlights its evolution from a niche investment to a mainstream financial instrument. Price Action Details: Testing Resistance Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $116,526, consolidating just below the key resistance zone at $122,077. The 3-day chart shows a sustained bullish structure, with price holding well above the 50-day ($101,725) and 100-day ($96,494) moving averages — both trending upward, signaling strong medium-term momentum. After reclaiming the $115,724 support level, BTC has maintained a steady upward bias, suggesting that bulls are still in control despite recent volatility. The consolidation phase just under resistance indicates market indecision, with buyers accumulating strength for a potential breakout. A decisive close above $122,077 could open the path toward retesting the all-time highs and potentially extending into price discovery. Volume remains relatively stable, but a noticeable uptick on breakout attempts would strengthen the bullish case. On the downside, failure to hold $115,724 could trigger a pullback toward the $110K–$112K range, where additional support and the 50-day moving average converge.

Here’s What is Coming,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-warns-of-final-phase-in-xrp-bull-cycle-heres-what-is-coming/,"Crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto has issued a technical update on the state of the XRP market, warning that while significant upside may still be ahead, investors should be aware that the current cycle may be entering its final phase. In a detailed video shared on social media, Steph examined multiple indicators, focusing on both bullish and bearish scenarios, and underlined the importance of watching key historical metrics. Steph began the analysis by referencing the Altcoin Season Index, a tool frequently used to gauge whether altcoins are currently overbought or undervalued relative to Bitcoin. The index is measured on a scale from 0 to 100, where readings below 25 typically indicate undervaluation in a Bitcoin-dominated market, while readings above 75 suggest overvaluation. According to Steph, the index is currently at 39, which remains well below the overbought level. This, in Steph’s view, indicates that there is still considerable room for growth in the altcoin market, including XRP . #XRP : DON’T SAY YOU WEREN’T WARNED… pic.twitter.com/nb4PvDgr8O — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 7, 2025 XRP Trading Around Key Support Levels Turning to XRP specifically, Steph highlighted that the asset has been trading in a range since the end of 2024, oscillating around the $3 mark. Steph noted that XRP is attempting to establish $3 as a support level, occasionally dipping slightly below and then recovering. From a technical perspective, this consolidation phase could be interpreted as a constructive pattern, particularly given that XRP appears to be converting previous resistance into support. The analyst also emphasized the significance of a long-term upward trend line that has been in effect since 2021. Steph believes that a breakout above this trend line could trigger a sharp price acceleration. On the two-week chart, Steph identified a long-term trend line that has seen multiple rejections in the past. According to the analysis, if XRP can break above this resistance line, a strong upward move could follow. In addition, Steph pointed to a recent golden cross. The last golden cross occurred in September 2024 and was followed by short-term volatility but ultimately led to a major rally. Steph argued that the current golden cross could again signal a bullish outcome in the mid-term. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Historical RSI Patterns Signal Caution Near $4.50 to $5.00 Steph also analyzed the weekly chart’s stochastic RSI, a momentum oscillator that has shown recurring patterns before local tops. The analyst observed that in past instances, XRP experienced local peaks shortly after the stochastic RSI hit overbought levels and then formed lower highs, leading to significant corrections. For example, a previous bearish divergence saw XRP drop back to $1.60, resulting in a prolonged and frustrating market phase for holders. Most recently, XRP peaked at $3.65 in July. The stochastic RSI also peaked around the same time, and Steph indicated that based on historical patterns, another push higher might be imminent, potentially reaching the $4.50 to $5.00 range . However, Steph warned that this level could coincide with a local top and lead to a temporary pullback. The same chart patterns have previously predicted such outcomes, making it a development that market participants should not ignore. Final Phase of Bullrun May Be Underway In the final segment of the analysis, Steph referred to broader market cycles and reiterated a view previously expressed in earlier videos: the current bull run may be entering its concluding phase. Time-wise, the analyst believes the market is nearing the end of the ongoing cycle, which could culminate in a blow-off phase marked by rapid and aggressive altcoin rallies. While Steph remains optimistic about further price increases and maintains that altcoins, including XRP, are still undervalued, the warning is clear—investors should remain alert to historical patterns and consider the possibility that a market top may not be far off.

This correction is concerning as it is pushing the price downward toward a Fibonacci level that could spark further decline. Given this, the price must reclaim and hold the $3 level if there is to be any major recovery in the price. What’s Wrong With XRP? Crypto analyst CasiTrades outlined the challenges that the XRP price is currently going through and what needs to happen for the altcoin to regain bullish momentum. In the X post, she explains that the failure to rally after a brief bounce above $3 showed that there wasn’t more upward movement to be had. But rather, it was just part of the deeper corrective wave. So far, this has turned out to be the case as the bears were previously able to beat the XRP price below $3 again. Related Reading: Institutional Solana Buying Ramps Up: The Nearly $600 Million Buy Shaking Up SOL Following the first break below $3, the price had pushed to test the support at $2.75. This level is the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level, and a sustained break below could trigger more crashes. As Casi explains, this decline was part of a larger ABC wave correction, which is inherently bearish in itself. However, the fact that the $2.75 remains above the Wave 1 high of $2.65 leads the analyst to believe that overall, the XRP price is still bullish. Mainly, she explains that there are now bullish divergences showing up on the 15-minute chart all the way to the 40-hour chart. This suggests that $2.75 could be the low of the latest decline. Why $3 Must Hold From Here Given the establishment of a possible low at the $0.75 level, the next course of action is to reclaim $3 and turn this resistance into support. As the crypto analyst explains, a rise above the $3.21 level and a sustained break are what is needed for confirmation that the decline is finally over. What is expected to follow such a move is a bullish impulse. Related Reading: XRP Price Projection: 5 Key Things To Watch Out For As The Bull Market Unfolds If this trend does play out, then the expectation is that the XRP price will be headed for new all-time highs from here. The crypto analyst sees an initial target of $4, which would mean its highest point in over seven years. Then, after that, a possible surge to $4.60-$4.80 serves as the final target.

When Chat GPT was asked, the AI model revealed that Remittix (RTX ) is the best investment to make right now. It further asserted that RTX would outperform XLM and XRP prices, delivering 13,000% in three months. The question remains: is this feasible? A Probable Outlook For Ripple (XRP) Price This XRP price chart from Ali_chart shows the price breaking out of a triangle. The price is currently pegged at $3.3, breaking above a significant resistance at $3. With recent news and upcoming upgrades on the Ripple ecosystem, bullish pressure is mounting. Source: Ali_chart via X. Analysts forecast Ripple (XRP) price to reach $5 by the end of 2025, but longer, bullish forecasts predict it might hit $7 to $30. On the more bullish end, these targets are 2x to 10x returns at best, not close to 13,000%. In the meantime, XLM (Stellar), which is traditionally compared with XRP, is making decent moves, being up 355% this year, but still does not have scary predictions of being able to grow by such astronomical figures. Stellar (XLM) Price Outlook In the crypto-payments industry, Stellar (XLM) has been described as the closest relative of Ripple, capable of low-fee, high-speed cross-border payments. It has attracted attention through its alliances with emerging markets and defied gravity with 355% growth on a year-to-date basis. Although analysts believe it could grow more, even up to 4x by the end of 2025. Its predictions are also significantly lower than 13,000% gain attributed to Remittix.

A significant debate has emerged regarding which firms should gain a crucial advantage in this evolving landscape. Specifically, should early applicants receive priority over larger, later entrants like BlackRock? ETF analyst James Seyffart recently shared his insightful perspective. He believes that firms who have already put in the groundwork should indeed get a head start. This view highlights a core principle of fairness and effort in the competitive financial market. Why Early Spot Solana ETF Filers Matter James Seyffart, in an interview with NovaDius president Nate Geraci, made a compelling argument. He stated that if BlackRock decides to pursue a spot Solana ETF , it should not be allowed to launch simultaneously with U.S. issuers who have already submitted their applications. This isn’t just about being first; it’s about acknowledging the significant investment of time and resources. Consider the efforts of firms like VanEck, which filed for a spot Solana ETF in June 2024. Along with Bitwise, Grayscale, Invesco, 21Shares, CoinShares, Canary Capital, Franklin Templeton, and Fidelity, these companies have spent considerable time engaging with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They have navigated complex regulatory hurdles, refined their filings, and addressed potential concerns. This collaborative effort with the SEC is vital for the maturation of the crypto market. Dedicated Engagement: Smaller firms have invested significant resources in understanding and meeting SEC requirements. Pioneering Spirit: These early filers are pushing the boundaries for new crypto investment products. Fair Competition: Granting a head start acknowledges their proactive approach and commitment. BlackRock Solana ETF: A Different Strategy? While the focus is often on individual crypto ETFs, Seyffart suggests BlackRock might have a different strategy in mind. He believes the financial giant is more likely to introduce a broader crypto index product. This kind of product would track the spot prices of several cryptocurrencies, extending beyond just Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Why this approach? Seyffart points out that skipping another single-asset crypto ETF, like a dedicated BlackRock Solana ETF , might not be a major setback for the firm. Bitcoin and Ethereum currently dominate the market, accounting for roughly 90% of the total cryptocurrency market value. For a firm of BlackRock’s scale, a diversified index product could offer broader market exposure with less granular risk. This strategic choice by BlackRock would: Offer diversified exposure to the crypto market. Potentially reduce the regulatory burden associated with single-asset filings. Align with their existing portfolio management philosophies for traditional assets. The Importance of SEC Approval Precedent for Crypto ETFs The process of gaining SEC approval for any new financial product, especially in the cryptocurrency space, is rigorous and time-consuming. The experience with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs has set a precedent, demonstrating the SEC’s meticulous approach. Firms must demonstrate robust investor protection measures, market surveillance capabilities, and a clear understanding of the underlying asset’s market dynamics. The time and effort spent by early crypto ETFs applicants in working closely with the SEC are invaluable. They help pave the way for future products by establishing regulatory frameworks and building trust. To allow a latecomer, regardless of its size, to launch simultaneously would potentially undermine the efforts and investments made by these pioneering firms. It could also discourage future innovation and diligent engagement with regulators. Looking Ahead: A Fair Race for Solana ETFs The discussion around Solana ETF approvals underscores a critical point: the need for a level playing field and recognition of effort in the evolving crypto investment landscape. As the market matures, ensuring fair competition and rewarding diligence will be paramount for fostering innovation and attracting more institutional interest. While BlackRock’s influence is undeniable, the commitment and pioneering spirit of early filers like VanEck and others deserve to be acknowledged. Their work is not just about launching a product; it’s about building a robust, regulated pathway for mainstream investors to access digital assets responsibly. The outcome of this debate will significantly shape the future of crypto investment products. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a Solana ETF? A Solana ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is an investment vehicle that would allow investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Solana (SOL) without directly owning the cryptocurrency. It would trade on traditional stock exchanges. 2. Why are early Solana ETF filers arguing for a head start? Early filers, such as VanEck and Bitwise, have invested considerable time and resources working with the SEC to prepare their applications. They believe their proactive efforts should grant them priority over firms like BlackRock, who may file later. 3. What is BlackRock’s likely strategy regarding crypto ETFs? According to analyst James Seyffart, BlackRock is more likely to launch a broader crypto index product that tracks multiple cryptocurrencies beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum, rather than focusing on another single-asset ETF like a dedicated spot Solana ETF. 4. How does SEC approval impact the launch of crypto ETFs? SEC approval is crucial for crypto ETFs to launch. The SEC ensures that these products meet regulatory standards for investor protection, market surveillance, and transparency. The approval process is rigorous and can take significant time and effort from applicants. 5. What does the term “spot Solana ETF” mean? A “spot Solana ETF” means the fund would directly hold actual Solana (SOL) tokens, reflecting the real-time, or “spot,” price of the cryptocurrency, unlike futures-based ETFs which track derivative contracts.

The government appears unswayed by the accurate GPS navigation argument, instead prioritizing its country’s security by limiting Google’s access to its local map data. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport announced on Friday that South Korea has delayed a decision on Google’s request to export local map data for use on servers outside the country. South Korea postpones decision on Google’s request to export data The ministry stated that its National Geographic Information Institute had decided to postpone the decision for 60 days to give Google time to propose measures addressing South Korea’s national security concerns. The delay means the issue will remain unresolved ahead of a possible summit between the leaders of the two countries later this month. It is not yet clear whether the matter will be included in the summit agenda. Google , owned by U.S. tech giant Alphabet, has made previous requests for permission to store and process South Korean map data abroad, which were rejected in both 2007 and 2016 on security grounds. Those denials cited the potential risk of exposing sensitive information, including the locations of military facilities. South Korea’s position revolves around the country’s security environment. The 1950–1953 Korean War ended without a peace treaty, leaving the peninsula in a technically unresolved state of conflict. Officials have argued that allowing detailed geospatial data to be transferred abroad could make it easier to pinpoint sensitive sites, including defense infrastructure, potentially compromising the nation’s security. Transport Minister Kim Yoon-duk reiterated late last month that the government must remain “very cautious” in granting map access to foreign companies, stressing that defense and public safety take precedence over trade considerations . In contrast, the United States views South Korea’s restrictions on cross-border data flows as long-standing barriers to foreign navigation services. U.S. officials have argued that these measures have hampered the operations of platforms such as Google Maps and Apple Maps, limiting their competitiveness in the South Korean market. Google has said that the absence of certain map data restricts its ability to provide full Google Maps functionality within the country, causing what it describes as “major inconveniences” for foreign tourists. According to the company, there are no legitimate security concerns over its mapping data, which it says is already publicly available and used by a range of companies after passing government security reviews. Ongoing negotiations and possible compromises Google stated that it is willing to work with South Korean authorities to address their concerns. The company said it is in “close discussion” with the government on additional security measures that could satisfy its regulatory requirements. One option under consideration is purchasing blurred imagery from local partners whose data has already been approved by the government. The South Korean government’s 60-day postponement is intended to give Google time to develop such solutions. However, presidential adviser Kim Yong-beom said last month that South Korea has not made concessions on the map data issue, nor on the separate matter of further opening its agricultural sector, despite the extensive bilateral trade negotiations with the United States.

As bullish momentum picks up across the crypto market, interest in upcoming crypto projects is reaching new all-time highs, particularly as gas prices decline and blockchain infrastructure expands. As Bitcoin remains the standard, savvy investors are also watching the market for the next 100x coin called Remittix (RTX) before the market peak. Will BTC Hit $150K Before Smaller Coins Catch Up? Bitcoin remains the market leader among cryptocurrencies. With a price of $116,213.74, its market cap is comfortably above $2.31 trillion. Although it declined 0.36% in the last 24 hours, its volume is up 4.9% at $62.65 billion, in clear testament to strong underlying demand. Most long-term investors and institutions continue to believe that this cycle will top at $150,000, and metrics like Bitcoin dominance still keep reinforcing that narrative. However, history suggests that altcoins tend to go harder when the bull cycle is in its later phases, especially low-cap crypto hidden gems and tokens within the top crypto presales of 2025. Why Remittix May Outshine Larger Names As Bitcoin makes its move towards its $150,000 target, Remittix (RTX) is creating waves for its utilitarian use case: instant crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ nations. The project is bridging the blockchain and traditional finance divide with a fast, secure, decentralized exchange optimized for global remittance. At just $0.0895 per token, Remittix has sold over 585Million+ tokens and crossed over $18.4Million raised. Why the hype? Wallet Beta Launch Q3: Early release of the real-time FX converting mobile-first wallet to users. $250,000 Giveaway: Large marketing drive attracting new investors and users. 40% Token Bonus: One-time bonus offer as $18M soft cap goal met. CertiK Audit Passed: Security-driven strategy builds retail and institutional investor trust. Cross-Chain Capabilities: In development to support both Ethereum and non-Ethereum chains with low gas cost crypto transfers. Real Utility in a Busy Market When hype coins vanish, tokens such as Remittix are standing out by delivering actual solutions. With international remittance a $19T market, Remittix is not only another DeFi token, it’s a true transaction volume platform. This is not speculation. Remittix is: Addressing actual problems: Direct-to-bank transfers, not wallet-to-wallet. Growing real usage: Supports 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiat currencies. Designed with mass market adoption in mind: Simple interface, instant exchange, and strong referral system. Fueling crypto growth: Gives crypto passive income functionality and business API platforms. Designed for long-term investors: Deflationary token structure gives value over time. These qualities place it among the top crypto under $1 and one of the top promising new crypto projects this year.

The decision comes shortly after both parties filed to dismiss their appeals , marking another step in winding down the long-running dispute. Bill Morgan, a prominent attorney who has followed the case, weighed in on this development, describing the SEC order as another win for Ripple. He called the waiver the “next best thing” given Judge Annalisa Torres’ decision not to dissolve the permanent injunction. Morgan also explained that this decision will help the company raise capital, confirming that “Ripple is no longer barred from conducting exempt securities offerings.” The move by the SEC will also aid Ripple’s broader business objectives, including its application for a national trust bank charter to form the Ripple National Trust Bank (RNTB) . Another win for Ripple. The SEC has made an order waiving the Bad Actor disqualification of Ripple that arose from the permanent injunction. Next best thing given Judge Torres would not dissolve the permanent injunction. This will help Ripple raise capital. Ripple is no longer… https://t.co/ghSFIaZfxg — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) August 8, 2025 The Bad Actor Disqualification The bad actor disqualification originates in Rule 506(d) of Regulation D, which disqualifies issuers from relying on certain private-offering exemptions when specific enforcement events have occurred. The consequence of such a designation is that an issuer must either seek a waiver or pursue registered offerings, a process that is more time-consuming and costly. Why This Matters For XRP With the disqualification removed, Ripple once again has access to Regulation D private-placement options for accredited investors. This change removes a specific regulatory hurdle and eases some compliance requirements for raising funds privately. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Morgan noted that the waiver will help Ripple raise capital and lift the previous ban on exempt securities offerings. Restored access to Rule 506 can speed up fundraising and give Ripple more flexibility in arranging private investments to support product development, manage liquidity, and build commercial partnerships involving XRP. Although Judge Torres denied the joint motion that would have lifted the permanent injunction placed on Ripple, this relief could help XRP by aiding the company’s broader strategic goals and initiatives that depend on institutional counterparties. For XRP holders, the waiver removes one source of regulatory friction, even though the permanent injunction remains on the record. Whether this targeted relief produces material strategic shifts for Ripple or significant market effects for XRP will depend on the company’s subsequent financing choices and on how regulators and counterparties respond.

Ethereum is among the few that are yet to achieve such an incredible feat, but it has closed down the gap to its 2021 ATH. ETHUSD. Source: TradingView Is it Time? The 4-hour graph above paints a very interesting picture. Ethereum, alongside the rest of the market, rocketed at the end of 2024 after the US elections. However, while BTC managed to surge past $100,000 to chart a fresh peak, ETH’s rally was capped at around $4,000. It tried to break that crucial resistance a few times, but it faced immediate rejection. The last one, which took place in early 2025, was particularly painful as it led to a violent correction that culminated in early April with a price dump to under $1,400 . At the time, the sentiment around the largest altcoin was extremely bearish, with multiple holders disposing of their ETH holdings. However, the landscape quickly turned, and it wasn’t long until ether managed to rebound past $2,000. It stayed there for a few weeks before the bulls stepped on the gas pedal and drove the asset north hard. By the end of July, it had neared the familiar $4,000 resistance, but couldn’t penetrate it. This finally happened last night when ETH shot up past it and shipped to a new three-and-a-half-year high of $4,200. This meant that the world’s second biggest cryptocurrency had added 200% in just four months. Now, though, all eyes are turning to the November 2021 all-time high of almost $4,900 (CoinGecko data), which is roughly 15% away. If it manages to break it, ETH will join the likes of BNB and XRP as some of the altcoins that have gone into uncharted territory during this cycle. What’s Driving ETH’s Pump? The answer to this is multi-fold. Investors using the ETFs to gain ETH exposure went berserk by accumulating massive shares within a relatively short time period. In fact, July outperformed all 11 previous months combined in which the ETH ETFs existed. Then, there were companies that went all in by spending billions to acquire more ether. Whales have also gone on a buying spree, and all of this has helped the underlying asset to gain traction and outperform many of its competitors in the past few months. Nevertheless, the big target is still ahead of it, and only time will tell if this is indeed ETH’s moment to take the spotlight and run with it.

Cardano (ADA), known for its methodical development and academic rigor, now finds itself compared to the fast-rising Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized lending and yield innovation platform turning heads in the DeFi market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is priced at $0.035 in phase 6 of its presale. Investors buying early into MUTM are on track for 500% gains as the project gains traction. Mutuum Finance has already raised more than $14.25 million and has more than 15000 investors. Mutuum Finance could outpace Cardano (ADA) in creating the next wave of crypto millionaires. Cardano Strengthens Its Infrastructure Ahead of 2025 Momentum Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at approximately $0.7989 reflecting a notable intraday gain of around 7.8%. This follows the community’s approval of a $71 million treasury-funded development package, a landmark move toward decentralized funding and infrastructure enhancement. This decision underscores increased on-chain governance maturity and institutional ambition within the ecosystem. As attention grows across the altcoin space, Cardano continues to assert its methodical growth ethos even as new DeFi-focused entrants like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerge. Mutuum Finance Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance has been running a $100,000 giveaway . 10 lucky people will be awarded a token of $10,000 in Mutuum Finance Tokens. The giveaway is a testament to the high amount of commitment the project holds towards acquiring a long-term and loyal fan base. As part of another move towards security and transparency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched an Official Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK. The project team will be compensating the participants a maximum of $50,000 USDT for submitting likely vulnerabilities in the project. The purpose of bounty program is to get a good coverage of all the classes of vulnerabilities; it is split into the four classes of severity; i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. The project also indicates the team’s commitment towards security of ecosystem along with investors’ trust. Mutuum Finance Expands with Phase 6 Launch of Its Presale Mutuum Finance is doing exceptionally well during presale, with stage 6 currently underway at $0.035. Mutuum Finance is changing the DeFi industry by creating a financial system with real-world applications. Presale has onboarded more than 15000 token holders and raised more than $14.25 million. Investors buying into the presale today could see their investment grow as high as 5x after launch. Powerful Lending Protocol The platform has a dual lending system for the provision of flexibility and the efficiency that encompasses Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models. Peer-to-Contract utilizes a smart contract that lends automatically without any human intervention. Peer-to-Peer model removes middlemen for lenders to be directly in contact with borrowers. It is more prevalent in meme coins. Mutuum Finance has quickly built strong momentum, raising over $14.25 million and attracting more than 15,000 investors during its presale. Now in Phase 6 at $0.035, the token will rise 14.29% to $0.04 in the next stage, with early buyers positioned for 400%–500% potential gains. Backed by a secure, audited dual-lending protocol and a USD-pegged stablecoin in development, MUTM is designed for real-world DeFi utility and long-term growth. Investors aiming to get in before the next price increase should secure their tokens now through the official presale.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-investors-you-need-2500-xrp-by-september-heres-why/,"Levi, a prominent member of the Crypto Crusaders community, has stated that XRP investors should aim to acquire an additional 2,500 tokens before September, citing a series of economic indicators and expected monetary policy shifts that he believes will strongly benefit the digital asset market. In his recent video, Levi acknowledged that XRP experienced a substantial rally followed by a period of volatility, and he anticipates a short-term correction. However, he stressed that such a correction would be insignificant compared to the potential market movements he expects in the coming months. He revealed that he has already secured multiple advantageous entry points before the recent rally and is preparing for further buying opportunities once certain market conditions are met. YOU NEED 2500 XRP BY SEPTEMBER! YOU'RE NOT READY!!! #XRP pic.twitter.com/5l7X75UKab — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) August 8, 2025 Economic Indicators and Global Monetary Policy Trends Levi pointed to recent employment data from major economies, including Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe, Japan, South Korea, and China. In his view, these figures signal a weakening global economy that will likely prompt multiple central banks to implement interest rate cuts. Canada recorded a loss of over 40,000 jobs in July, marking its largest monthly decline since the pandemic, while the United States reported disappointing job creation alongside an unemployment rate exceeding 4%. According to Levi, these conditions, combined with inflation rates hovering near target levels, create strong incentives for the Federal Reserve and other central banks to inject liquidity into the markets through rate reductions. Referencing analysis conducted using Grok, Levi explained that historically, persistent weak jobs data significantly increases the likelihood of central banks cutting rates to stimulate growth. He estimated that the probability of U.S. and Canadian rate cuts in September ranges from 70% to 90%, with further reductions possible in subsequent months. He also noted that such decisions would likely coincide with similar actions from other economies, collectively releasing trillions of dollars in liquidity into global markets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Political Factors and Potential Market Impact Levi also discussed political developments in the United States, where President Donald Trump is reportedly seeking to diminish the influence of current Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell by shifting public focus toward a prospective new appointee. Levi believes that this strategy, coupled with ongoing trade policies and tariffs, may further align U.S. monetary policy toward aggressive rate reductions. He added that if the anticipated cuts are delayed in September, October remains a likely timeframe for such measures. XRP Price Projections and Strategic Positioning Addressing why he singled out 2,500 XRP as a target accumulation level, Levi noted that approximately 75% of current XRP holders possess fewer tokens than this amount. He argued that surpassing this threshold could position investors to benefit more significantly from anticipated price movements. Levi cited historical data suggesting a 90% to 95% correlation between increased market liquidity and price growth in digital assets, particularly in the three months following rate cuts. Based on this, he forecasts that XRP could experience substantial gains in late 2025, especially in the fourth quarter, driven by the combined effects of global liquidity injections and the possible introduction of XRP exchange-traded funds by institutions such as BlackRock and Fidelity. In the short term, Levi expects XRP to remain volatile, with price movements between $3.21 and $3.37. He indicated that he would view any dip near $3.00 as a significant buying opportunity in preparation for the expected macroeconomic and institutional catalysts later in the year. He concluded by stressing that, in his opinion, current conditions represent a rare convergence of factors that XRP holders have anticipated for years, and that dismissing these opportunities now would be unwise.

As reported last week, the current Maelstrom exec sold a big portion of his portfolio as he envisioned a more profound market-wide correction was in the making. At the time, Hayes disposed of more than $8 million worth of ETH, alongside some PEPE and ENA holdings. Later on, he owned up to the move, saying that the US Federal Reserve had decided once again not to lower the key interest rates, which was a bearish sign for the crypto market. Also, he noted that Trump’s foreign policy will result in more turbulence in the ever-volatile crypto market, which is why he preferred to be on the sidelines. Although that made a lot of sense at the time (which was just a week ago), as many cryptocurrencies were in the red after Trump’s latest actions and nuclear submarine movements, the market typically tends to move in the opposite direction of what people expect. In the past few days alone, many digital assets have posted notable price gains, including ETH. In fact, the second-largest cryptocurrency just broke past $4,000 and marked a new multi-year high of $4,200. This means that it has gained 20% in a week, which is in stark contrast to Hayes’s expectations of a price drop to $3,000. As such, Hayes took it to X again to say that he had to “buy it all back.” Evidently, he was referring to ETH since he posted an Ethereum chart and asked for forgiveness from one of the biggest ether proponents – Tom Lee. Oh, and he also promised not to take profits again. Had to buy it all back, do you forgive me @fundstrat ? I pinky swear, I’ll never take profit again. pic.twitter.com/jRWfaCEPE6 — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) August 9, 2025 The post Arthur Hayes Rebuys ETH Amid Price Rally and Swears Off Profit-Taking appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|ETHBTC|ETHUSD|Arthur Hayes|Ethereum (ETH) Price,EN,0,0,TRADING|ETH|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-08-09 07:35:37

ADA may also gain from the fresh market momentum, potentially flying over $1.50. As the big crypto assets start heating up again, investors are looking around the space for hidden gems that are undervalued — and one DeFi project that is quietly building a following is Remittix . Ethereum, ADA, and the Path to New Highs Ethereum and other major crypto assets, such as ADA, have shown strong bullish momentum over the last few days. Ethereum is trading at $3,934.55, up 2.46%, with a market cap of $475.12 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $41.05 billion. ADA is also close behind and is trading at $0.7811 with a 2.35% gain, a market cap of $27.67 billion, and daily volume of over $1.5 billion — nearly an 80% increase. This latest wave in Ethereum, ADA, and other blue-chip cryptocurrencies is indicative of a broader bullish trend. As more users transition into decentralized apps and Ethereum Layer 2 solutions, there is growing demand for DeFi projects and low gas fee crypto ecosystems. ADA has also gained momentum with smart contract capability and staking rewards attracting new developers and long-term holders. Remittix and the Push Towards Real-World Crypto Adoption While Ethereum and ADA are getting increased attention, Remittix (RTX) is carving its own niche. As a real-world crypto solution, Remittix allows users to transfer crypto directly to bank accounts across 30+ countries. With FX conversion in real time, 40+ crypto coverage, and fiat integrations, Remittix is creating a new DeFi category: PayFi. Remittix is also in presale, priced at just $0.0895 per token. Over $18.4 million has been raised so far, and in excess of 585 million RTX tokens have been sold. The platform is preparing for the release of its beta wallet in Q3, offering a mobile-first solution for freelancers, remitters, and small businesses. The 40% token bonus is still on — a chief driver of its runaway traction. Remittix is addressing a real-world problem: the inefficiency of cross-border settlements. With centralized exchanges being slow or expensive, and most DeFi platforms having no fiat connectivity, Remittix is bridging the gap by being a cross-chain DeFi project with fiat settlements. The Growth Formula Behind Remittix’s Appeal: Real-World Usefulness: Built to facilitate easier global payments, not just hype. Beta Wallet Launch: Q3 — with crypto-to-bank transfers. $250,000 Giveaway: Creating massive interest and exposure. 40% Bonus Tokens: Still available — but not for long. Crypto to Watch in 2025 Amidst a market filled with speculation, Remittix is gaining a reputation for its real-world use case, placing it as one of the most anticipated upcoming crypto projects. It’s ticking a few big trends: low gas fee cryptocurrency, early-stage crypto investment, and crypto solving real world problems. Remittix is setting itself up to be a solid contender for best DeFi altcoin of the year.

The Signal Just Appeared Again",https://timestabloid.com/last-two-times-xrp-flashed-this-signal-it-surged-630-and-54/,"Ali Martinez (@ali_charts), a prominent crypto analyst on X, has shared a chart showing the MVRV ratio for XRP crossing above its 200-day moving average, a configuration known as a golden cross. This on-chain metric is closely followed by traders. In previous instances, it coincided with major XRP rallies. Martinez noted that the last two occurrences of this signal were followed by price increases of 630% and 54%, respectively. The chart displays XRP’s current price at $3.319, alongside the MVRV ratio (yellow) and its long-term moving average (red). This golden cross marks the third occurrence of the signal in the observed timeframe. The last two times the MVRV ratio flashed a golden cross, $XRP soared 630% and 54%. That signal just appeared again. pic.twitter.com/rnavmDvscq — Ali (@ali_charts) August 8, 2025 Historical Context and Price Projections The MVRV ratio measures the relationship between market capitalization and realized capitalization, offering insight into whether holders are in profit or loss. Traders often view a golden cross above the 200-day average as a potential bullish regime shift. In late November 2024, a similar cross preceded a rally of approximately 630%, culminating in a multi-year peak of $3.39. In July, XRP formed a similar pattern, and Martinez drew attention to the formation before the impressive 54% rally. Notably, this rally sent XRP to its all-time high of $3.65 , and if the asset replicates the larger of those historical moves from its current price, it could climb to around $24.23. Matching the smaller gain would place XRP near $5.11, with both figures marking new peak prices for the asset. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Is XRP Headed for a New All-time High? For short-term participants, the latest golden cross could be a tactical signal to monitor, especially if confirmed by consistent price closes above the MVRV moving average and supported by rising trading volumes. For longer-term investors, the signal may indicate improving strength and signal long-term growth for XRP. The potential upside implied by historical precedents may attract attention, but prudent capital allocation and stop-loss strategies remain essential to protect against downside risk. However, analysts are bullish on XRP and anticipate a massive rally , at least in the short term. Regulatory developments have also contributed to this bullish narrative, as Ripple and the SEC have filed to dismiss their appeals , putting an end to the legal battle that has held XRP down for years. Without regulatory hurdles, a 630% and 54% increase now seems more feasible, and market participants will be eagerly watching the asset’s movements over the next few days.

This projected rally is rooted in the fact that XRP’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has formed a golden cross , a technical pattern that occurs when the short-term MVRV ratio moves above its long-term 200-day moving average ( MA ). XRP MVRV chart. Source: Santiment This rare event has occurred only twice in recent years, and both times it preceded major rallies, as observed by cryptocurrency trading analyst Ali Martinez in an X post on August 8. According to the expert, the last two times this pattern appeared, XRP soared 630% and 54%, respectively. Notably, the MVRV ratio measures how overvalued or undervalued an asset is compared to its “fair value” based on historical acquisition prices. If XRP were to repeat its best historical performance of a 640% surge, the token could climb from its current price of $3.30 to around $24.42, a new record high that would push its market cap to $1.45 trillion, ranking it as the second-largest cryptocurrency , assuming Ethereum ( ETH ) records minimal growth over the same period. XRP’s warning signal Meanwhile, XRP investors should be alert to any potential price reversal. To this end, data shared by The Enigma Trader indicates that the asset’s 90-day moving average whale flow has turned negative, signaling heavy outflows from large holders. XRP whale flow chart. Source: Crypto Quant This shift mirrors patterns seen in January to February, when persistent whale distribution coincided with a local price peak followed by a correction. While the current downturn is shorter and less severe than earlier in the year, the alignment between whale selling and price weakness remains notable. Without a sustained return of positive whale flows, typically above 5 million XRP per day, the market risks staying under structural selling pressure. Overall, it remains to be seen how this metric will play out and impact XRP’s price. This development comes as the SEC formally closed its case against Ripple over unregistered securities sales. On August 7, Ripple and the SEC agreed to drop appeals of Judge Analisa Torres’ fine and her ban on XRP sales to institutional investors. XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $3.32, up 0.65% in the past 24 hours and nearly 11% higher over the past week. XRP seven-day price chart.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $116,879 (+0.01%) Market cap $2.11 Trillion Trading volume (24-hour) $42.13 Billion (+18.9%) Circulating supply 19.87 Million BTC All-time high $111,970; May 22, 2025 All-time low $0.04865; Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $117,000 24-hour low $116,700 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $ 133,640 (+25.66%) Fear & Greed Index 65 (Greed) Sentiment Neutral Volatility 3.54% Green Days 16/30 (53%) 50-Day SMA $ 111,818 200-Day SMA $ 91,276 14-Day RSI 42.21 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin surges above $116K Resistance for BTC is at $119,623 Support for BTC/USD is at $115,501 The BTC price analysis for 9 August confirms that BTC faces a surge in volatility as the price surges above $116K. The price is now aiming for a consolidation within a bullish channel. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin faces consolidation above $116K Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that Bitcoin faces buying demand as it hovers above $116K. Currently, buyers are triggering recovery rally, resulting in a retest of immediate Fib levels. The 24-hour volume has surged to $1.09 billion, showing a surge in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $116,879, surging by over 0.01% in the last 24 hours. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and trades at 54, hinting that a bullish correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bearish domination rises around EMA trend lines The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bulls are strengthening their position to hold the price above the EMA trend lines. However, sellers are aiming for a trend continuation below $114K. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a positive region at 0.75, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed green candles above the signal line, and the indicator aims for positive momentum, strengthening long-position holders’ confidence.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $119,623, it will fuel a bullish rally to $123,298. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $115,501, beginning a bearish trend to $111,655. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin up today? Bitcoin faced a surge in buying demand as sellers failed to maintain domination around $114K. The recent lows triggered buying demand toward $117K. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $120K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC The SEC increased the number of allowed options contracts from 25,000 to 250,000 “for all ETFs with options,” which includes the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) but not the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC). Bitcoin price prediction August 2025 Bitcoin’s price jumped to $123,000, making July its best month in 2025. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its “halving” events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we’ll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $118,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $101,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction August 2025 $101,000 $105,000 $118,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year. Bitcoin price prediction 2031 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $285,058 and potentially rise to a maximum of $350,548. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $303,555 throughout the year.

Cathie Wood of Ark Invest forecasts Bitcoin may hit $600,000 by 2030, with a potential rise to $1.5 million in her bull case scenario after Bitcoin ETF approval (Bitcoin exchange traded funds). Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-09 07:50:00

The question now arises whether the correction has finally ended or that’s just a typical dead cat bounce. PI Token Price. Source: CoinGecko It’s safe to say that the PI token didn’t enjoy the past few months. Aside from a few brief and unsuccessful price pumps, the asset’s overall trend has been extremely bearish, which culminated at the beginning of August. PI dropped at the end of last week to a new all-time low of under $0.35 only to chart another negative record on August 6 at $0.335 (CoinGecko data). This meant that it had lost roughly 90% of its value since its all-time high at the end of February. The past day, though, has been highly beneficial for the entire cryptocurrency market. Led by ETH’s impressive performance and surge past $4,000, many altcoins have marked 5-8% gains, while a few, such as Pi Network’s coin, have exploded by double-digits. As of press time, PI stands at $0.4, which is 20% above the ATL marked just three days ago. While its community rejoices in this notable daily performance, others wonder whether this is a typical dead cat bounce moment, which is something the PI token has certainly done in the past. Looking ahead, the daily token unlocks are not as scary as they were in July. Data from PiScan shows that there’s only one day in the next month where the number of unlocked coins will near 10 million, while the average is at 5.6 million – a lot less than the 7-8 million average in June and July. This should ease some of the selling pressure on the asset, at least in theory. PI Token Unlock Schedule.

Many investors are wondering: could we truly see a significant Bitcoin rally in the coming months? Recent insights suggest this isn’t just wishful thinking; a potential Bitcoin bull market could be on the horizon. What’s Driving This Bold BTC Price Prediction ? Crypto analyst Kevin Svenson recently shared his perspective in a YouTube video, highlighting strong indicators for a sustained bull market. He believes Bitcoin (BTC) has the potential to surge approximately 30% from its current levels, targeting an impressive range of $140,000 to $150,000 during its next significant upward movement. This isn’t a random guess; Svenson’s analysis is rooted in a specific economic indicator. His methodology connects BTC’s price movements directly to global liquidity. Specifically, he tracks the M2 money supply, which measures the total amount of money in circulation, including cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near money. Svenson suggests that a rise in global liquidity often precedes or coincides with a strong Bitcoin bull market , acting as a significant tailwind for the asset. Understanding Crypto Market Liquidity and Its Influence Why is global liquidity so important for the crypto space? When there’s more money flowing through the global financial system, investors tend to seek out higher-risk, higher-reward assets like cryptocurrencies. This increased availability of capital can fuel demand and drive prices up. Svenson observed a clear pattern: changes in the M2 money supply often mirror Bitcoin’s price trajectory. This correlation suggests that as more liquidity enters the system, a portion of it finds its way into digital assets, boosting their value. The current M2 trend, according to Svenson, indicates continued strength. This ongoing influx of capital is a critical component of the analyst’s optimistic BTC price prediction . It provides a foundational support for a potential large-scale Bitcoin rally . Key observations from Svenson’s analysis include: Current Trend: The present M2 money supply trend points towards sustained positive momentum for the crypto market. Anticipated Peak: This strength is expected to continue into October and November of the current year. Potential Pullback Signal: A sharp decline in the liquidity index after this period could signal either a market peak or the beginning of a significant pullback for Bitcoin. Navigating the Path to a Bitcoin Future Price of $150K While the outlook is optimistic, it’s important to remember that market predictions are not guarantees. Investors should consider several factors when evaluating such bold forecasts for a high Bitcoin future price . Investors are keen to understand the factors influencing the Bitcoin future price . What could be the challenges on this path? Regulatory Changes: Unexpected regulatory shifts in major economies could impact market sentiment and slow down the Bitcoin rally . Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic downturns or interest rate hikes could reduce global liquidity, thereby affecting the crypto market liquidity that fuels growth. Black Swan Events: Unforeseen global events can always disrupt market trends, regardless of current indicators. However, the potential benefits of a significant Bitcoin surge are substantial for early adopters and long-term holders. A move to $150,000 would solidify Bitcoin’s position as a premier digital store of value and significantly increase its market capitalization, reinforcing the idea of a powerful Bitcoin bull market . Actionable Insights for Investors For those looking to navigate this potential bull run, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on global liquidity reports and expert analyses like Svenson’s. Understanding the flow of crypto market liquidity is crucial. Diversify: While Bitcoin is a strong contender, a diversified portfolio can mitigate risks. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose, and consider dollar-cost averaging to smooth out entry points. The prospect of Bitcoin reaching $150,000 is certainly exciting, fueled by the insights of analysts like Kevin Svenson and the observed correlation with global liquidity. While the path to such a price target may have its challenges, the underlying market dynamics, particularly the increasing crypto market liquidity , provide a compelling argument for continued growth. As we move closer to the projected peak in liquidity, staying informed and prepared will be key for investors looking to capitalize on this potential monumental shift in Bitcoin’s valuation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the basis for the $150K Bitcoin price prediction? The prediction by analyst Kevin Svenson is primarily based on the correlation between Bitcoin’s price movements and global liquidity, as measured by the M2 money supply. He observes that increased liquidity tends to fuel a Bitcoin rally. 2. How does M2 money supply relate to Bitcoin’s price? The M2 money supply indicates the total amount of money in circulation. When this supply increases, more capital is available in the financial system, often leading investors to seek higher-risk, higher-reward assets like Bitcoin, thus driving up its price. 3. When does the analyst expect the liquidity trend to shift? Kevin Svenson anticipates the current strong global liquidity trend to continue into October and November. After this period, he suggests a sharp decline in the liquidity index could signal a market peak or a pullback. 4. Are there risks to this Bitcoin rally prediction? Yes, like all market predictions, this forecast carries risks. Potential challenges include unforeseen regulatory changes, broader macroeconomic downturns that reduce global liquidity, and “black swan” events that can disrupt market trends. 5. What should investors do based on this forecast? Investors should stay informed about global liquidity reports, consider diversifying their portfolios, and practice sound risk management by only investing what they can afford to lose and potentially using dollar-cost averaging strategies.

Although Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) reaped the rewards of significant success in previous cycles, a new token on Ethereum— Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) —is already on track to be the next Top 3 meme coin by market capitalization. It is gaining rapid traction as it bears the unique combination of meme-centric allure, innovation in blockchain technology, and a swiftly expanding meme and crypto community. This positions Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) to dethrone both SHIB and PEPE in the coming months. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE): Meme Hype Meets Real Utility What makes Little Pepe different from other meme coins is that it is not solely driven by community hype; it is backed by real blockchain technology. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is building its own Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 blockchain designed explicitly for meme coin creation and trading. It offers extremely low gas fees, instant transaction finality, zero taxes, and built-in sniper bot protection. This makes it one of the most meme tokens with utility ever to hit the market. Little Pepe does not want to issue meme coins simply quickly; instead, he wants to offer a launchpad for meme coins of the future. Through the Meme Launchpad, developers will be able to launch new meme projects. They will be part of the Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) ecosystem, assuring them security, speed, and scalability, enabling them to build an entire community-driven assets ecosystem. Explosive Presale Performance and Community Backing The success of Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) presale is already being compared to the early hype of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. The token has raised over $14.8 million from early presale stages and is now selling out at a breakneck pace. A viral $777,000 giveaway has further fueled interest. The token is trending on CoinMarketCap, Twitter, and Telegram, and whales are quietly buying up the token. Now, with over 10.3 billion tokens sold and listings on centralized exchanges to be announced, Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is poised for its breakout launch. Unlike the majority of meme tokens that have a short-lived post-launch hype, Little Pepe has the infrastructure and developer support needed for sustained long-term growth. SHIB and PEPE: Still Powerful, but Losing Steam Both Shiba Inu and Pepe coin remain stagnant for now, but it seems like change may be afoot. The growth of SHIB peaked, then coin holders began to lose interest in transaction activities; on the other hand, PEPE, while having a breakout in 2023, still struggles with shedding the meme-only perspective. With no distinctive blockchain or infrastructure features, both coins are exposed to replacement by newer, dollar-utility projects like Little Pepe ($LILPEPE). SHIB and PEPE now seem to be stuck in a perpetual state of innovation mutation, with analysts and investors reworking their conjectures and predictions. If Little Pepe maintains its trajectory—releasing the layer 2, gaining listings on major exchanges, and bringing meme producers on board—by the end of 2025, it could easily rank higher than both in market capitalization. A Top 3 Meme Coin in the Making Currently priced at approximately $0.0018, Little Pepe presents a unique opportunity for investors looking for 100x or even 500x returns. If adequately hyped, utilized, and supported on exchanges, the token could very well soar to $0.50 – $1.00, thereby ranking it among the top three meme coins by market cap, right behind Dogecoin and potentially above SHIB and PEPE. One of the top advantages of Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is that it does not function solely as a meme; it operates as a meme infrastructure project, providing more value. That detail is significant as meme investors spend more time researching tokens that have both value growth and long-term potential. Conclusion The meme coin space is changing fast, and so is Little Pepe($LILPEPE). While SHIB and PEPE start to fade away, this new token on Ethereum is looking to create a foundation far greater than just fleeting attention. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is attempting to capture a spot in the Top 3 meme coins by besting the unprecedented presale demand and building community tools along with a Layer 2 blockchain. The end is PEPE, the beginning is Little Pepe, and just like that, meme coins have a new future.

The trend remains bullish, supported by steady buying interest and strong technical positioning. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Avoid Forced Selling: BTC Sits 7.4% Above Last Difficulty Bottom Key data shows that the correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 has surged to 80%. In this high-correlation regime, a continued rally in US equities could provide Bitcoin with a tailwind toward new highs, while an equity pullback could amplify downside volatility. With the S&P 500 currently in a bullish phase, BTC appears to be tracking the same trajectory. Still, market watchers caution that such high correlation levels are often short-lived and prone to sharp reversals. For now, traders are closely monitoring both equity and crypto charts, knowing that any shift in risk appetite across traditional markets could quickly ripple into Bitcoin’s price action. S&P 500 Correlation Strengthens Bitcoin’s Macro Link According to top analyst Axel Adler, the recent 80% correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 underscores how deeply macroeconomic forces are influencing the crypto market. In this environment, key drivers such as interest rate expectations, liquidity conditions, and the broader risk-on/risk-off sentiment are directly transmitted to BTC’s price action. Under this regime, a sustained recovery in US equities will likely provide a supportive backdrop for Bitcoin. Conversely, if stock markets experience a downturn, the negative sentiment could quickly spill over into the crypto space, amplifying sell-offs and triggering broader market weakness. Adler points out that the current reading is based on a 1-week rolling correlation metric, which is inherently volatile. Historically, such correlation spikes are rarely sustained for long periods. The present level, while significant, is unlikely to hold for more than a few weeks before reverting toward its mean. Despite the short-term nature of this spike, the analyst emphasizes that the growth of crypto adoption in the US—from institutional products like ETFs to corporate treasury allocations—sets the stage for a bullish long-term outlook. Still, traders must remain mindful that macroeconomic downturns, tightening liquidity, or shifts in Federal Reserve policy could rapidly reverse market sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Futures Bias Turns Neutral As OI Net Position Hits Zero – Details Bitcoin Price Analysis: Bulls Defend Key Support Bitcoin (BTC) is trading around $116,565, holding steady after reclaiming the $115,724 support level, which coincides with a key horizontal zone from late July. On the 4-hour chart, BTC recently broke above the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day SMAs, signaling short-term bullish momentum. These moving averages, now converging near $116,000, could act as a strong support cluster if tested again. The immediate upside target remains the $122,077 resistance, last tested in mid-July. However, BTC has faced selling pressure near $117,000, indicating short-term consolidation before a possible push higher. Volume has tapered slightly after the breakout, suggesting that buyers may need fresh momentum to sustain the move.

Alongside rising activity on cross-chain DeFi project platforms like Remittix , TRX is now forecast to hit $0.45 in 2026, up from its current range near $0.32. Analysts point to stronger TVL metrics , rising dApp usage, and stablecoin growth. Momentum in the Tron ecosystem has pushed some to revisit the idea of TRX becoming the next 100x crypto. Projections for 2025 cite average highs around $0.34, with extreme cases placing the price closer to the $0.89 mark . Investors are eyeing Tron’s DeFi projects for crypto with passive income potential as liquidity continues surging. Remittix Is Quietly Becoming the Breakout Presale of 2025 Remittix is drawing major interest as a high-growth crypto that tackles real-world problems. The project’s focus on fast, low gas fee crypto payments makes it a standout across the best DeFi projects of 2025. It recently revealed its wallet interface, launching in Q3, with a 40% token bonus as it has achieved its $18M softcap. At a price of just $0.0895, Remittix has already raised over $18.4 million with over 585M+ tokens sold.

Key reasons why Remittix is leading the pack: Cross-border payments settle in under 60 seconds Powerful use cases in DeFi and crypto staking tools Upcoming listings and wallet beta may boost visibility Real-world adoption across Africa and South Asia Smart investors are rushing to buy the RTX token early Analysts agree: Why Remittix is the best crypto presale of the year isn’t just a marketing phrase. It’s a reflection of on-chain metrics and adoption speed. TRX Price Prediction Supports Bullish Mid-Term Target Short-term TRX price prediction models suggest a slow but stable climb into Q1 2026. Several market analysts, including Binance and Bitget, now see $0.45 as a feasible target if TVL maintains upward momentum. Platforms like Changelly and Kraken highlight that increased DeFi activity could act as a strong price driver. Source: TradingView With new stablecoin options, meme coin integrations, and growing dApp incentives, Tron is being seen as a top crypto under $1 . This makes it especially attractive to retail investors looking for undervalued crypto projects with real utility.

This individual, who held their digital assets for an incredible eight years, has now offloaded a significant portion of their holdings, turning a modest initial investment into millions. This remarkable transaction highlights the immense potential of long-term crypto holding and the power of patience in the dynamic digital asset market. The Ethereum Whale’s Astounding Profit Journey This specific Ethereum whale’s journey is nothing short of incredible. According to insights from on-chain analyst @EmberCN on X , this address withdrew 3,865 ETH from the Kraken exchange in early 2017. At that time, each token was priced at a mere $13. This meant their initial investment amounted to approximately $50,000. Over the years, this patient holder gradually sold off a smaller portion, specifically 565 ETH. However, the recent significant ETH sale of 3,280 tokens represents the bulk of their remaining holdings. This latest move brings their total realized gains to an astonishing $14.43 million. This translates into a staggering 288-fold return on their original $50,000 investment. It is a powerful reminder of the exponential growth possible within the cryptocurrency space for those who hold conviction. What Does Long-Term Crypto Holding Truly Mean? This story serves as a profound testament to the benefits of long-term crypto holding . Many investors seek quick gains, but this whale’s strategy demonstrates the profound rewards from unwavering patience and strong conviction in an asset’s fundamental value. Holding through multiple market cycles, including challenging bear markets, allowed this investor to capitalize fully on Ethereum’s significant growth over nearly a decade. This strategic patience is a cornerstone of a successful crypto investment strategy for many seasoned participants. Key aspects of long-term holding: Patience: Waiting out market fluctuations instead of reacting to every dip or peak. Conviction: Believing in the underlying technology and long-term potential. Reduced Stress: Less frequent trading often leads to less emotional decision-making. Compounding Gains: Allowing profits to accumulate over extended periods. Unpacking the ETH Sale with On-Chain Analysis The ability to track such precise transactions, revealing the full scope of this Ethereum whale ‘s profit, is thanks to sophisticated on-chain analysis . Tools and expert analysts, like @EmberCN , continuously monitor public blockchain addresses. This provides unparalleled transparency into major movements of digital assets, offering insights that traditional markets often lack. This recent ETH sale offers valuable data for market observers. It clearly shows significant profit-taking by a long-term holder, which can sometimes signal broader market sentiment. Large holders, often referred to as whales, possess the capacity to influence market dynamics. Understanding their movements helps shed light on potential trends and liquidity shifts within the ecosystem. This transparency is a unique feature of blockchain technology. Key Takeaways for Your Crypto Investment Strategy What valuable lessons can everyday investors glean from this Ethereum whale’s remarkable success? The narrative provides several actionable insights for anyone navigating the complex world of digital assets: Patience is Paramount: The eight-year holding period underscores the immense value of adopting a long-term perspective. Short-term noise often distracts from long-term potential. Early Entry Advantage: While not everyone can buy ETH at $13 today, identifying and investing early in promising technologies or projects can yield significant returns. Thorough research is key. Risk Management is Crucial: All crypto investments carry inherent risks due to market volatility and regulatory uncertainties. Diversification across different assets and careful risk assessment are always crucial components of a sound crypto investment strategy . Stay Informed with On-Chain Analysis: Following reliable sources of on-chain analysis can provide unique insights into market dynamics, large holder behavior, and overall liquidity, helping you make more informed decisions. The recent ETH sale by an Ethereum whale serves as a compelling narrative of immense profit derived from unwavering conviction and long-term crypto holding . It powerfully reminds us that while volatility is a constant companion in the crypto market, strategic patience, combined with informed decisions, can unlock extraordinary financial gains. This incredible journey from a modest investment to millions offers a profound lesson for aspiring and seasoned investors alike, underscoring the potential for life-changing returns in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies.
