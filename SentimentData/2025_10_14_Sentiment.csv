Traders and investors are carefully observing XRP’s momentum, but the search for the next breakout candidate does not end there. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is slowly gaining attention as a showstopper set to replicate the same kind of explosive growth. Already in Phase 6 of its presale and having sold out over 65%, MUTM is more than a speculation coin, it’s a carefully crafted DeFi ecosystem that incorporates innovative functionality, community-governance, and a roadmap structured for long-term growth. With momentum in its current presale and increasing investor curiosity, MUTM may be the altcoin to focus on alongside Ripple as both tokens set their sight on hefty gains in 2025. Ripple Price Prediction: Ready to Record a Sudden Jump to $5 XRP is now trading near the $2.70 support level, a region it has tested several times, showing strength and continued investor demand. So long as this support level remains, there may be continued momentum for a swift push toward the $5 mark, spurred by renewed buying demand and favorable sentiment. Even if the overall market gets volatile, XRP’s finding a floor above $2.70, and $2.60 as the next important safety net, indicates that there’s still a clear direction ahead for bulls. As market players hold out for this possible breakout, eyes are looking to emerging altcoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which has been making a lot of noise as investors are looking for the next high-priority project. Mutuum Finance Presale Buzz Builds Up Steam Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining investor attention this week following tremendous speed in Phase 6 of presale. The tokens are currently valued at $0.035, a 16.17% increment from the previous round. Over 16,910 investors have already purchased generating over $17.25 million, healthfully depicting an emerging market confidence in the bright DeFi future of Mutuum Finance. With over 65% sold in Phase 6, early investors are acquiring their buy-ins before the next increment. Even collateral management is optimized, for eventual ultimate power-to-borrow by mutual complementing leveraging off the related holdings, with the ultimate bankruptcy risk elimination and overall platform health. Real-Time Data via Chainlink Oracles To achieve proper, stable prices and risk valuation, Mutuum Finance utilizes Chainlink oracles for feeds of USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, sophisticated data feeds, and decentralized exchange TWAPS also ensure that valuation derived from a protocol remains accurate, no matter record-record volatility or illiquidity. Mutuum’s lending and borrowing protocol has a launch impending. Version 1 (V1) of it will debut on Sepolia Testnet in Q4, 2025, and it will have key components which are as follows: liquidity pools,mtTokens,debt tokens, liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be provided at the launch for collaterals, lending, and borrowing and will give the users the efficient, scalable, and secure DeFi. The platform also provides floating-, fixed-, and floating/fixed-degree tools and balances the supply versus the demand for the liquids as well as stabilizes the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance to Blast Off Ripple (XRP) registers resilience near $2.70, predicting a possible jump to $5, but altcoin investors looking for the next alt to have high potential are focusing on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Phase 6 of the presale of MUTM has already generated more than $17.25 million from over 16,910 investors, and 65% of tokens have been sold. Its forthcoming Sepolia Testnet protocol for lending and borrowing, involving liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot, coupled with Chainlink oracle-led pricing and sound risk management, make MUTM a secure, scalable, and efficient DeFi ecosystem. Early investors must invest now to acquire MUTM tokens prior to the presale progressing, and reap huge gains.

Related Reading: ‘BNB Isn’t Crumbling’: CZ Slams Critics Stirring Fear And Doubt The rally comes after a sharp sell-off triggered by geopolitical tensions earlier this month, followed by an aggressive rebound fueled by whale accumulation and institutional inflows. According to CoinGlass, daily trading volume jumped 55% to $10.7 billion, while open interest rose 25%, signaling fresh leveraged positions betting on continued upside momentum. BNB’s sharp turnaround mirrors broader market stabilization but with stronger conviction. Traders are now eyeing a move toward $1,450–$1,500, a region that would mark a new all-time high for the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. BNB's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: BNBUSD on Tradingview CZ Attributes BNB Price Rally to Genuine Market Demand Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) weighed in on the rally, emphasizing that BNB’s recent strength comes from organic market demand, not artificial liquidity support. “BNB has no market makers,” he stated, adding that the price recovery reflects the community’s belief, builder activity, and deflationary mechanisms that continue to burn tokens. CZ also praised BNB Chain ecosystem contributors such as Venus and Binance, who “took hundreds of millions out of their own pockets to protect users” during the recent volatility, a move he described as a demonstration of “different value systems.” His comments helped solidify investor sentiment, with analysts noting that CZ’s transparency about internal market structure has reassured traders that BNB’s rally is fundamentally driven rather than speculative. The token’s deflationary model and sustained ecosystem utility continue to underpin long-term confidence. Can BNB Break $1,500 Next? From a technical standpoint, BNB’s breakout above $1,236 resistance has activated bullish momentum, with the RSI hovering near 65, showing strong but not overbought conditions. MACD crossover and robust volume spikes point to further upside potential. A close above $1,349 (the October 7 high) could propel the token toward $1,400–$1,452, with the next key psychological milestone at $1,500.

Bitcoin surged to an unprecedented all-time high (ATH) of $126,080 last Monday, propelling the entire digital asset market upward. Investor attention also continued flooding into altcoins and the best meme coins , many of which have already set fresh valuation milestones in 2025. However, Trump’s Friday announcement of 100% tariffs on China sent stocks and crypto reeling, with crypto turning into an absolute bloodbath. In the space of an hour, it was not uncommon to see leading cryptos shed 30%. Many argue the sell-off was good for the industry as it squeezed out over-leveraged players, lining the way for an imminent bull run. This is not just hope; this is a historical pattern. With that in mind, let’s see which altcoins are the best to buy ahead of a crypto gold rush. Ripple (XRP): 2025’s Cross-Border Payment Leader Poised for More ATHs XRP ($XRP) , the token powering Ripple’s ultra-fast, low-cost payment system, continues to show its superiority to legacy payment rails like SWIFT. Backing from the UN Capital Development Fund and collaborations with several major U.S. banks have propelled XRP to the third-largest crypto by market capitalization, now hovering near $157 billion. Ripple’s recent unveiling of RLUSD, a USD-pegged stablecoin, underscores its ambition to capture the expanding stablecoin industry. Over the past 12 months, XRP has climbed 387%, hitting its first new high in seven years at $3.65 on July 18. It outperformed Bitcoin more than 4x, which grew 83% in the same timeframe. With a relative strength index (RSI) near 40, XRP appears primed for a rebound after a 13% dip in price since last Monday. Meanwhile, the overall $4.02 trillion crypto market has rebounded 5%, as it quickly recovers from the crash. Technical indicators show two bullish flag formations on XRP’s summer charts, awaiting a breakout. Should ETF approvals arrive by mid-October, positive sentiment could push XRP toward the $5–$10 range, or possibly higher. Solana ($SOL): Ethereum’s Top Challenger and This Week’s Breakout Star Solana ($SOL) remains one of the fastest and most efficient blockchain ecosystems, now commanding a market cap of around $107 billion. Its total value locked (TVL) has risen to over $11.3 billion , reflecting robust growth in its DeFi ecosystem. Anticipation is building for potential Solana spot ETF approvals in the U.S. this month, a move that could invite large-scale institutional inflows, similar to those enjoyed by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. However, the US government’s ongoing partial shutdown has meant that previous deadlines are up in the air Solana’s RSI sits at 42 and rising, as it returns to convergence with its 30-day moving average, indicating timely recovery. Support holds firm around $150, preventing steep declines, with resistance at $250, a level that, if broken, could spark another sharp rally. Revisiting its prior ATH of $293.31, or even surpassing $500, remains possible before 2025 concludes. Cardano ($ADA): The Eco-Friendly Smart Contract Network Targeting 2026 Growth Cardano ($ADA) has sustained momentum and investor confidence throughout 2025, rising 101% in the last 365 days and outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Created by Charles Hoskinson, an Ethereum co-founder, Cardano emphasizes a scientific, energy-efficient design, built upon a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. Its academic approach has even influenced portions of Ethereum’s ongoing roadmap. With a current market capitalization of over $32 billion, ADA would need to triple its value to seriously contend with Solana and challenge Ethereum’s dominance. Now trading around $0.7114, ADA has gained 10% in the last 24 hours, suggesting very rapid post-crash re-accumulation. Favorable conditions could lift ADA toward $1.50 by autumn, and possibly test its $3.09 ATH by year’s end. Even without major policy shifts, steady adoption trends could still see ADA approach $2 within 2025. From a technical standpoint, ADA formed a bullish flag pattern over the summer, a setup often preceding major upward movement. Although it briefly lost momentum amid September’s broader market pullback, the pattern remains without a clear breakout. Key resistance levels sit near $1.15, with strong support zones between $0.65 and $0.70. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): Bitcoin Layer-2 to Revitalize Bitcoin? Among 2025’s most talked-about newcomers, Bitcoin’s vital new Layer 2, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , is rapidly attracting investor attention, raising over $23.3 million in presale funding. The project aims to become an integral part of Bitcoin’s ecosystem by upgrading Bitcoin’s scalability and functionality through a Layer-2 solution infused with meme culture energy. Analysts forecast potential 10x or greater returns following launch. Developed on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER offers smart contract support, low-cost, high-speed transactions, and a Canonical Bridge that enables near-instant Bitcoin transfers, dApp integration, and meme token interoperability. A Coinsult audit recently verified zero security vulnerabilities, reinforcing investor confidence. The HYPER token powers this ecosystem through governance, staking, and transaction fees. Early backers can earn up to 50% APY from staking while participating in DAO governance. Visit the official presale website or follow Bitcoin Hyper on X and Telegram for more information.

Historically, “Uptober” has often marked the beginning of extended bull runs. Last Monday, Bitcoin rallied to a new ATH, although Trump’s Friday announcement of 100% tariffs on China scuppered crypto’s progress and resulted in some of the worst intraday price performance ever seen. Still, many crypto old-hands say this was the shakeout the market needed. Historically, crypto has a habit of crashing badly before every major bull run. They argue that it was a cleansing event, which squeezed out the over-leveraged and the fickle-handed. XRP ($XRP): ChatGPT Predicts a Surge to $20 ChatGPT projects that Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could potentially surge to between $10 and $20 before the New Year, a nearly eightfold jump from its current price of $2.57 if it hits the upper end. Source: ChatGPT XRP progenitor Ripple this year won a five-year legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), propelling XRP to $3.65 on July 18, its first all-time high (ATH) since 2017. Over the last 12 months, XRP’s price has soared by 381%, making it the best-performing large-cap unpegged crypto. During the same timeframe, Bitcoin rose by 83%, and Ethereum’s price appreciated 67%. Technical analysis shows three distinct bullish flag setups throughout 2025, including two during the summer months, signals often preceding a strong breakout that hasn’t materialized yet. Analysts now expect October’s historically bullish seasonality, along with possible ETF approvals, clearer U.S. crypto legislation, and more Ripple partnerships, to catalyze the march to $20 Dogecoin ($DOGE): ChatGPT Predicts Doge Could Leap Well Beyond Doge Army’s $1 Target Launched in 2013 as a lighthearted joke, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has evolved into a top-tier cryptocurrency, boasting a $31 billion market capitalization within the broader $67 billion meme coin sector. Its staying power is down to an active global community and increasing use cases in online payments. Currently trading around $0.20, with an RSI hovering near 40 and trending upward, Dogecoin has surged 9% in 24 hours with plenty of headroom left for further upward moves this week. Over the last 24 hours, DOGE outperformed Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana, all of which are recovering quickly from the flash crash, but Dogecoin is exhibiting its meme coin tendency to multiply daily crypto price trends. Chart patterns across 2025 highlight multiple bullish formations, laying the groundwork for a bullish breakout. According to ChatGPT’s projection, DOGE could finish the year between $1.50 and $3, with the upper range representing an aggressive stretch target. A more conservative expectation would place the token between $0.25 and $0.40. Given its previous all-time high was $0.7316 during the 2021 bull market, any move past the Doge Army’s long-sighted $1 target is wishful. Mainstream adoption continues to grow: Tesla still accepts Dogecoin for merchandise, while platforms such as PayPal and Revolut have integrated DOGE transactions into their ecosystems. Pepe ($PEPE): ChatGPT Predicts Meme Coin Favorite Reclaiming Its All-Time High Debuting in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) now commands a market cap of $3.2 billion, the largest among non-dog-themed tokens. Inspired by Matt Furie’s “Boy’s Club” comic, Pepe’s deep webcomic/meme has made it a viral sensation across crypto circles and beyond. Despite heavy competition, Pepe maintains healthy liquidity and strong community engagement, at times buoyed by cryptic but bullish nods from likely fan Elon Musk on his X profile. Currently trading near $0.0000075, the token remains about 73% below its December 2024 peak of $0.00002803. In ChatGPT’s optimistic scenario, Pepe could reclaim its previous all-time high, nearly quadrupling in value from current levels, if it crosses sticky resistance at $0.000018. With an RSI near 34, Pepe is currently trading at a low price, making now an attractive point to accumulate. As investor confidence returns, Pepe has a shot at a new ATH a year after the last. Missed out on DOGE? Enter Maxi Doge (MAXI): A Contender Guzzling Community Hype and Degen Power A new Dogecoin challenger has hit the presales market called Maxi Doge ($MAXI) . Early investors are piling into MAXI, having already backed the presale with nearly $3.6 million in early contributions.

Despite the US-China trade war–driven liquidation event that wiped out bullish setups for most altcoins , SOL has reaffirmed historical support at $173. Whales seem to be treating the 24% weekly decline as a discount, with a sharp spike in the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicating heavy accumulation likely led by large holders. SOL Chaikin Money Flow.

CoinGlass data adds weight to the trend, showing nearly $27 million in Solana exchange outflows, suggesting whales are moving holdings to self-custody in anticipation of a recovery. Solana Price Prediction: Whales are Positioned for a $1,000 Surge? The bounce at $173 has validated the lower boundary of a six-month rising wedge , with the pattern now approaching its apex and momentum building fast. This support zone has once again acted as a launchpad, shifting attention back toward a potential breakout. SOL / USD 1-day chart, ascending wedge pattern. Source: TradingView. On the 1-day SOL/USD chart , the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reversed sharply from a near-oversold reading of 33 , while the MACD histogram signals seller exhaustion, suggesting bulls are regaining control. The key breakout level sits at $300 , marking Solana’s all-time high from earlier this year. If SOL flips that level into support, it could enter price discovery mode , opening the door to a rally toward $500 , a 160% upside from current levels. In the short term, the $190 demand zone will be crucial. A confirmed bounce from here could set a higher base for a sustained uptrend. Looking ahead, macro factors like interest rate cuts , corporate treasury buying , and potential spot ETF approvals could push SOL toward the $1,000 mark , a 415% surge as the bull market gains steam. SNORTER: The Tool to Make the Most of the Marker Rebounds Solana has a history of starting surges in its meme coin market. Its last all-time high saw the birth of 10x–1000x coins like Fartcoin and Melania. Now, Solana’s next meme wave is forming, and Snorter ($SNORT) might be the edge traders need to catch it early Snorter Bot is built for competitive trading: limit-order sniping to grab the sharpest entries, MEV-resistant swaps that shield you from frontrunners, copy trading that mirrors proven winners, and rug-pull protection that helps filter out scams before you commit. Just as importantly, Snorter guides exits. It helps traders lock in profits at the right moment, often the difference between a small win and a huge one. The stats look solid too. The presale has raised almost $4 million, while early stakers are still earning up to 108% APY before the next phase begins next week. And the timing couldn’t be better. The macro narrative is driving capital back into risk assets like meme coins—making Snorter even more valuable as momentum builds across the sector.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency is regaining ground after last week’s selloff, lifted by renewed corporate buying and easing geopolitical stress between the U.S. and China. The headline move came from Strategy, the largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally, which quietly bought 220 BTC for $27 million just before prices dipped to $110,000. Despite volatility, the firm now holds 640,250 BTC, valued at around $73 billion. This latest purchase, financed through preferred share sales, nudged Strategy’s average purchase price to roughly $74,000. Analysts see it as yet another show of faith. “Large holders like Strategy don’t flinch in market swings; they anchor Bitcoin’s long-term floor,” one market strategist told reporters. Such steady institutional positioning continues to signal confidence, keeping the broader market structure intact and setting the tone for the next potential rally. BlackRock’s $94B ETF Strengthens the Case Adding to the momentum, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, recently likened Bitcoin to gold in a CBS interview , marking a complete reversal from his earlier skepticism. “Crypto has a role, just like gold does,” he said. JUST IN: $12 trillion BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says, “There is a role for crypto the same way there is a role for gold.” “This is not a bad asset.” pic.twitter.com/PeTORJ3PHB — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) October 13, 2025 BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust now manages roughly $94 billion, and half its investors are first-time clients. That mix of institutional and retail demand is deepening Bitcoin’s mainstream footprint, reinforcing its identity as “digital gold” amid inflation worries. Fink’s endorsement has fueled renewed investor trust. Retail interest is surging, widening the crypto market base. Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative continues to mature. Wall Street’s growing embrace of Bitcoin adds another layer of validation, suggesting that the asset’s next phase of adoption could come from traditional portfolios seeking stability and diversification. Trump’s BTC Holdings Add Political Weight In another surprising twist, President Donald Trump has become one of Bitcoin’s biggest individual holders. His company, Trump Media, purchased $2 billion in Bitcoin earlier this year, giving him an indirect stake of roughly $870 million through his 41% ownership. JUST IN: Forbes says President Donald Trump ""is now one of the largest #bitcoin investors on the planet,"" owning an estimated $870 million in BTC pic.twitter.com/uvCtkvDdv4 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) October 13, 2025 The move mirrors Michael Saylor’s playbook at MicroStrategy, turning Trump Media into a Bitcoin-treasury-style company. Since the purchase, Bitcoin’s price has risen nearly 6%, reflecting growing optimism around the alignment between political influence and crypto adoption. Market watchers now view this convergence, between Wall Street, corporate America, and political power, as the strongest signal yet of Bitcoin’s institutional legitimacy. Bitcoin Technical Setup: Bulls Target $122K Technically, Bitcoin trades in a tight consolidation channel between $112,700 and $117,600. A breakout above $116,100—the key 50% Fibonacci retracement—could trigger renewed bullish momentum toward $119,800–$122,500. The RSI at 56 shows improving buying strength, while lower candle wicks highlight consistent dip accumulation. If resistance holds, BTC could retest $111,200, where strong support aligns with the 23.6% Fib retracement. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview For short-term traders, a close above $116,000 sets up a possible continuation pattern, while institutions continue to treat every dip as a buying opportunity. With sentiment improving, ETF inflows steady, and macro tensions easing, Bitcoin’s path toward $122K may only be getting started. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of Bitcoin on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult, the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $23.4 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013105 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems. If Bitcoin built the foundation, Bitcoin Hyper could make it fast, flexible, and fun again.

53103840,605059,1760396423,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53103840.jpeg,Are XRP Futures ETFs Good For The Price? Expert Breaks Down What You Should Know,https://bitcoinist.com/are-xrp-futures-etfs-good/,"According to crypto analyst Jake Claver, XRP futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) don’t actually help the token’s price. He explains that these products do not purchase real XRP tokens. Instead, they trade contracts that settle in cash. Because they don’t buy or lock away tokens, there is no real demand or supply pressure on XRP. In contrast, spot XRP ETFs could have a much bigger effect. These would require fund managers to buy and hold actual XRP tokens, removing them from circulation. As a result, once these spot ETFs are approved, demand from institutional investors could push prices higher. Jake Claver Explains Why XRP Futures ETFs Don’t Drive Real Demand Jake Claver explains that futures ETFs don’t buy a single XRP token. They are cash-settled contracts, meaning investors are only trading paper agreements, not the tangible asset . Fund managers buy and roll these futures contracts before they expire, and even if delivery ever happens, they immediately sell the tokens right back. This process keeps XRP’s actual supply untouched. Claver calls this “paper trading dressed up in an ETF wrapper.” It looks like a real investment in XRP, but it is not. Since futures ETFs never hold the actual token, they do not create any pressure on XRP’s supply. There is no actual buying demand, and that means no upward push on price. He also notes that this setup only checks a regulatory box for the SEC. The SEC usually wants six months of futures trading before approving any spot ETF. For Claver, XRP’s futures ETFs are part of that early stage, not a significant price driver. Why Spot XRP ETFs Could Trigger A Real Supply Shock While futures ETFs have little real effect, Claver believes spot ETFs could change the game. Unlike futures, spot ETFs require fund managers to buy actual XRP tokens for every dollar invested. Those tokens are then held in custody by regulated institutions like Coinbase or Anchorage, removing them from the open market. Each share of the ETF is backed by real XRP, often between five and fifty tokens per share, and these tokens stay locked unless investors sell. Claver compares this to what happened with Bitcoin. Futures ETFs have existed since 2017, but Bitcoin’s real growth only began when spot ETFs launched in January. According to Claver, XRP is now in a similar position. The market has already met the SEC’s futures requirement, meaning spot ETFs could soon be approved. When that happens, institutional investors will need to buy large amounts of XRP in a market with very low liquidity. The launch of spot XRP ETFs could trigger intense price discovery and what Claver calls a “mathematical supply shock.” He believes the real move for XRP will start when institutions compete for actual tokens in a market that’s already running dry. Futures ETFs may have opened the door, but spot ETFs could be what finally pushes XRP into its next significant phase.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-13 23:00:23

Meanwhile, new altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE are drawing early attention as investors position for the next crypto uptrend. Bitcoin Price Prediction: $150K Remains Possible The Bitcoin price prediction for $150,000 by 2025 remains unchanged, even after a 10% pullback to around $102,759. Analysts say the dip is normal profit-taking after weeks of heavy accumulation. Over $5.6 billion in long positions were liquidated as volatility picked up, but institutional inflows continue to balance the sell pressure. BlackRock, Fidelity, and ARK Invest have expanded their Bitcoin exposure, fueling growing optimism among long-term holders. Geoffrey Kendrick from Standard Chartered still believes Bitcoin could reach as high as $200,000 if institutional capital keeps flowing at this rate. Recent ETF data backs this view. Spot Bitcoin ETFs added $2.71 billion in weekly inflows, bringing total assets to nearly $159 billion , or 7% of Bitcoin’s market cap. That shows big investors are still accumulating through structured products, even as short-term traders exit positions. ETF Activity Shows Confidence in Bitcoin Future Bitcoin’s short-term correction has not stopped ETF investors from buying the dip. Monday alone saw $1.21 billion in inflows, the second-largest single-day total since launch. This pattern suggests long-term allocators are using temporary price drops to build positions. BlackRock’s IBIT fund now holds over $65 billion , leading the market, while Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s GBTC showed smaller outflows. Analysts call this a short-term shakeout, not a reversal. Vincent Liu from Kronos Research noted, “Capital keeps flowing into BTC as allocators double down on the digital gold conviction trade.” With 31 new crypto ETF applications awaiting SEC review, institutional access to Bitcoin is expanding faster than ever, reinforcing why many still call it the best crypto to buy now . Key Bitcoin Price Highlights Bitcoin dropped 10% to $112,759 on Friday on Trump announcement $5.6B in long positions liquidated during the correction. ETFs logged $2.71B inflows this week despite volatility. Analysts hold to the $150K Bitcoin price prediction for 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A New Altcoin Gaining Buzz Before Bitcoin’s Next Move As Bitcoin gears toward a new rally phase, MAGACOIN FINANCE has caught early attention as a best crypto to buy now alongside BTC. Priced under $0.0006 , it is still new with a small market cap, making it one of the few altcoins that could post a 20x surge if momentum builds this quarter. Analysts believe that once Bitcoin breaks above $150K, fresh liquidity will flow into newer coins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Its early stage and compact price range create room for faster expansion compared to larger-cap assets. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE: Price below $0.0006 , early entry opportunity Small market cap, room for rapid expansion Could reach $0.0012 this quarter as Bitcoin rallies Community-backed and building fast How Traders Should Position Now Traders watching this Bitcoin price prediction may see the current dip as a setup for the next leg higher.

Related Reading: ‘BNB Isn’t Crumbling’: CZ Slams Critics Stirring Fear And Doubt According to reports, the court’s approval on October 13 allows the exchange to move ahead with a court-supervised recovery process tied to the $234 million hack that hit the platform in July 2024. Creditor Vote And Numbers Based on reports from the company, the revised plan won broad backing from affected account holders. In an August revote, 95.7% of participating scheme creditors voted in favor, and those votes came from 143,190 participating creditors representing about $196 million in approved claims. The strong turnout and result were used by WazirX to press its case to the Singapore court. Thank you to everyone who supported this difficult phase of WazirX. The Singapore High Court has approved the scheme. Its your support and love that has made this possible ❤️ Now we set out on the next phase to work hard and create value for everyone. We’re here because of YOU… — Nischal (Shardeum) 🔼 (@NischalShetty) October 13, 2025 The hack itself exploited a Safe Multisig wallet in mid-July 2024 and drained a large pool of user funds. Investigations and media accounts linked the breach to advanced cyber operators, and the theft forced WazirX to freeze both crypto and rupee withdrawals while legal options were explored. What Users Will Receive According to several outlets, users may recover a substantial portion of lost funds under the approved plan. Reports have said recoveries could reach up to 55% of the losses, delivered as a mix of immediate liquid payments and so-called Recovery Tokens that represent remaining claims to be fulfilled over time. WazirX has said the first wave of payouts — in stablecoin or USDT equivalent — would follow once the scheme takes effect. That mix means some users will get cash-equivalent payments quickly while others will hold tokens that the company intends to redeem as it regains assets or generates revenue. The plan shifts part of the repayment responsibility to entities inside India to comply with local rules, a change that was highlighted during court rounds. The road to approval was not straight. The Singapore court had earlier rejected a first version of the scheme after judges raised questions over the plan’s structure and oversight. That decision forced WazirX and its advisers to rework the proposal and secure a fresh vote from creditors before returning to court. Related Reading: XRP Traders Face Fresh Selling Pressure As Large Holders Move Out Next Steps And Timeline If the scheme becomes effective under the court’s timetable, WazirX says distributions of available liquid assets will begin within 10 business days. That window is expected to trigger the initial USDT transfers while RTs are recorded for the remainder of approved claims. The exchange will still need to finish legal formalities and coordinate with payment processors and regulators.

David Namdar, Chief Executive Officer at CEA Industries, said that BNB’s latest positive performance is not unexpected at all. Rather, it is the result of years of investing in robust ecosystem growth initially. BNB is on again The 32nd $BNB burn in July destroyed ~1,595,600 BNB (~$1.024B USD). With $BNB near all-time highs again, I'm expecting the next burn to pack even more firepower. What’s your estimate for the burn amount & USD value? #BNBBurn @BNBNetworkCo — David J. Namdar (@namdar) October 10, 2025 He believes that the market is just catching up to the “credibility, scale, and utility of the BNB ecosystem.” His company holds the world’s largest BNB Coin treasury, owning 480,000 tokens worth over $660 million at the time of writing. BNB Price Prediction: BNB Recovers After Hitting Key Support During Flash Crash BNB volumes have gone up by 72.3% in the past 24 hours, as the token hit a new all-time high at $1,370. This figure accounts for 7% of the asset’s circulating supply, underscoring the strength of the buying spree. The daily chart shows a sharp reaction from buyers as BNB touched $900 , with above-average volume confirming it as a key support level. Today’s spike suggests momentum is building, and further gains could be on the horizon. The $1,350 zone remains a critical resistance. A breakout above it would likely confirm the start of a new leg higher, potentially pushing BNB toward $2,000 as traders recover from Friday’s volatility. While the BNB ecosystem is known for its scalability, it still ranks as the third-largest chain by total value locked (TVL) . But what if the next big breakout doesn’t come from BNB or Solana? A new presale called Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is turning heads by tapping into the massive, untouched value on the Bitcoin network , using Solana-grade speed to unlock staking, DeFi, and more through a purpose-built layer-2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Raises $24M to Launch Its Powerful L2 Since its launch, Bitcoin (BTC) holders have not been able to earn passive income on their investment as the network does not support the launch of smart contracts. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) changes this with the launch of a side chain that will allow investors to hold, stake, and lend their assets to further monetize their holdings. It all starts with the Hyper Bridge – a Bitcoin-native solution that safely holds users’ BTC tokens in a designated Bitcoin wallet. The protocol immediately mints the corresponding amount of assets on the Hyper L2 to give investors access to a growing number of decentralized apps (dApps) built on this Solana-based side chain. By leveraging the power of the second largest smart contracts network in the space, Bitcoin Hyper will overcome the hurdles that have prevented the top crypto from taking over as the top DeFi chain. To buy $HYPER while it is still available at a discounted presale price, simply head to the Bitcoin Hyper official website and link up your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to invest.

Under this framework, XRP qualifies as an eligible asset, placing it on the fast track to approval and paving the way for regulated spot exposure in U.S. TradFi markets XRP Price Prediction: Is this the Catalyst That Puts $1,000 In Focus? Fresh demand from TradFi markets could give XRP the momentum it needs to confirm the breakout of a year-long ascending triangle pattern. Although the weekend’s mass liquidation event invalidated most short-term bullish setups, this wider structure remains in play. XRP / USD 1-day chart, year-long ascending triangle pattern. Source: TradingView. Momentum indicators now refocus attention on the breakout, reaffirming $1.50 as a potential bottom. The RSI has sharply reversed after dipping into oversold territory at 30, while the MACD histogram shows a possible bottom forming below the signal line—signaling buyers are returning as sellers lose steam. The key breakout threshold sits at $3.40, a resistance level that has capped upside throughout the pattern. Once flipped to support, XRP could rally 210% toward its $8 technical target . In the near term, however, traders should watch for a bounce from the $2.70 demand zone to confirm higher support for a sustained uptrend. Looking further ahead, expanding exposure to U.S. TradFi markets and U.S. interest rate cuts to fuel risk-on sentiment could propel XRP toward $15 running into 2026—a potential 500% gain. While the $1,000 XRP price target remains distant right now, these new touchpoints for mainstream capital inflows create a strong foundation for it to be realized long-term. PepeNode: The New Way to Earn This Cycle? Pepe took over the meme world last cycle, turning a viral frog into one of crypto’s biggest cultural moments. Now, feeding off that same energy, a new offshoot, PepeNode ($PEPENODE) , is adding something the original never had: real passive income. Other meme coins have tried before; Shiba Inu brought staking, but PepeNode goes a step further with a fresh mine-to-earn model. Mining without any hardware needed. Just log in, acquire virtual nodes, assemble rigs, and start generating rewards across proven meme coins. The stats look solid too. The presale has already exceeded $1.7 million , while early stakers are still earning up to 740% APY before the next phase begins. With the added fuel of 70% burns on all $PEPENODE spent on nodes and rigs, deflation supports long-term token value. And the timing couldn’t be better. The macro narrative is driving capital back into risk assets like meme coins, making PepeNode’s rewards model even stronger as momentum builds across the sector.

However, several market and structural factors suggest that this milestone remains far from reach. Despite community efforts and ecosystem growth, the project’s fundamentals and market position create significant barriers. Without major shifts in supply, utility, and institutional backing, the goal of $0.001 may remain unattainable. Enormous Token Supply and Weak Institutional Adoption The most significant hurdle to Shiba Inu is the enormous amount of tokens of the coin.Despite burning over 41% of the original supply, largely through Vitalik Buterin's significant 2021 burn, approximately 589 trillion tokens remain in circulation. It may take decades or even centuries to bring the supply down to the level that would sustain $0.001 at the present levels. Every price rally requires massive capital inflow, and it is hard to maintain the momentum. Another issue is institutional adoption. Unlike Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Solana , which have attracted significant institutional investment, Shiba Inu's market remains dominated by retail participants. Valour Inc., a Swedish ETP issuer, launched a SHIB-focused exchange-traded product on Sweden's Spotlight Stock Market.The exposure is low and has not been able to lure high institutional capital or enhance credibility among the traditional investors. Leadership Concerns and Limited Ecosystem Utility Transparency and leadership issues have also raised red flags within the Shiba Inu community. Shiba Inu's anonymous leadership structure continues to deter serious institutional capital from entering the ecosystem.The project operates under pseudonymous leadership, with Shytoshi Kusama at the helm. While anonymity initially aligned with crypto's ethos, it now poses accountability concerns. Prominent blockchain projects like Ethereum and Cardano benefit from visible, accountable leaders, something Shiba Inu still lacks. Although it has introduced Shibarium, ShibaSwap, and the Shib Metaverse, experts say these projects have not generated meaningful utility or adoption beyond speculative trading. The development team's attention appears divided across multiple projects. Kusama's previous endorsement of SHY, a separate meme token, redirected community focus and liquidity away from the core SHIB ecosystem. Such actions dilute investor confidence and fragment the community's resources. Internal tensions within the leadership team have surfaced publicly. Developer Kaal Dhairya acknowledged this discord, noting that ”some so-called leaders who benefited from Shiba Inu have walked away.” Team conflicts typically result in delayed development milestones and reduced community trust. The combination of excessive token supply, absent institutional support, anonymous leadership, limited utility, and internal conflicts creates a formidable barrier to the $0.001 target. Each factor independently presents significant challenges.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|BUSINESS|TRADING|ETH,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-13 23:29:57

These coins have all posted bullish gains in the past 24 hours, and their technicals and fundamentals suggest that more rallies will be coming soon. And as the market recovers and enters an increasingly buoyant phase, we take a look at an up-and-coming token that could potentially outperform once it launches in the next few weeks. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Overselling Clears Way for ETF-Driven Push to New ATH XRP has rebounded by 10% in the past 24 hours, although its current price of $2.63 represents an 11% drop in a week and a 15% decline in a month. On the other hand, XRP retains a very solid 392% increase in the past year, with the coin’s fundamentals remaining as bullish as they were prior to last week’s liquidation-fuelled selloff. The most positive thing XRP has on its horizon is the incoming launch of numerous XRP ETFs, which will drive significant institutional investment in the altcoin. And with Ripple continuing to expand its cross-border payment and stablecoin business, demand for XRP is only going to increase in the medium- and long-term. Source: TradingView Its chart today suggests that the coin could bounce back strongly from the weekend’s dip, with its indicators beginning to rise from heavily oversold positions. For example, its relative strength index (yellow) has now risen above 40 after slipping below 30 a couple of days ago, while its MACD (orange, blue) has bottomed out. From here, we may see the XRP price rise consistently, driven by ETF launches and ongoing Ripple growth. It could hit $3 by the end of October, before breaking its current ATH of $3.65 by the end of November. Crypto Price Prediction: Cardano ($ADA) – L1 Development and Canary ETF to Boost ADA by 2026 At $0.7216, ADA has risen by 12% in the past 24 hours, although it remains down by 15% in the past week and by 22% in the last 30 days. These may be disappointing declines, but as with XRP, this overselling has created the conditions for a big rally in the near future. ADA is also looking forward to the launch of a multi-asset ETF, offered by Canary, and once it goes live, it could result in a big boost. There’s also the fact that Cardano is one of the most well-established and reputable layer-one networks in crypto, with its platform undergoing regular development and updating . While it remains relatively small compared to the biggest L1s (e.g., Ethereum and Solana), its steady development will boost its utility and adoption over time, boosting the ADA price in turn. Source: TradingView And today, ADA’s chart also reveals a coin that is beginning to bounce back after some very heavy selling. Based on how oversold it has been recently, we could see the ADA price return to $1 by the end of the month, while making it back above $3 by the end of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) – Meme Token to Surge on the Back of NFT Sales and ETF PENGU has posted a substantial 16% gain today, but at $0.02551, it remains down by 18% in a week and by 30% in a month. Although it has faced challenges over the past couple of months, PENGU’s prospects appear very promising. For one, Canary has filed to launch an ETF that would invest in PENGU and also in Pudgy Penguins NFTs. This would provide a massive boost to PENGU, especially when so few meme tokens (with the exception of Dogecoin) are likely to have their own ETFs anytime soon. PENGU also benefits from the ongoing popularity of the Pudgy Penguins NFT series, which boasts total sales worth $714.6 million , as well as a current daily volume of $5 million. Its chart today suggests that it too could be breaking out soon, given how much the market has been overselling it. Source: TradingView If it could decisively break through the $0.030 resistance level, then it we could witness a surge towards former highs. It may reach $0.040 by the middle of November, while entering 2026 above the $0.10 level. PEPENODE Raises $1.8 Million as Anticipation Builds for Mine-to-Earn Token With the market rebounding strongly from the weekend’s selloff, now may be an ideal time to invest in newer tokens, which could post outsized gains once the end-of-year rally gets into full swing. One new token that looks particularly good in this respect is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), which is an Ethereum-based mine-to-earn token that has begun generating lots of hype. So close… but so far. Time to upgrade those nodes to get some more https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/dlsXwoKUoE — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) October 11, 2025 Launching later in the year, PEPENODE will enable its users to build their own virtual mining rigs. They can use these rigs to earn rewards in other meme tokens (such as Pepe and Fartcoin), while they can increase their rewards by spending PEPENODE to acquire more nodes. This mechanic could create strong demand for PEPENODE, and judging by the amount it has raised in its presale—over $1.8 million—investors already appear interested. This is also helped by the fact that you can stake PEPENODE for staking yields, which are currently just above 700% APY. Investors can join its presale at the official PEPENODE website, where it currently costs $0.0011005, although this price will continue to rise until the sale ends.

The consumers are alleging that the deal violates anti-trust laws, and has led to Microsoft artificially inflating prices of its generative AI services. The proposed class action was filed in a San Francisco federal court and claims that Microsoft used a secret, exclusive cloud computing deal with OpenAI to illegally limit the supply of computational power essential to run OpenAI’s popular platforms, ChatGPT included. The lawsuit further argues that this alleged restriction on the market has hurt millions of users by driving subscription prices up while diminishing product quality. The consumers accuse Microsoft of market manipulation Microsoft has invested more than $13 billion in OpenAI to date. The tech giant first announced a $1 billion partnership in 2019, in a deal that established its Azure as the key cloud computing service for the ChatGPT maker. This initiative, the plaintiffs are positive, was used to corner the emerging generative AI market. According to the court papers, the agreement allowed Microsoft to take advantage of OpenAI’s ground breaking success for its own benefit, at the same time while it developed competing products like Microsoft Copilot. It further alludes to a price war among AI services experienced earlier this year, emphasizing that ChatGPT prices remained “substantially higher” than its competitors, allegedly because of Microsoft’s market manipulation, according to the plaintiffs. According to a Reuters article , while the lawsuit admits that some of the tightest restrictions have recently eased with OpenAI reportedly beginning to buy compute power from Google in June this year, it however warns that the threat remains in place. The plaintiffs describe the arrangement as “a sword of Damocles over OpenAI wielded by one of its principal competitors,” suggesting that Microsoft may re-impose the restrictions any time. Now, the consumers are seeking unspecified damages for alleged overcharges dating back to the public launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. Additionally, they are requesting a court order to permanently stop Microsoft from enforcing the allegedly anti-competitive limits on OpenAI. Microsoft has been under some regulatory scrutiny for some time. The tech giant recently narrowly escaped the risk of a multibillion-euro fine after agreeing on a deal with EU to loosen the grip of its workplace chat service, Teams, on the professional software market. This followed over a year of antitrust bickering which was triggered by complaints from rival platforms, which later led to the EU accepting commitments regarded as binding from the Microsoft. The commitments were in relation to Microsoft being required to sell versions of its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites without Teams, as the Cryptopolitan previously reported. As for the latest case, both Microsoft and OpenAI had no immediate comment on the lawsuit, neither did attorneys at Bathaee Dunne for the 11 consumers who filed the lawsuit had a comment immediately. OpenAI, which was founded as a nonprofit in 2015 but has since restructured into a for-profit entity, is not named as a defendant in the case.

Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Pushes Higher Again – Has It Finally Found Its Short-Term Bottom? While MNT remains below its $2.84–$2.86 all-time high, the strong recovery suggests bulls are regaining control, potentially setting the stage for another push toward the upper range if momentum holds. Spot activity exploded, with daily trading volume up more than 60% to about $1.2 billion, while futures open interest climbed 9% to $269.7 million, a signal that speculative demand is accelerating alongside spot buying. MNT's price bounces back following major losses on the daily chart. Source: MNTUSD on Tradingview Fundamental Tailwinds: RWAs, Stablecoin Liquidity, and Exchange Distribution Beyond the chart, Mantle’s rally is grounded in clear catalysts. The network’s Tokenization-as-a-Service (TaaS)stack is pulling real-world asset issuers on-chain, while the launch of USD1, a new stablecoin building on Mantle, is injecting fresh liquidity and utility into its DeFi rails. Distribution is another edge: Mantle’s deepening Bybit integration (treasury programs, listings, and roadmap alignment) is funneling sustained order flow, not just one-off hype. Analysts also highlight Mantle’s modular design (execution on Mantle with EigenDA for data availability and OP-stack upgrades) that lowers costs and improves throughput, important for tokenization, trading, and payments use cases. Can Mantle (MNT) Bulls Clear $3? The Levels and Scenarios Momentum favors further upside as a decisive close above $2.87 could open the door to $3.00, with extended targets near $3.60 if volume and open interest continue to rise. On the downside, $2.50–$2.55 is initial intraday support, followed by the must-hold $1.90–$2.00 zone; losing that would risk a deeper retrace toward $1.60–$1.75 where buyers last reloaded. For now, breadth (spot + derivatives), rising participation, and a tight, orderly trend argue for trend continuation rather than a blow-off top.

This is important, as it coincides with a time when the crypto market is starting to recover from a massive correction over the weekend. XRP To Rebound From Major Support According to Rietveld, XRP’s price is approaching an important support zone around $2.785, which could serve as the foundation for a strong bullish reversal. He noted that XRP is likely near its local bottom and that a rebound from this level would be normal, where cryptocurrencies surged shortly after major corrections. The analyst noted that traditional equity markets, especially in the United States, are hitting new all-time highs, even as the broader crypto market is consolidating. This divergence has occurred multiple times before, but liquidity eventually rotates from the stock market into digital assets and causes explosive upward movements. Rietveld pointed out that a similar pattern was observed in early March, April, and May, when stocks peaked just before Bitcoin and altcoins went on a major rally. Institutional And Sovereign Interest Building In Crypto Rietveld’s analysis also highlighted increasing institutional appetite for cryptocurrencies, which he believes will be a major catalyst for the next market expansion. He cited data showing that over 60% of institutional investors plan to increase their exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies beyond what they already have. This trend, he said, is a very good sign. Rietveld also mentioned that aside from private institutions, several sovereign wealth funds, including those in Luxembourg, Denmark, and the United States, are preparing to allocate portions of their portfolios to Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Particularly, he referenced news about Luxembourg, which r ecently confirmed that it is assigning 1% of its sovereign wealth fund to Spot Bitcoin ETFs. The analyst described this as the early stage of a broader capital migration worth trillions of dollars from traditional markets into cryptocurrencies. Rietveld’s comments extended beyond technicals and market inflow trends. The analyst offered a strong critique of the global financial system by accusing central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve, of mismanagement and corruption through unchecked money printing and debt accumulation. In his view, the fiat currency system is unsustainable, and cryptocurrencies like XRP are the best option for financial independence. He encouraged investors not to succumb to fear or market uncertainty, noting that the periods of widespread panic, like the current one, are the best buying opportunities. Those who are patient and are accumulating at these low prices are the ones positioning themselves to benefit the most when the next strong crypto rally rolls in.",XRP|altcoins|bitcoin|Levi Rietveld|ripple|Spot Bitcoin ETFs|US Federal Reserve|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|BTC|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-14 00:00:34

Concerns about the government’s forthcoming budget were behind the slowdown, new figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) show. Overall, total retail sales increased 2.3% in September over the same month last year — after climbing by 3.1% in August and 2.5% in July. Sales at stores open for at least a year, excluding newly opened ones, also declined to 2% from 2.9%. Retailers say a mix of inflation, tax uncertainty, and unpredictable weather has put the brakes on spending. One-quarter of consumers are holding out as Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves gets set to unveil her first full budget in November, research shows. The new administration is attempting to strike a balance between promoting growth and fulfilling green investment promises, while also carrying an increasingly heavy public debt load. The uncertainty is clearly having an impact on household activity, according to Helen Dickinson, Chief Executive of the BRC. Sales at food retailers rose modestly, driven more by inflation than volume. Shoppers were increasingly trading down to cheaper brands or buying in smaller quantities, KPMG’s retail tracker said. Non-food sales, including clothing and household goods, dropped steeply — roughly 0.7% in September compared with 1.8% the previous month. Unseasonably warm weather also impacted demand for cold-weather items, such as coats and boots. Retailers had hoped to see earlier gains from autumn collections, but consumers continue to wait until it’s more seasonally appropriate before sprucing up their wardrobes. Shops prepare for tough ‘golden quarter’ Now retailers are entering into what is called the “golden quarter” — the all-important last three months of the year when profits are driven by Christmas shopping . But the outlook is mixed. John Lewis Partnership Plc has unveiled its largest-ever seasonal recruitment drive, taking on 13,700 temporary workers at its department stores, warehouses, and Waitrose supermarkets. The company is well-positioned to meet its full-year profit targets, Chairman Jason Tarry said, even after reporting a loss in the first half. Likewise, the UK’s second-biggest grocer, J Sainsbury Plc, which owns Argos, is to recruit 19,000 temporary workers to cope with the holiday season rush. The supermarket giant anticipates an explosion in online orders and in-store visits this November and December, but cautions that shoppers are likely to remain picky. Linda Ellett, UK Head of Consumer, Retail and Leisure at KPMG, said spending remained highly targeted as shoppers remained cautious. She noted that retailers were relying on promotions and carefully planned product ranges to attract customers and boost sales in the lead-up to the Christmas season. Technology sales offered one bright spot, with a lift from the introduction of Apple’s new iPhone and Apple Watch models in mid-September. But other discretionary categories, such as home decor and apparel, were order of magnitude slower. Meanwhile, shop price inflation increased to 1.4% in September, up from 0.9% in August – its highest since February, according to BRC data. Higher import costs and energy prices continue to squeeze margins. Tax concerns contribute to pressure on retailers. Retailers are also dealing with potential tax ripple effects in Reeves’ November budget, beyond the impact on consumer spending. The government is considering changes to business rates — the property tax paid by shops — that could disproportionately hit large stores. The BRC has cautioned that introducing a new tax band for big retailers could lead to store closures and job losses, particularly among department store chains already struggling with high costs. Small businesses are especially vulnerable. Some warn that a further rise in business rates would push them into closure. The Federation of Small Businesses has called for the Treasury to freeze or cut the levy next fiscal year in an effort to help stop further decline on Britain’s high streets. Retail analysts say the current slowdown illustrates a precarious balancing act for policymakers. Tax increases could threaten to erode the already fragile consumer confidence, but postponing fiscal reforms may exacerbate Britain’s budget shortfall. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The incident has also sparked debate about the unique features that separate decentralized finance (DeFi) from traditional finance (TradFi), and whether DeFi can truly remain permissionless when its front-end gateways comply with sanctions regimes designed for TradFi. Uniswap faces backlash over blanket restrictions The issue was made public on X by Artem Chystiakov, a Ukrainian DeFi builder known as Arvolear, who posted an open appeal to Uniswap Labs after finding that the platform’s front end was unavailable for Ukrainian IP addresses. He said the reason Uniswap has been giving so far is that “Ukraine is present on the OFAC sanctions list provided on the U.S. Department of the Treasury website.” However, Chystiakov pointed out that Uniswap has misinterpreted the information, adding, “It is clearly stated that no goods, services, or technology must be provided to both the so-called DNR/LNR and the Crimea regions of Ukraine. Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities/regions are not mentioned whatsoever.” Chystiakov said he had first raised the issue with Uniswap support under ticket number “169045,” but nothing has been done on the matter, so he went public with an open letter calling for the company to lift the ban on Ukraine. The restrictions appear to stem from Uniswap Labs’ sanctions compliance tools, which use IP-based geolocation to prevent users in certain regions from accessing the front end. The issue has also made its way to Change.org where a petition titled “Restore Uniswap Access for Ukrainian Citizens,” was filed. So far, the signatories have been relatively few but has since gathered support from across the DeFi community. Compliance clashes with crypto’s open access ethos Uniswap’s Terms of Service explicitly prohibit use from jurisdictions under U.S. economic or trade sanctions. According to the policy published on its support site , users may not access the interface if they are located in or affiliated with such regions. This language mirrors obligations set by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which maintains sanctions lists covering entities in Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk, but not the rest of Ukraine. Critics say that Uniswap Labs, which develops and hosts the popular user interface for the Uniswap protocol , has overreached in its compliance efforts. The future of access and accountability in DeFi Chystiakov insists that the problem is not about a lack of alternatives; Ukrainian users can still access the protocol directly via blockchain explorers, third-party interfaces, or VPNs, but about principle. He wrote on X that “It’s more than just UI availability, rather true crypto values they fail to follow.” According to Chystiakov , “It’s as simple as ‘the face of defi’ project failing to hold its promise of global accessibility and censorship resistance. Absolutely pathetic and coward behavior… How can we claim to change the financial world when we can’t even dare to change ourselves? DeFi idea is cracking right here.” The Ukrainian DeFi community is now urging Uniswap Labs to implement more targeted compliance measures, blocking only the sanctioned regions and individuals rather than the entire country. As of the time of writing, neither Uniswap nor its founder, Hayden Adams, have publicly sent a response to Chystiakov post on X. However, the company has previously defended its use of compliance tools. Still, the incident has revived a fundamental question for the DeFI movement, which is, can a protocol truly be “open and permissionless” if its main access point is subject to unilateral corporate or political control?

Industry leaders like Solana (SOL) are continuing to dazzle, delivering lightning-fast settlements and a burgeoning ecosystem that entices both retail and institutional investors However, as altcoins compete for headlines, there emerges a new contender, building momentum stealthily and turning heads among investors that seek the unconventional. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) finds itself, right now, in Phase 6 of its presale, having sold out in excess of 65% already, signaling a wave of confidence in a project designed to deliver exponential growth. Mutuum Finance blurs together strategic innovations and a roadmap that makes it a serious contender to become a leader among tomorrow’s best altcoins to deliver come 2025. With the momentum behind the presale picking pace and a solid footing being established, Mutuum Finance has a strong likelihood to re-establish the definition of a next 100x cryptocurrency. Solana Price Analysis Sol (SOL) currently faces a vital 4-hour support level of $190.8, retaining just above essential lows following a recent rout. Momentum indicators continue to point towards the downside, implying further losses until a clear positive reversal sign, i.e., a pin bar or engulfing candle that has the potential to haul SOL towards $209.2 in the near term, appears. Erosion of support for $190.8 could bring lower levels of $180.7 and even $168.2 into play, retaining the near-term perspective bearish until SOL can convincingly retake and maintain levels higher than $209.2. While market players focus on these key movements, the markets’ quest for strong, high-potential altcoins beyond the established names is gaining momentum, an area seeing fledging project Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gain a lot of attention. Mutuum Finance Takes Off During Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) remains in good stride, its sixth presale now 65% full. Investor appetite remains extremely strong, with over 16,910 investors putting over $17.25 million worth into the project so far. Those are all-time records for MUTM and reflect the unstopping global confidence globally into the platform’s DeFi long-term prospect and potential ecosystem. Follow-up to its quest to scale its decentralized ecosystem, Mutuum Finance’s latest news is that it will release its lending and borrowing protocol . Version 1 (V1) of the Platform will launch on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 of 2025. The initial launch will contain major features including liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and the liquidator bot that will serve as a building block to a healthy, efficient, and scalable DeFi architecture. The protocol has also instituted an in-real-time system of risk and liquidity management that are integrated beneath the same to be able to function and stay stable in the event of distress. The protocol also liquidates automatically illiquid or under-collaterallised positions, as well as capping levels of exposure to risk to avoid contagion from happening between pools of assets. ETH and stablecoins are anchor collateral coins that give stabilizing base support to higher-risk coins. Adaptive reserve factor allocation across classes of assets optimizes ultimate risk versus reward optimization through enhanced general system coverage for the reserves. In addition, the Mutuum Finance protocol also hedges the volatility in real-time together with the liquidity and adjusts dynamically to suit changing market conditions. It dynamically offsets Exposure management and short-selling pressures to avert forced liquidation so that even the most extreme market corrections have healthfully balanced the collateralization. Systemic risk in Real-Time DeFi, thus, is contained and the DeFi platform stable, strong, and consistent in spite of volatile market conditions. Top Altcoin to Invest in 2025 As Solana (SOL) crosses key supports around $190.8, altcoin investors seeking high-potential altcoins are focusing on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Its Phase 6 presale has already raised more than $17.25 million from more than 16,910 investors, and 65% of tokens sold already suggest good market confidence. Its upcoming Sepolia Testnet lending and borrowing protocol, consisting of liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot, along with real-time risk and liquidity management, makes MUTM a scalable, secure, and efficient DeFi ecosystem. Pre-emptive investors seeking to capitalize on the next 100x crypto gain must invest in MUTM tokens now before the presale advances.

The drop came amid what analysts describe as the largest liquidation event in crypto market history, wiping out billions in leveraged positions across major exchanges. While bulls briefly lost control during the panic, ETH has since begun to stabilize, with renewed buying interest emerging near key demand zones. Related Reading: Bitmine Receives 23,823 Ethereum From BitGo As Institutional Accumulation Continues Onchain analyst Maartunn highlighted that leverage is once again building up on Ethereum, signaling that traders are returning to the market following the reset. According to his data, open interest on ETH surged significantly over the past 24 hours — a sign that speculative activity is resuming as volatility cools. This renewed leverage could set the stage for another decisive move, either fueling a short-term relief rally or inviting further liquidations if momentum fades. The coming days will be crucial for Ethereum, as bulls attempt to reclaim the $4,000 level to confirm a sustainable recovery. Market sentiment remains cautious but optimistic, with onchain data showing large holders and institutions continuing to accumulate ETH despite recent turbulence — a potential signal of long-term confidence in the asset’s resilience. Leverage Returns to Ethereum: A Risky Revival In Market Activity According to Maartunn, Ethereum’s Open Interest has surged by +8.2% within the past 24 hours — a clear sign that leverage is flowing back into the market. This rapid rise comes just days after the largest liquidation event in crypto history, where overleveraged traders were wiped out during the sudden crash. Now, it seems many are trying to “trade their money back,” reigniting short-term volatility and speculation across exchanges. Maartunn notes that while these so-called “revenge pumps” often create strong intraday rallies, they rarely sustain long-term momentum. Historically, around 75% of similar leverage-driven recoveries tend to revert, leading to renewed pullbacks once liquidity and funding rates normalize. Only about 25% manage to extend into lasting uptrends, typically when supported by fresh spot buying or renewed institutional inflows. This data underscores the precarious balance Ethereum currently faces. The jump in Open Interest signals revived market participation, but also introduces the risk of another wave of forced liquidations if traders overextend their positions. For now, ETH’s short-term recovery remains largely fueled by derivatives activity rather than spot demand. The next few days will be pivotal in determining Ethereum’s direction. If price holds above the $4,000 region with sustained volume, it could confirm that bulls are regaining control. However, a sudden drop in Open Interest or sharp funding spikes could signal that the rally is overextended — setting the stage for another correction.

The daily chart shows that ETH quickly rebounded from the 200-day moving average (red line), confirming it as a major area of demand. Price is now consolidating near $4,150, attempting to build momentum after a strong bullish candle on high volume — a potential sign that buyers are regaining control. However, ETH faces immediate resistance near the $4,250–$4,300 zone, which coincides with the 50-day moving average (blue line). This area previously acted as strong support, and reclaiming it would be essential for confirming a shift back into bullish structure. The 100-day moving average (green line) is now flattening, reflecting the market’s cautious sentiment following the massive liquidation event. Related Reading: Solana Network Activity Drops 50%: Is The Rally Built On Weak Fundamentals? If bulls manage to sustain price action above $4,000, the next targets lie near $4,500 and eventually $4,750. Conversely, failure to hold the 200-day MA could open the door to a deeper retest of $3,600 or lower. For now, Ethereum’s recovery remains technically constructive, but it must overcome these resistance levels to confirm that the recent rebound is more than just a short-term reaction to oversold conditions.

Total crypto market cap jumped roughly 5%, with over $550 billion flowing back into digital assets after a panic sparked by talk of 100% U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Bitcoin (BTC) reclaimed $115,000 (+3%), Ethereum (ETH) climbed to $4,142 (+8.2%), and XRP traded near $2.54. High-beta majors joined the rebound: BNB surged 14% and Solana (SOL) gained 7%. Trade War Fears Ease as China Clarifies Export Rules and Trump Softens Tone The bid returned as China’s Ministry of Commerce clarified its rare-earth export controls are legal but not a ban, with compliant civilian applications to be approved. President Donald Trump also struck a more conciliatory tone, posting that the U.S. wants to “help China, not hurt it,” easing fears of a near-term trade war escalation. The shift follows the largest crypto liquidation on record, over $19–$20 billion in 24 hours, as over-levered longs were flushed in Friday’s cascade. Prediction markets now price sharply lower odds of full tariffs by Nov. 1, aligning with Monday’s broad risk-on bounce. Institutions Buy The Dip As ETF Momentum Steadies From a deeper perspective, the flows stayed constructive. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw only minor daily outflows ($4.5M on Friday) and remain net positive by nearly $6B for October, signaling continuing institutional demand via regulated vehicles. On-chain watchers also flagged Marathon Digital adding 400 BTC ($46M) through FalconX in early Monday trade, consistent with treasuries opportunistically accumulating into weakness. Sentiment gauges improved from “extreme fear,” while social data on Stocktwits flipped bullish for BTC, with some traders eyeing a retest of $140K if macro tailwinds persist. Levels To Watch: Support, Resistance, And Catalysts Technically, BTC’s swift recovery places $114,000–$117,000 as near-term support, with resistance layered around $121,000–$126,000 (the recent ATH zone). ETH faces supply near $4,200–$4,300, while XRP watchers highlight $2.60–$2.65 as a hurdle to unlock momentum toward $3.00. Macro remains the key swing factor, as any renewed tariff saber-rattling or U.S. data surprises (especially amid a patchy government-statistics calendar) could reignite volatility.

This significant rise has resulted from increased sales of costly electric vehicles and luxury cars. During this month, data released highlighted that American car purchasers spent an average of $50,080 on new vehicles. This spending represents a 3.6% increase from last year. Record EV sales, fueled by the expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit, further pushed prices upward, making new cars less affordable for many consumers. Erin Keating points out the influence of wealthier families on the American car market Erin Keating, an Executive Analyst and Senior Director of Economic and Industry Insights at Kelley Blue Book’s parent company, Cox Automotive, noted that the days of the $20,000 car have disappeared from the market. Based on her argument, the current car market is greatly influenced by wealthier families. According to Keating, many cost-conscious car buyers will wait for vehicle price drops or opt for used cars. This cautious behavior stems from the surge of new car prices, which have increased more than 25% over the last five years. At this time, Americans attracted more attention in the car market, making significant purchases of expensive trucks and SUVs while ignoring affordable options that once appealed to first-time buyers. Following these price hikes , reports from S&P Global research revealed that s everal young buyers have shifted their preferences to used vehicles or are maintaining their older ones longer, as the average age of cars on the road has exceeded twelve years. Additionally, individuals buying new vehicles secure seven-year or longer loan term extensions. Meanwhile, according to reports from researcher Edmunds.com, the average car payment per month escalated to $754 in the third quarter. One in five individuals purchasing a new automobile is spending a monthly budget of more than $1,000 on car loans. Concerning the federal tax credit, many consumers had rushed to make EV purchases to be eligible for the credit, resulting in price hikes. Moreover, this escalation in sales led battery-powered vehicles to account for a record 12% of the US car market. Kelley Blue Book reported that electric models recorded an average selling price of $58,124 in September. Luxury vehicles, on the other hand, also recorded impressive sales in September. To illustrate this, over 60 models worth average prices exceeding $75,000 made up 7.4% of all new car sales that month. This reflected a surge from 6% the previous year. Trump’s extensive tariff policies raise tension in the car market The full effects of President Donald Trump’s tariffs on inflation have not been fully realized, as automakers absorb much of the added costs. Regarding this situation, analysts raised concerns that carmakers would eventually have to pass these costs on to consumers to sustain their profits. “Tariffs have established new cost pressures for the car industry,” Keating said, pointing out a powerful combination of EVs and high-end automobiles as the main influencers of the pricing trends in September. In the meantime, Ford Motor Co. anticipated that its profits would drastically decline this year amid the escalating effects of Trump’s tariffs. This highlights the considerable changes in Washington policies interfering with the car industry. Apart from Ford, the automaker, based in Dearborn, Michigan, forecasted that its adjusted earnings before interest and taxes would decline by as much as 36% this year . This reduction is mainly due to the net tariff effect of $2 billion, which equals roughly $500 million more than Ford had estimated earlier. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The company said it purchased Ether more aggressively during the recent market volatility, bringing its total holdings to over 3 million ETH, representing roughly 2.5% of the cryptocurrency’s total supply. BitMine’s average purchase price for the recent acquisitions was $4,154 per token. Between Friday and Monday, the firm acquired 202,037 ETH, valued at approximately $827 million, according to a statement on X. This increase pushed BitMine’s overall crypto portfolio to $13.4 billion, which includes $12.9 billion in cryptocurrency and “moonshot” investments, 192 Bitcoin, $104 million in cash, and a $135 million stake in Nasdaq-listed Eightco Holdings. The purchases came amid a sharp market correction on Friday, which triggered around $19 billion in liquidations over the weekend. Tom Lee, chairman of BitMine and head of research at Fundstrat, said the market downturn created an opportunity to buy Ethereum at discounted prices. “The crypto liquidation over the past few days created a price decline in ETH, which BitMine took advantage of,” Lee said. He added that the company is now “more than halfway towards our initial pursuit of the ‘alchemy of 5%’ of ETH.” Lee also highlighted the broader investment logic, stating, “Volatility creates deleveraging, and this can cause assets to trade at substantial discounts to fundamentals, or as we say, ‘substantial discount to the future,’ and this creates advantages for investors, at the expense of traders.” BitMine’s approach may influence other institutional investors to adopt similar long-term accumulation strategies. Interest in the company extends beyond crypto investors, as its stock, BMNR, was recently the 22nd most widely traded on U.S. markets, averaging over $3.5 billion in five-day trading volume as of Friday. Despite this, BMNR’s stock price fell 11% over the past five days, following a short position by Kerrisdale Capital, which criticized BitMine’s business model as “on its way to extinction.” The company’s dual focus on cryptocurrency and traditional equities reflects a broader trend of institutional participation in digital assets.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-10-14 01:06:54

The world’s biggest memory chipmaker and South Korea’s most valuable company is riding the artificial intelligence wave that has reshaped the global semiconductor market. Samsung’s operating profit in the July-September quarter jumped to 12.1 trillion won ($8.5 billion), surpassing analysts’ forecasts of about 9.7 trillion won, according to preliminary results released on Tuesday. Revenue increased to 86 trillion won, a steep gain from the previous year’s 67.4 trillion won. AI surge drives record chip profits The performances represented Samsung’s best since early 2022, and suggested that its chip division was rebounding strongly from a two-year industry downturn. Now, the recovery in memory chip pricing and global AI development is causing profits to leap. Average DRAM prices increased by roughly 172% year-over-year in the third quarter, and NAND flash memory also posted double-digit growth, according to TrendForce. These chips are crucial for the AI servers that underpin large language models, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, as well as data centers operated by tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. Samsung has been scrambling to narrow the gap behind its smaller competitor, SK Hynix, which currently dominates the market for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in AI accelerators. Most of Nvidia’s HBM3E chips, which are crucial for training and running AI models, are provided by SK Hynix. But Samsung is quickly gaining ground. It recently received certification from Nvidia for its 12-layer HBM3E chips and secured an order from AMD, enabling it to tap into the fast-growing AI server market. The certification will enable Samsung to initiate mass shipments within the next few months, positioning it to compete head-to-head with SK Hynix and Micron, according to people familiar with the industry. Investors bet big on Samsung’s future in AI. The strong quarter has helped lift investor confidence that Samsung is on track to regain leadership in the semiconductor industry. Its shares have surged more than 60% since the beginning of June, driven by hopes for AI demand and a recovery in memory prices. Both Samsung and SK Hynix recently signed deals to provide chips for OpenAI’s “Stargate” project, an ambitious initiative to construct one of the world’s largest AI data centers. Stargate’s estimated demand could potentially consume 40% of global DRAM production, underscoring the significant demand for processing power from AI. Park Jae-kyung, an analyst at Daishin Securities, said Samsung’s profit surge marked a watershed moment, noting that the company was not only recovering but also re-emerging at the forefront of the AI revolution. In memory as well as beyond, Samsung’s display and mobile divisions performed well. But premium smartphone panel earnings benefited from robust sales of foldable devices and OLED panels. The company’s Galaxy Z Fold6 and Flip6 models had helped prop up the mobile income line, contributing to a less lopsided growth picture among divisions. Analysts predict that Samsung’s semiconductor profit will surge through 2025, driven by faster-than-anticipated global demand for AI servers. The company informed investors on its most recent earnings call in July that it anticipated strong growth in high-end memory products for servers in the second half of the year. Still, risks remain. Samsung faces challenges related to geopolitical tensions, export controls, and supply chain disruptions — especially after the United States recently tightened restrictions on exporting chip technology to China. The company has also been under pressure to improve its profitability in the foundry business, where it trails its Taiwanese rival, TSMC. Analysts from Morgan Stanley, Citi, and Goldman Sachs have all updated their Samsung share price forecasts in the past week to reflect high, continued memory prices and better chip yields. According to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Masahiro Wakasugi, Samsung has returned to the game, describing the nexus of AI-driven demand, squeezed supply, and improved technology across its products — as well as high interest rates — as having created a “double whammy” for profitability.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. China Renaissance’s reported plan to raise $600 million for a BNB-focused investment vehicle , with Binance founder Changpeng Zhao's YZi Labs investing alongside, may look like a straightforward bet on Binance’s ecosystem. But Singapore-based market maker Enflux argues it’s something deeper: a signal that Asian institutions are building a different kind of crypto exposure than their Western counterparts. “Regional capital allocators are seeking exposure to infrastructure tokens that drive transaction flow, not just store-of-value assets,” Enflux said in a note to CoinDesk, framing the China Renaissance move as part of a broader divergence between East and West. BNB is a great example of this. Binance, of course, isn't a listed company, but BNB serves as something very close to a stock. Its value is a proxy for market sentiment and confidence in Binance. While U.S. and European markets have leaned into tokenized Treasuries, funds, and real-world assets, Asia’s capital markets are increasingly constructing crypto-native liquidity networks centered around exchange, staking, and transaction infrastructure. ""This ties into the broader shift where Asian capital markets are building out their own layer of crypto-native liquidity networks while Western markets tokenized TradFi,"" Enflux continued. The logic is straightforward. Value should be accrued by activity, not scarcity. Tron's move to create a publicly listed company to give investors listed exposure to activity on the TRX network – which is heavily used to send USDT around Latin America – follows the same train of thought. If Enflux’s thesis is right, the China Renaissance fund could be an early blueprint for Asia’s next wave of institutional products: permanent capital vehicles that hold the pipes of the crypto economy, not just its gold. Market Movement: BTC: BTC is trading above $114,500, relatively flat as the market stabilizes after last weekend's volatility. ETH: ETH rose 1.5% to $4,230 as network activity picked up, even as U.S.-listed Ethereum ETFs saw $118 million in outflows. Gold: Gold surged 2% to a record $4,103 an ounce as renewed U.S.-China trade tensions and expectations of further Fed rate cuts drove investors toward safe-haven assets. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed Tuesday as Trump’s conciliatory remarks on China failed to offset renewed trade tensions, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 1.34%.

53109413,604864,1760407211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53109413.jpeg,Bitcoin Market Structure Resets For A Fresh Start: Data Hints At Price Recovery,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-market-structure-resets-for-a-fresh-start/,"Bitcoin has faced one of its most volatile weeks in recent history, plunging to $103,000 on Friday in a dramatic 15% drop that erased billions in market value within hours. The sudden sell-off triggered widespread liquidations across the crypto market, wiping out leveraged positions and sparking panic among traders. However, price action is now showing early signs of recovery, with some analysts suggesting that this sharp correction could pave the way for a stronger, more sustainable uptrend. According to a recent report from CryptoQuant, this event marks one of the most severe market resets ever recorded, with potential ripple effects expected to shape price behavior for months to come. Following Bitcoin’s peak last week, open interest — a measure of futures market activity — dropped sharply by $12 billion, from $47 billion to $35 billion. This represents one of the largest contractions in derivatives positioning seen in recent years. Such massive deleveraging historically precedes a healthier market structure, as excessive speculation is flushed out. While volatility remains elevated, the combination of reduced leverage and renewed inflows from stablecoin reserves could position Bitcoin for a gradual recovery — if demand holds steady and buyers regain confidence in the coming sessions. Market Reset Clears the Path For Bitcoin The CryptoQuant report highlights a notable shift in Bitcoin’s market structure following Friday’s massive correction. Funding rates, which had been declining steadily for months, briefly turned negative during the capitulation event — a clear sign that traders flipped bearish in panic. However, these rates have since normalized to modestly positive levels, indicating that sentiment is stabilizing and short-term speculation is being replaced by more balanced positioning. Another key metric, the Bitcoin Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR), also dropped significantly after reaching levels not seen since 2022. This sharp reduction points to a widespread deleveraging across derivatives markets, as overexposed traders were forced to unwind positions. Such events often act as a “reset” for market health, flushing out excessive leverage and setting the stage for more sustainable growth. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) fell to its lowest point since April. This decline implies that stablecoin liquidity — or the potential buying power sitting on the sidelines — has risen substantially relative to Bitcoin’s market capitalization. Historically, when stablecoin liquidity increases after major sell-offs, it often signals an accumulation phase that precedes recovery. BTC Attempts Recovery After Sharp Correction Bitcoin is showing signs of stabilization after its steep decline to the $103,000 level on Friday. The daily chart reveals that BTC has rebounded sharply, currently hovering around $115,000. This recovery suggests that buyers are stepping in around key demand zones, defending the 200-day moving average — a historically critical level for maintaining long-term bullish momentum. Despite the bounce, Bitcoin remains below the $117,500 resistance, a level that previously acted as strong support. Bulls must reclaim and close above this zone to confirm a continuation toward $120,000 and potentially retest the $125,000 range. Until then, the price remains within a consolidation phase following an extreme liquidation event. The moving averages (50-day and 100-day) show a near-term bearish crossover risk, reflecting the market’s cautious tone. However, the quick rebound from last week’s capitulation indicates strong underlying demand and the potential for a higher low formation — a constructive technical sign. If BTC manages to hold above $112,000 and regain $117,500, momentum could shift back in favor of buyers. Conversely, failure to sustain these levels could expose the market to another retest of lower supports around $108,000.

These Bitcoin Charts Could Be Ones To Watch In a shock to the market, Bitcoin ended last week with a steep crash, falling from above $122,000 to below $110,000. The coin managed to make some recovery on Sunday, and that rebound has held so far into Monday. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Selling: $50 Million Exiting Wallets Every Day However, while BTC appears to be rebuilding its structure, its direction remains unclear, as noted by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in an X thread. Maartunn has shared a few key charts that could determine whether the recovery will hold or fade. First, the analyst has revealed a chart that points out a similarity between the recent Bitcoin price action and the November 2021 bull market top. As displayed in the above graph, BTC broke above its weekly resistance with the recent price rally, but immediately fell below the line after the crash. A similar failed breakout also took place back in November 2021. According to Maartunn, such a trend typically signals exhaustion. On-chain data also suggests the cryptocurrency is currently trapped below a notable resistance level, as the chart for the UPRD shows. The UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) here is an indicator that tells us about the amount of Bitcoin that was last purchased/transferred at the various price levels that the asset has visited in its history. From the metric’s chart, it’s visible that a significant amount of supply has its cost basis between $117,500 to $120,000. The holders of these coins would naturally be underwater right now, so there is a chance that if BTC recovers to their break-even level, they might panic sell, fearing going into losses again. Given the scale of the supply involved, selling pressure of this kind could be notable on a retest of the range, potentially making it a major resistance barrier for the asset. A support level that could be key is the average cost basis or Realized Price of the short-term holders (STHs).

53109577,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=835315,1760407423,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53109577.jpeg,Bhutan migrates national digital ID to Ethereum,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bhutan-migrates-digital-id-to-ethereum/,"The Kingdom of Bhutan is gradually migrating its National Digital Identity (NDI) platform to the Ethereum blockchain, marking a landmark step in the digital transformation agenda for this Himalayan nation. The move makes Bhutan the first country to base its national identity system on a public blockchain, thereby enhancing transparency, trust, and citizen control over their personal information. The migration from NDI to Ethereum is at the core of Bhutan’s vision to create a decentralized, secure, and self-sovereign digital community. This integration will enable the NDI to generate verifiable credentials, sign digital documents, and prove identity natively on Ethereum’s public, distributed network. By building its core identity system on Ethereum, Bhutan aims to reduce its reliance on centralized databases, a common vulnerability to hacking, manipulation, and data leakage. This philosophy for the nation is in sync with India’s “technology with values” philosophy, which encourages integrity and ethics, inclusion, and empowerment through innovation. The launch of Bhutan’s National Digital Identity on Ethereum marks a significant milestone in establishing the country as a leader in the realm of digital government, according to Prime Minister Lyonchen Tshering Tobgay. He said that by utilizing Ethereum’s globally distributed and decentralized infrastructure, they aimed to enhance the security, transparency, and availability of Bhutan’s critical systems. He added that this milestone underscored their vision of creating an interoperable and user-owned identity system, one that connects Bhutan to global ecosystems while upholding His Majesty the King’s vision of a secure, inclusive, and digitally empowered society. Shortly after the 2023 election, Bhutan’s National Digital Identity (NDI) was established, the first and only national system worldwide to offer self-sovereign identity (SSI) at a population-wide scale. His Royal Highness also emerged as the country’s first digital citizen during the launch, highlighting Bhutan’s leadership in people-centered digital innovation. Bhutan gains global recognition through blockchain collaboration Aya Miyaguchi, the president of the Ethereum Foundation , praised Bhutan’s move as a way blockchain could be employed to create open and inclusive systems that work for citizens — and not just institutions. Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, also praised the initiative, stating that decentralized digital identity is a fundamental building block for the future of the internet and that he is pleased to see innovative teams, such as uPort, developing self-sovereign solutions. He added that Bhutan’s adoption of an open architecture built on Ethereum demonstrated the purpose behind creating the platform — to drive meaningful and positive change through open-source technology. From the outset, Bhutan has sought to establish a transparent network that serves its citizens as well as those beyond its borders. Anchoring in a public blockchain enables the Government of Bhutan to allow its citizens to verify their credentials from anywhere in the world, while preserving privacy and control. This differs from many remote identification systems based on opaque, centralized infrastructure controlled by governments or the private sector. The government aims to migrate the entire NDI platform onto Ethereum by early 2026. When it’s fully rolled out, Bhutanese citizens will be able to prove certain things about themselves without disclosing their personal information, as cryptographic proofs are used instead of the usual ID checks. Driving innovation through blockchain Besides its national identity system, the country is studying more extensive uses of blockchain technology in various aspects of governance and social services. In 2025, the nation also hosted a decentralized applications (dApp) hackathon in Paro, with a partnership from the Ethereum Foundation. The event was attended by over 70 developers who worked on creating digital tools based on Bhutan’s identity framework. The projects included verifying land records, implementing transparent citizen feedback systems, and tracking provenance for locally made products. Bhutan’s NiaoDai Interchain has also formed a global partnership with iDen2, a decentralized identity protocol, to jointly develop Phenix—a modular identity solution for use worldwide. The partnership will aim to combine Bhutan’s real-world experience in deploying a national digital identity with the iDen2 open-source technology, enabling other countries and organizations to replicate Bhutan’s success.

Polymarket Bettors Eye November Funding Bill Timeline According to the poll , 84% of participating Polymarket bettors believe that Congress will pass a funding bill by November 30. Meanwhile, just 30% of bettors predict a funding bill will advance through Congress by October 31. Lastly, just 1% of bettors estimate a deal will be done by October 15, particularly given the short timeline. The Polymarket poll’s latest figures come as the U.S. government shutdown nears entering its third week after U.S. lawmakers failed to agree on key spending bills ahead of the October 1 deadline. Thousands of federal employees have already been laid off because of the political dysfunction, with Vice President JD Vance telling Fox News in a recent interview that more jobs will be on the line if Congress does not find a solution. “The longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be,” Vance said. “To be clear, some of these cuts are going to be painful.” During a Cabinet meeting at the White House last Thursday, Trump vowed to cut “only” Democratic programs in response to the shutdown.

On Friday, Bitcoin plunged to $103,000 within minutes, triggering a wave of panic across the market as overleveraged positions were wiped out and Altcoins lost more than 80% of their value in the same period. The sudden correction left investors questioning whether this marked the end of the bull phase or simply a reset before the next leg up. Related Reading: Bitmine Receives 23,823 Ethereum From BitGo As Institutional Accumulation Continues Despite the chaos, key onchain data paints a more optimistic picture. Top analyst Darkfost highlights that the supply of ERC-20 stablecoins continues to grow, especially on Binance, the exchange that remains the undisputed leader in trading volume. This surge in stablecoin reserves suggests that liquidity is quietly rebuilding beneath the surface, as investors prepare for re-entry rather than full-scale retreat. In crypto cycles, rising stablecoin balances often act as a precursor to renewed buying pressure, indicating that capital is sitting on the sidelines, waiting for the right moment to return. As volatility cools down, the stablecoin supply could play a decisive role in shaping the market’s next major move. Liquidity Surges As Binance Hits Record High Reserves Darkfost shared data showing that the ERC-20 stablecoin supply on Binance has seen a massive surge over the past two months, rising by $10 billion since August, from $32 billion to $42 billion. This marks the highest level of ERC-20 stablecoin reserves ever recorded on the exchange, a significant milestone that signals renewed liquidity inflows into the market. This sharp increase in stablecoin reserves suggests two major dynamics at play. First, investors continue to deploy capital into the crypto market through stablecoins, a common precursor to renewed accumulation and trading activity. Second, Binance’s dominance in global trading volume remains unchallenged, with increasing user participation demanding more available liquidity on the platform. While part of this increase may stem from investors rotating capital back into stablecoins after the recent market crash, this explanation alone doesn’t capture the full picture. Binance typically adjusts its reserves in response to active trading behavior, meaning this spike is more likely linked to rising demand and capital readiness than to risk aversion. Despite recent volatility and sharp liquidations, the data show that liquidity is flowing back in, positioning the market for a potential rebound. If this trend continues, stablecoin accumulation on Binance could serve as the foundation for the next major leg up across Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem. Related Reading: From $254M To $78.5B: Tron USDT Growth Drives Network Valuation Stablecoin Dominance Spikes: Capital Rotates After Market Crash The chart shows a sharp rise in stablecoin dominance, which recently spiked above 9% before cooling to around 8.15%. This move reflects a rapid flight to liquidity following last week’s extreme volatility, when Bitcoin plunged below $105K and altcoins saw significant losses. Historically, such spikes in stablecoin dominance indicate that traders are exiting risk assets to hold stablecoins, waiting for market stabilization before redeploying capital. Interestingly, the pullback from 9% to 8% suggests that the panic phase may already be easing. The market appears to be entering a reaccumulation phase, where stable capital is preparing for the next major move. On a technical level, stablecoin dominance remains well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, signaling persistent strength in liquidity reserves. Related Reading: Solana Network Activity Drops 50%: Is The Rally Built On Weak Fundamentals? If dominance continues to consolidate near these highs while Bitcoin stabilizes, it could create the foundation for renewed inflows into risk assets. In other words, money hasn’t left the market—it’s waiting on the sidelines. Stablecoin dominance above 8% generally marks periods of strong capital positioning, often preceding new market uptrends. The current setup, therefore, highlights growing investor caution but also a buildup of dry powder that could soon reenter the market.

As fear grips Bitcoin, analysts are turning to Cardano (ADA) and Ethereum (ETH) as the best crypto to buy now . Bitcoin Price Prediction: Fear Index Sparks Buying Debate The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has crashed to 27 , its lowest level in six months, after President Trump announced a 100% tariff on Chinese imports . The sudden move triggered panic across the crypto market. Bitcoin dropped sharply to $102,000 before bouncing back above $112,000 on Binance’s futures. Over $19 billion in long and short positions were wiped out within 24 hours. Analysts say this marks one of the most volatile trading sessions since April. Despite the chaos, some traders now see opportunity. Bitwise Europe’s research head, Andre Dragosch , said on X that the firm’s sentiment index dropped to its lowest since mid-2024, calling it a contrarian buying signal . In past cycles, similar drops in sentiment preceded rebounds. Bitcoin’s previous fear low in April saw prices rise more than 30% within weeks. Analysts now eye a short-term recovery zone between $110,000 and $120,000 , making BTC one of the best crypto to buy now. Bitcoin Market Snapshot Fear & Greed Index: 27 (Fear) 24h liquidations: $19.27 billion Short-term BTC recovery zone: $110K – $120K Analysts call it a contrarian buying signal Cardano Price Prediction: Whales and Retail Traders Build Together Cardano (ADA) dropped nearly 60% in one day during the tariff-driven selloff but quickly rebounded to around $0.65 . Despite heavy losses, whales and retail traders are quietly adding to their holdings. Data from Santiment shows wallets holding 10M–100M ADA increased by 0.14 billion ADA , equal to about $89.6 million at current prices. This steady build-up during a crash suggests conviction among large holders. The Money Flow Index also shows inflows returning, meaning buyers are gradually stepping in. ADA’s Hydra scaling upgrade continues to drive optimism, capable of processing up to 1 million transactions per second (TPS) in tests. Analysts believe this could attract new dApp developers and help ADA stabilize once the market regains balance Cardano Highlights ADA rebounds to $0.65 after 59% drop Whale wallets added $89.6M ADA Hydra upgrade enables 1M TPS in tests Traders eye recovery toward $1 if sentiment improves Ethereum Price Prediction: Steady Use Supports $10K Target Ethereum remains active despite selling pressure. On-chain data shows over 9.5 million daily contract calls , the highest since mid-2024. The RWA (real-world asset) sector on Ethereum now holds $11.7 billion , up from $1.5 billion a year ago. Institutional activity through spot Ether ETFs and corporate treasury accumulation has helped maintain engagement on the network. Analysts view this as proof of lasting demand. Traders note that ETH could briefly dip under $4,000 , but many expect recovery toward $10,000 once volatility fades. The ETH network’s reliability , with zero downtime since inception, continues to make it the go-to blockchain for stablecoin and RWA projects.

Bitcoin As Non-Asset Class? The firm issued a stark warning to its clients, advising them to steer clear of Bitcoin. HL emphasized that the cryptocurrency holds “no intrinsic value” and should not be included in their life savings or retirement strategies. In a statement, HL acknowledged that while Bitcoin has delivered positive long-term returns, it has also undergone extreme volatility, making it a riskier investment compared to traditional assets like stocks and bonds. The firm asserted that Bitcoin does not qualify as an asset class and lacks the characteristics necessary for inclusion in growth or income portfolios. Furthermore, HL noted that performance assumptions for cryptocurrency are challenging to analyze, reinforcing the view that it lacks intrinsic value . Hargreaves Lansdown is the third major financial institution to issue such a warning recently, joining Deutsche Bank and Elliott Management in expressing skepticism about the value proposition of cryptocurrencies. Just days prior, Deutsche Bank informed its clients that Bitcoin is “backed by nothing,” although it anticipates that the cryptocurrency may eventually be adopted as a reserve asset by central banks. In January, activist investor Elliott Management cautioned its clients about an “inevitable collapse” of Bitcoin, citing its lack of substance as an asset. Crypto Market Rebounds While Hargreaves Lansdown’s assessment of Bitcoin’s volatility and risk is valid, it is important to note that Bitcoin has also proven to be a profitable investment. Following the recent collapse in prices, Bitcoin has shown signs of recovery, priced at around $114,200, reflecting a 83% increase year-to-date (YTD), significantly outpacing the S&P 500 . Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, also climbed on Monday nearly 9% to hover around $4,130. After dipping below the $4 trillion threshold on Friday, the total market capitalization rebounded to reach approximately $3.9 trillion. The price fluctuations followed a disastrous Friday that saw over $19 billion evaporate from traders’ positions, marking the largest one-day liquidation event . Within a span of 24 hours, Bitcoin lost more than $200 billion in market capitalization and dropped nearly 10% in value, while Ethereum suffered an even steeper decline of almost 14%.

ETH is now showing positive signs and might rise further toward the $4,400 level. Ethereum started a recovery wave above the $4,000 and $4,120 levels. The price is trading above $4,120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $4,150 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it trades above $4,320. Ethereum Price Gains Traction Ethereum price started a recovery wave above the $3,850 level, like Bitcoin . ETH price formed a base and was able to recover above the $4,000 level. The price cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the main drop from the $4,758 swing high to the $3,422 low. The bulls were able to push the price above the $4,200 pivot level. Besides, there is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $4,150 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $4,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,250 level. The next key resistance is near the $4,400 level. The first major resistance is near the $4,440 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the main drop from the $4,758 swing high to the $3,422 low. A clear move above the $4,400 resistance might send the price toward the $4,500 resistance. An upside break above the $4,500 region might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,550 resistance zone or even $4,650 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,300 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,150 level and the trend line. The first major support sits near the $4,120 zone. A clear move below the $4,120 support might push the price toward the $4,050 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,950 region in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,880.

Analyst Egrag Crypto has presented a structured comparison, drawing on past events to illustrate where the current movement sits in XRP’s broader historical framework. His latest chart highlights three major declines, coupled with a striking liquidation statistic that distinguishes this downturn from prior episodes. #XRP – Keeping It Simple: Major Drops (Binance Chart): December 2017: #XRP dropped by 99%. SEC Lawsuit (2021): We saw a 77% drop. Recent Drop: Just yesterday, XRP fell by 78% Liquidation Stats COVID Crash: $1.2 billion in liquidations. FTX Crash: $1.6 billion… pic.twitter.com/9unpMSdksJ — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 12, 2025 A Pattern of Major Corrections In his breakdown, Egrag points to three critical instances of deep corrections in XRP’s trading history. The first occurred during late 2017, a period marked by extreme volatility across the crypto market, in which XRP suffered a near-total retracement. The next major decline followed the regulatory challenges that emerged in 2021, when XRP dropped by approximately 77%. The most recent move, recorded just days ago, saw XRP fall by 78%, placing it beside previous substantial declines that preceded key structural shifts in the chart. These comparisons are not presented for dramatic effect but to establish that large-scale drawdowns have been a recurring feature of XRP’s price behavior. Egrag’s focus is on the consistency of these declines and the phases that followed them, rather than on short-term sentiment. Liquidations on an Unprecedented Scale One of the most notable elements in Egrag’s observation is the comparison of liquidation figures across major market shocks. During the COVID crash, liquidations reached around $1.2 billion. The collapse tied to the FTX exchange saw approximately $1.6 billion in liquidated positions. The latest event, however, far exceeded registering an estimated $19.6 billion in total liquidations . This scale is significant because it reflects a market heavily exposed to leveraged positions. The forced unwinding of these positions contributed to the severity of the movement, amplifying selling pressure beyond standard market activity. While past liquidation events were impactful, none approached the level seen in this latest episode, raising broader questions about leverage management across the digital asset space. Technical Implications and Market Sentiment Egrag’s analysis does not attempt to forecast immediate direction but instead underscores a recurring technical theme: historically, extreme corrections have often been followed by extended accumulation phases and, in some cases, substantial upside movements. The emphasis is placed on the aftermath of crashes—how price structures evolve once extreme selling pressure subsides. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Rather than issuing directives, the analyst frames the present moment as one of decision for market participants. Individuals may choose to exit positions to remove uncertainty, or they may hold through volatility with the expectation of long-term structural recovery . The message is clear that each choice carries responsibility, and no external commentary should dictate personal financial decisions. Stability and Perspective Within Volatility While the current decline has understandably raised concern, Egrag’s presentation is rooted in perspective rather than alarm. By placing recent events alongside historical data, he encourages a careful view of XRP’s movement, acknowledging both risk and possibility. The reminder to remain steady is aimed not at dismissing market stress but at emphasizing informed decision-making over reaction. For long-term holders , the analysis serves as a data-driven reference point. For newer participants, it illustrates how extreme volatility formed part of XRP’s market cycle. What follows will depend on broader market conditions, regulatory advancement, and sentiment recovery. However, the historical framework provided offers a structured basis for interpretation rather than speculation.

The week closed quietly with just $159 million in outflows on Friday. With this, 2025’s year-to-date inflows have climbed to $48.7 billion, already exceeding last year’s record total. Digital asset exchange-traded products (ETPs) saw explosive trading last week, as they registered a record $53 billion in weekly volume. This figure is nearly double 2025’s average pace. Friday’s $15.3 billion turnover marked the highest single-day figure ever recorded. Following the tariff-driven market drop, total assets under management declined 7% from the previous week’s peak to $242 billion. Altcoin Flows Stay Resilient Investors poured $2.67 billion into Bitcoin over the past week, which pushed cumulative 2025 inflows to $30.2 billion. Though strong, that figure remains short of 2024’s $41.7 billion benchmark, according to the latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report. Friday’s market sell-off generated record trading volumes of $10.4 billion; however, the actual daily net flow was modest, standing at just $0.39 million. Meanwhile, Ethereum attracted $338 million in inflows last week but faced significant $172 million outflows on Friday, which was the largest among all digital assets. This indicates that investors viewed it as particularly exposed during the correction. Meanwhile, enthusiasm around the upcoming US ETFs for Solana and XRP appears to be waning, as inflows eased to $93.3 million and $61.6 million, respectively. Investment flows into altcoin-based products were modest but steady. For instance, Chainlink pulled in $3.2 million while Sui recorded $2.3 million in inflows. Cardano and Litecoin added smaller amounts, receiving $0.8 million and $0.2 million. Multi-asset products, on the other hand, deviated from the broader positive sentiment, registering significant outflows of more than $35 million for the period. In regional terms, the United States overwhelmingly dominated inflows, drawing more than $3 billion in fresh investments. Switzerland came next with $132 million, followed by Germany at $53.5 million and Australia at $9.9 million. Canada posted smaller inflows of $3.8 million. Meanwhile, Sweden led outflows with $22 million, while Brazil and Hong Kong reported declines of $10.1 million and $9.3 million each. Market Still on Shaky Ground Financial markets were rattled overnight after tensions between the US and China escalated unexpectedly. The sell-off began when President Trump accused China of “holding the world captive” through sweeping export restrictions on rare earth elements. Investors quickly fled risk assets, which pushed the Nasdaq down 3.5% and the S&P 500 down 2.7%. Bitcoin wasn’t spared either, as it briefly collapsed to $102K before recovering to $115K amid a record $19 billion in liquidations. According to QCP Capital, with global liquidity tightening and policy risks soaring, “market positioning remains defensive across risk assets heading into the new week.” The post Bitcoin Dominates Fund Flows With $2.67B Influx, But Still Trails 2024’s Peak appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Bitcoin|Ethereum|Solana|XRP,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|ASIA,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-10-14 03:33:44

These are projects that combine strong fundamentals, transparent presales, and community growth. Among them, BullZilla ($BZIL) stands out with measurable ROI, followed by established players and high-potential newcomers such as Bitcoin Cash (BCH), MoonBull, La Culex, Avalanche (AVAX), SUI, Stellar (XLM), and Chainlink (LINK). Each project offers its own angle of innovation and return potential. From presale transparency to cross-chain expansion, these coins are being closely watched by analysts anticipating the next bull run. 1. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Presale Turning Heads with Massive ROI BullZilla ($BZIL) has quickly gained recognition as one of the most promising new 1000x coins of 2025. Currently in Stage 6 (Going Full Send!), BullZilla is redefining transparency in presales with detailed price stages and verifiable progress metrics. The current price sits at $0.0001524, with over $880,000 raised, 2,900 holders, and 31 billion tokens sold. The project’s structured pricing model ensures steady growth and predictability for early investors. So far, those who joined in earlier stages have seen an ROI of 2550.43%, while the ROI potential from Stage 6C to listing is projected at 3358.93%. At this stage, a $1,000 investment earns approximately 6.56 million $BZIL tokens, valued at $34,000 at the listing price of $0.00527141. The next stage, 6D, will bring a 4.37% price increase, from $0.0001524 to $0.00015907, continuing the presale’s upward momentum. BullZilla’s roadmap includes staking utilities, NFT integration, and cross-chain expansion. Its consistent delivery, strong community engagement, and precise ROI tracking make it a standout among new 1000x coins. The BZIL crypto presale is attracting retail and institutional investors alike who are drawn to verifiable returns and community-driven growth. 2. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Returning to Form with Payment Utility Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has experienced a strong resurgence during this year’s Uptober rally. As one of Bitcoin’s earliest forks, BCH remains focused on fast, low-cost peer-to-peer payments. It recently surpassed $600 for the first time since 2021, driven by renewed adoption among global merchants and payment processors. According to CoinMarketCap, BCH’s transaction activity has increased as investors diversify away from high-fee networks. Its growing relevance in everyday payments and developing economies positions it as a top contender among the new 1000x coins with practical use cases. With increasing global demand for scalable payment options, BCH’s combination of stability and efficiency makes it a strong player for investors seeking value and adoption-driven growth. 3. MoonBull (MOBU): The DeFi-Powered Meme Coin on the Rise MoonBull (MOBU) is currently in its presale phase and is redefining meme coin economics. Built on Ethereum, it merges humor with high-performing DeFi mechanics. Each transaction contributes to liquidity, burns tokens, and rewards holders through reflections. The project’s 23-stage scarcity model ensures that the token’s value rises progressively. It’s staking APY of 95%, instant referral bonuses, and locked liquidity demonstrate a strong focus on sustainability. MoonBull’s smart contract has been verified for security, and its roadmap includes cross-chain staking and an AI-based staking optimizer that dynamically reallocates rewards. MoonBull represents the next generation of meme coins that go beyond hype. With its combination of DeFi integration and high-yield staking, it’s becoming one of the most talked-about new 1000x coins among crypto enthusiasts and DeFi investors. 4. La Culex (CULEX): An Upcoming Presale Built for Longevity La Culex (CULEX) is an upcoming presale project that blends meme energy with long-term tokenomics. With a total supply of 200 billion tokens, the allocation is 45% for presale, 15% for staking rewards, 20% for liquidity locked for 18 months, and 2% for burns. The project features 32 presale stages, each increasing token scarcity and price, aiming for a listing value of $0.007. Investors can earn up to 80% APY staking rewards through the Hive Vault and benefit from a 12% referral system on the Bite Chain. La Culex ensures safety with audited contracts, locked liquidity, and zero transaction tax. Its structured growth model and secure ecosystem make it one of the new 1000x coins to watch before it goes live. 5. Avalanche (AVAX): Scaling DeFi and Real-World Assets Avalanche (AVAX) has established itself as a key player in scalable blockchain infrastructure. With sub-second transaction times and low fees, it’s a hub for DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise blockchain adoption. Recent partnerships with global financial firms have positioned Avalanche at the center of real-world asset tokenization (RWA). According to Decrypt, its subnets are being adopted by institutions aiming to issue digital securities and tokenized debt. AVAX’s deflationary model, growing developer base, and institutional collaborations put it among the top new 1000x coins with strong long-term fundamentals. As tokenization expands, Avalanche is likely to play a central role in bridging traditional finance with decentralized ecosystems. 6. SUI: Redefining Speed and Developer Accessibility SUI continues to impress as one of the fastest-growing Layer-1 networks. Built with the Move programming language, it offers near-instant finality and unmatched scalability, capable of handling over 300,000 transactions per second. Its architecture enables developers to build high-performance dApps and games with low latency. According to The Block, SUI’s adoption among Web3 gaming studios has increased rapidly, making it a preferred choice for NFT marketplaces and DeFi protocols seeking efficiency. With continuous ecosystem growth and developer incentives, SUI has secured its position among the most promising new 1000x coins. Its combination of performance and developer-friendly infrastructure sets it apart in the crowded Layer-1 race. 7. Stellar (XLM): Expanding Global Financial Access Stellar (XLM) continues to be a cornerstone in global payment innovation. Its mission to connect banks, businesses, and users through fast, affordable cross-border transfers has made it a favorite for institutions adopting blockchain technology. Recent collaborations with global fintech companies have expanded Stellar’s use in stablecoin transfers, remittances, and tokenized asset issuance. The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) continues to support ecosystem growth by partnering with financial institutions across developing regions. With increasing real-world adoption and low transaction fees, XLM remains one of the new 1000x coins with long-term sustainability. Its focus on accessibility and inclusivity makes it a reliable hold in any diversified portfolio. 8. Chainlink (LINK): Powering Real-World Data in Blockchain Chainlink (LINK) continues to dominate as the leading decentralized oracle network. It provides trusted data to power smart contracts across blockchains, making it indispensable for DeFi, insurance, and supply chain systems. The introduction of the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) has strengthened its role in connecting multiple blockchains. Chainlink’s recent partnerships with major banks and enterprises highlight its growing real-world importance. As on-chain and off-chain worlds converge, LINK’s role in securing reliable data will only expand. For investors focused on infrastructure-driven growth, Chainlink remains one of the strongest new 1000x coins with real utility and institutional demand. Conclusion The next generation of new 1000x coins is emerging across diverse sectors, from DeFi and payments to infrastructure and presales. BullZilla leads the pack with its clear ROI model and transparent growth structure. Bitcoin Cash, MoonBull, and La Culex add momentum through scalability and tokenomics, while Avalanche, SUI, Stellar, and Chainlink deliver utility and institutional relevance. For investors seeking early entry before the market’s next significant surge, these eight projects represent a balanced mix of innovation and potential.

BTC plunged to as low as $103K before rebounding, leaving traders and analysts assessing whether this correction marks the beginning of a deeper retracement or just another shakeout. Adding intrigue to the situation, a mysterious whale, known by many as a “BitcoinOG,” profited more than $160 million in just 30 hours during the crash. The trader reportedly executed large short positions on both Bitcoin and Ethereum, perfectly timing the market’s downturn. Now, in a surprising twist, this same entity is doubling down. Lookonchain data shows that the trader has opened additional short positions totaling 1,423 BTC—worth approximately $161 million at current prices. The move has sparked widespread speculation across the crypto community. While some see it as a calculated hedge anticipating further downside, others interpret it as a potential market manipulation attempt. Regardless, Bitcoin’s ability to recover amid such heavy short positioning will be a key test of market resilience in the days ahead. Bitcoin OG Moves Another 100 BTC: A Signal or a Setup? According to data from Lookonchain, the mysterious trader known as “Bitcoin OG” has just deposited another 100 BTC—worth approximately $11.48 million—into Kraken within the past hour. Depositing BTC to exchanges like Kraken often signals a potential intent to sell or to use the coins as collateral for derivatives trading. Given that this trader has already built a massive short position—currently estimated at 1,423 BTC ($161 million)—this additional transfer may suggest that the individual is either increasing leverage or preparing for further downside. It’s a classic playbook move: send BTC to an exchange ahead of shorting or market-making activity. However, such transactions can also act as psychological catalysts, amplifying fear across the market. When large wallets move funds after volatile events, it often triggers panic among retail traders, who interpret it as a prelude to another sell-off. The coming days will therefore be crucial. If Bitcoin holds above $113K–$115K despite these bearish signals, it could indicate that selling pressure is being absorbed by strong hands. Conversely, failure to maintain this support could trigger another cascade of liquidations toward the $108K–$110K zone. In short, the market is entering a decisive phase—where Bitcoin’s resilience will either confirm recovery or pave the way for another sharp leg down. Price Faces Resistance as Recovery Slows Bitcoin’s daily chart shows the market struggling to regain momentum after last week’s dramatic sell-off. Following the drop to $103K, BTC rebounded sharply but now faces resistance near the $117,500 level — a critical zone that previously acted as both support and resistance throughout August and September. The price is currently trading around $114,300, sitting just below the 50-day moving average (blue line), while the 100-day (green) and 200-day (red) moving averages remain slightly below, supporting the current structure around $112K and $107K, respectively. This alignment suggests that BTC remains in a medium-term uptrend, but the current consolidation could define the next major move. If Bitcoin manages to close above $117,500, it could confirm a bullish continuation toward $122K and eventually retest the $125K level. Conversely, failure to break through resistance may trigger renewed selling pressure, potentially dragging the price back toward $110K or even $107K. Momentum indicators show that buyers are cautious, with limited follow-through after each rally attempt. For now, Bitcoin’s outlook remains neutral to slightly bullish—but traders should watch for confirmation of direction around the $117.5K mark, which will likely determine whether the next leg is a recovery or another corrective wave.

Bitcoin On-Chain Fundamentals Losing Strength? According to a CryptoQant Quicktake post by contributor TeddyVision, Bitcoin’s Network Activity Index has been consistently trending below its 365-day moving average (MA) for most of 2025. The decline shows a structural slowdown in the Bitcoin network’s on-chain usage. Related Reading: Bitcoin Decouples From Miner Flows With -0.15 Correlation – What It Means For Price? For the uninitiated, the Bitcoin Network Activity Index measures how actively users are interacting on-chain – tracking metrics like transaction counts, active addresses, and transfer volumes. A rising index suggests growing organic usage and adoption, while a declining one indicates slowing network engagement. To recall, the Bitcoin network activity surged ahead of price back in 2023-24. At the time, Bitcoin price witnessed organic expansion in price, primarily driven by genuine on-chain usage. However, the trend has changed significantly in 2025. For the most part, this year saw Bitcoin liquidity circulating off-chain, while on-chain traffic has dwindled. As a result, the Network Activity Index has tumbled below the 365-day MA. That said, BTC price has held between $100,000 to $120,000, creating a widening gap between the digital asset’s valuation and network fundamentals. The CryptoQuant analyst remarked: Capital keeps rotating, but not expanding – most flows happen off-chain, through ETFs, custodians, and synthetic exposure, while genuine on-chain demand remains subdued. TeddyVision stated that the recent capital rotation in the Bitcoin market is not indicative of its strength, but rather it is just “momentum running on fumes.” The analyst added that when the Bitcoin network usage stagnates while price keeps on increasing, valuations stop reflecting adoption and start tracking assumptions. To conclude, although Bitcoin is not collapsing just yet, the fall in its network usage activity speaks volumes about its falling fundamentals. That said, all may not be over for BTC just yet. In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto noted that the Bitcoin bull market is not over yet. The analyst stated that a Bitcoin bear market will only start if it loses the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the weekly chart. Q4 2025 Bullish For BTC? While the recent flash crash to $102,000 may have spooked BTC bulls, several industry experts are still confident that the digital asset will continue to make new record highs in the last quarter of 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Prediction: Why The Price Will Cross $140,000 By The End Of October Crypto market expert Ash Crypto recently predicted that BTC is likely to hit as high as $180,000 in Q4 2025. Similarly, fresh data from Binance suggests that BTC could be on track to $130,000. In the same vein, noted crypto analyst Egrag recently forecasted that BTC only needs a minor catalyst to surge to $175,000. At press time, BTC trades at $114,076, up 0.8% in the past 24 hours.

53113347,https://timestabloid.com/?p=86280,1760414563,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Projected XRP Price If Pension Funds Allocate 5% into XRP,https://timestabloid.com/projected-xrp-price-if-pension-funds-allocate-5-into-xrp/,"XRP could record one of its most significant price increases if American pension funds diversify even a small share of their holdings into digital assets. Estimates suggest that allocating just 5% of total U.S. pension assets to XRP could push its value above $70 , positioning it among the top beneficiaries of institutional adoption in the cryptocurrency market. Growing Institutional Interest in Crypto Institutional investors, including pension funds and retirement managers, are gradually showing more openness to cryptocurrencies. In recent years, both defined-benefit plans and 401(k) accounts have started experimenting with small exposures to digital assets. These allocations are typically introduced through spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or through companies with direct crypto exposure, such as MicroStrategy (MSTR). So far, the level of investment remains conservative, ranging between 0.1% and 1% of portfolio allocations. Many fund managers continue to exercise caution due to crypto’s volatility and perceived risk. Critics, including the advocacy group Better Markets, have described such moves as potentially irresponsible for retirement accounts. Still, the number of public entities allowing crypto investments is rising. As of April 2025, reports indicate that at least 17 U.S. states had either authorized or were reviewing proposals to permit crypto investments for reserve funds, while 16 states had done the same for their pension systems. Pennsylvania notably introduced legislation in late 2024 allowing its state treasurer and pension programs to gain exposure to Bitcoin. A study published by the CFA Institute, initially in 2022 and updated in 2024, revealed that 94% of state and local pension plans and 62% of corporate pension funds now hold crypto-related investments, whether directly or indirectly. Policy Changes Under the Trump Administration A major policy shift came when President Donald Trump issued an executive order instructing the Department of Labor (DOL) to review and update its guidelines regarding alternative investments within 401(k) retirement accounts. This order overturned the DOL’s earlier position from May 2022, which had warned against crypto allocations in retirement funds due to potential volatility and fraud risks. The revised policy now gives fiduciaries more flexibility to include digital assets, which could encourage broader participation from pension institutions. Should this happen, pension funds could start to allocate small but impactful portions of their portfolios to alternative assets, like XRP, potentially reshaping the token’s market dynamics. XRP Price Projection Based on 5% Allocation According to data from the Investment Company Institute, total assets under U.S. pension funds and retirement accounts reached $45.8 trillion as of June 30, 2025. These figures encompass both defined-benefit and defined-contribution plans, including 401(k). Presently, XRP trades near $2.60 , with a market capitalization of approximately $147.6 billion and a circulating supply of about 59.9 billion tokens. If pension funds were to direct 5% of their collective holdings, around $2.29 trillion, into XRP, the resulting capital inflow would significantly expand the asset’s market capitalization. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market behavior in crypto often exhibits a multiplier effect, where capital inflows trigger price increases larger than the initial investment. Analyst Dom previously noted that XRP has historically shown multiplier effects of over 200x. Even applying a conservative 2x multiplier, a $2.29 trillion investment would elevate XRP’s total valuation by roughly $4.58 trillion. Adding this figure to the current capitalization of $147 billion results in a projected market value near $4.73 trillion. Dividing this by XRP’s 60 billion token supply yields an estimated price of approximately $78.70 per coin. While such projections remain hypothetical, they illustrate the scale of potential growth if institutional investors fully embrace digital assets. A modest allocation from the pension fund sector alone could drastically reshape XRP’s market position , especially if regulatory conditions continue to evolve favourably.

The price is now showing positive signs but faces a major hurdle near the $2.620 level. XRP price is attempting a recovery wave above the $2.50 zone. The price is now trading above $2.520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.650 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it settles below $2.50. XRP Price Struggles Near Resistance XRP price found support and started a strong recovery wave above $2.20, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to climb above the $2.250 and $2.320 levels to enter a positive zone. There was a decent increase above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.05 swing high to the $1.40 swing low. However, the price seems to be facing a major barrier near the $2.650 level. Besides, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.650 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $2.520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.60 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.650 level and the trend line. It is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.05 swing high to the $1.40 swing low. A clear move above the $2.650 resistance might send the price toward the $2.70 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.720 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.80. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $2.650 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.550 level. The next major support is near the $2.50 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.50 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.30. The next major support sits near the $2.2680 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $2.220. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now near the 50 level.

Despite strong community enthusiasm and years of promotion, several fundamental and structural challenges make such a milestone highly improbable under current conditions. The Core Issue: Excessive Token Supply The greatest barrier to Shiba Inu’s $0.001 target is its overwhelming token supply. Although approximately 41% of the initial supply has been permanently removed from circulation, mainly due to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s large-scale burn in 2021, the asset still maintains a circulating supply of around 589 trillion tokens. This figure remains too high to support substantial price growth without enormous capital inflows. Given the current burn pace, it would likely take several decades to reduce supply to a level where $0.001 could be feasible. Even small price increases now require disproportionately large amounts of new investment, making each upward movement progressively harder to sustain. Limited Institutional Engagement Shiba Inu’s growth has largely relied on retail enthusiasm, with minimal participation from institutional investors. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana, which have each attracted attention from major asset managers and corporations, SHIB has not yet secured any significant institutional adoption. Although Sweden-based Valour Inc. launched a Shiba Inu exchange-traded product (ETP) to provide limited exposure, the initiative has not meaningfully boosted investor confidence or liquidity. The absence of a U.S.-listed spot ETF further reinforces the perception that SHIB remains a speculative asset rather than a serious investment vehicle. Anonymity and Leadership Concerns Another challenge lies in the project’s governance structure. Shiba Inu’s leadership, headed by the pseudonymous developer Shytoshi Kusama, has chosen to remain anonymous . While anonymity once added intrigue to the project’s identity, it now raises transparency and accountability issues that deter institutional investors. By comparison, projects led by visible figures such as Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum) or Charles Hoskinson (Cardano) have earned more credibility, partly because investors can assess the leadership’s track record and intentions. Shiba Inu’s lack of identifiable management continues to restrict its legitimacy in traditional financial spaces. Insufficient Utility and Adoption Despite efforts to expand its ecosystem through initiatives like Shibarium, ShibaSwap, and the Shib Metaverse, the project has yet to establish a core use case that drives consistent demand beyond speculation. These developments have generated community excitement but have not translated into sustained real-world utility or significant on-chain activity. Fragmented Focus and Internal Disputes In recent months, Shiba Inu’s leadership has also been linked to projects outside its primary ecosystem. Shytoshi Kusama’s support for the separate meme token “SHY” is a notable example. Such diversions risk fragmenting the community’s focus and redirecting liquidity away from SHIB itself. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Further complicating matters, internal disagreements have reportedly surfaced among developers. In a public statement, developer Kaal Dhairya alluded to tensions within the team, noting that several individuals who previously benefited from Shiba Inu had departed the project. Internal divisions of this nature can slow progress, delay deliverables, and erode investor confidence. Shiba Inu’s path to $0.001 is obstructed by structural realities that extend far beyond community enthusiasm. Its massive circulating supply, lack of institutional adoption, anonymous leadership, and absence of strong utility collectively undermine the token’s long-term potential. Until these core challenges are addressed and the project demonstrates measurable progress in reducing supply and increasing practical adoption, the $0.001 dream is likely to remain out of reach for investors.

Lee went on to explain how the leverage flushout and volatility caused panic selling and discounts to asset fundamentals. “Volatility creates deleveraging, and this can cause assets to trade at substantial discounts to fundamentals, or as we say, ‘substantial discount to the future’ and this creates advantages for investors, at the expense of traders.” Millions of traders were liquidated when markets tanked following insider whales opening massive short positions just before a major announcement from the US President.

Gold prices hit another record high of $4,160 per ounce on Tuesday, with investors ramping up safe-haven buying. Singapore’s economy expanded 2.9% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2025, slowing from an upwardly revised 4.5% in Q2 as weakness in manufacturing weighed on overall performance. The Monetary Authority of Singapore left its monetary policy unchanged on Tuesday, maintaining the rate of appreciation of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) band, with no change to its width or centre. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 2.61% to around 47,590, while the broader Topix Index lost 0.7% to 3,175 in post-holiday trade on Tuesday, with Japanese shares declining for a second session. The Japanese yen fell to around 152.3 per dollar on Tuesday, extending losses from the previous session, as mounting political uncertainty dampened investor sentiment. On Friday, Japan’s Komeito party announced its withdrawal from the ruling coalition led by the Liberal Democratic Party, deepening doubts over Sanae Takaichi’s policy agenda and complicating her path to the premiership. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.27% to climb above 3,900 on Tuesday, ending a two-day losing streak amid signs of easing US-China trade tensions, with both sides indicating readiness to restart negotiations, and the offshore yuan edged lower to around 7.14 per dollar on Tuesday, trading within a narrow range. China and the U.S. are escalating their trade war by imposing new port fees on ocean shipping firms starting Tuesday, targeting vessels that transport goods and making maritime trade a new front in their ongoing trade war. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday that President Trump remains on course to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month as both nations seek to defuse tensions over tariffs and export controls. Looking ahead, investors will closely watch China’s upcoming inflation report, expected to show a modest year-on-year contraction and a slight monthly gain. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 1.05% to 25,956 in Tuesday morning trade, attempting to recover following six consecutive sessions of losses. India ( SENSEX ) fell 0.26% Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.16% to 8,868 on Tuesday, marking its third consecutive session of losses and remaining at its lowest level in nearly two weeks, as notable declines in major banking stocks outweighed strong performances in the mining and gold sectors. The Australian dollar stabilized around $0.651 on Tuesday, as minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia's October meeting indicated that the central bank saw no urgency for additional rate cuts. The RBA held its cash rate at 3.6% in September 2025, following a 25bps cut in the previous month, keeping borrowing costs at its lowest since April 2023. On the economic front, Australia's NAB Business Confidence Index rose to 7 in September 2025, up from a three-month low of 4 in August, remaining above its long-term average. The South Korean won hovered near 1,427 per dollar on Tuesday, showing little change from the previous session, as markets cautiously evaluated recent signals from Seoul and Washington amid ongoing trade negotiations. South Korea is in talks with the U.S. to establish a bilateral foreign exchange swap line as part of a broader trade deal, amid concerns that proposed U.S. investments could disrupt its currency market. In the U.S. on Monday, all three major indexes ended sharply higher on Monday, rebounding from Friday’s steep sell-off after President Trump struck a softer tone on US-China trade tensions, assuring that relations with Beijing “will all be fine.” Investors now await quarterly results from major banks including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs later in the day. U.S. stock futures edged lower on Tuesday: Dow -0.17% ; S&P 500 -0.41% ; Nasdaq -0.55% . Currencies: ( JPY:USD ), ( CNY:USD ), ( AUD:USD ), ( INR:USD ), ( HKD:USD ), ( NZD:USD ).

According to The Big Whale, the product, scheduled for launch in early 2026, is seen as a significant step toward strengthening the bridge between traditional finance and the cryptocurrency world. France-based Amundi, a giant with approximately €2.3 trillion in assets under management, ranks among the top ten largest asset managers globally. Founded in 2010 through the merger of the asset management units of Crédit Agricole and Société Générale, the company has maintained steady growth in Europe's financial markets ever since.

53117167,https://invezz.com/?p=2923484,1760419235,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,XRP price prediction as the XRPR ETF inflows continue,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/14/xrp-price-prediction-as-the-xrpr-etf-inflows-continue/,"XRP price crashed to a low of $2.5440, down by over 30% from the year-to-date high. Ripple was trading at $2.5485, up sharply from last Friday’s low of $1.7768. This article explores whether XRP is a good investment as the XRPR ETF nears a $100 million milestone. XRPR ETF growth is accelerating The recently launched REX-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR) is firing on all cylinders. It has achieved over $92 million in assets, less than a month after its launch, a sign that there is robust demand from institutional investors. XRPR ETF has gained assets despite its high expense ratio of 0.75%. In contrast, most spot Bitcoin ETFs have a ratio of less than 0.25%. As such, its continued inflows is a sign that there is substantial demand for the coin from institutional investors. The Teucrium 2x XRP ETF (XXRP) has also had substantial inflows in the past few months and now has over $355 million in assets under management. These ETFs mean that the spot XRP ETFs by more mainstream companies like Franklin Templeton, Invesco, and Bitwise will be more popular in Wall Street if the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves them after the government shutdown ends. Analysts expect that XRP ETFs will have billions in inflows and assets in the first year of launch. JPMorgan analysts expect the funds will have over $8 billion in inflows in the first year. American investors have had substantial interest in the crypto industry. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have had over $62.4 billion in inflows since their inception, while Ethereum funds have had over $14.48 billion in inflows. The two have over $130 billion and $28.75 billion in assets under management. XRP price chart | Source: TradingView Other catalysts for the Ripple price The other main catalyst for the XRP price is the ongoing stablecoin growth. Data shows that the Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin has over $839 million in assets, a robust growth for a coin that was launched late last year. RLUSD is widely used, with its daily volume being $105 million. RLUSD’s success is important because some of the supply is in the XRP Ledger network. It is also notable that after Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act. There are other catalysts, including its growing market share in the RWA industry, where its total assets have jumped to $361 million, up by 3.39%. Some of the top RWA assets in the platform are VERT Capital, RLUSD, OpenEden Digital, Archax, Ondo, and Braza Crypto. XRP price technical analysis XRP price chart | Source: TradingView The daily timeframe chart shows that the XRP price has plunged in the past few weeks, moving from a high $3.6650 to $2.53. It has moved below the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). The coin has formed a giant hammer candlestick, which is a common bullish reversal pattern. Still, the most likely scenario is where the token resumes the downward trend and move to the support at $2. A move above the resistance point at $2.84, the 200-day moving average will invalidate the bearish view.

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000359. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000583 and an average trading price of $0.000560 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The recent launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1?

Momentum is weak, but hints of recovery are emerging in the short term. FLOKI on the daily timeframe Floki’s daily chart for October 14 reveals a fragile consolidation phase following a steep correction from the $0.000108 level. The price is currently around $0.00007421, slightly below the mid-Bollinger band ($0.00008598), signaling continued bearish pressure. The lower Bollinger band near $0.00006363 acts as key support, while resistance is capped at $0.000086 and $0.000108. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains in bearish territory, though the histogram bars are fading red, hinting at declining bearish momentum, but no confirmed bullish crossover yet. The RSI at 48.14 indicates a neutral to slightly bearish stance, suggesting room for a potential rebound if buying volume returns. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the 4-hour timeframe, Floki shows early consolidation signs as the alligator’s moving averages tighten near $0.000074–$0.000077, indicating a potential volatility expansion ahead. The price action remains sandwiched between the green and red lines of the alligator, reflecting indecision. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The MACD histogram has turned slightly positive at $0.00000144, hinting at a bullish divergence. However, a sustained move above $0.0000768 is needed to confirm a short-term upward breakout. If buyers hold above $0.000073 support, momentum could carry Floki to $0.000078–$0.000082 in the near term. Conversely, a rejection near $0.0000768 may lead to a retest of $0.000068–$0.000070 support.

A move above $0.000076 could trigger a mild rally toward $0.000085, but a failure to hold above $0.000072 risks another dip toward $0.000065. The market remains cautious and range-bound, pending confirmation of a stronger breakout. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~11x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a market cap of up to $95 to $100 billion to hit $0.01, over 95x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

FLOKI historic price sentiment Floki Inu price history by Coingecko From late 2021 to 2023, Floki experienced significant volatility. After reaching an all-time high of $0.0003437 in late 2021, prices fluctuated throughout 2022, ranging from $0.0001004 to $0.0005815. In early 2023, the price surged but corrected by March, stabilizing around $0.0003143 by April and closing the year at $0.0003502.

The market crash was triggered by a Truth Social post from US President Donald Trump threatening tariffs on China, which sent prices plunging and caused major disruptions on Binance. Some users reported being unable to close positions, while others saw altcoins briefly display “zero” prices. Despite the chaos, BNB rebounded to a new all-time high on Monday. Binance also faced lingering technical issues, with Binance Wallet and Trust Wallet users reporting delayed balance displays and pricing glitches caused by network congestion and oracle strain. BNB Chain Launches $45M Airdrop BNB Chain unveiled a $45 million “reload airdrop” to help users recover from losses suffered during last Friday’s historic crypto market crash, which wiped out roughly $20 billion in liquidations. The initiative will distribute BNB tokens, which are currently valued at around $1,276 each, to more than 160,000 eligible addresses. According to the network, the airdrop will begin this week and finish by early November. Partners like Four Meme, PancakeSwap, Binance Wallet, and Trust Wallet will help to facilitate the distribution. BNB Chain was originally developed by Binance but is now maintained by a decentralized community. It said the effort is meant to support retail traders that were impacted by the extreme volatility seen last week. Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao confirmed that rewards will be allocated randomly among eligible participants. The airdrop comes just days after one of the most dramatic sell-offs in crypto’s history, triggered by a Truth Social post from US President Donald Trump threatening 100% tariffs on Chinese imports. The shock sent markets tumbling, and Binance was quickly caught in the center of the storm as users reported platform glitches during the chaos. Some traders claimed they were unable to close their positions during the sell-off, while others pointed to issues like altcoins briefly showing “zero” prices on Binance, even though they continued trading normally elsewhere. (Source: Binance ) Adding to the controversy, Ethena’s synthetic stablecoin, USDe, plunged to $0.65 on Binance while maintaining near-peg levels on other exchanges. Ethena Labs founder Guy Young attributed the anomaly to Binance’s reliance on internal order book data for its oracle, where liquidity was thinner compared to external sources. Binance later issued a statement assuring its users that its core futures systems remained functional throughout the crash. The exchange blamed the “zero price” glitch on a decimal configuration issue and explained that some brief price drops were due to thin liquidity triggering old limit orders. Binance also confirmed that it compensated affected users holding depegged assets like USDe, BNSOL, and WBETH, covering $283 million in total losses. Despite the turbulence, BNB rebounded strongly, and hit a new all-time high on Monday morning. BNB price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Binance Wallet Glitches Persist Meanwhile, Binance’s infrastructure faced even more strain in the aftermath of Friday’s crypto market crash, as balance display issues persisted across its self-custody product, Binance Wallet, into Monday. The platform confirmed on X that it was “temporarily experiencing lag” due to network congestion, preventing some users from viewing wallet data. Binance explained that the affected information required “buffering time to display” and said its team was working to resolve the issue. The disruption followed similar glitches on Binance’s trading platform, where abnormal price readings affected several altcoins during the market’s steep decline. Some users claimed they were unable to interact with their assets, with one even reporting a loss of more than $130 after being unable to sell BNB. The Binance Wallet problems came shortly after Trust Wallet — another self-custody platform founded by Binance’s Changpeng “CZ” Zhao — also experienced issues over the weekend. On Sunday, Trust Wallet said that some users were unable to see their balances due to a “market data sync issue,” though it later announced that the problem was fixed within about four hours. Despite the resolution, several users continued to report inaccurate balance displays afterward. Trust Wallet’s head of communications, Dami Odufuwa, said that the glitch was limited to fiat balance visibility and did not affect users’ ability to trade, swap, or stake tokens. Odufuwa reassured people that all assets were secure and that the issue stemmed solely from temporary market data synchronization errors. Trezor analyst Lucien Bourdon suggested that the incorrect balance displays across Binance Wallet and Trust Wallet were likely caused by the record liquidations during the crash, which overwhelmed pricing and oracle servers.

According to market analyst Phursey, the transfers included a staggering 145 million XRP, valued at roughly $340 million, moved to Binance alone, while additional chunks were seen flowing through Bitfinex and various unknown wallets. As a result, the massive XRP transfer has sent shockwaves through the community, sparking intense debate over its intent. Some analysts view it as a routine exchange reshuffle, a liquidity realignment ahead of increased trading activity. Notably, exchanges often shift assets between hot and cold wallets, consolidate reserves, or rebalance inventories ahead of onboarding institutions or facilitating large OTC trades. From this angle, a massive transfer to Binance may simply signal routine custodial management or preparation for legitimate trading activity, not a planned sell-off. Therefore, analysts supporting this view typically look for confirming patterns like phased movements, redistribution to known custodians, or matching inbound flows that suggest standard operational behavior. Conversely, others suspect a more calculated move, entailing a strategic liquidity prep to offload tokens before a possible market correction. At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at $2.54 per CoinGecko data . XRP Set to Benefit as RLUSD Adoption Accelerates Across DeFi and Payments According to prominent crypto observer SMQKE, XRP is poised to directly benefit from the accelerating demand for RLUSD, Ripple’s native stablecoin built to bridge liquidity across decentralized finance (DeFi), enterprise payments, and on-chain settlements. RLUSD, issued by Ripple and fully backed 1:1 with U.S. dollar reserves, has quickly emerged as one of the most promising new entrants in the stablecoin market. Its growing traction among institutional users and DeFi protocols signals a shift toward deeper utility within the XRP Ledger (XRPL) ecosystem, one that could drive sustained demand for XRP itself. As RLUSD adoption expands, analysts anticipate a ripple effect across the broader XRPL network. Developers are expected to integrate the stablecoin into DeFi applications, automated market makers (AMMs), and cross-border payment rails. This integration would enhance on-chain liquidity and attract new capital inflows, while simultaneously increasing transaction volumes, a key factor in XRP’s market utility. SMQKE highlights that Ripple’s dual-asset strategy, pairing its stablecoin RLUSD with XRP, gives it a powerful edge over rival blockchains. As RLUSD gains traction among enterprises and fintechs as a settlement medium, XRP’s role as the core bridge for liquidity and value transfer grows increasingly vital. Therefore, the coming wave of enterprise integrations could reignite institutional interest in XRP. Leveraging Ripple’s global payment partnerships, RLUSD introduces a compliant, transparent gateway for faster, low-cost remittances. This synergy between stablecoin liquidity and XRP utility could trigger a self-reinforcing cycle of adoption, cementing XRPL’s position as a leading network for real-world finance. Conclusion Whether the massive XRP transfers signal routine exchange management or the first tremors of a major market shift, one thing is certain, investor confidence is on edge. The XRP Army’s sharp vigilance highlights a maturing market where transparency, timing, and liquidity shifts can move billions in mere minutes. Meanwhile, RLUSD’s rapid adoption signals more than just another stablecoin milestone, it marks a defining moment for Ripple’s ecosystem. As institutions, DeFi developers, and payment providers flock to the XRP Ledger to harness RLUSD’s stability and efficiency, XRP is regaining prominence as the core bridge for global liquidity.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-14 05:39:14

The move enables nearly 800,000 citizens to verify their credentials on a public blockchain, marking it the first of its kind. According to the Ethereum Foundation President Aya Miyaguchi, the integration of the system on Ethereum “is now fully operational.” “This milestone marks not only a national achievement but a global step toward a more open and secure digital future for the long term,” Miyaguchi posted on X . 1/ Today, Bhutan celebrates a historic milestone, becoming the first nation to anchor its national digital identity system on Ethereum. @VitalikButerin and I were honored to join the launch ceremony on behalf of the Ethereum community, graced by His Royal Highness. pic.twitter.com/KA4tOYbsJ4 — Aya Miyaguchi (@AyaMiyagotchi) October 13, 2025 Aya Miyaguchi, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, joined Bhutan’s prime minister, Tshering Tobgay, and crown prince on Monday at the launch ceremony. Bhutan Government’s Decentralized Adoption The move aligns with Ethereum’s 10th anniversary , underscoring a shared commitment to open public data. “When I first visited Bhutan in May 2024, I felt a strong resonance between Bhutan and Ethereum: both believe that visions for the future must be grounded in strong foundational values,” wrote Miyaguchi. “It’s deeply inspiring to see a nation commit to empowering its citizens with self-sovereign identity.” Ethereum boasts a globally distributed network of validator nodes. By leveraging the blockchain, Bhutan’s NDI benefits from greater decentralization, transparency and resilience. With this integration, Bhutan’s national digital identity system can now issue Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and enable digital signing directly on Ethereum. “By leveraging Ethereum’s globally distributed network, we are strengthening the security, transparency, and resilience of Bhutan’s digital infrastructure,” said Lyonchen Tshering Tobgay, the Prime Minister of Bhutan. National ID System From Polygon to Ethereum Blockchain Per a Bhutan Times report , His Royal Highness The Gyalsey of Bhutan launched its National Digital Identity in 2023 and became the first digital citizen. In August 2024, the South Asian nation made a transition of its national digital self-sovereign identity from Hyperledger to Polygon . Bhutan adopted the Polygon Blockchain, and its zero-knowledge protocols, aiming to enhance the system’s scalability, ensuring it can handle high transaction volumes without compromising performance. “Bhutan’s transition reflects what Ethereum was always designed for — empowering individuals with sovereignty over their own data, fostering trust without central points of failure, and enabling inclusive digital systems that serve people first,” Aya Miyaguchi added. Besides, the Bhutan government is also staking Bitcoin, becoming the fifth-largest nation to hold the asset in treasuries.

Lookonchain on Tuesday posted blockchain data showing the investor entered at $115,783 and currently holds a 3,440 BTC short position worth about $392.67m, with an unrealized profit near $5.7m and a liquidation threshold of $128,030. Despite Bitcoin rebounding to around $115,000 over the weekend, the trader has added to the position aggressively, indicating a renewed bearish conviction.

Market watchers are now mulling whether this is an attempt to shake out weak longs or part of a larger, calculated push toward another engineered collapse. In a prior episode, the same wallet gained notoriety after opening massive shorts just before Donald Trump’s tariff announcement triggered a sharp market drop , netting an estimated $160m in profits. That trade stoked debate over whether political signals and insider timing were colluding, especially since the trader has been branded a “Trump insider” in crypto circles. Other Hyperliquid Whales Join “Trump Insider” In Mounting Bearish Positions Compounding the tension, other heavy hitters on the Hyperliquid platform are also placing bearish bets . Whale 0x9eec9 currently holds $98m in shorts across DOGE, ETH, PEPE, XRP, and ASTER. Whale 0x9263 is wagering $84m against SOL and BTC. These are not impulsive bets by retail speculators, but decisive moves by seasoned players betting on coordinated downside. Since the crash, markets have seen an increase in hedging activity and put buying, pointing to growing bearish sentiment. Nonetheless, the sheer size and timing of these bets maintain pressure on Bitcoin and crypto markets, especially as volatility returns to centre stage.

News Background XRP’s rebound from Friday’s sub-$1.58 liquidation lows lost steam overnight as fresh whale activity hit exchanges. A single 23.9 M XRP transfer (≈ $63 M) to Binance coincided with selling pressure that erased early gains. The move came as open interest jumped 2.4 % to $1.36 B, suggesting leveraged positioning remains elevated even after the $32 B market-cap recovery that followed Trump’s tariff-driven crypto rout. Broader risk markets stabilized as trade-war rhetoric softened, but derivatives desks flagged renewed short build-ups near $2.65–$2.66. Price Action Summary XRP traded a $0.11 band (4 %) from $2.54 to $2.66 between Oct 13 05:00 and Oct 14 04:00. Volume exploded to 244.6 M at 13:00 — nearly 3× the 91.8 M average — confirming aggressive dip-buying near $2.55. Price peaked at $2.66 during 20:00 hour before sustained sell-off drove a $2.55 close. Bears extended control into the final hour, breaking $2.57 support on 4 M volume at 04:10, then consolidating $2.55–$2.56 into close. Technical Analysis The $2.55–$2.56 zone continues to anchor near-term support after repeated high-volume defenses. Resistance is firm at $2.65–$2.66 where profit-taking and whale flows triggered multiple rejections. Momentum bias leans bearish while XRP trades below its 200-day MA ($2.63), though a sustained reclaim above $2.60 could reset the structure for another $2.70 test. Volume remains the key tell: spikes on dips show institutions buying weakness, but lower highs suggest supply still outweighs demand. What Traders Are Watching $2.55 support — can it hold through weekend Asia sessions? Reaction to $2.65–$2.66 resistance zone on next uptick.

The data center project will cover three separate campuses in Adavivaram, Tarluvada, and Rambilli villages, with the firm aiming to start operations by mid-2028. Overall, the initiative supports Andhra Pradesh’s plan to build 6 gigawatts of data center capacity by 2029. Nara Lokesh, the region’s IT minister, commented , “It’s not just about the jobs. It’s about the larger ripple effect that it creates, the economic activity it creates.” The Visakhapatnam project will include submarine cables and metro fiber infrastructure Earlier, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu had hailed Google’s project a “game-changer,” saying it represents the single largest investment India has seen since its financial overhaul. Per project details, Google will channel the investment through its Indian arm, Raiden Infotech India Ltd. The cluster’s construction will also require laying and landing three high-capacity submarine cables, as well as setting up dedicated landing stations and metro fiber infrastructure. Currently, the firm and its subsidiaries have established 29 data center sites in 11 countries worldwide, including the US, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, and several in Europe. The planned Visakhapatnam cluster is poised to be its biggest in Asia so far. In December 2024, six months into his tenure, Naidu formalized an agreement with Google through a memorandum of understanding. Insiders noted that Google had listed several infrastructure requirements for its data center infrastructure. Naidu had also earlier proposed revisions to the IT and Copyright Acts aimed at advancing data city projects. The Indian government later issued a draft policy setting out a roadmap for data center development. In May, a Google Asia Pacific delegation then toured Visakhapatnam, guided by Lokesh as they assessed prospective locations. Now, its data project will be incorporated into India’s maiden International AI Infrastructure Hub, envisioned as a digital powerhouse supporting industrial growth and technological innovation. India’s data center market is forecasted to surpass $100 billion by 2027 India has also attracted companies seeking to enhance their AI systems. Amazon recently announced plans to invest over $233 million in India by 2025. The fund will be used to expand its operational infrastructure, develop new technology for its fulfillment network, and enhance delivery safety. The investment builds on Amazon’s earlier investments, which were used to create an operational network to deliver to all serviceable pin codes in the country. The e-commerce powerhouse, rivaling Walmart’s Flipkart and Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Retail in India, revealed in June 2023 plans to invest around $26 billion in the country by 2030. The announcement was timed after Amazon CEO Andy Jassy met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the US and announced further investments of $6.5 billion. However, Amazon did not specify how that number is broken down. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan , Amazon’s cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS), also announced that it would invest approximately $12.9 billion, equivalent to 1.06 trillion rupees, in India by the end of 2030. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has described the technologies as a lever for India’s economic transformation and an instrument for lifting millions out of poverty. But scarce water and unpredictable electricity may thwart his expansion plans. Lokesh’s Telugu Desam Party, led by his father, is heavily entwined in Modi’s development strategy. The government of Andhra Pradesh is attracting investors with affordable land and reliable power. Naidu first made his name in the late 1990s, when he helped turn Hyderabad into a global tech hub with companies like Microsoft and Oracle setting up shop there. Having leveraged its political strength to push through corporate-friendly policies at the state level, including further moves against trade unions and other workers’ rights, the party is now using its influence to push for federal policies that will strengthen companies investing widely in Andhra Pradesh. Lokesh remarked, “We are willing to have conversations which might even require policy intervention at the federal level.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",Tech|Google,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-14 05:46:12

Key Takeaways: South Korea’s FIU has resumed reviewing Binance’s acquisition of Gopax, with approval possible by late 2025. The review of Gopax’s executive changes effectively serves as a test of Binance’s qualification as a controlling shareholder. Binance’s $4.3 billion US settlement appears to have eased South Korean regulators’ earlier AML-related concerns. According to a Tuesday report from Newsis , the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) is now reviewing Gopax’s formal report on changes to its key executives, a move tied directly to Binance’s ownership stake, and the review is reportedly progressing favorably. Approval could come as early as the end of 2025. Binance’s Fate in Korea Hinges on Executive Review Under South Korean law, there is no separate system for assessing the suitability of major shareholders in crypto exchanges. As a result, the FIU’s review of Gopax’s executive changes effectively serves as a vetting process for Binance’s qualification as a controlling shareholder. Binance first acquired a 67% stake in Gopax in February 2023, becoming its largest shareholder. The exchange and Gopax jointly filed the executive change report in March 2023, but local regulators froze the approval process over anti-money laundering (AML) concerns. The delay coincided with Binance’s legal troubles in the US , where the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) accused the company of unregistered operations and AML violations. Binance later reached a $4.3 billion settlement with US authorities, which appears to have eased South Korean regulators’ concerns , Newsis said. 4/ Whereas Gopax is one of the central exchanges severely damaged by @FTX_Official 's collapse, @Binance used IRI to invest in #Gopax . With #Binance 's investment, @GOPAX_kr will resume the customer withdrawal of deposited assets, including interests. pic.twitter.com/IVPx57Y20l — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) February 7, 2023 Gopax is among the few South Korean exchanges authorized to handle cash-to-crypto transactions, a designation that requires strict compliance with KYC and AML standards. The platform suffered a major liquidity crisis in early 2023 after its DeFi partner, Genesis Global Capital, froze withdrawals tied to Gopax’s GoFi product. Following Genesis’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, roughly $47 million (₩56.6 billion) in user funds were left inaccessible. Binance’s acquisition of Gopax was initially framed as a rescue effort, aimed at restoring customer confidence and injecting funds to compensate affected users. However, as regulatory hurdles dragged on, Binance reportedly explored selling part of its Gopax stake to local cloud provider Megazone to lower its ownership share, a deal that ultimately collapsed in late 2024, The Bell reported. South Korea Orders Crypto Exchanges to Halt Lending Services In August, South Korea’s financial regulator moved to rein in risky lending practices in the digital asset sector, ordering local exchanges to suspend all crypto lending services until a proper regulatory framework is established. The crackdown came amid South Korea’s broader pivot toward regulated crypto adoption. Authorities are lifting restrictions on institutional trading and preparing to approve the country’s first spot crypto ETFs . President Lee Jae Myung’s administration is also working on a stablecoin framework pegged to the Korean won, signaling a more open approach to digital finance despite the latest curbs. More recently, Dunamu, the operator of South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Upbit, unveiled a new custody service aimed at corporate and institutional clients, as regulatory green lights for virtual asset investments spark growing demand for secure storage solutions. The service stores all deposited digital assets in cold wallets, entirely offline and insulated from internet-based threats, to shield holdings from cyberattacks and other external breaches.

Citi has been working in this area for the last two to three years and significant progress has been made, Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships and innovation in the bank's services unit, told CNBC. “We are continuing to explore different types of assets. We expect to launch with a reliable custody solution that we can offer to our asset managers and other clients within the next few quarters.” Traditional financial institutions, which for years avoided cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, have begun to enter the arena after US President Donald Trump's administration established a more favorable regulatory framework for digital assets. New legislation like the GENIUS Act specifically targets specific areas, including stablecoins. Related News: Developers of One of the Major Altcoins of 2021 Bull Announce They Have Repurchased a Significant Amount of Tokens In the crypto world, custody services can take various forms, from digital asset exchanges holding user funds to institutions' self-custody systems. Citi's planned service will reportedly allow the bank to directly hold crypto assets. Chatterjee said Citi is working on both a homegrown technological solution and evaluating third-party partnerships. “For some asset types, we may have entirely in-house solutions, but for others, we may also use agile, third-party solutions. We are not ruling out any options at this time.” As with all custody services, there are risks such as cyberattacks and asset theft. However, heavily regulated banks like Citi are considered a safer alternative due to their long history of asset protection. Not every Wall Street bank is keen on this strategy. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon stated that his bank would offer cryptocurrency purchases to its clients but would not store these assets. *This is not investment advice.

Related Reading: XRP Reclaims Market Momentum With $30 Billion In Fresh Inflows, A Rally Underway? Chinese Investment Plans $600 Million Fundraiser On Monday, Bloomberg reported that Beijing-based Chinese investment bank China Renaissance Holdings Ltd. is planning a fundraiser for a new BNB-based public vehicle backed by YZi Labs Management Ltd. According to the news media outlet, China Renaissance aims to raise $600 million to create a publicly listed DAT company dedicated to accumulating BNB in the United States. YZi Labs, formerly known as Binance Labs, reportedly plans to invest $200 million in the deal alongside the Hong Kong-listed bank. Sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that YZi Labs met with a group of executives bullish on BNB for dinner in early October. China Renaissance, alongside other firms reportedly involved in setting up BNB hoarding companies, sent a representative to the event. It’s worth noting that the two companies recently announced a strategic partnership to “advance the development of BNB and the BNB Chain ecosystem,” which has been gaining momentum over the past few months. In August, China Renaissance shared that it had signed a strategic cooperation agreement with YZi Labs, aiming to “shape institutional pathways for digital asset adoption — from compliant product development to enterprise-level RWA applications” and create “meaningful synergies between the two ecosystems.” The investment bank also revealed its plan to invest around $100 million in BNB as part of its proprietary holdings, becoming the first Hong Kong-listed company to allocate the cryptocurrency as a proprietary digital asset. BNB Treasury Company Trend The Chinese investment bank initiative follows the growing trend of launching crypto-based DAT companies. This trend has seen the launch of dozens of new Treasury Companies and the investment of billions of dollars into these vehicles in the past couple of months. Last week, the world’s largest BNB Treasury Company, CEA Industries, announced that its treasury holdings have reached a total of $663 million in cash and crypto assets. As part of its goal to own 1% of the altcoin’s total token supply by the end of 2025, the Nasdaq-listed company now holds a total of 480,000 BNB tokens, valued at $585.5 million by October 6. In late September, Kazakhstan announced the launch of the Alem Crypto Fund, its first crypto reserve fund, aimed at long-term investment in digital assets, with Binance Kazakhstan as a strategic partner. Related Reading: ‘BNB Isn’t Crumbling’: CZ Slams Critics Stirring Fear And Doubt As part of the partnership, Alem Crypto Fund made BNB its first investment to highlight “the trust in the Binance ecosystem” and embark on “a new chapter for institutional recognition of cryptocurrencies in Kazakhstan.” Amid the surge in BNB-based funds, the altcoin has recorded a massive 36% rally in the last month, breaking past the $1,000 barrier and hitting multiple all-time highs (ATHs), reaching its most recent high of $1,370 on October 13. As of this writing, BNB is trading at $1,281, a 4% increase in the weekly timeframe.

According to price feeds, XRP traded around $2.57 at the time of reporting, up 7.5% for the day after tumbling to $1.20 over the weekend and staging a recovery of more than 100%. ETF Filings Move Forward Based on reports from ETF watchers, amendments have gone in for a number of spot XRP ETF applications. ETF analyst Nate Geraci posted that firms including Grayscale, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, WisdomTree and Canary Capital filed updates. Some documents now list ticker symbols — Grayscale’s would be GXRP, Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ and Canary’s XRPC — which market participants view as one of the last procedural steps before approval. Grayscale’s decision was scheduled for October 18, while Bitwise’s had an expected date of October 22. XRP is a bit cheaper today as well. https://t.co/hnmrIxpV6I — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) October 11, 2025 Regulatory Pause Hits Timetable Reports have disclosed that the ongoing US government shutdown has reduced the Securities and Exchange Commission’s capacity to finish certain review actions. Reporter Eleanor Terrett said the agency is operating with a skeleton crew and has suspended functions that include accelerating registration statements and declaring S-1s effective, steps required for funds to begin trading. With a new generic listing standard now in place and the SEC asking issuers about withdrawing related 19b-4 filings, conventional deadlines may not hold. Prediction markets put the chance of the shutdown becoming the longest in US history at about 49%, which adds uncertainty to timing. Price Action And Community Reaction Deaton posted a light comment on X, writing “XRP is a bit cheaper today,” which was followed by a thoughtful emoji. That remark echoed a common refrain among XRP holders who see the current lull as an entry point while institutional products near readiness. At press time, XRP’s rebound from a low near $1.20 to roughly $2.57 shows how quickly the token moved in recent sessions. Analysts note that continued filing updates suggest issuers expect approvals once normal SEC operations return. Realize that the market cap of XRP went down by a ~$100Billion (a recorded low of $1.17), then bounced back up a ~$100Billion in MC on very little Net Flows in comparison. Trust, when they’re ready to rocket this thing to infinity, it won’t take as much money as anyone thinks. https://t.co/59IiEhO2lX pic.twitter.com/wtQntCPzKA — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) October 10, 2025 Market Drops And Liquidations The broader crypto market suffered a rapid decline that intensified the drama. Based on market-cap metrics, total crypto value fell from $4.09 trillion at noon yesterday to about $3.3 trillion by nine PM (UTC), a loss of nearly $800 billion within nine hours. Community commentators pointed to heavy liquidations during that event. Chad Steingraber said the crash triggered what he called the largest XRP long liquidation in history, around $422 million, and he pointed to unusual exchange flows as part of the post-crash analysis.

Known for his adherence to traditional charting principles, Brandt shared a multi-decade view of XRP’s performance, showing what he considers to be a remarkably consistent technical setup extending back to 2014. As a student of classical charting principles and history, has there ever been a purer long-term chart? $XRP pic.twitter.com/rbA2Mp955A — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) October 13, 2025 A Clear Long-Term Structure The chart presented by Brandt highlights XRP’s behavior over multiple market cycles, capturing the asset’s early consolidation, its sharp rise during 2017, and the extended compression phase that followed. The long-term formation is built upon symmetrical patterns and defined trendlines, showing how XRP has respected its technical boundaries over years of market fluctuations. At the time of Brandt’s post, XRP was trading near $2.63, forming a compact consolidation range just below the $2.83 simple moving average. The structure suggests that XRP has maintained a disciplined chart pattern, one that aligns closely with traditional accumulation and breakout cycles observed in classical technical analysis. Brandt’s interpretation points to XRP as an example of how an asset can demonstrate clear, sustained structural integrity even in a highly speculative market. Different Interpretations from Market Observers Brandt’s post prompted several comments from traders and investors offering their own interpretations of the chart. A user identified as Mr. Skies noted that, based on his experience, assets that accumulate for long periods tend to deliver stronger upward movements once they emerge from extended consolidation. His statement reflects a view shared by many traditional market analysts who regard prolonged basing structures as potential precursors to major advances. In contrast, another commenter, known as lostintheoldworld, took a more reserved stance, suggesting that XRP could continue moving sideways for another five or six years. This reflects a cautious interpretation, emphasizing that long-term structures do not necessarily translate to immediate action. Adding a broader perspective, a user under the name A Concerned Observer discussed the difference between data-driven analysis and emotionally influenced speculation. While parts of the XRP community tend to rely on sentiment and speculative narratives, he remarked that Peter Brandt often makes objective, evidence-based assessments of both positive and negative conditions in various markets. He also mentioned that he began buying XRP at $0.40 and appreciates its performance, but encouraged the community to stay grounded amid speculation about riddles and hidden predictions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Classical Charting and Market Discipline Brandt’s post reinforces his long-standing commitment to classical charting methods, which rely on the study of recurring price structures rather than market sentiment. The repeated appearance of symmetrical consolidations and clearly defined trend formations in XRP’s history supports the argument that the asset has matured into one of the most technically coherent charts in the crypto market. The consistency of XRP’s long-term pattern aligns with the type of disciplined behavior often seen in markets that adhere to fundamental technical principles. While Brandt’s analysis does not make any forward price prediction, his focus remains on how XRP’s chart has maintained structural clarity through multiple cycles.

The crash, fueled by renewed US–China trade tensions, wiped out more than $20 billion in liquidations across major exchanges. Yet amid the chaos, Remittix has captured attention as the best crypto project to buy now, raising $27.4 million from 678 million tokens sold at $0.1166 each. Bitcoin Price Action: A Market Shaken But Not Broken Source: Kamran Asghar The volume of liquidated Bitcoin exceeded that of the 2022 selloff, and the Bitcoin crash caused a general panic in the cryptocurrency markets. Having hit its annual peak, analysts identified leveraged trading and profit-taking as the primary reasons behind the sudden fall of Bitcoin. It was subsequently found that the price recovered later to above $114,000, which indicated a high demand. The market strategist Michael van de Poppe emphasized that to sustain the upward trend, it is necessary to ensure that the support is at the 20-week moving average of $113,300 or higher. The analysts estimate that, as long as it does not exceed this point, Bitcoin may hit a high of $125,000 to $150,000 in Q4. Any further fall below $110,000 may, however, unlock additional losses to a possible $98,000. The traders are on their toes as volatility continues in the Bitcoin story of this week.

53117359,605429,1760422107,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53117359.jpeg,4 Altcoin có thể đạt đỉnh mới trong tuần thứ ba của tháng 10 bất chấp thị trường sụp đổ,https://bitcoinist.com/4-altcoins-poised-for-new-highs-october-2025-vn/,"Mặc dù thị trường tiền điện tử toàn cầu vừa trải qua một đợt sụt giảm mạnh, một số altcoin vẫn đang thể hiện sức mạnh đáng kinh ngạc và tiến gần đến mức đỉnh lịch sử (ATH). Nhà đầu tư xem đây là cơ hội để tích lũy trước đợt phục hồi tiếp theo. Dưới đây là 4 altcoin được giới phân tích đánh giá có tiềm năng bứt phá trong tuần tới: USELESS, Mantle, Ethereum và Bitcoin Hyper. USELESS (USELESS): Gần như phục hồi hoàn toàn sau cú sập USELESS là một trong số ít meme coin vẫn duy trì giao dịch gần mức đỉnh bất chấp cú sụt giảm toàn thị trường vào thứ Sáu. Hiện đồng coin này chỉ còn cách mức ATH $0.444 khoảng 19,7% , cho thấy lực mua mạnh mẽ so với phần lớn altcoin khác. Trong 24 giờ qua, USELESS đã tăng 67% , giao dịch quanh $0.368 , đang cố gắng giữ vùng hỗ trợ $0.364. Đường trung bình EMA 50 ngày tiếp tục củng cố xu hướng tăng, mở ra khả năng kiểm định lại đỉnh cũ trong ngắn hạn . Nếu lực bán sớm xuất hiện, USELESS có thể điều chỉnh xuống dưới vùng $0.292, thậm chí về $0.230, làm mất đi tín hiệu tăng hiện tại. Mantle (MNT): Chờ bứt phá để lập đỉnh mới Mantle đang nổi lên như một ứng cử viên sáng giá trong nhóm altcoin tiềm năng có thể lập đỉnh mới. Hiện token này giao dịch quanh $2.15 , cách mức ATH $2.87 khoảng 33% . Tuy mức tăng này khá cao, nhưng đà 32% trong 24 giờ gần nhất cho thấy MNT hoàn toàn có thể đạt được. Nếu giá phá vỡ kháng cự $2.29 và biến nó thành hỗ trợ, MNT có thể tiếp tục tăng hướng về $2.87 , thiết lập kỷ lục mới. Tuy nhiên, nếu thị trường suy yếu hoặc áp lực bán tăng, việc giảm dưới $1.92 có thể đưa giá trở lại vùng $1.77 , làm mất động lực tăng. Ethereum (ETH): Duy trì vị thế dẫn đầu trong nhóm altcoin lớn Ethereum hiện đang giao dịch ở mức $4,162 , ngay dưới vùng kháng cự quan trọng $4,222 . Sau khi bật mạnh từ $3,742 , ETH đã tăng 10% chỉ trong 24 giờ, cho thấy niềm tin nhà đầu tư vẫn còn mạnh mẽ. Theo mô hình Ichimoku Cloud , xu hướng ngắn hạn của ETH vẫn tích cực. Nếu ETH thành công trong việc biến $4,222 thành hỗ trợ, giá có thể tăng lên $4,500 , thậm chí kiểm tra mức kháng cự tiếp theo ở $4,956 . Ngược lại, nếu không thể duy trì vùng này, ETH có nguy cơ điều chỉnh về $4,000 hoặc thấp hơn, xóa đi phần lớn lợi nhuận gần đây. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): Ẩn số mới của mùa altcoin 2025 Bên cạnh ba đồng trên, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) đang thu hút sự chú ý nhờ hướng đi khác biệt — mang lại khả năng mở rộng và tốc độ cao cho mạng Bitcoin . HYPER đang phát triển giải pháp Layer-2 cho Bitcoin, sử dụng Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) để đạt tốc độ giao dịch dưới một giây và gần như không tốn phí. Mô hình này giúp Bitcoin có thể hỗ trợ dApp, DeFi và các meme coin , điều vốn dĩ mạng chính (Layer-1) không làm được. Presale của HYPER đã huy động được hơn 22,7 triệu USD , phản ánh niềm tin của nhà đầu tư vào tầm nhìn dự án. Nhiều chuyên gia tin rằng HYPER có thể trở thành một trong những altcoin dẫn đầu làn sóng tăng giá quý IV/2025 khi công nghệ Layer-2 cho Bitcoin bước vào giai đoạn thương mại hóa. Truy cập Bitcoin Hyper Tổng kết USELESS, Mantle, Ethereum và Bitcoin Hyper đại diện cho bốn hướng phát triển khác nhau trong thế giới altcoin — từ meme coin cộng đồng đến nền tảng blockchain cấp doanh nghiệp.

His latest chart outlines a precise technical picture of where XRP currently stands and what it must achieve to re-establish a bullish structure. The analysis illustrates how XRP is trading below a dense cluster of EMAs—specifically the 9, 21, 50, 100, and 200-day indicators—an area that often determines whether momentum favors buyers or sellers. Egrag’s post highlights three significant price reactions along the 200-day EMA where XRP previously found support before rallying. The most recent point, however, shows the token once again hovering near these key averages, signaling a make-or-break zone for short-term direction. His analysis suggests that unless XRP pushes decisively back above this range, the asset could remain under pressure and risk extending its current consolidation phase. #XRP – Moving: WE NEED #XRP To get it's Ass above the EMA's. pic.twitter.com/WqzXmKGk3j — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 12, 2025 Charted Targets and Support Zones The chart presents defined levels to watch both above and below the current trading price. On the upside, XRP must first regain the 2.30 and 2.65 regions before approaching higher objectives near 3.13 and 3.44. These levels mark zones of previous resistance where sellers have historically emerged. Should momentum return and volume increase, a move toward the 3.13 area would represent a significant technical recovery. To the downside, Egrag identifies the 1.76 level as the primary structural support, with the 1.58 region acting as an even deeper cushion if broader weakness persists. These levels coincide with earlier reaction points on the chart where XRP stabilized before prior rallies. The setup essentially outlines a broad trading range, within which XRP’s next move will likely define its direction for the remainder of the year. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Responses Reflect Divided Outlook Responses to Egrag’s post offered differing perspectives. Market observer Vincent warned that the market remains vulnerable to quick retail-driven selloffs, often triggered by impulsive traders reacting to social media posts. He suggested such volatility could prolong XRP’s recovery phase even after brief rallies. Another commenter expressed confidence in the broader upward trend but mentioned that one more downward move may occur before the next significant breakout, referencing a potential “gooseneck” formation seen in prior setups. These reactions illustrate the current division among traders—some cautious about short-term volatility, others optimistic about the medium-term trajectory once XRP clears technical barriers. Technical Implications and Forecast From a technical standpoint, XRP’s failure to close above the 50 and 100-day EMAs could sustain the current neutral-to-bearish tone. However, a sustained breakout above these averages would reassert upward strength and could shift sentiment toward the higher resistance targets marked by Egrag . The EMA cluster effectively serves as a control zone for market structure, and reclaiming it would mark a pivotal signal of renewed momentum.

Our dYdX price prediction for 2025 expects a maximum price of $3.55. In 2030, we expect the dYdX price to touch $29.58. The dYdX exchange captured significant attention last year. The platform aimed to migrate its existing dYdX tokens from Ethereum to this new mainnet. However, in the fall of 2024, the platform disclosed that it was reducing its workforce by 35%. As dYdX’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does dYdX have the potential to hit the $10 mark soon?” or “Will dYdX ever go up?” or “Where will dYdX be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our dYdX price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency dYdX Token dYdX Price $0.377 (+2.3%) Market Cap $413.34 Million Trading Volume $11.92 Million Circulating Supply 787.63 Million dYdX All-time High $4.53 (Mar 08, 2024) All-time Low $0.4954 (Apr 09, 2025) 24-hour high $0.38 24-hour low $0.365 dYdX price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.377 Price Prediction $ 0.471094 (-25.40%) Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Sentiment Bullish Volatility 5.04% Green Days 18/30 (60%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.62838 200-Day SMA $ 0.621281 14-Day RSI 46.8 dYdX price analysis: dYdX faced bullish pressure toward $0.377 TL;DR Breakdown: dYdX price analysis shows that dYdX faced buying pressure toward $0.377 Resistance for dYdX is at $0.4108 Support for dYdX/USD is at $0.2921 The dYdX price analysis for 14 October confirms that dYdX faced a surge as buyers gained confidence. Currently, buyers are dominating, resulting in an upward push toward $0.377. dYdX price analysis 1-day chart: dYdX price surges toward $0.377 An analysis of the daily dYdX price chart shows the token faced buying pressure after the price made a surge above immediate Fib levels. As a result, buyers are now aiming for a hold above $0.377 mark. The 24-hour volume surged to $12.2 million, showing a surge in interest in trading today. dYdX is trading at $0.377, surging by over 2.3% in the last 24 hours. dydX /USDT price chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level but trades around 30, hinting that sellers are controlling momentum. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. dYdX/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction The 4-hour dYdX price chart suggests that bulls strengthen their position as they aim for a hold of the price above the EMA trend lines. Currently, buyers are holding the price around the EMA20 trend line. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a bearish region at 0.93, showing that short-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate a downward trend. However, the MACD trend line has formed green candles above the signal line, and the indicator aims for a positive momentum, strengthening long-position holders’ confidence. dYdX technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.629506 BUY SMA 5 $ 0.626593 BUY SMA 10 $ 0.623829 BUY SMA 21 $ 0.632192 BUY SMA 50 $ 0.62838 BUY SMA 100 $ 0.614458 BUY SMA 200 $ 0.621281 BUY Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.619515 BUY EMA 5 $ 0.619828 BUY EMA 10 $ 0.623568 BUY EMA 21 $ 0.629308 BUY EMA 50 $ 0.622148 BUY EMA 100 $ 0.622503 BUY EMA 200 $ 0.709744 SELL What to expect from dYdX price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms that dYdX is attempting a dip below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing an upside recovery rally in the coming hours. If dYdX’s price holds momentum above $0.4108, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.6408. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the dYdX price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.2921, beginning a bearish trend to $0.2180. Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX up today? The overall dydx market sentiment is bullish as buyers strongly defended support channels. This has resulted in a strong buying pressure. Will dYdX Recover? If buyers hold above $0.4 level strongly, we might see a strong recovery in the coming hours. What is the dYdX price prediction for 2025? In 2025, dYdX is predicted to reach a minimum level of $3.86. Traders and investors can expect a maximum level of $4.55 and an average price of $3.96 if the bulls show up. Will dYdX reach $10? Depending on market sentiment, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future. It is advised to seek independent professional consultation and investment advice from experts before investing in the crypto market, which has high price volatility. Recent news/opinion on dYdX dYdX has updated its 2025 roadmap, outlining plans to launch a Telegram trading integration as the platform faces declining earnings. According to the roadmap, dYdX plans to roll out a series of software upgrades that include a partner fee share, scale and TWAP orders and designated proposers, targeting the reduction of end-to-end trading latency. dYdX price prediction October 2025 September was a bearish month for dYdX as the altcoin dropped toward $0.55. dYdX’s price might attempt to surge toward $0.75 from its recent low and be pushed further, at least $0.9, if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection by the bearish side, leading to a consolidation around $0.45. dYdX price prediction Minimum price Average price Maximum price dYdX price prediction October 2025 $0.45 $0.75 $0.9 dYdX price prediction 2025 The price of 1 dYdX is expected to reach a minimum level of $0.4 by the end of 2025.

Traders can expect an average price of $6.11 throughout 2026. If the market stays positive, we expect the dYdX price to trade well above $5 by 2027. However, the future market potential for dYdX entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment in long-term holding. dYdX historical price sentiment dydx price history: CoinStats dYdX price started trading in December 2023, hovering below $3.5. In January 2024, the price of dYdX faced a decline as it recorded a low of $2.4. However, in March, the dYdX surged exponentially and touched a high near $4.3. After that, dYdX initiated its bearish rally and hovered around $1 till November. However, dYdX soon recovered following Trump’s victory in the elections, skyrocketing toward $2.6 in December of 2024. Since then, dYdX has been declining and is consolidating below the $1 mark. By the end of April, dYdX price surged toward $0.68. In May, dYdX price surged toward $0.76 but it later declined toward $0.5 in early June. By the end of June, dYdX had declined toward $0.41. In July, the token surged toward $0.7 but failed to maintain buying demand and dropped below $0.6. In August, dYdX again surged toward $0.76 but declined later toward $0.6. By the end of September, dYdX price declined toward the low of $0.55.",Crypto Price Predictions|dYDX,EN,0,0,TRADING|DYDX|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BUSINESS|WLD|ALTCOIN|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-14 06:49:30

Secure real-world yields in 4 easy steps If the mechanics of mortgage debt investment leave you a little confused, you don’t need to worry. CoinLander makes the whole investment process simple, transparent, and fully automated. Step 1: Choose from real estate-backed investment pools with clear details on potential returns, risk, and duration.

Vitalik Buterin Joins!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/a-surprise-ethereum-eth-move-comes-from-a-country-that-surprised-with-its-bitcoin-assets-vitalik-buterin-joins/,"A new move came from Bhutan, the South Asian country that stands out with its support for Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies. Bhutan, which has been quietly making moves into cryptocurrency, recently moved its national ID system to Ethereum. Accordingly, Bhutan is migrating its self-sovereign identity (SSI) system, covering approximately 800,000 people, from its previous base, Polygon (POL), to the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain. The technical integration with Ethereum has been completed, and the full migration of all credentials is scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of next year. While Bhutan is the third country to implement a blockchain-based national ID system, currently only a few countries, such as Brazil and Vietnam, have partially adopted similar systems. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and ETH Foundation President Aya Miyaguchi attended the launch ceremony. Miyaguchi stated that this is the world's first national-level Ethereum identity integration. “The country's commitment to granting its citizens a self-governing identity is very impressive. This integration is a world-first initiative and a step toward an open and secure digital future. This move represents not only a national achievement but also a global step toward a more open and secure digital future in the long term,” said Aya Miyaguchi. Bhutan has been running its ID system on Polygon since August 2024, and on Hyperledger Indy before that. *This is not investment advice.

The drop of the market’s Fear Index to 34 earlier in the week – its lowest level since May – has analysts turning their focus to Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE as the top altcoins to buy during market fear heading in to Q4 2025. Although the sentiment remains a tad sceptical, history has revealed that periods of fear often present the best accumulation opportunities. Ethereum ETF Inflows Defy Market Volatility Ethereum is garnering significant institutional interest as spot ETF products are outperforming expectations. The ETF for the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) recently ended trading at $30.20, with total inflows of $621 million in early October, more than double all of last month. After dipping towards $3400 last week because of global macro tensions, the price of ETH stabilised above the $4000 mark. According to analysts, Ether remains strong due to accumulation from the ETF-driven ETH future, while other altcoins face liquidation. In the short duration, ETH is expected to rally towards $4280 on continued buying, a push towards $4600-$4800 is expected if the markets stabilize and BTC reclaim support above $120K. Cardano (ADA): Whale Accumulation Amid Market Fear Cardano (ADA) is among the most bought digital assets during the latest correction. In the last week, large holders of ADA have added over 70 million ADA, indicating strong confidence despite weakness. Cardano Price Chart: CoinMarketCap ADA has been changing hands at the $0.84 to $0.86 range at the moment. If market sentiment improves, analysts predict the price could rise towards the $0.93 to $1.12 range at some point in October. Despite the selloff, the Hydra scaling upgrade has garnered institutional interest as forecasts expect monthly gains of 14 to 18% when conditions improve. Whale operations activity and steady developer progress show that ADA continues to remain one of the best altcoins to buy in fear, especially for long-term investors betting on network growth. XRP: ETF Anticipation and Institutional Rotation XRP is staying over the $2.70–2.80 support zone due to heavy selling pressure. Experts predict significant fluctuations in XRP as many firms will be making their spot ETF decisions after October 18 and before October 25, 2025. Major firms like Grayscale, Franklin Templeton and WisdomTree have made applications. Meanwhile, JPMorgan estimates inflows for the ETF to be around $8-$20 billion during the first year on approval. XRP is currently in the $2.72 to $3.04 range, but it may reach $4.00 to $4.50 in November following the approval of ETFs. Data on the blockchain shows that whale accumulation has stabilised. Thus, whales are ready for post-ETF rally making XRP one of the best altcoins to buy. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Verified and Rising During Market Fear While established assets like Ethereum, ADA, and XRP dominate institutional coverage, analysts are also flagging MAGACOIN FINANCE as an emerging high-ROI altcoin that has benefited from early accumulation during the downturn. Analysts note that MAGACOIN FINANCE’s scarcity-driven tokenomics, verified ecosystem, and community growth across multi-wallet support (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet) make it a credible diversification choice during high-volatility phases. Many investors view it as a hedge against market fear, with projections indicating a 20x–33x ROI potential post-listing. Thus making it one of the best altcoins to buy during market fear. Conclusion With Ethereum ETF inflows strengthening, Cardano whale accumulation rising, and XRP ETF speculation driving rotation, analysts are beginning to view the current fear-driven environment as a setup for recovery. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a standout high-upside altcoin , offering verifiable audits, community trust, and strong investor momentum — qualities that make it one of the most credible new entrants heading into 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been fully audited and verified by Hashex , confirming its smart-contract integrity and investor protection. Analysts note that few presales offer this level of transparent, certified security backed by Certik review. As sentiment gradually turns from fear to accumulation, the combination of institutional-grade assets like ETH, ADA, and XRP — alongside emerging audited projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE — could define the next major rally cycle.

This reverse takeover transaction will see Brag House acquire House of Doge, a move that has received unanimous approval from both companies’ Boards of Directors, also expected to propel Dogecoin’s mainstream adoption. House Of Doge Shares Now Available With this latest move announced on Monday, Dogecoin is now accessible not only to institutional investors but also to retail investors, allowing them to engage in Dogecoin’s projects and future developments. Individuals now have the opportunity to become shareholders in House of Doge, granting them a stake in the organization’s operations and decision-making processes. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Bottom Around $70,000? Arthur Hayes Says Correction ‘Very Normal’ In A Bull Market In the press release, both entities asserted that the establishment of a 20-year partnership between House of Doge and the Dogecoin Foundation ensures the financial backing necessary for continued development of Dogecoin for years to come. Notably, this comes on the heels of DogeOS smart contract Layer 2, and the impending launch of the Dogecoin Fractal side-chain for the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs), further enhancing Dogecoin’s development and utility. Marco Margiotta, CEO of House of Doge, stated: Since launching House of Doge, we’ve built momentum across every layer of the Dogecoin ecosystem, from establishing the Official Dogecoin Treasury with ZONE to forming alliances with Robinhood for developing new yield-bearing products, as well as our exclusive ETP/ETF partnership with 21Shares. Now, we’re bringing what we’ve built to the public markets. Expert Unveils 4 Bullish Targets For DOGE Earlier this year, House of Doge collaborated with 21Shares, alongside the Dogecoin Foundation to launch Europe’s first Dogecoin ETP. The product’s performance has led to an expanded partnership with 21Shares, including the filing for a US Dogecoin Spot ETF and a Dogecoin 2X Levered ETF, both currently under review. In parallel, House of Doge established the Official Dogecoin Treasury in partnership with CleanCore Solutions (NYSE: ZONE), which was founded on September 5, 2025. This Treasury currently holds over 730 million Dogecoin, serving as a foundational element of House of Doge’s financial infrastructure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Not Over?

Market expert Jonathan Carter noted on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that new bullish targets for Dogecoin have emerged following Friday’s market downturn. He indicated that the memecoin has successfully tested the symmetrical triangle support on its daily chart, signaling a potential rebound. According to Carter’s analysis, consolidation combined with divergence signals suggests a setup for a bounce, with price targets set at $0.25, $0.31, $0.37, and $0.47.

BitMine’s Total Ethereum Holdings Surpass 3 Million NYSE-listed Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum network company BitMine today disclosed that it had bought an additional 202,037 ETH during the crypto market crash over the weekend. Notably, the market crash led to a massive $19 billion in liquidations. According to the announcement, BitMines’ total crypto holdings now comprise of 3,032,188 ETH, bought at an average price of $4,154. In addition, the firm holds 192 BTC, a stake in Eightco Holdings worth $135 million, and unencumbered cash worth $104 million. BitMine continues to reign as the largest publicly-traded Ethereum treasury in the world, and the second-largest overall global crypto treasury, trailing Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which holds digital assets worth a total of more than $73 billion on its balance sheet. BitMine Chairman, Tom Lee, said: The crypto liquidation over the past few days created a price decline in ETH, which BitMine took advantage of. We acquired 202,037 ETH tokens over the past few days pushing our ETH holdings to over 3 million, or 2.5% of the supply of ETH. We are now more than halfway towards our initial pursuit of the ‘alchemy of 5%’ of ETH. BitMine’s share is also experiencing renewed interest as its ETH bet continues to get bigger. Today, the company’s stock, BMNR, is up 3.4%, trading at $54.45 at the time of writing. Recent data from BitMine suggests that, based on its average five-day trading volume, BMNR was the 22nd most traded stock on US-based exchanges, witnessing a trading volume of $3.5 billion on Friday. Opinion Still Split On ETH Utility While 2025 is seeing unprecedented interest in Ethereum as a viable corporate treasury asset, some industry experts are still on the fence. The strongest opposition comes from staunch Bitcoin advocates. For instance, recently Bitcoin maximalist Nick Szabo warned that Ethereum has a “fundamental problem,” adding that most of its use-cases are largely external to ETH’s market value. Similarly, crypto entrepreneur Samson Mow noted that ETH’s price is being “propped up” by $6 billion in Korean retail money. He added that Ethereum’s recent bullish price action is not entirely due to its market demand. That said, some ETH bulls are firmly behind the digital asset. SharpLink CEO Joseph Chalom recently remarked that Ethereum is a superior treasury asset compared to BTC. At press time, BTC trades at $4,165, up 1% in the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|bitcoin|BitMine|Bitmine Immersion Technologies|crypto|Crypto Market|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|ETH|ethereum analysis|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-14 07:00:38

Bitpanda will now offer the bank’s EUR CoinVertible (EURCV) and USD CoinVertible (USDCV) directly to retail users across Europe through its platform and DeFi wallet. The move makes Bitpanda the first retail broker in Europe to enable customers to earn yield on the CoinVertible stablecoins. Users will be able to lend and borrow against these assets within supported onchain protocols, such as Morpho and Uniswap. Jean-Marc Stenger, CEO of SG-FORGE, said the collaboration marks a “decisive step forward” in bringing regulated assets into DeFi. The CoinVertible tokens, both compliant with the EU’s MiCA framework, are designed to provide bank-grade stability in blockchain environments that often rely on unregulated alternatives. For Bitpanda, the partnership represents another step toward bridging traditional finance with Web3. Co-CEO Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad said the integration “creates real ways people can benefit from Web3,” pointing to future work around the Vision token and the planned Vision Chain. Since 2024, the two firms have worked to make stablecoins more accessible under European regulation.

Rather than focusing solely on future price projections, the post addressed the importance of structured profit-taking, particularly in light of last week’s market crash. This combination of confidence and caution presents a perspective for experienced holders who are preparing for potential large price movements. $350-$400 XRP isn’t too bad…I still think we see $1000+ Be sure you take profits at all different price points because you never know what happens. Case in point…the huge crash on Friday https://t.co/AA6mcHJk1v — The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) October 12, 2025 High-End Projections with Realistic Interim Expectations RemiReliefX referenced potential future pricing scenarios in which XRP reaches between $350 and $400 , noting that even such significant valuations would not represent the ceiling. The commentator maintained a broader expectation that XRP could ultimately move beyond $1,000 in the long term . These numbers, while ambitious, were delivered with an underlying message: conviction in an asset’s future does not remove the need for strategic exits along the way. This outlook is consistent with a growing segment of market participants who foresee substantial appreciation over multiple cycles. However, RemiReliefX did not frame these figures as guarantees but rather as possibilities that require patience, awareness, and disciplined portfolio management. The Central Message: Take Profits in Stages A key point made was the necessity of taking profits at different price levels. According to RemiReliefX, waiting for a single peak price without locking in incremental gains can leave investors vulnerable to sudden retracements. This advice was reinforced by referencing the sharp decline observed on Friday, which served as an example of how quickly gains can be reduced if positions remain fully exposed. The reminder was directed especially at those who hold long-term positions and may be reluctant to sell any portion of their holdings. The practical approach outlined encourages securing returns gradually so that a market correction does not erase potential life-changing gains. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Reactions: Practical Concerns and Skepticism Responses from other users reflected a broad range of sentiment. Someone expressed a desire for a more modest outcome, stating that even a $10 to $20 price floor for XRP is enough to impact their lives. Another emphasized that while staged profit-taking is frequently discussed, very few actually act on it, and the recent crash reinforced why action is more important than theory. There were also skeptical voices who challenged the feasibility of the high projections, pointing out that XRP has struggled to sustain even $3 levels this year. This segment of the community questioned how such ambitious targets can be justified when recent price performance has remained constrained. Balancing Conviction with Discipline RemiReliefX’s message ultimately underscores the dual responsibility of long-term holders: maintaining conviction while implementing safeguards. The commentary did not discourage belief in substantial upside but insisted that belief should not override strategy. By promoting structured profit-taking, the post acknowledges that volatility is an inherent part of the market and must be navigated with foresight rather than emotion.

It’s the backbone of the DeFi world, a reference layer for many layer-2 and cross-chain projects and it benefits from upgrades. However, at the current level, the prospects of wild gains seem far-fetched. For investors looking for explosive growth, there is a new DeFi project worth watching. Ethereum Price: Why ETH Might Fall Short Of Expectations ETH has strong fundamentals. It’s central to the smart contract ecosystem and it’s continuously evolving. But there are headwinds. Gas fees, scalability bottlenecks and tight competition from newer layer-1 and layer-2 alternatives could constrain explosive growth. Critics will point out that for ETH to hit $50,000, its market cap would have to dwarf everything else in crypto and it would need to absorb massive capital flows from traditional finance. Without that kind of tidal wave, to push past even $20,000 will be a heroic feat. If you’re looking for gigantic upside in a shorter time frame, that’s where newer projects start to look more tempting. Remittix: The Disruptor You Might Be Overlooking Remittix is not your average vaporware token. It’s positioning itself as a cross-chain PayFi solution that allows users to send crypto directly into real bank accounts across 30+ countries. The developer team is hyping wallet beta launches, live FX conversions, referral income, real use for freelancers and merchants and central exchange listings in the pipeline. Early buyers are already shouting on social media about being up multiples. Some analysts are even dubbing Remittix “XRP 2.0.” Its presale has pulled in over $27.4 million with 679+ million tokens sold. There are also reports that BitMart and LBank will be among the first exchanges to list it. When compared to established coins, Remittix argues it has sharper utility for everyday payments, smoother UX and flexibility across chains. If they deliver, the gain potential is far higher than with ETH.

In a recent interview with CNBC, JPMorgan’s Scott Lucas has reconfirmed that the bank will allow clients to trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. That won’t happen now – the company is still exploring how crypto integrates into its broader markets strategy. Lucas described JPMorgan’s position as an ‘and’ strategy, meaning the firm will focus on balancing existing financial infrastructure with emerging blockchain opportunities. On trading crypto, Lucas stated: Jamie [Dimon] was pretty clear during investor day [….] custody is not on the table at the moment. —Scott Lucas, CNBC Interview While JPMorgan will not offer custody services now, the firm has been experimenting with deposit tokens and stablecoins. He also highlighted JPMorgan’s deposit token prototype, JPMD , which is designed to enable real-time, 24/7 cross-border settlements, serve as on-chain collateral, and offer seamless integration with existing deposit systems. He also added that trading clients would also have the option of using stablecoins for transactions and exploring new blockchain-based financial workflows. Lucas’s interview is a clear signal that JPMorgan wants to bridge traditional financial markets with blockchain infrastructure. Earlier this month, its research division said Bitcoin may be undervalued compared to gold and that the Bitcoin-to-gold volatility ratio has fallen below 2.0, improving its risk-adjusted appeal. Analysts projected that $BTC could reach $165K, roughly 39% above current levels if the ‘debasement trade’ continues. Earlier this year, JPMorgan considered a policy to lend clients against Bitcoin and crypto holdings , which would make it the first bank to accept crypto as loan collateral. With JPMorgan doubling down on Bitcoin trading and blockchain innovation, a new wave of institutional momentum is taking shape. And it could push top altcoins farther than ever before. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a Layer 2 scalability solution for Bitcoin, is ready to capture the momentum that Wall Street is finally embracing. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): The Altcoin Powering Bitcoin’s Fastest & Most Scalable Layer-2 Despite being the crypto that started it all, Bitcoin’s aging infrastructure suffers from poor speed (max 7 transactions per second), lack of compatibility for dApps and smart contracts, and high transaction costs. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to address these issues with its next-generation Layer 2 network, designed to be both fast and scalable. Integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) , it takes transaction speed to a few seconds (compared to a few minutes or hours). The secret potion behind Bitcoin Hyper’s operations is its Canonical Bridge , which lets deposit $BTC and mint an equivalent amount on the L2 network as wrapped $BTC. You’ll be able to use it on the upcoming dApps on the L2, with very low transaction fees and minimal latency. At the heart of this booming ecosystem lies $HYPER, the network’s native token. You can use $HYPER as a transaction fuel, staking asset, governance token, and priority access key to token launches, new dApps, and ecosystem rewards built on Bitcoin Hyper. Read about Bitcoin Hyper in our detailed guide here. Bitcoin Hyper’s presale has been a soaring success, with the project having already raised $23.5M so far. The price of one token today is $0.013115, and the staking rewards are at a juicy 50%. If our $HYPER price predictions materialize , one token could increase to $0.20 by 2026. That’s a 1,425% return from today’s price, and if the L2 manages to bring dApps and smart contracts to Bitcoin, we could see significant user adoption for $HYPER. A few weeks ago, several whales bought over $1M worth of Bitcoin Hyper, taking the presale to above $21M. One worth $379.9K happened just ten days ago. Don’t miss out: grab Your $HYPER today before it potentially explodes!",Crypto News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-14 07:14:12

It was last down nearly 3% to $111,856. The broader crypto market fell sharply, with total market cap sliding 3.2% to $3.8 trillion. Ethereum dropped 4% to $4,012, BNB plunged 10% to $1,205 and XRP slipped 5.5% to $2.47. Markets approach Powell’s speech amid sharp swings, fueled by renewed US-China trade tensions and steep declines in digital asset prices. Powell is scheduled to speak on the economic outlook and monetary policy at the NABE Annual Meeting in Philadelphia on Tuesday. Analysts expect his tone to sway sentiment on rate cuts and whether the crypto descent deepens or stabilizes. Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech tomorrow could trigger a crypto market crash as traders await guidance on interest rates and economic policy amid U.S.-China trade tensions. #CryptoMarket #Powell #FederalReserve https://t.co/uYtW13jgYK — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 13, 2025 Political Uncertainty Fuels Investor Anxiety Across Risk Assets Last week, President Donald Trump escalated tensions by announcing plans to impose 100% tariff on all Chinese goods imported to the US starting Nov. 1. The move triggered massive market turmoil, wiping more than $125b from global crypto valuations in hours. Markets found some footing on Monday after Trump softened his tone on China. Still, the shock left traders on edge and primed for further swings. Lukman Otunuga, senior market analyst at FXTM, said the reaction “underscores just how sensitive investors remain to political risk and trade uncertainty.” He added that the US–China tensions and a dragging government shutdown could keep markets jittery. Large Liquidations Expose Fragile Leverage But Highlight Strong Projects Kevin Lee, chief business officer at Gate, expects downward pressure to persist near term as geopolitical risks and tariffs weigh on sentiment. He sees the Fed’s expected rate cut on Oct. 28–29 as a possible turning point to ease conditions for risk assets. Yannik Schrade, CEO of Arcium, argued that large liquidations like the weekend’s $19b wipeout act as a market filter, exposing weaker leveraged positions while drawing focus to utility-driven projects. He cited Zcash’s relative resilience and Umbra’s $155m raise in confidential DeFi infrastructure as signs of focus amid volatility. Attention now turns to Powell, whose remarks could decide whether crypto finds relief or slides deeper into decline.

Key Takeaways: California’s new law protects unclaimed crypto from forced liquidation, keeping assets in their original form under state custody. Senate Bill 822 expands the state’s Unclaimed Property Law to cover digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Custodians must notify owners before reporting assets as unclaimed and transfer the exact crypto type. Governor Gavin Newsom signed Senate Bill 822 into law over the weekend, ensuring that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto assets remain in their original form when transferred to state custody under the state’s Unclaimed Property Law (UPL). The bill, authored by Senator Josh Becker (D-Menlo Park), passed both chambers unanimously in September before receiving the governor’s approval on Saturday. California Expands Unclaimed Property Law to Cover Dormant Crypto Assets The law updates California’s decades-old UPL, which governs how the state handles dormant financial assets such as abandoned bank accounts, securities, and insurance proceeds. Under the new provisions, digital financial assets are now officially classified as intangible property subject to the same framework, addressing a long-standing legal gap over how to treat inactive crypto holdings. The change applies to accounts that remain untouched for at least three years following failed contact attempts. Previously, ambiguity around digital assets had left custodians and exchanges uncertain about their responsibilities and reporting procedures. Under SB 822, digital asset custodians are required to notify apparent owners between six and twelve months before assets are reported as unclaimed. Notifications must follow a standardized form approved by the Controller’s Office, allowing users to reclaim or reactivate their holdings before state intervention. California just passed a bill to seize #Bitcoin left idle on exchanges. After 3 years of inactivity, assets can be taken by the state under 'Unclaimed Property' laws. Bill now heads to the Senate. pic.twitter.com/nl1pQPWkvW — TFTC (@TFTC21) June 4, 2025 Once the escheatment process begins, holders must transfer the exact type and amount of the asset, along with the relevant private keys, to a state-approved custodian within 30 days. These custodians must hold valid licenses issued by the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. The Controller may later convert unclaimed crypto to fiat after 18 to 20 months, with rightful owners still entitled to reclaim their assets or equivalent sale proceeds. Alongside SB 822, Governor Newsom also signed Senate Bill 243, which establishes the nation’s first legal guardrails for AI “companion” chatbots. Michigan Lawmakers Advance Bitcoin Bill Last month, Michigan lawmakers revived House Bill 4087 , which would let the state allocate up to 10% of funds to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, potentially joining Texas, Arizona, and New Hampshire in sovereign crypto initiatives. The move positions Michigan alongside a growing list of states eyeing Bitcoin as a hedge and strategic reserve asset, joining early movers like Texas, New Hampshire, and Arizona. International momentum is building as well. The Philippines recently introduced a bill to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve with a 20-year lockup period. Meanwhile, El Salvador, the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender , is reportedly adding gold to its national reserves. Pakistan has also taken a major policy turn with its plans to establish a government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, announced in May 2025 by Bilal Bin Saqib, head of the Pakistan Crypto Council.

Bloomberg reported earlier Tuesday that China sanctioned U.S. units of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean in a move that reignited fears that the trade conflict with Washington could spiral, just days after both sides signaled restraint. Stocks in Asia tumbled, equity futures in the U.S. and Europe followed, and crypto traders were again forced to de-risk after a brief weekend bounce. Contracts tied to the S&P 500 dropped 0.7%, Nasdaq 100 futures lost 1%, and Japan’s Nikkei fell more than 3%, marking its worst session in nearly two months. The yen reversed losses and strengthened against the dollar. Gold and silver both erased earlier gains in heavy afternoon selling, while 10-year Treasury yields eased to near 4.03% as investors moved to safety. Crypto again tracked risk. Bitcoin fell 3% to $111,869, Ethereum dropped 4% to around $4,000, and BNB slid more than 10% after outperforming last week. XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin all fell between 5% and 6% in the past 24 hours. Total liquidations hit $630 million, with long positions making up two-thirds of the wipeout, according to CoinGlass . The correction extends a volatile stretch that began with U.S. President Donald Trump’s 100% tariff threat on Chinese imports last week — a shock that triggered crypto’s largest-ever liquidation event. Nearly $20 billion in positions were erased across derivatives markets in 24 hours, per Hyperliquid data, before a short-lived rebound over the weekend.

Washington imposed a new wave of trade barriers in the last 48 hours, involving a 100% duty on imported Chinese semiconductors and Chinese-made electric vehicles, along with enhanced export controls on software related to AI and rare earth elements. Beijing quickly struck back, suspending exports of major battery metals and applying licensing regulations to U.S. technology companies based in mainland China. The moves have prompted universal market panic, eradicating more than $9.1 billion in world equity value and catapulting risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, into a tumultuous trajectory. As institutional investors hasten to rebalance portfolios, veteran investors are turning to digital assets that can hedge against rising trade-driven volatility. Most notably, Ripple (XRP), Ethereum (ETH), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are becoming top choices. XRP is continuing to enjoy growing cross-border payment integrations, Ethereum is still the foundation of decentralized apps and institutional DeFi activity, while Mutuum Finance, currently in Phase 6 of its presale, with a whopping 65%+ sold and $17.3 million raised by 17,000 investors, is garnering attention as a new-age hedge against uncertainty. Taken together, the three cryptocurrencies provide a strategic combination of stability, growth, and long-term outlook as the rising China–U.S. trade war drives up trade-driven volatility. XRP Price Prediction: Crucial $2.47 Point Might Determine Next Direction XRP is trading at $2.47 currently, a turning point that will decide its short-term future direction. Sticking with resilience above that point can precipitate a bullish rebound, taking the token potentially into the $3.02–$3.37 area with bulls firmly back in control. A conclusive slide back under $2.47 is likely to induce a retest back to the $1.95 support level prior to a sustainable rebound taking hold. This crossroads is a crucial turning point for investors, with the immediate days ahead potentially holding the key to XRP’s future path to year-end 2025. As investors consider XRP eagerly, they are already turning their attention to nascent potential Mutuum Finance (MUTM) instead, a token that is gathering traction fast in a market characterized by shifting momentum and newcomers to the top. Ethereum Price Forecast: Levels to Trade Amid Trade War Flashpoint Ethereum (ETH) stands at a crossroads with rising China–U.S. trade tensions whetting indecision across world markets. A possible deepening of the current tariff dispute would witness ETH briefly sweeping or backtesting its even lows, a short-term risk-off sentiment signifier, though experts point out that a recovery back above the $3,300 level will confirm the return of bullish sentiment and potentially pave the way to a charge at $4,000 if the markets regain their composure. With traders eagerly awaiting U.S. policy guidance and overall direction across the markets, many investors are also taking a glance across the wider crypto market with a view to spotting potential newcomers that would become top performers as soon as steadying volatility settles the focus firmly in the direction of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Surges in 2025 Mutuum Finance is the buzz these days in the DeFi scene, with its presale achieving 17,000+ investors and securing a tremendous $17.3+ million in funds to-date. Already at Phase 6 and 65% taken during this phase, the token value stands at $0.035 at present, signifying a steady market demand along with rising investors’ confidence. The platform is set to unveil its lending and borrowing protocol . V1 will be launched on the Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025 and will feature integral product construction blocks such as liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be accommodated for borrowing, collateralization, and lending and will be accessible at launch time, providing multi-asset, plug-and-play DeFi accessibility. Institutional and retail consumers will be provided with secure, efficient, and user-friendly decentralized finance products. The China–U.S. trade war just escalated further, U.S. new tariffs and Chinese export bans have wiped out $9.1B in world value. During times of turbulence in markets, investors are flocking to stable cryptos. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is at the forefront with $17.3M generated, 17,000 investors, and 65% Phase 6 sold. DeFi technology and an upcoming Q4 2025 Testnet release provide Mutuum Finance with a top-of-the-line volatility hedge. Get in on the Mutuum Finance presale today, 2025’s top crypto play.

The device integrates GPUs, CPUS, networking, CUDA libraries, and AI software. The new release has been integrated with the GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip. It can deliver up to 1 petaflop of AI performance and 128 GB of unified CPU-GPU memory in a compact desktop form factor. The supercomputer uses ConnectX-7 200 Gb/s networking and NVLink-C2C technology, which provides five times the bandwidth of the fifth-generation PCIe. Huang says DGX Spark will democratize AI computing power NVIDIA’s CEO, Jensen Huang, revealed that the DGX Spark returns the firm to its original mission of democratizing AI computing power. “In 2016, we built DGX-1 to give AI researchers their supercomputer. I hand-delivered the first system to Elon at a small startup called OpenAI, and from it came ChatGPT. With DGX Spark, we return to that mission, placing an AI computer in the hands of every developer to ignite the next wave of breakthroughs.” – Jensen Huang , NVIDIA CEO The DGX Spark enables developers to run inference on models with up to 200 billion parameters and fine-tune models of up to 70 billion parameters locally, eliminating the need to rely solely on cloud or data center services. The latest blog revealed that the DGX Spark has been preloaded with the full NVIDIA AI software stack, including CUDA libraries and NIM microservices. The software stack enables immediate deployment of AI workflows, including image generation, vision search, and language model tuning. Early adopters include Anaconda, Google , Hugging Face, Meta, Microsoft, JetBrains, Docker, and LM Studio, who have validated and optimized their tools for Spark. Research institutions, such as NYU’s Global Frontier Lab, have also begun testing the unit. Kyunghyun Cho, professor of computer and data science at NYU, said that the DGX Spark allows them to access petascale computing on a desktop. He added that it enables rapid prototyping and experimentation with advanced AI models, even for privacy-sensitive applications such as healthcare. DGX Spark runs on NVIDIA’s Linux-based DGX OS and is purpose-built for developing and training AI models, rather than consumer applications. Users can also link two Spark systems to support models of up to 405 billion parameters. Huang personally delivered one of the first DGX Spark units to Elon Musk at SpaceX’s Starbase facility in Texas to commemorate the launch, echoing the 2016 delivery of the original DGX-1 to OpenAI. NVIDIA stock jumps 2.88% today following the announcement NVIDIA announced that the DGX Spark will be available for order starting October 15 through NVIDIA’s website and select partner manufacturers, including Acer, ASUS, Dell Technologies, GIGABYTE, HP, Lenovo, and MSI. It will also be available at Micro Center retail outlets in the U.S. and will be made globally available through the AI lab’s distribution network later. 🚨NVIDIA and its partners will start shipping DGX Spark — the world’s smallest AI supercomputer.⁰⁰Early recipients are testing, validating and optimizing their tools, software and models for DGX Spark.

The company recently announced a $100 billion GPU supply agreement with OpenAI and a $6.3 billion deal with CoreWeave. Cryptopolitan reported that the AI chip maker will invest $100 billion into OpenAI to help the AI lab build massive data centers centered on NVIDIA’s processors. The companies revealed that OpenAI will deploy NVIDIA systems that will require 10 gigawatts of power collectively. The gigawatt measure, used more often now to better describe large AI chip clusters, sets the scale of the project. Jensen Huang told CNBC’s Jon Fortt in San Jose, California, that 10 gigawatts equals around 4 to 5 million GPUs. That matches what the AI chip maker expects to ship this year, twice as much as last year. According to Google Finance data, NVIDIA stock was trading at $188.32 at the time of publication, representing a 2.88% increase over the past 24 hours. The stock has also maintained a positive YTD of +40.23%, showing sustained positive investor confidence in the AI chip maker’s performance. Get seen where it counts.

Prices have rebounded since. Despite the sudden sell-off and the subsequent quick recovery, Bitcoin’s market-value-to-realized-value (MVRV) ratio continues to signal a mid-cycle expansion. This essentially means the market remains structurally healthy and well below the overheated phase seen in prior bull runs. Market Still in Expansion Mode According to recent analysis shared by CryptoQuant, the MVRV ratio currently stands near 2.0, which is significantly under the historical overvaluation threshold of 4.0 that previously represented cycle peaks in 2013, 2017, and 2021. By contrast, readings below 1.0 have historically coincided with major accumulation phases such as those in 2015, 2018, and 2020. The current mid-range level implies that most investors are sitting on profits. Despite this, sentiment has not reached euphoric extremes. Supporting the mid-cycle narrative, on-chain metrics reveal that long-term investors are holding steady and avoiding major selling activity. In addition, steady institutional ETF inflows and a notable decline in miner selling pressure align with a maturing but still constructive market phase. In previous instances, each Bitcoin cycle has unfolded in three clear stages – recovery (MVRV 4) – with the current readings closely resembling mid-2020 levels before the last major breakout. These factors point toward a period of structural consolidation rather than the formation of a macro top. Supply Shock Brewing At the same time, Bitcoin’s exchange reserves have dropped to their lowest level in more than a decade. Data shows that the total Bitcoin held on centralized exchanges has fallen to approximately 2.4 million BTC, down from more than 3.5 million in 2020. This represents one of the longest and most consistent outflow trends in the flagship crypto asset’s history. Experts believe that the continued decline in exchange-held coins reduces immediate selling pressure and potentially implies that investors are increasingly transferring their holdings to cold wallets and institutional custody solutions. Historically, exchange reserves rose sharply between 2013 and 2018 as trading activity expanded with the growth of centralized platforms. However, since 2020, reserves have steadily decreased in tandem with rising institutional adoption, the launch of spot ETFs, and a stronger preference for long-term storage. On-chain metrics indicate that “smart money” continues to accumulate, while large-scale withdrawals suggest increasing confidence in BTC’s long-term value. This sustained decline is similar to patterns observed before major bull runs in 2020 and 2021.

His comment referred to the asset’s long-term price movement, which has followed clear and repeatable technical patterns. Clear Structure in Multi-Year Chart Brandt pointed to a symmetrical triangle formation between 2014 and 2017. XRP broke out of that pattern in late 2017, which led to a price rally that peaked above $2. After this move, the asset entered a new phase of sideways movement from 2018 to mid-2025, forming what appears to be an ascending wedge. As a student of classical charting principles and history, has there ever been a purer long-term chart? $XRP pic.twitter.com/rbA2Mp955A — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) October 13, 2025 Notably, that structure also broke to the upside, taking XRP to a new all-time high of $3.65. At the moment, the price is trading just under the 200-week moving average, near $2.83. This level is acting as resistance while the price consolidates. Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto said the chart remains one of the strongest in the space. “This has been my bias for a while and nothing has changed in the last 48 hours,” they wrote. They expect XRP to move into double-digit territory before the current cycle ends. A similar view came from EtherNasyonaL, who compared today’s structure with past cycles. In both cases, XRP broke a long-standing resistance and returned to retest an earlier support area. “Don’t underestimate XRP,” the analyst said, pointing to a consistent upward trend over time. Source: EtherNasyonaL/X Trading Range and Key Liquidity Zones XRP was priced at $2.45 at press time, down 6% in the past 24 hours and 18% over the last week. Despite this, volume data shows strong interest around $2.50, which is now a key price level. Cryptoinsightuk shared liquidity charts for XRP. The hourly chart shows heavy buy orders near $2.20–$2.40 and sell pressure around $2.60–$2.80.

BNB Has Been Rising Since Parallel Channel Breakout Much like the rest of the cryptocurrency sector, BNB suffered a price crash on Friday, but while the rest of the market has been unable to make a full recovery, the altcoin has already retraced to the pre-crash level, and surpassed it. Related Reading: Bitcoin Direction Still Unclear: Analyst Says Watch These Key Charts Earlier on Monday, the coin even managed to set a new all-time high (ATH) above $1,370. Thus, it would appear that unlike Bitcoin, the coin’s ATH exploration period hasn’t cooled off yet. And it’s possible that BNB will only climb further in the near future, if the technical analysis (TA) pattern shared by analyst Ali Martinez in an X post is anything to go by. The pattern in question is a Parallel Channel, which forms whenever an asset’s price observes consolidation between two parallel trendlines. The upper level of the pattern acts as a resistance barrier, while the lower one provides support. Together, they keep the price locked inside the channel. When one of these levels fails to hold, the asset can witness a continuation of trend in that direction. A surge above the resistance line is naturally a bullish signal, while a fall under the support a bearish one. The 3-day price of BNB was stuck inside a Parallel Channel for a few years before it found a breakout earlier this year, as the chart shared by Martinez shows. Since the breakout, BNB has been exploring new highs, implying the bullish effect of the Parallel Channel resistance break may be in effect. From the graph, it’s apparent that the coin has so far climbed up half as much distance as the width of the channel. Generally, Parallel Channel breakouts are considered to be of the same length as the width of the channel. If the cryptocurrency is following this pattern, then it may be targeting the level a full height above the channel. “It looks like BNB wants to push toward $2,400!” notes the analyst. A surge to this target of $2,400 from the current level would imply an increase of almost 89% for the coin. It now remains to be seen whether the asset will follow this path suggested by the Parallel Channel. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Selling: $50 Million Exiting Wallets Every Day In another X post, Martinez has pointed out that the 1-day price of Bitcoin has also been traveling inside a Parallel Channel for the last few months. As displayed in the chart, Bitcoin is trading near the midline of the Parallel Channel after its plunge. It will now be interesting to see whether it continues its decline to the $100,000 lower level or not. BNB Price At the time of writing, BNB is trading around $1,270, up 4% over the last week.

53121384,605323,1760428850,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53121384.jpeg,Hyperliquid Unveils HIP-3 Upgrade: Users Can Now Launch Custom Perpetual Futures Exchanges,https://bitcoinist.com/hyperliquid-unveils-hip-3-upgrade-custom-perpetual/,"Hyperliquid (HYPE), a Layer-1 platform that has made notable strides in the cryptocurrency sector this year, has announced its latest upgrade, HIP-3. This upgrade marks a significant step toward decentralizing the perpetual futures listing process, allowing users and developers to deploy their own perpetual futures exchanges on the platform. What To Expect From Hyperliquid’s Latest Upgrade The Hyperliquid protocol will facilitate builder-deployed perpetuals (HIP-3), with a minimum viable product (MVP) of this feature currently active on the testnet. Builder-deployed perpetuals will share many characteristics with HyperCore, the blockchain-based engine of Hyperliquid’s trading platform, including spot deployments and the allocation of new, high-performance on-chain order books. In terms of deployment logistics, gas fees in HYPE will be determined through a Dutch auction conducted every 31 hours, with a single auction covering all HIP-3 perpetual decentralized exchanges (DEXs). For the mainnet, the staking requirement is set at 500,000 HYPE, although this requirement is anticipated to decrease as the infrastructure matures. Any amount staked above the current requirement can be withdrawn. Importantly, the staking requirement will be upheld for 30 days even after all of a deployer’s perpetual markets have been halted. Any deployer meeting the staking criterion can establish one perpetual DEX , with each DEX featuring independent margin, order books, and deployer settings. Deployers can use any quote asset as collateral for a DEX. However, assets that fail to satisfy the permissionless quote asset criteria will lose their status based on an on-chain validator vote, which would also disable any perpetual DEXs utilizing that asset as collateral. Future Enhancements In terms of asset deployment, the first three assets introduced in any perpetual DEX will not require participation in the auction process. Any additional assets will go through a Dutch auction with the same hyperparameters as the HIP-1 auction . This Hyperliquid’s HIP-3 auction for additional perpetuals will be shared across all DEXs. Future enhancements are planned to improve the user experience regarding the reservation of assets for time-sensitive deployments. Currently, only isolated margin mode is required, while cross-margin support is projected for a future upgrade. Markets under HIP-3 will incorporate established sources of trading fee discounts, including staking discounts, referral rewards, and aligned collateral discounts. From the deployer’s perspective, the fee share is fixed at 50%. For users, fees will be double the usual rates applied to validator-operated perpetual markets , although the protocol will collect the same fee regardless of whether the trade occurs on an HIP-3 or a validator-operated platform. At the time of writing, the platform’s native token, HYPE, is trading at around $39.84. This represents a significant 17% drop over the past week, in line with the wider crypto market crash on Friday, when the token fell as low as $20.8.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-says-xrp-game-over-heres-the-significance/,"Crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto has highlighted a major development for XRP, indicating over 1.5 billion XRP in payments within just 24 hours. He described this as a major indicator of renewed network momentum, suggesting that large-scale institutional activity is likely driving the surge. According to Steph, the sudden rise in transaction volume cannot be explained by retail movement alone, indicating that bigger players are once again using XRP for settlement and cross-border transactions through RippleNet and related payment systems. He noted that such spikes in payment activity demonstrate XRP’s growing adoption in real-world use cases, particularly in institutional payment corridors. This development, he said, reinforces XRP’s strength as a digital asset designed for liquidity and large-scale financial operations. #XRP Game Over… pic.twitter.com/Y7wizo9QQ9 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 12, 2025 Market Structure and Technical Positioning Steph provided detailed insight into XRP’s technical outlook, noting that while the asset recently pulled back slightly from the $3.09 mark, it remains above crucial support levels. He explained that XRP’s current trading position above its key 200-day moving averages—$2.62 for the EMA and $2.56 for the SMA—signals that it is in a broader uptrend. Despite short-term consolidation, he emphasized that XRP’s technical foundation remains solid. He also observed that the $2.70 range continues to serve as a strong support zone, where XRP has repeatedly rebounded in recent weeks. This consistency, combined with surging payment volume, supports the argument that XRP could be gearing up for another move higher. Steph compared this setup to earlier market phases that preceded major rallies, suggesting the potential for a breakout if on-chain activity remains high. Institutional Momentum and Broader Sentiment According to Steph, the sharp increase in XRP payments aligns with growing institutional participation in the market. Large transactions of this magnitude typically come from financial institutions leveraging XRP for settlements or liquidity management He linked this renewed activity to broader market optimism, noting that Bitcoin’s climb near its all-time high of $122,000 and improving sentiment in the crypto sector have created favorable conditions for assets like XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Steph believes that Q4 has entered a more bullish phase, with rising confidence across digital markets. He also mentioned ongoing ETF filings for XRP , interpreting them as signs of institutional commitment to the asset’s long-term potential. Outlook for XRP’s Next Move Steph emphasized that XRP’s ability to stay above the $3 mark will be critical to sustaining its upward trend. Should payment activity remain consistent and technical indicators hold firm, he expects XRP to test the $3.30 resistance level soon. Breaking through that threshold could open the door to new all-time highs before the end of the quarter. He concluded by stating that XRP is in a strong market position, both technically and fundamentally. The surge in daily transactions highlights the increasing role of institutional players and suggests the market may be preparing for another phase of expansion.

At this point, the shutdown has delayed the approval of altcoin ETFs like XRP and Solana (SOL), which are awaiting approval from the SEC. Apart from this, it also postponed the approval process of cryptocurrency bills in the USA. Investment bank TD Cowen has indicated that the US cryptocurrency bill could be delayed beyond the November 2026 elections. US investment bank TD Cowen has predicted that the passage of a major cryptocurrency market structure bill could be delayed until after the November 2026 midterm elections, The Block reported. The bank said Republicans and Democrats were negotiating a bill on how the cryptocurrency sector should be regulated, but things were not going well. Negotiations on the bill, known as the CLARITY Act, have reportedly stalled due to behind-the-scenes disagreements between the Democratic and Republican parties. On this point, TD Cowen stated that it was not impossible for progress to be made in the next 12 months, but that there were more reasons to delay the bill at present than to accelerate it. “We are not suggesting there are no avenues for action in the next 12 months. Our argument is that there are more reasons for senators to delay action than to act quickly.” The bank said the biggest obstacle to the legislation is Democrats' demand to ban senior government officials, including President Donald Trump, and their families from owning crypto companies. The CLARITY Act aims to establish a regulatory framework for the crypto industry by defining the roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in the cryptocurrency sector. A provision added to the bill also defines secondary assets. This provision will clarify which digital assets and cryptocurrencies are and are not considered securities. CLARITY covers much more comprehensive cryptocurrency regulations, unlike GENIUS, which covers a more limited topic such as stablecoins. The US House of Representatives approved the cryptocurrency regulation bill, called the CLARITY Act, in July 2025. *This is not investment advice.

Analysts expect a rebound across the top altcoins, with MAGACOIN FINANCE also drawing attention as traders seek fresh opportunities after the recent pullback. Solana Price Prediction: Can SOL Hold the $217 Level? Solana price sits near $217, a key level that traders are watching closely. The coin has pulled back after recent gains but remains inside its longer-term rising structure. A clean reaction above $217 could set up a return toward $230–$235, which has acted as a ceiling for weeks. Analysts note that defending this area keeps Solana’s broader uptrend alive. If buyers take control near this level, the next wave higher could reach $240 and possibly $250 as confidence returns to the market. However, if price breaks below $210, a dip toward $200 is still possible before the next attempt higher. The current consolidation shows that traders are cautious but not ready to abandon the bullish setup yet. Overall, Solana price prediction remains optimistic as long as it stays above $210–$217. The coin continues to attract participants looking for medium-term upside if Bitcoin begins to rise again. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Bulls Eye $120K Recovery Bitcoin price dropped from its $126,000 high and briefly tested the $102,000 zone. Analysts say this move is part of a normal reset after the market’s strong rally. Data from Glassnode shows that a large number of traders accumulated Bitcoin around $117,000–$119,000, suggesting demand remains healthy. Experts like Stockmoney Lizards and Ted Pillows believe that after this “flush,” Bitcoin will likely turn higher again. If Bitcoin holds above $118,000, the next recovery phase could push prices back toward $125,000–$130,000. The recent drop in futures open interest by $4.1 billion also indicates that leveraged positions are cooling off, which often clears the path for steadier price growth. For now, the Bitcoin price prediction favors a recovery once short-term pressure eases. Many traders view this dip as a setup for a stronger fourth-quarter rally. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The New Altcoin to Watch As Solana and Bitcoin draw attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE is fast becoming a name to watch. Analysts say it could see the strongest price action once Bitcoin rebounds, which makes it one of the best crypto presales right now. Because it’s newer and has a low market cap, this altcoin is seen as more agile and better positioned to react when major coins start moving. If Bitcoin gains 20%, MAGACOIN FINANCE could rise between 200% and 2,000%, according to early projections. Those who missed the Dogecoin run in 2021 are watching this project closely as a new opportunity in the market. MAGACOIN FINANCE is audited by CertiK and HashEx, adding credibility and user confidence to its ecosystem. What Traders Should Do Now Traders watching Solana and Bitcoin should keep an eye on the $217 and $118K zones. A recovery from these levels could trigger a wider market rally. For those looking for early movers, MAGACOIN FINANCE may offer a new entry point before broader adoption begins.

Current as of 14 Oct 2025. What the law does Holders must remit unclaimed crypto to the State Controller or a designated custodian in kind. Default custody is the native asset, not cash. The Controller can convert later under defined conditions. Qualified custodians must meet security, segregation, and audit standards. Process and timelines Before escheat, holders must attempt owner contact and provide notice within the statutory window. After transfer, owners reclaim the same asset type rather than sale proceeds. Exchanges and custodians face reporting, recordkeeping, and asset-mapping requirements. Market context California is the first state to codify explicit in-kind treatment for unclaimed crypto. The rule reduces involuntary sell pressure during escheat events, clarifies obligations for platforms with dormant accounts, and sets a template other states can adopt or modify.",,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-10-14 08:16:40
