Traders and investors are carefully observing XRP’s momentum, but the search for the next breakout candidate does not end there. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is slowly gaining attention as a showstopper set to replicate the same kind of explosive growth. Already in Phase 6 of its presale and having sold out over 65%, MUTM is more than a speculation coin, it’s a carefully crafted DeFi ecosystem that incorporates innovative functionality, community-governance, and a roadmap structured for long-term growth. With momentum in its current presale and increasing investor curiosity, MUTM may be the altcoin to focus on alongside Ripple as both tokens set their sight on hefty gains in 2025. Ripple Price Prediction: Ready to Record a Sudden Jump to $5 XRP is now trading near the $2.70 support level, a region it has tested several times, showing strength and continued investor demand. So long as this support level remains, there may be continued momentum for a swift push toward the $5 mark, spurred by renewed buying demand and favorable sentiment. Even if the overall market gets volatile, XRP’s finding a floor above $2.70, and $2.60 as the next important safety net, indicates that there’s still a clear direction ahead for bulls. As market players hold out for this possible breakout, eyes are looking to emerging altcoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which has been making a lot of noise as investors are looking for the next high-priority project. Mutuum Finance Presale Buzz Builds Up Steam Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining investor attention this week following tremendous speed in Phase 6 of presale. The tokens are currently valued at $0.035, a 16.17% increment from the previous round. Over 16,910 investors have already purchased generating over $17.25 million, healthfully depicting an emerging market confidence in the bright DeFi future of Mutuum Finance. With over 65% sold in Phase 6, early investors are acquiring their buy-ins before the next increment. Even collateral management is optimized, for eventual ultimate power-to-borrow by mutual complementing leveraging off the related holdings, with the ultimate bankruptcy risk elimination and overall platform health. Real-Time Data via Chainlink Oracles To achieve proper, stable prices and risk valuation, Mutuum Finance utilizes Chainlink oracles for feeds of USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, sophisticated data feeds, and decentralized exchange TWAPS also ensure that valuation derived from a protocol remains accurate, no matter record-record volatility or illiquidity. Mutuum’s lending and borrowing protocol has a launch impending. Version 1 (V1) of it will debut on Sepolia Testnet in Q4, 2025, and it will have key components which are as follows: liquidity pools,mtTokens,debt tokens, liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be provided at the launch for collaterals, lending, and borrowing and will give the users the efficient, scalable, and secure DeFi. The platform also provides floating-, fixed-, and floating/fixed-degree tools and balances the supply versus the demand for the liquids as well as stabilizes the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance to Blast Off Ripple (XRP) registers resilience near $2.70, predicting a possible jump to $5, but altcoin investors looking for the next alt to have high potential are focusing on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Phase 6 of the presale of MUTM has already generated more than $17.25 million from over 16,910 investors, and 65% of tokens have been sold. Its forthcoming Sepolia Testnet protocol for lending and borrowing, involving liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot, coupled with Chainlink oracle-led pricing and sound risk management, make MUTM a secure, scalable, and efficient DeFi ecosystem. Early investors must invest now to acquire MUTM tokens prior to the presale progressing, and reap huge gains.

Related Reading: ‘BNB Isn’t Crumbling’: CZ Slams Critics Stirring Fear And Doubt The rally comes after a sharp sell-off triggered by geopolitical tensions earlier this month, followed by an aggressive rebound fueled by whale accumulation and institutional inflows. According to CoinGlass, daily trading volume jumped 55% to $10.7 billion, while open interest rose 25%, signaling fresh leveraged positions betting on continued upside momentum. BNB’s sharp turnaround mirrors broader market stabilization but with stronger conviction. Traders are now eyeing a move toward $1,450–$1,500, a region that would mark a new all-time high for the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. BNB's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: BNBUSD on Tradingview CZ Attributes BNB Price Rally to Genuine Market Demand Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) weighed in on the rally, emphasizing that BNB’s recent strength comes from organic market demand, not artificial liquidity support. “BNB has no market makers,” he stated, adding that the price recovery reflects the community’s belief, builder activity, and deflationary mechanisms that continue to burn tokens. CZ also praised BNB Chain ecosystem contributors such as Venus and Binance, who “took hundreds of millions out of their own pockets to protect users” during the recent volatility, a move he described as a demonstration of “different value systems.” His comments helped solidify investor sentiment, with analysts noting that CZ’s transparency about internal market structure has reassured traders that BNB’s rally is fundamentally driven rather than speculative. The token’s deflationary model and sustained ecosystem utility continue to underpin long-term confidence. Can BNB Break $1,500 Next? From a technical standpoint, BNB’s breakout above $1,236 resistance has activated bullish momentum, with the RSI hovering near 65, showing strong but not overbought conditions. MACD crossover and robust volume spikes point to further upside potential. A close above $1,349 (the October 7 high) could propel the token toward $1,400–$1,452, with the next key psychological milestone at $1,500.

Bitcoin surged to an unprecedented all-time high (ATH) of $126,080 last Monday, propelling the entire digital asset market upward. Investor attention also continued flooding into altcoins and the best meme coins , many of which have already set fresh valuation milestones in 2025. However, Trump’s Friday announcement of 100% tariffs on China sent stocks and crypto reeling, with crypto turning into an absolute bloodbath. In the space of an hour, it was not uncommon to see leading cryptos shed 30%. Many argue the sell-off was good for the industry as it squeezed out over-leveraged players, lining the way for an imminent bull run. This is not just hope; this is a historical pattern. With that in mind, let’s see which altcoins are the best to buy ahead of a crypto gold rush. Ripple (XRP): 2025’s Cross-Border Payment Leader Poised for More ATHs XRP ($XRP) , the token powering Ripple’s ultra-fast, low-cost payment system, continues to show its superiority to legacy payment rails like SWIFT. Backing from the UN Capital Development Fund and collaborations with several major U.S. banks have propelled XRP to the third-largest crypto by market capitalization, now hovering near $157 billion. Ripple’s recent unveiling of RLUSD, a USD-pegged stablecoin, underscores its ambition to capture the expanding stablecoin industry. Over the past 12 months, XRP has climbed 387%, hitting its first new high in seven years at $3.65 on July 18. It outperformed Bitcoin more than 4x, which grew 83% in the same timeframe. With a relative strength index (RSI) near 40, XRP appears primed for a rebound after a 13% dip in price since last Monday. Meanwhile, the overall $4.02 trillion crypto market has rebounded 5%, as it quickly recovers from the crash. Technical indicators show two bullish flag formations on XRP’s summer charts, awaiting a breakout. Should ETF approvals arrive by mid-October, positive sentiment could push XRP toward the $5–$10 range, or possibly higher. Solana ($SOL): Ethereum’s Top Challenger and This Week’s Breakout Star Solana ($SOL) remains one of the fastest and most efficient blockchain ecosystems, now commanding a market cap of around $107 billion. Its total value locked (TVL) has risen to over $11.3 billion , reflecting robust growth in its DeFi ecosystem. Anticipation is building for potential Solana spot ETF approvals in the U.S. this month, a move that could invite large-scale institutional inflows, similar to those enjoyed by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. However, the US government’s ongoing partial shutdown has meant that previous deadlines are up in the air Solana’s RSI sits at 42 and rising, as it returns to convergence with its 30-day moving average, indicating timely recovery. Support holds firm around $150, preventing steep declines, with resistance at $250, a level that, if broken, could spark another sharp rally. Revisiting its prior ATH of $293.31, or even surpassing $500, remains possible before 2025 concludes. Cardano ($ADA): The Eco-Friendly Smart Contract Network Targeting 2026 Growth Cardano ($ADA) has sustained momentum and investor confidence throughout 2025, rising 101% in the last 365 days and outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Created by Charles Hoskinson, an Ethereum co-founder, Cardano emphasizes a scientific, energy-efficient design, built upon a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. Its academic approach has even influenced portions of Ethereum’s ongoing roadmap. With a current market capitalization of over $32 billion, ADA would need to triple its value to seriously contend with Solana and challenge Ethereum’s dominance. Now trading around $0.7114, ADA has gained 10% in the last 24 hours, suggesting very rapid post-crash re-accumulation. Favorable conditions could lift ADA toward $1.50 by autumn, and possibly test its $3.09 ATH by year’s end. Even without major policy shifts, steady adoption trends could still see ADA approach $2 within 2025. From a technical standpoint, ADA formed a bullish flag pattern over the summer, a setup often preceding major upward movement. Although it briefly lost momentum amid September’s broader market pullback, the pattern remains without a clear breakout. Key resistance levels sit near $1.15, with strong support zones between $0.65 and $0.70. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): Bitcoin Layer-2 to Revitalize Bitcoin? Among 2025’s most talked-about newcomers, Bitcoin’s vital new Layer 2, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , is rapidly attracting investor attention, raising over $23.3 million in presale funding. The project aims to become an integral part of Bitcoin’s ecosystem by upgrading Bitcoin’s scalability and functionality through a Layer-2 solution infused with meme culture energy. Analysts forecast potential 10x or greater returns following launch. Developed on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER offers smart contract support, low-cost, high-speed transactions, and a Canonical Bridge that enables near-instant Bitcoin transfers, dApp integration, and meme token interoperability. A Coinsult audit recently verified zero security vulnerabilities, reinforcing investor confidence. The HYPER token powers this ecosystem through governance, staking, and transaction fees. Early backers can earn up to 50% APY from staking while participating in DAO governance. Visit the official presale website or follow Bitcoin Hyper on X and Telegram for more information.

Historically, “Uptober” has often marked the beginning of extended bull runs. Last Monday, Bitcoin rallied to a new ATH, although Trump’s Friday announcement of 100% tariffs on China scuppered crypto’s progress and resulted in some of the worst intraday price performance ever seen. Still, many crypto old-hands say this was the shakeout the market needed. Historically, crypto has a habit of crashing badly before every major bull run. They argue that it was a cleansing event, which squeezed out the over-leveraged and the fickle-handed. XRP ($XRP): ChatGPT Predicts a Surge to $20 ChatGPT projects that Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could potentially surge to between $10 and $20 before the New Year, a nearly eightfold jump from its current price of $2.57 if it hits the upper end. Source: ChatGPT XRP progenitor Ripple this year won a five-year legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), propelling XRP to $3.65 on July 18, its first all-time high (ATH) since 2017. Over the last 12 months, XRP’s price has soared by 381%, making it the best-performing large-cap unpegged crypto. During the same timeframe, Bitcoin rose by 83%, and Ethereum’s price appreciated 67%. Technical analysis shows three distinct bullish flag setups throughout 2025, including two during the summer months, signals often preceding a strong breakout that hasn’t materialized yet. Analysts now expect October’s historically bullish seasonality, along with possible ETF approvals, clearer U.S. crypto legislation, and more Ripple partnerships, to catalyze the march to $20 Dogecoin ($DOGE): ChatGPT Predicts Doge Could Leap Well Beyond Doge Army’s $1 Target Launched in 2013 as a lighthearted joke, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has evolved into a top-tier cryptocurrency, boasting a $31 billion market capitalization within the broader $67 billion meme coin sector. Its staying power is down to an active global community and increasing use cases in online payments. Currently trading around $0.20, with an RSI hovering near 40 and trending upward, Dogecoin has surged 9% in 24 hours with plenty of headroom left for further upward moves this week. Over the last 24 hours, DOGE outperformed Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana, all of which are recovering quickly from the flash crash, but Dogecoin is exhibiting its meme coin tendency to multiply daily crypto price trends. Chart patterns across 2025 highlight multiple bullish formations, laying the groundwork for a bullish breakout. According to ChatGPT’s projection, DOGE could finish the year between $1.50 and $3, with the upper range representing an aggressive stretch target. A more conservative expectation would place the token between $0.25 and $0.40. Given its previous all-time high was $0.7316 during the 2021 bull market, any move past the Doge Army’s long-sighted $1 target is wishful. Mainstream adoption continues to grow: Tesla still accepts Dogecoin for merchandise, while platforms such as PayPal and Revolut have integrated DOGE transactions into their ecosystems. Pepe ($PEPE): ChatGPT Predicts Meme Coin Favorite Reclaiming Its All-Time High Debuting in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) now commands a market cap of $3.2 billion, the largest among non-dog-themed tokens. Inspired by Matt Furie’s “Boy’s Club” comic, Pepe’s deep webcomic/meme has made it a viral sensation across crypto circles and beyond. Despite heavy competition, Pepe maintains healthy liquidity and strong community engagement, at times buoyed by cryptic but bullish nods from likely fan Elon Musk on his X profile. Currently trading near $0.0000075, the token remains about 73% below its December 2024 peak of $0.00002803. In ChatGPT’s optimistic scenario, Pepe could reclaim its previous all-time high, nearly quadrupling in value from current levels, if it crosses sticky resistance at $0.000018. With an RSI near 34, Pepe is currently trading at a low price, making now an attractive point to accumulate. As investor confidence returns, Pepe has a shot at a new ATH a year after the last. Missed out on DOGE? Enter Maxi Doge (MAXI): A Contender Guzzling Community Hype and Degen Power A new Dogecoin challenger has hit the presales market called Maxi Doge ($MAXI) . Early investors are piling into MAXI, having already backed the presale with nearly $3.6 million in early contributions.

Despite the US-China trade war–driven liquidation event that wiped out bullish setups for most altcoins , SOL has reaffirmed historical support at $173. Whales seem to be treating the 24% weekly decline as a discount, with a sharp spike in the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicating heavy accumulation likely led by large holders. SOL Chaikin Money Flow.

CoinGlass data adds weight to the trend, showing nearly $27 million in Solana exchange outflows, suggesting whales are moving holdings to self-custody in anticipation of a recovery. Solana Price Prediction: Whales are Positioned for a $1,000 Surge? The bounce at $173 has validated the lower boundary of a six-month rising wedge , with the pattern now approaching its apex and momentum building fast. This support zone has once again acted as a launchpad, shifting attention back toward a potential breakout. SOL / USD 1-day chart, ascending wedge pattern. Source: TradingView. On the 1-day SOL/USD chart , the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reversed sharply from a near-oversold reading of 33 , while the MACD histogram signals seller exhaustion, suggesting bulls are regaining control. The key breakout level sits at $300 , marking Solana’s all-time high from earlier this year. If SOL flips that level into support, it could enter price discovery mode , opening the door to a rally toward $500 , a 160% upside from current levels. In the short term, the $190 demand zone will be crucial. A confirmed bounce from here could set a higher base for a sustained uptrend. Looking ahead, macro factors like interest rate cuts , corporate treasury buying , and potential spot ETF approvals could push SOL toward the $1,000 mark , a 415% surge as the bull market gains steam. SNORTER: The Tool to Make the Most of the Marker Rebounds Solana has a history of starting surges in its meme coin market. Its last all-time high saw the birth of 10x–1000x coins like Fartcoin and Melania. Now, Solana’s next meme wave is forming, and Snorter ($SNORT) might be the edge traders need to catch it early Snorter Bot is built for competitive trading: limit-order sniping to grab the sharpest entries, MEV-resistant swaps that shield you from frontrunners, copy trading that mirrors proven winners, and rug-pull protection that helps filter out scams before you commit. Just as importantly, Snorter guides exits. It helps traders lock in profits at the right moment, often the difference between a small win and a huge one. The stats look solid too. The presale has raised almost $4 million, while early stakers are still earning up to 108% APY before the next phase begins next week. And the timing couldn’t be better. The macro narrative is driving capital back into risk assets like meme coins—making Snorter even more valuable as momentum builds across the sector.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency is regaining ground after last week’s selloff, lifted by renewed corporate buying and easing geopolitical stress between the U.S. and China. The headline move came from Strategy, the largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally, which quietly bought 220 BTC for $27 million just before prices dipped to $110,000. Despite volatility, the firm now holds 640,250 BTC, valued at around $73 billion. This latest purchase, financed through preferred share sales, nudged Strategy’s average purchase price to roughly $74,000. Analysts see it as yet another show of faith. “Large holders like Strategy don’t flinch in market swings; they anchor Bitcoin’s long-term floor,” one market strategist told reporters. Such steady institutional positioning continues to signal confidence, keeping the broader market structure intact and setting the tone for the next potential rally. BlackRock’s $94B ETF Strengthens the Case Adding to the momentum, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, recently likened Bitcoin to gold in a CBS interview , marking a complete reversal from his earlier skepticism. “Crypto has a role, just like gold does,” he said. JUST IN: $12 trillion BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says, “There is a role for crypto the same way there is a role for gold.” “This is not a bad asset.” pic.twitter.com/PeTORJ3PHB — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) October 13, 2025 BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust now manages roughly $94 billion, and half its investors are first-time clients. That mix of institutional and retail demand is deepening Bitcoin’s mainstream footprint, reinforcing its identity as “digital gold” amid inflation worries. Fink’s endorsement has fueled renewed investor trust. Retail interest is surging, widening the crypto market base. Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative continues to mature. Wall Street’s growing embrace of Bitcoin adds another layer of validation, suggesting that the asset’s next phase of adoption could come from traditional portfolios seeking stability and diversification. Trump’s BTC Holdings Add Political Weight In another surprising twist, President Donald Trump has become one of Bitcoin’s biggest individual holders. His company, Trump Media, purchased $2 billion in Bitcoin earlier this year, giving him an indirect stake of roughly $870 million through his 41% ownership. JUST IN: Forbes says President Donald Trump ""is now one of the largest #bitcoin investors on the planet,"" owning an estimated $870 million in BTC pic.twitter.com/uvCtkvDdv4 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) October 13, 2025 The move mirrors Michael Saylor’s playbook at MicroStrategy, turning Trump Media into a Bitcoin-treasury-style company. Since the purchase, Bitcoin’s price has risen nearly 6%, reflecting growing optimism around the alignment between political influence and crypto adoption. Market watchers now view this convergence, between Wall Street, corporate America, and political power, as the strongest signal yet of Bitcoin’s institutional legitimacy. Bitcoin Technical Setup: Bulls Target $122K Technically, Bitcoin trades in a tight consolidation channel between $112,700 and $117,600. A breakout above $116,100—the key 50% Fibonacci retracement—could trigger renewed bullish momentum toward $119,800–$122,500. The RSI at 56 shows improving buying strength, while lower candle wicks highlight consistent dip accumulation. If resistance holds, BTC could retest $111,200, where strong support aligns with the 23.6% Fib retracement. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview For short-term traders, a close above $116,000 sets up a possible continuation pattern, while institutions continue to treat every dip as a buying opportunity. With sentiment improving, ETF inflows steady, and macro tensions easing, Bitcoin’s path toward $122K may only be getting started. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of Bitcoin on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult, the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $23.4 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013105 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems. If Bitcoin built the foundation, Bitcoin Hyper could make it fast, flexible, and fun again.

53103840,605059,1760396423,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53103840.jpeg,Are XRP Futures ETFs Good For The Price? Expert Breaks Down What You Should Know,https://bitcoinist.com/are-xrp-futures-etfs-good/,"According to crypto analyst Jake Claver, XRP futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) don’t actually help the token’s price. He explains that these products do not purchase real XRP tokens. Instead, they trade contracts that settle in cash. Because they don’t buy or lock away tokens, there is no real demand or supply pressure on XRP. In contrast, spot XRP ETFs could have a much bigger effect. These would require fund managers to buy and hold actual XRP tokens, removing them from circulation. As a result, once these spot ETFs are approved, demand from institutional investors could push prices higher. Jake Claver Explains Why XRP Futures ETFs Don’t Drive Real Demand Jake Claver explains that futures ETFs don’t buy a single XRP token. They are cash-settled contracts, meaning investors are only trading paper agreements, not the tangible asset . Fund managers buy and roll these futures contracts before they expire, and even if delivery ever happens, they immediately sell the tokens right back. This process keeps XRP’s actual supply untouched. Claver calls this “paper trading dressed up in an ETF wrapper.” It looks like a real investment in XRP, but it is not. Since futures ETFs never hold the actual token, they do not create any pressure on XRP’s supply. There is no actual buying demand, and that means no upward push on price. He also notes that this setup only checks a regulatory box for the SEC. The SEC usually wants six months of futures trading before approving any spot ETF. For Claver, XRP’s futures ETFs are part of that early stage, not a significant price driver. Why Spot XRP ETFs Could Trigger A Real Supply Shock While futures ETFs have little real effect, Claver believes spot ETFs could change the game. Unlike futures, spot ETFs require fund managers to buy actual XRP tokens for every dollar invested. Those tokens are then held in custody by regulated institutions like Coinbase or Anchorage, removing them from the open market. Each share of the ETF is backed by real XRP, often between five and fifty tokens per share, and these tokens stay locked unless investors sell. Claver compares this to what happened with Bitcoin. Futures ETFs have existed since 2017, but Bitcoin’s real growth only began when spot ETFs launched in January. According to Claver, XRP is now in a similar position. The market has already met the SEC’s futures requirement, meaning spot ETFs could soon be approved. When that happens, institutional investors will need to buy large amounts of XRP in a market with very low liquidity. The launch of spot XRP ETFs could trigger intense price discovery and what Claver calls a “mathematical supply shock.” He believes the real move for XRP will start when institutions compete for actual tokens in a market that’s already running dry. Futures ETFs may have opened the door, but spot ETFs could be what finally pushes XRP into its next significant phase.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-13 23:00:23

Meanwhile, new altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE are drawing early attention as investors position for the next crypto uptrend. Bitcoin Price Prediction: $150K Remains Possible The Bitcoin price prediction for $150,000 by 2025 remains unchanged, even after a 10% pullback to around $102,759. Analysts say the dip is normal profit-taking after weeks of heavy accumulation. Over $5.6 billion in long positions were liquidated as volatility picked up, but institutional inflows continue to balance the sell pressure. BlackRock, Fidelity, and ARK Invest have expanded their Bitcoin exposure, fueling growing optimism among long-term holders. Geoffrey Kendrick from Standard Chartered still believes Bitcoin could reach as high as $200,000 if institutional capital keeps flowing at this rate. Recent ETF data backs this view. Spot Bitcoin ETFs added $2.71 billion in weekly inflows, bringing total assets to nearly $159 billion , or 7% of Bitcoin’s market cap. That shows big investors are still accumulating through structured products, even as short-term traders exit positions. ETF Activity Shows Confidence in Bitcoin Future Bitcoin’s short-term correction has not stopped ETF investors from buying the dip. Monday alone saw $1.21 billion in inflows, the second-largest single-day total since launch. This pattern suggests long-term allocators are using temporary price drops to build positions. BlackRock’s IBIT fund now holds over $65 billion , leading the market, while Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s GBTC showed smaller outflows. Analysts call this a short-term shakeout, not a reversal. Vincent Liu from Kronos Research noted, “Capital keeps flowing into BTC as allocators double down on the digital gold conviction trade.” With 31 new crypto ETF applications awaiting SEC review, institutional access to Bitcoin is expanding faster than ever, reinforcing why many still call it the best crypto to buy now . Key Bitcoin Price Highlights Bitcoin dropped 10% to $112,759 on Friday on Trump announcement $5.6B in long positions liquidated during the correction. ETFs logged $2.71B inflows this week despite volatility. Analysts hold to the $150K Bitcoin price prediction for 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A New Altcoin Gaining Buzz Before Bitcoin’s Next Move As Bitcoin gears toward a new rally phase, MAGACOIN FINANCE has caught early attention as a best crypto to buy now alongside BTC. Priced under $0.0006 , it is still new with a small market cap, making it one of the few altcoins that could post a 20x surge if momentum builds this quarter. Analysts believe that once Bitcoin breaks above $150K, fresh liquidity will flow into newer coins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Its early stage and compact price range create room for faster expansion compared to larger-cap assets. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE: Price below $0.0006 , early entry opportunity Small market cap, room for rapid expansion Could reach $0.0012 this quarter as Bitcoin rallies Community-backed and building fast How Traders Should Position Now Traders watching this Bitcoin price prediction may see the current dip as a setup for the next leg higher.

Related Reading: ‘BNB Isn’t Crumbling’: CZ Slams Critics Stirring Fear And Doubt According to reports, the court’s approval on October 13 allows the exchange to move ahead with a court-supervised recovery process tied to the $234 million hack that hit the platform in July 2024. Creditor Vote And Numbers Based on reports from the company, the revised plan won broad backing from affected account holders. In an August revote, 95.7% of participating scheme creditors voted in favor, and those votes came from 143,190 participating creditors representing about $196 million in approved claims. The strong turnout and result were used by WazirX to press its case to the Singapore court. Thank you to everyone who supported this difficult phase of WazirX. The Singapore High Court has approved the scheme. Its your support and love that has made this possible ❤️ Now we set out on the next phase to work hard and create value for everyone. We’re here because of YOU… — Nischal (Shardeum) 🔼 (@NischalShetty) October 13, 2025 The hack itself exploited a Safe Multisig wallet in mid-July 2024 and drained a large pool of user funds. Investigations and media accounts linked the breach to advanced cyber operators, and the theft forced WazirX to freeze both crypto and rupee withdrawals while legal options were explored. What Users Will Receive According to several outlets, users may recover a substantial portion of lost funds under the approved plan. Reports have said recoveries could reach up to 55% of the losses, delivered as a mix of immediate liquid payments and so-called Recovery Tokens that represent remaining claims to be fulfilled over time. WazirX has said the first wave of payouts — in stablecoin or USDT equivalent — would follow once the scheme takes effect. That mix means some users will get cash-equivalent payments quickly while others will hold tokens that the company intends to redeem as it regains assets or generates revenue. The plan shifts part of the repayment responsibility to entities inside India to comply with local rules, a change that was highlighted during court rounds. The road to approval was not straight. The Singapore court had earlier rejected a first version of the scheme after judges raised questions over the plan’s structure and oversight. That decision forced WazirX and its advisers to rework the proposal and secure a fresh vote from creditors before returning to court. Related Reading: XRP Traders Face Fresh Selling Pressure As Large Holders Move Out Next Steps And Timeline If the scheme becomes effective under the court’s timetable, WazirX says distributions of available liquid assets will begin within 10 business days. That window is expected to trigger the initial USDT transfers while RTs are recorded for the remainder of approved claims. The exchange will still need to finish legal formalities and coordinate with payment processors and regulators.

David Namdar, Chief Executive Officer at CEA Industries, said that BNB’s latest positive performance is not unexpected at all. Rather, it is the result of years of investing in robust ecosystem growth initially. BNB is on again The 32nd $BNB burn in July destroyed ~1,595,600 BNB (~$1.024B USD). With $BNB near all-time highs again, I'm expecting the next burn to pack even more firepower. What’s your estimate for the burn amount & USD value? #BNBBurn @BNBNetworkCo — David J. Namdar (@namdar) October 10, 2025 He believes that the market is just catching up to the “credibility, scale, and utility of the BNB ecosystem.” His company holds the world’s largest BNB Coin treasury, owning 480,000 tokens worth over $660 million at the time of writing. BNB Price Prediction: BNB Recovers After Hitting Key Support During Flash Crash BNB volumes have gone up by 72.3% in the past 24 hours, as the token hit a new all-time high at $1,370. This figure accounts for 7% of the asset’s circulating supply, underscoring the strength of the buying spree. The daily chart shows a sharp reaction from buyers as BNB touched $900 , with above-average volume confirming it as a key support level. Today’s spike suggests momentum is building, and further gains could be on the horizon. The $1,350 zone remains a critical resistance. A breakout above it would likely confirm the start of a new leg higher, potentially pushing BNB toward $2,000 as traders recover from Friday’s volatility. While the BNB ecosystem is known for its scalability, it still ranks as the third-largest chain by total value locked (TVL) . But what if the next big breakout doesn’t come from BNB or Solana? A new presale called Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is turning heads by tapping into the massive, untouched value on the Bitcoin network , using Solana-grade speed to unlock staking, DeFi, and more through a purpose-built layer-2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Raises $24M to Launch Its Powerful L2 Since its launch, Bitcoin (BTC) holders have not been able to earn passive income on their investment as the network does not support the launch of smart contracts. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) changes this with the launch of a side chain that will allow investors to hold, stake, and lend their assets to further monetize their holdings. It all starts with the Hyper Bridge – a Bitcoin-native solution that safely holds users’ BTC tokens in a designated Bitcoin wallet. The protocol immediately mints the corresponding amount of assets on the Hyper L2 to give investors access to a growing number of decentralized apps (dApps) built on this Solana-based side chain. By leveraging the power of the second largest smart contracts network in the space, Bitcoin Hyper will overcome the hurdles that have prevented the top crypto from taking over as the top DeFi chain. To buy $HYPER while it is still available at a discounted presale price, simply head to the Bitcoin Hyper official website and link up your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to invest.

Under this framework, XRP qualifies as an eligible asset, placing it on the fast track to approval and paving the way for regulated spot exposure in U.S. TradFi markets XRP Price Prediction: Is this the Catalyst That Puts $1,000 In Focus? Fresh demand from TradFi markets could give XRP the momentum it needs to confirm the breakout of a year-long ascending triangle pattern. Although the weekend’s mass liquidation event invalidated most short-term bullish setups, this wider structure remains in play. XRP / USD 1-day chart, year-long ascending triangle pattern. Source: TradingView. Momentum indicators now refocus attention on the breakout, reaffirming $1.50 as a potential bottom. The RSI has sharply reversed after dipping into oversold territory at 30, while the MACD histogram shows a possible bottom forming below the signal line—signaling buyers are returning as sellers lose steam. The key breakout threshold sits at $3.40, a resistance level that has capped upside throughout the pattern. Once flipped to support, XRP could rally 210% toward its $8 technical target . In the near term, however, traders should watch for a bounce from the $2.70 demand zone to confirm higher support for a sustained uptrend. Looking further ahead, expanding exposure to U.S. TradFi markets and U.S. interest rate cuts to fuel risk-on sentiment could propel XRP toward $15 running into 2026—a potential 500% gain. While the $1,000 XRP price target remains distant right now, these new touchpoints for mainstream capital inflows create a strong foundation for it to be realized long-term. PepeNode: The New Way to Earn This Cycle? Pepe took over the meme world last cycle, turning a viral frog into one of crypto’s biggest cultural moments. Now, feeding off that same energy, a new offshoot, PepeNode ($PEPENODE) , is adding something the original never had: real passive income. Other meme coins have tried before; Shiba Inu brought staking, but PepeNode goes a step further with a fresh mine-to-earn model. Mining without any hardware needed. Just log in, acquire virtual nodes, assemble rigs, and start generating rewards across proven meme coins. The stats look solid too. The presale has already exceeded $1.7 million , while early stakers are still earning up to 740% APY before the next phase begins. With the added fuel of 70% burns on all $PEPENODE spent on nodes and rigs, deflation supports long-term token value. And the timing couldn’t be better. The macro narrative is driving capital back into risk assets like meme coins, making PepeNode’s rewards model even stronger as momentum builds across the sector.

However, several market and structural factors suggest that this milestone remains far from reach. Despite community efforts and ecosystem growth, the project’s fundamentals and market position create significant barriers. Without major shifts in supply, utility, and institutional backing, the goal of $0.001 may remain unattainable. Enormous Token Supply and Weak Institutional Adoption The most significant hurdle to Shiba Inu is the enormous amount of tokens of the coin.Despite burning over 41% of the original supply, largely through Vitalik Buterin's significant 2021 burn, approximately 589 trillion tokens remain in circulation. It may take decades or even centuries to bring the supply down to the level that would sustain $0.001 at the present levels. Every price rally requires massive capital inflow, and it is hard to maintain the momentum. Another issue is institutional adoption. Unlike Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Solana , which have attracted significant institutional investment, Shiba Inu's market remains dominated by retail participants. Valour Inc., a Swedish ETP issuer, launched a SHIB-focused exchange-traded product on Sweden's Spotlight Stock Market.The exposure is low and has not been able to lure high institutional capital or enhance credibility among the traditional investors. Leadership Concerns and Limited Ecosystem Utility Transparency and leadership issues have also raised red flags within the Shiba Inu community. Shiba Inu's anonymous leadership structure continues to deter serious institutional capital from entering the ecosystem.The project operates under pseudonymous leadership, with Shytoshi Kusama at the helm. While anonymity initially aligned with crypto's ethos, it now poses accountability concerns. Prominent blockchain projects like Ethereum and Cardano benefit from visible, accountable leaders, something Shiba Inu still lacks. Although it has introduced Shibarium, ShibaSwap, and the Shib Metaverse, experts say these projects have not generated meaningful utility or adoption beyond speculative trading. The development team's attention appears divided across multiple projects. Kusama's previous endorsement of SHY, a separate meme token, redirected community focus and liquidity away from the core SHIB ecosystem. Such actions dilute investor confidence and fragment the community's resources. Internal tensions within the leadership team have surfaced publicly. Developer Kaal Dhairya acknowledged this discord, noting that ”some so-called leaders who benefited from Shiba Inu have walked away.” Team conflicts typically result in delayed development milestones and reduced community trust. The combination of excessive token supply, absent institutional support, anonymous leadership, limited utility, and internal conflicts creates a formidable barrier to the $0.001 target. Each factor independently presents significant challenges.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|BUSINESS|TRADING|ETH,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-13 23:29:57

These coins have all posted bullish gains in the past 24 hours, and their technicals and fundamentals suggest that more rallies will be coming soon. And as the market recovers and enters an increasingly buoyant phase, we take a look at an up-and-coming token that could potentially outperform once it launches in the next few weeks. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Overselling Clears Way for ETF-Driven Push to New ATH XRP has rebounded by 10% in the past 24 hours, although its current price of $2.63 represents an 11% drop in a week and a 15% decline in a month. On the other hand, XRP retains a very solid 392% increase in the past year, with the coin’s fundamentals remaining as bullish as they were prior to last week’s liquidation-fuelled selloff. The most positive thing XRP has on its horizon is the incoming launch of numerous XRP ETFs, which will drive significant institutional investment in the altcoin. And with Ripple continuing to expand its cross-border payment and stablecoin business, demand for XRP is only going to increase in the medium- and long-term. Source: TradingView Its chart today suggests that the coin could bounce back strongly from the weekend’s dip, with its indicators beginning to rise from heavily oversold positions. For example, its relative strength index (yellow) has now risen above 40 after slipping below 30 a couple of days ago, while its MACD (orange, blue) has bottomed out. From here, we may see the XRP price rise consistently, driven by ETF launches and ongoing Ripple growth. It could hit $3 by the end of October, before breaking its current ATH of $3.65 by the end of November. Crypto Price Prediction: Cardano ($ADA) – L1 Development and Canary ETF to Boost ADA by 2026 At $0.7216, ADA has risen by 12% in the past 24 hours, although it remains down by 15% in the past week and by 22% in the last 30 days. These may be disappointing declines, but as with XRP, this overselling has created the conditions for a big rally in the near future. ADA is also looking forward to the launch of a multi-asset ETF, offered by Canary, and once it goes live, it could result in a big boost. There’s also the fact that Cardano is one of the most well-established and reputable layer-one networks in crypto, with its platform undergoing regular development and updating . While it remains relatively small compared to the biggest L1s (e.g., Ethereum and Solana), its steady development will boost its utility and adoption over time, boosting the ADA price in turn. Source: TradingView And today, ADA’s chart also reveals a coin that is beginning to bounce back after some very heavy selling. Based on how oversold it has been recently, we could see the ADA price return to $1 by the end of the month, while making it back above $3 by the end of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) – Meme Token to Surge on the Back of NFT Sales and ETF PENGU has posted a substantial 16% gain today, but at $0.02551, it remains down by 18% in a week and by 30% in a month. Although it has faced challenges over the past couple of months, PENGU’s prospects appear very promising. For one, Canary has filed to launch an ETF that would invest in PENGU and also in Pudgy Penguins NFTs. This would provide a massive boost to PENGU, especially when so few meme tokens (with the exception of Dogecoin) are likely to have their own ETFs anytime soon. PENGU also benefits from the ongoing popularity of the Pudgy Penguins NFT series, which boasts total sales worth $714.6 million , as well as a current daily volume of $5 million. Its chart today suggests that it too could be breaking out soon, given how much the market has been overselling it. Source: TradingView If it could decisively break through the $0.030 resistance level, then it we could witness a surge towards former highs. It may reach $0.040 by the middle of November, while entering 2026 above the $0.10 level. PEPENODE Raises $1.8 Million as Anticipation Builds for Mine-to-Earn Token With the market rebounding strongly from the weekend’s selloff, now may be an ideal time to invest in newer tokens, which could post outsized gains once the end-of-year rally gets into full swing. One new token that looks particularly good in this respect is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), which is an Ethereum-based mine-to-earn token that has begun generating lots of hype. So close… but so far. Time to upgrade those nodes to get some more https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/dlsXwoKUoE — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) October 11, 2025 Launching later in the year, PEPENODE will enable its users to build their own virtual mining rigs. They can use these rigs to earn rewards in other meme tokens (such as Pepe and Fartcoin), while they can increase their rewards by spending PEPENODE to acquire more nodes. This mechanic could create strong demand for PEPENODE, and judging by the amount it has raised in its presale—over $1.8 million—investors already appear interested. This is also helped by the fact that you can stake PEPENODE for staking yields, which are currently just above 700% APY. Investors can join its presale at the official PEPENODE website, where it currently costs $0.0011005, although this price will continue to rise until the sale ends.

The consumers are alleging that the deal violates anti-trust laws, and has led to Microsoft artificially inflating prices of its generative AI services. The proposed class action was filed in a San Francisco federal court and claims that Microsoft used a secret, exclusive cloud computing deal with OpenAI to illegally limit the supply of computational power essential to run OpenAI’s popular platforms, ChatGPT included. The lawsuit further argues that this alleged restriction on the market has hurt millions of users by driving subscription prices up while diminishing product quality. The consumers accuse Microsoft of market manipulation Microsoft has invested more than $13 billion in OpenAI to date. The tech giant first announced a $1 billion partnership in 2019, in a deal that established its Azure as the key cloud computing service for the ChatGPT maker. This initiative, the plaintiffs are positive, was used to corner the emerging generative AI market. According to the court papers, the agreement allowed Microsoft to take advantage of OpenAI’s ground breaking success for its own benefit, at the same time while it developed competing products like Microsoft Copilot. It further alludes to a price war among AI services experienced earlier this year, emphasizing that ChatGPT prices remained “substantially higher” than its competitors, allegedly because of Microsoft’s market manipulation, according to the plaintiffs. According to a Reuters article , while the lawsuit admits that some of the tightest restrictions have recently eased with OpenAI reportedly beginning to buy compute power from Google in June this year, it however warns that the threat remains in place. The plaintiffs describe the arrangement as “a sword of Damocles over OpenAI wielded by one of its principal competitors,” suggesting that Microsoft may re-impose the restrictions any time. Now, the consumers are seeking unspecified damages for alleged overcharges dating back to the public launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. Additionally, they are requesting a court order to permanently stop Microsoft from enforcing the allegedly anti-competitive limits on OpenAI. Microsoft has been under some regulatory scrutiny for some time. The tech giant recently narrowly escaped the risk of a multibillion-euro fine after agreeing on a deal with EU to loosen the grip of its workplace chat service, Teams, on the professional software market. This followed over a year of antitrust bickering which was triggered by complaints from rival platforms, which later led to the EU accepting commitments regarded as binding from the Microsoft. The commitments were in relation to Microsoft being required to sell versions of its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites without Teams, as the Cryptopolitan previously reported. As for the latest case, both Microsoft and OpenAI had no immediate comment on the lawsuit, neither did attorneys at Bathaee Dunne for the 11 consumers who filed the lawsuit had a comment immediately. OpenAI, which was founded as a nonprofit in 2015 but has since restructured into a for-profit entity, is not named as a defendant in the case.

Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Pushes Higher Again – Has It Finally Found Its Short-Term Bottom? While MNT remains below its $2.84–$2.86 all-time high, the strong recovery suggests bulls are regaining control, potentially setting the stage for another push toward the upper range if momentum holds. Spot activity exploded, with daily trading volume up more than 60% to about $1.2 billion, while futures open interest climbed 9% to $269.7 million, a signal that speculative demand is accelerating alongside spot buying. MNT's price bounces back following major losses on the daily chart. Source: MNTUSD on Tradingview Fundamental Tailwinds: RWAs, Stablecoin Liquidity, and Exchange Distribution Beyond the chart, Mantle’s rally is grounded in clear catalysts. The network’s Tokenization-as-a-Service (TaaS)stack is pulling real-world asset issuers on-chain, while the launch of USD1, a new stablecoin building on Mantle, is injecting fresh liquidity and utility into its DeFi rails. Distribution is another edge: Mantle’s deepening Bybit integration (treasury programs, listings, and roadmap alignment) is funneling sustained order flow, not just one-off hype. Analysts also highlight Mantle’s modular design (execution on Mantle with EigenDA for data availability and OP-stack upgrades) that lowers costs and improves throughput, important for tokenization, trading, and payments use cases. Can Mantle (MNT) Bulls Clear $3? The Levels and Scenarios Momentum favors further upside as a decisive close above $2.87 could open the door to $3.00, with extended targets near $3.60 if volume and open interest continue to rise. On the downside, $2.50–$2.55 is initial intraday support, followed by the must-hold $1.90–$2.00 zone; losing that would risk a deeper retrace toward $1.60–$1.75 where buyers last reloaded. For now, breadth (spot + derivatives), rising participation, and a tight, orderly trend argue for trend continuation rather than a blow-off top.

This is important, as it coincides with a time when the crypto market is starting to recover from a massive correction over the weekend. XRP To Rebound From Major Support According to Rietveld, XRP’s price is approaching an important support zone around $2.785, which could serve as the foundation for a strong bullish reversal. He noted that XRP is likely near its local bottom and that a rebound from this level would be normal, where cryptocurrencies surged shortly after major corrections. The analyst noted that traditional equity markets, especially in the United States, are hitting new all-time highs, even as the broader crypto market is consolidating. This divergence has occurred multiple times before, but liquidity eventually rotates from the stock market into digital assets and causes explosive upward movements. Rietveld pointed out that a similar pattern was observed in early March, April, and May, when stocks peaked just before Bitcoin and altcoins went on a major rally. Institutional And Sovereign Interest Building In Crypto Rietveld’s analysis also highlighted increasing institutional appetite for cryptocurrencies, which he believes will be a major catalyst for the next market expansion. He cited data showing that over 60% of institutional investors plan to increase their exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies beyond what they already have. This trend, he said, is a very good sign. Rietveld also mentioned that aside from private institutions, several sovereign wealth funds, including those in Luxembourg, Denmark, and the United States, are preparing to allocate portions of their portfolios to Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Particularly, he referenced news about Luxembourg, which r ecently confirmed that it is assigning 1% of its sovereign wealth fund to Spot Bitcoin ETFs. The analyst described this as the early stage of a broader capital migration worth trillions of dollars from traditional markets into cryptocurrencies. Rietveld’s comments extended beyond technicals and market inflow trends. The analyst offered a strong critique of the global financial system by accusing central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve, of mismanagement and corruption through unchecked money printing and debt accumulation. In his view, the fiat currency system is unsustainable, and cryptocurrencies like XRP are the best option for financial independence. He encouraged investors not to succumb to fear or market uncertainty, noting that the periods of widespread panic, like the current one, are the best buying opportunities. Those who are patient and are accumulating at these low prices are the ones positioning themselves to benefit the most when the next strong crypto rally rolls in.",XRP|altcoins|bitcoin|Levi Rietveld|ripple|Spot Bitcoin ETFs|US Federal Reserve|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|BTC|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-14 00:00:34

Concerns about the government’s forthcoming budget were behind the slowdown, new figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) show. Overall, total retail sales increased 2.3% in September over the same month last year — after climbing by 3.1% in August and 2.5% in July. Sales at stores open for at least a year, excluding newly opened ones, also declined to 2% from 2.9%. Retailers say a mix of inflation, tax uncertainty, and unpredictable weather has put the brakes on spending. One-quarter of consumers are holding out as Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves gets set to unveil her first full budget in November, research shows. The new administration is attempting to strike a balance between promoting growth and fulfilling green investment promises, while also carrying an increasingly heavy public debt load. The uncertainty is clearly having an impact on household activity, according to Helen Dickinson, Chief Executive of the BRC. Sales at food retailers rose modestly, driven more by inflation than volume. Shoppers were increasingly trading down to cheaper brands or buying in smaller quantities, KPMG’s retail tracker said. Non-food sales, including clothing and household goods, dropped steeply — roughly 0.7% in September compared with 1.8% the previous month. Unseasonably warm weather also impacted demand for cold-weather items, such as coats and boots. Retailers had hoped to see earlier gains from autumn collections, but consumers continue to wait until it’s more seasonally appropriate before sprucing up their wardrobes. Shops prepare for tough ‘golden quarter’ Now retailers are entering into what is called the “golden quarter” — the all-important last three months of the year when profits are driven by Christmas shopping . But the outlook is mixed. John Lewis Partnership Plc has unveiled its largest-ever seasonal recruitment drive, taking on 13,700 temporary workers at its department stores, warehouses, and Waitrose supermarkets. The company is well-positioned to meet its full-year profit targets, Chairman Jason Tarry said, even after reporting a loss in the first half. Likewise, the UK’s second-biggest grocer, J Sainsbury Plc, which owns Argos, is to recruit 19,000 temporary workers to cope with the holiday season rush. The supermarket giant anticipates an explosion in online orders and in-store visits this November and December, but cautions that shoppers are likely to remain picky. Linda Ellett, UK Head of Consumer, Retail and Leisure at KPMG, said spending remained highly targeted as shoppers remained cautious. She noted that retailers were relying on promotions and carefully planned product ranges to attract customers and boost sales in the lead-up to the Christmas season. Technology sales offered one bright spot, with a lift from the introduction of Apple’s new iPhone and Apple Watch models in mid-September. But other discretionary categories, such as home decor and apparel, were order of magnitude slower. Meanwhile, shop price inflation increased to 1.4% in September, up from 0.9% in August – its highest since February, according to BRC data. Higher import costs and energy prices continue to squeeze margins. Tax concerns contribute to pressure on retailers. Retailers are also dealing with potential tax ripple effects in Reeves’ November budget, beyond the impact on consumer spending. The government is considering changes to business rates — the property tax paid by shops — that could disproportionately hit large stores. The BRC has cautioned that introducing a new tax band for big retailers could lead to store closures and job losses, particularly among department store chains already struggling with high costs. Small businesses are especially vulnerable. Some warn that a further rise in business rates would push them into closure. The Federation of Small Businesses has called for the Treasury to freeze or cut the levy next fiscal year in an effort to help stop further decline on Britain’s high streets. Retail analysts say the current slowdown illustrates a precarious balancing act for policymakers. Tax increases could threaten to erode the already fragile consumer confidence, but postponing fiscal reforms may exacerbate Britain’s budget shortfall. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The incident has also sparked debate about the unique features that separate decentralized finance (DeFi) from traditional finance (TradFi), and whether DeFi can truly remain permissionless when its front-end gateways comply with sanctions regimes designed for TradFi. Uniswap faces backlash over blanket restrictions The issue was made public on X by Artem Chystiakov, a Ukrainian DeFi builder known as Arvolear, who posted an open appeal to Uniswap Labs after finding that the platform’s front end was unavailable for Ukrainian IP addresses. He said the reason Uniswap has been giving so far is that “Ukraine is present on the OFAC sanctions list provided on the U.S. Department of the Treasury website.” However, Chystiakov pointed out that Uniswap has misinterpreted the information, adding, “It is clearly stated that no goods, services, or technology must be provided to both the so-called DNR/LNR and the Crimea regions of Ukraine. Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities/regions are not mentioned whatsoever.” Chystiakov said he had first raised the issue with Uniswap support under ticket number “169045,” but nothing has been done on the matter, so he went public with an open letter calling for the company to lift the ban on Ukraine. The restrictions appear to stem from Uniswap Labs’ sanctions compliance tools, which use IP-based geolocation to prevent users in certain regions from accessing the front end. The issue has also made its way to Change.org where a petition titled “Restore Uniswap Access for Ukrainian Citizens,” was filed. So far, the signatories have been relatively few but has since gathered support from across the DeFi community. Compliance clashes with crypto’s open access ethos Uniswap’s Terms of Service explicitly prohibit use from jurisdictions under U.S. economic or trade sanctions. According to the policy published on its support site , users may not access the interface if they are located in or affiliated with such regions. This language mirrors obligations set by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which maintains sanctions lists covering entities in Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk, but not the rest of Ukraine. Critics say that Uniswap Labs, which develops and hosts the popular user interface for the Uniswap protocol , has overreached in its compliance efforts. The future of access and accountability in DeFi Chystiakov insists that the problem is not about a lack of alternatives; Ukrainian users can still access the protocol directly via blockchain explorers, third-party interfaces, or VPNs, but about principle. He wrote on X that “It’s more than just UI availability, rather true crypto values they fail to follow.” According to Chystiakov , “It’s as simple as ‘the face of defi’ project failing to hold its promise of global accessibility and censorship resistance. Absolutely pathetic and coward behavior… How can we claim to change the financial world when we can’t even dare to change ourselves? DeFi idea is cracking right here.” The Ukrainian DeFi community is now urging Uniswap Labs to implement more targeted compliance measures, blocking only the sanctioned regions and individuals rather than the entire country. As of the time of writing, neither Uniswap nor its founder, Hayden Adams, have publicly sent a response to Chystiakov post on X. However, the company has previously defended its use of compliance tools. Still, the incident has revived a fundamental question for the DeFI movement, which is, can a protocol truly be “open and permissionless” if its main access point is subject to unilateral corporate or political control?

Industry leaders like Solana (SOL) are continuing to dazzle, delivering lightning-fast settlements and a burgeoning ecosystem that entices both retail and institutional investors However, as altcoins compete for headlines, there emerges a new contender, building momentum stealthily and turning heads among investors that seek the unconventional. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) finds itself, right now, in Phase 6 of its presale, having sold out in excess of 65% already, signaling a wave of confidence in a project designed to deliver exponential growth. Mutuum Finance blurs together strategic innovations and a roadmap that makes it a serious contender to become a leader among tomorrow’s best altcoins to deliver come 2025. With the momentum behind the presale picking pace and a solid footing being established, Mutuum Finance has a strong likelihood to re-establish the definition of a next 100x cryptocurrency. Solana Price Analysis Sol (SOL) currently faces a vital 4-hour support level of $190.8, retaining just above essential lows following a recent rout. Momentum indicators continue to point towards the downside, implying further losses until a clear positive reversal sign, i.e., a pin bar or engulfing candle that has the potential to haul SOL towards $209.2 in the near term, appears. Erosion of support for $190.8 could bring lower levels of $180.7 and even $168.2 into play, retaining the near-term perspective bearish until SOL can convincingly retake and maintain levels higher than $209.2. While market players focus on these key movements, the markets’ quest for strong, high-potential altcoins beyond the established names is gaining momentum, an area seeing fledging project Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gain a lot of attention. Mutuum Finance Takes Off During Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) remains in good stride, its sixth presale now 65% full. Investor appetite remains extremely strong, with over 16,910 investors putting over $17.25 million worth into the project so far. Those are all-time records for MUTM and reflect the unstopping global confidence globally into the platform’s DeFi long-term prospect and potential ecosystem. Follow-up to its quest to scale its decentralized ecosystem, Mutuum Finance’s latest news is that it will release its lending and borrowing protocol . Version 1 (V1) of the Platform will launch on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 of 2025. The initial launch will contain major features including liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and the liquidator bot that will serve as a building block to a healthy, efficient, and scalable DeFi architecture. The protocol has also instituted an in-real-time system of risk and liquidity management that are integrated beneath the same to be able to function and stay stable in the event of distress. The protocol also liquidates automatically illiquid or under-collaterallised positions, as well as capping levels of exposure to risk to avoid contagion from happening between pools of assets. ETH and stablecoins are anchor collateral coins that give stabilizing base support to higher-risk coins. Adaptive reserve factor allocation across classes of assets optimizes ultimate risk versus reward optimization through enhanced general system coverage for the reserves. In addition, the Mutuum Finance protocol also hedges the volatility in real-time together with the liquidity and adjusts dynamically to suit changing market conditions. It dynamically offsets Exposure management and short-selling pressures to avert forced liquidation so that even the most extreme market corrections have healthfully balanced the collateralization. Systemic risk in Real-Time DeFi, thus, is contained and the DeFi platform stable, strong, and consistent in spite of volatile market conditions. Top Altcoin to Invest in 2025 As Solana (SOL) crosses key supports around $190.8, altcoin investors seeking high-potential altcoins are focusing on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Its Phase 6 presale has already raised more than $17.25 million from more than 16,910 investors, and 65% of tokens sold already suggest good market confidence. Its upcoming Sepolia Testnet lending and borrowing protocol, consisting of liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot, along with real-time risk and liquidity management, makes MUTM a scalable, secure, and efficient DeFi ecosystem. Pre-emptive investors seeking to capitalize on the next 100x crypto gain must invest in MUTM tokens now before the presale advances.

The drop came amid what analysts describe as the largest liquidation event in crypto market history, wiping out billions in leveraged positions across major exchanges. While bulls briefly lost control during the panic, ETH has since begun to stabilize, with renewed buying interest emerging near key demand zones. Related Reading: Bitmine Receives 23,823 Ethereum From BitGo As Institutional Accumulation Continues Onchain analyst Maartunn highlighted that leverage is once again building up on Ethereum, signaling that traders are returning to the market following the reset. According to his data, open interest on ETH surged significantly over the past 24 hours — a sign that speculative activity is resuming as volatility cools. This renewed leverage could set the stage for another decisive move, either fueling a short-term relief rally or inviting further liquidations if momentum fades. The coming days will be crucial for Ethereum, as bulls attempt to reclaim the $4,000 level to confirm a sustainable recovery. Market sentiment remains cautious but optimistic, with onchain data showing large holders and institutions continuing to accumulate ETH despite recent turbulence — a potential signal of long-term confidence in the asset’s resilience. Leverage Returns to Ethereum: A Risky Revival In Market Activity According to Maartunn, Ethereum’s Open Interest has surged by +8.2% within the past 24 hours — a clear sign that leverage is flowing back into the market. This rapid rise comes just days after the largest liquidation event in crypto history, where overleveraged traders were wiped out during the sudden crash. Now, it seems many are trying to “trade their money back,” reigniting short-term volatility and speculation across exchanges. Maartunn notes that while these so-called “revenge pumps” often create strong intraday rallies, they rarely sustain long-term momentum. Historically, around 75% of similar leverage-driven recoveries tend to revert, leading to renewed pullbacks once liquidity and funding rates normalize. Only about 25% manage to extend into lasting uptrends, typically when supported by fresh spot buying or renewed institutional inflows. This data underscores the precarious balance Ethereum currently faces. The jump in Open Interest signals revived market participation, but also introduces the risk of another wave of forced liquidations if traders overextend their positions. For now, ETH’s short-term recovery remains largely fueled by derivatives activity rather than spot demand. The next few days will be pivotal in determining Ethereum’s direction. If price holds above the $4,000 region with sustained volume, it could confirm that bulls are regaining control. However, a sudden drop in Open Interest or sharp funding spikes could signal that the rally is overextended — setting the stage for another correction.

The daily chart shows that ETH quickly rebounded from the 200-day moving average (red line), confirming it as a major area of demand. Price is now consolidating near $4,150, attempting to build momentum after a strong bullish candle on high volume — a potential sign that buyers are regaining control. However, ETH faces immediate resistance near the $4,250–$4,300 zone, which coincides with the 50-day moving average (blue line). This area previously acted as strong support, and reclaiming it would be essential for confirming a shift back into bullish structure. The 100-day moving average (green line) is now flattening, reflecting the market’s cautious sentiment following the massive liquidation event. Related Reading: Solana Network Activity Drops 50%: Is The Rally Built On Weak Fundamentals? If bulls manage to sustain price action above $4,000, the next targets lie near $4,500 and eventually $4,750. Conversely, failure to hold the 200-day MA could open the door to a deeper retest of $3,600 or lower. For now, Ethereum’s recovery remains technically constructive, but it must overcome these resistance levels to confirm that the recent rebound is more than just a short-term reaction to oversold conditions.

Total crypto market cap jumped roughly 5%, with over $550 billion flowing back into digital assets after a panic sparked by talk of 100% U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Bitcoin (BTC) reclaimed $115,000 (+3%), Ethereum (ETH) climbed to $4,142 (+8.2%), and XRP traded near $2.54. High-beta majors joined the rebound: BNB surged 14% and Solana (SOL) gained 7%. Trade War Fears Ease as China Clarifies Export Rules and Trump Softens Tone The bid returned as China’s Ministry of Commerce clarified its rare-earth export controls are legal but not a ban, with compliant civilian applications to be approved. President Donald Trump also struck a more conciliatory tone, posting that the U.S. wants to “help China, not hurt it,” easing fears of a near-term trade war escalation. The shift follows the largest crypto liquidation on record, over $19–$20 billion in 24 hours, as over-levered longs were flushed in Friday’s cascade. Prediction markets now price sharply lower odds of full tariffs by Nov. 1, aligning with Monday’s broad risk-on bounce. Institutions Buy The Dip As ETF Momentum Steadies From a deeper perspective, the flows stayed constructive. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw only minor daily outflows ($4.5M on Friday) and remain net positive by nearly $6B for October, signaling continuing institutional demand via regulated vehicles. On-chain watchers also flagged Marathon Digital adding 400 BTC ($46M) through FalconX in early Monday trade, consistent with treasuries opportunistically accumulating into weakness. Sentiment gauges improved from “extreme fear,” while social data on Stocktwits flipped bullish for BTC, with some traders eyeing a retest of $140K if macro tailwinds persist. Levels To Watch: Support, Resistance, And Catalysts Technically, BTC’s swift recovery places $114,000–$117,000 as near-term support, with resistance layered around $121,000–$126,000 (the recent ATH zone). ETH faces supply near $4,200–$4,300, while XRP watchers highlight $2.60–$2.65 as a hurdle to unlock momentum toward $3.00. Macro remains the key swing factor, as any renewed tariff saber-rattling or U.S. data surprises (especially amid a patchy government-statistics calendar) could reignite volatility.

This significant rise has resulted from increased sales of costly electric vehicles and luxury cars. During this month, data released highlighted that American car purchasers spent an average of $50,080 on new vehicles. This spending represents a 3.6% increase from last year. Record EV sales, fueled by the expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit, further pushed prices upward, making new cars less affordable for many consumers. Erin Keating points out the influence of wealthier families on the American car market Erin Keating, an Executive Analyst and Senior Director of Economic and Industry Insights at Kelley Blue Book’s parent company, Cox Automotive, noted that the days of the $20,000 car have disappeared from the market. Based on her argument, the current car market is greatly influenced by wealthier families. According to Keating, many cost-conscious car buyers will wait for vehicle price drops or opt for used cars. This cautious behavior stems from the surge of new car prices, which have increased more than 25% over the last five years. At this time, Americans attracted more attention in the car market, making significant purchases of expensive trucks and SUVs while ignoring affordable options that once appealed to first-time buyers. Following these price hikes , reports from S&P Global research revealed that s everal young buyers have shifted their preferences to used vehicles or are maintaining their older ones longer, as the average age of cars on the road has exceeded twelve years. Additionally, individuals buying new vehicles secure seven-year or longer loan term extensions. Meanwhile, according to reports from researcher Edmunds.com, the average car payment per month escalated to $754 in the third quarter. One in five individuals purchasing a new automobile is spending a monthly budget of more than $1,000 on car loans. Concerning the federal tax credit, many consumers had rushed to make EV purchases to be eligible for the credit, resulting in price hikes. Moreover, this escalation in sales led battery-powered vehicles to account for a record 12% of the US car market. Kelley Blue Book reported that electric models recorded an average selling price of $58,124 in September. Luxury vehicles, on the other hand, also recorded impressive sales in September. To illustrate this, over 60 models worth average prices exceeding $75,000 made up 7.4% of all new car sales that month. This reflected a surge from 6% the previous year. Trump’s extensive tariff policies raise tension in the car market The full effects of President Donald Trump’s tariffs on inflation have not been fully realized, as automakers absorb much of the added costs. Regarding this situation, analysts raised concerns that carmakers would eventually have to pass these costs on to consumers to sustain their profits. “Tariffs have established new cost pressures for the car industry,” Keating said, pointing out a powerful combination of EVs and high-end automobiles as the main influencers of the pricing trends in September. In the meantime, Ford Motor Co. anticipated that its profits would drastically decline this year amid the escalating effects of Trump’s tariffs. This highlights the considerable changes in Washington policies interfering with the car industry. Apart from Ford, the automaker, based in Dearborn, Michigan, forecasted that its adjusted earnings before interest and taxes would decline by as much as 36% this year . This reduction is mainly due to the net tariff effect of $2 billion, which equals roughly $500 million more than Ford had estimated earlier. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The company said it purchased Ether more aggressively during the recent market volatility, bringing its total holdings to over 3 million ETH, representing roughly 2.5% of the cryptocurrency’s total supply. BitMine’s average purchase price for the recent acquisitions was $4,154 per token. Between Friday and Monday, the firm acquired 202,037 ETH, valued at approximately $827 million, according to a statement on X. This increase pushed BitMine’s overall crypto portfolio to $13.4 billion, which includes $12.9 billion in cryptocurrency and “moonshot” investments, 192 Bitcoin, $104 million in cash, and a $135 million stake in Nasdaq-listed Eightco Holdings. The purchases came amid a sharp market correction on Friday, which triggered around $19 billion in liquidations over the weekend. Tom Lee, chairman of BitMine and head of research at Fundstrat, said the market downturn created an opportunity to buy Ethereum at discounted prices. “The crypto liquidation over the past few days created a price decline in ETH, which BitMine took advantage of,” Lee said. He added that the company is now “more than halfway towards our initial pursuit of the ‘alchemy of 5%’ of ETH.” Lee also highlighted the broader investment logic, stating, “Volatility creates deleveraging, and this can cause assets to trade at substantial discounts to fundamentals, or as we say, ‘substantial discount to the future,’ and this creates advantages for investors, at the expense of traders.” BitMine’s approach may influence other institutional investors to adopt similar long-term accumulation strategies. Interest in the company extends beyond crypto investors, as its stock, BMNR, was recently the 22nd most widely traded on U.S. markets, averaging over $3.5 billion in five-day trading volume as of Friday. Despite this, BMNR’s stock price fell 11% over the past five days, following a short position by Kerrisdale Capital, which criticized BitMine’s business model as “on its way to extinction.” The company’s dual focus on cryptocurrency and traditional equities reflects a broader trend of institutional participation in digital assets.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-10-14 01:06:54

The world’s biggest memory chipmaker and South Korea’s most valuable company is riding the artificial intelligence wave that has reshaped the global semiconductor market. Samsung’s operating profit in the July-September quarter jumped to 12.1 trillion won ($8.5 billion), surpassing analysts’ forecasts of about 9.7 trillion won, according to preliminary results released on Tuesday. Revenue increased to 86 trillion won, a steep gain from the previous year’s 67.4 trillion won. AI surge drives record chip profits The performances represented Samsung’s best since early 2022, and suggested that its chip division was rebounding strongly from a two-year industry downturn. Now, the recovery in memory chip pricing and global AI development is causing profits to leap. Average DRAM prices increased by roughly 172% year-over-year in the third quarter, and NAND flash memory also posted double-digit growth, according to TrendForce. These chips are crucial for the AI servers that underpin large language models, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, as well as data centers operated by tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. Samsung has been scrambling to narrow the gap behind its smaller competitor, SK Hynix, which currently dominates the market for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in AI accelerators. Most of Nvidia’s HBM3E chips, which are crucial for training and running AI models, are provided by SK Hynix. But Samsung is quickly gaining ground. It recently received certification from Nvidia for its 12-layer HBM3E chips and secured an order from AMD, enabling it to tap into the fast-growing AI server market. The certification will enable Samsung to initiate mass shipments within the next few months, positioning it to compete head-to-head with SK Hynix and Micron, according to people familiar with the industry. Investors bet big on Samsung’s future in AI. The strong quarter has helped lift investor confidence that Samsung is on track to regain leadership in the semiconductor industry. Its shares have surged more than 60% since the beginning of June, driven by hopes for AI demand and a recovery in memory prices. Both Samsung and SK Hynix recently signed deals to provide chips for OpenAI’s “Stargate” project, an ambitious initiative to construct one of the world’s largest AI data centers. Stargate’s estimated demand could potentially consume 40% of global DRAM production, underscoring the significant demand for processing power from AI. Park Jae-kyung, an analyst at Daishin Securities, said Samsung’s profit surge marked a watershed moment, noting that the company was not only recovering but also re-emerging at the forefront of the AI revolution. In memory as well as beyond, Samsung’s display and mobile divisions performed well. But premium smartphone panel earnings benefited from robust sales of foldable devices and OLED panels. The company’s Galaxy Z Fold6 and Flip6 models had helped prop up the mobile income line, contributing to a less lopsided growth picture among divisions. Analysts predict that Samsung’s semiconductor profit will surge through 2025, driven by faster-than-anticipated global demand for AI servers. The company informed investors on its most recent earnings call in July that it anticipated strong growth in high-end memory products for servers in the second half of the year. Still, risks remain. Samsung faces challenges related to geopolitical tensions, export controls, and supply chain disruptions — especially after the United States recently tightened restrictions on exporting chip technology to China. The company has also been under pressure to improve its profitability in the foundry business, where it trails its Taiwanese rival, TSMC. Analysts from Morgan Stanley, Citi, and Goldman Sachs have all updated their Samsung share price forecasts in the past week to reflect high, continued memory prices and better chip yields. According to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Masahiro Wakasugi, Samsung has returned to the game, describing the nexus of AI-driven demand, squeezed supply, and improved technology across its products — as well as high interest rates — as having created a “double whammy” for profitability.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. China Renaissance’s reported plan to raise $600 million for a BNB-focused investment vehicle , with Binance founder Changpeng Zhao's YZi Labs investing alongside, may look like a straightforward bet on Binance’s ecosystem. But Singapore-based market maker Enflux argues it’s something deeper: a signal that Asian institutions are building a different kind of crypto exposure than their Western counterparts. “Regional capital allocators are seeking exposure to infrastructure tokens that drive transaction flow, not just store-of-value assets,” Enflux said in a note to CoinDesk, framing the China Renaissance move as part of a broader divergence between East and West. BNB is a great example of this. Binance, of course, isn't a listed company, but BNB serves as something very close to a stock. Its value is a proxy for market sentiment and confidence in Binance. While U.S. and European markets have leaned into tokenized Treasuries, funds, and real-world assets, Asia’s capital markets are increasingly constructing crypto-native liquidity networks centered around exchange, staking, and transaction infrastructure. ""This ties into the broader shift where Asian capital markets are building out their own layer of crypto-native liquidity networks while Western markets tokenized TradFi,"" Enflux continued. The logic is straightforward. Value should be accrued by activity, not scarcity. Tron's move to create a publicly listed company to give investors listed exposure to activity on the TRX network – which is heavily used to send USDT around Latin America – follows the same train of thought. If Enflux’s thesis is right, the China Renaissance fund could be an early blueprint for Asia’s next wave of institutional products: permanent capital vehicles that hold the pipes of the crypto economy, not just its gold. Market Movement: BTC: BTC is trading above $114,500, relatively flat as the market stabilizes after last weekend's volatility. ETH: ETH rose 1.5% to $4,230 as network activity picked up, even as U.S.-listed Ethereum ETFs saw $118 million in outflows. Gold: Gold surged 2% to a record $4,103 an ounce as renewed U.S.-China trade tensions and expectations of further Fed rate cuts drove investors toward safe-haven assets. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed Tuesday as Trump’s conciliatory remarks on China failed to offset renewed trade tensions, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 1.34%.

53109413,604864,1760407211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53109413.jpeg,Bitcoin Market Structure Resets For A Fresh Start: Data Hints At Price Recovery,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-market-structure-resets-for-a-fresh-start/,"Bitcoin has faced one of its most volatile weeks in recent history, plunging to $103,000 on Friday in a dramatic 15% drop that erased billions in market value within hours. The sudden sell-off triggered widespread liquidations across the crypto market, wiping out leveraged positions and sparking panic among traders. However, price action is now showing early signs of recovery, with some analysts suggesting that this sharp correction could pave the way for a stronger, more sustainable uptrend. According to a recent report from CryptoQuant, this event marks one of the most severe market resets ever recorded, with potential ripple effects expected to shape price behavior for months to come. Following Bitcoin’s peak last week, open interest — a measure of futures market activity — dropped sharply by $12 billion, from $47 billion to $35 billion. This represents one of the largest contractions in derivatives positioning seen in recent years. Such massive deleveraging historically precedes a healthier market structure, as excessive speculation is flushed out. While volatility remains elevated, the combination of reduced leverage and renewed inflows from stablecoin reserves could position Bitcoin for a gradual recovery — if demand holds steady and buyers regain confidence in the coming sessions. Market Reset Clears the Path For Bitcoin The CryptoQuant report highlights a notable shift in Bitcoin’s market structure following Friday’s massive correction. Funding rates, which had been declining steadily for months, briefly turned negative during the capitulation event — a clear sign that traders flipped bearish in panic. However, these rates have since normalized to modestly positive levels, indicating that sentiment is stabilizing and short-term speculation is being replaced by more balanced positioning. Another key metric, the Bitcoin Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR), also dropped significantly after reaching levels not seen since 2022. This sharp reduction points to a widespread deleveraging across derivatives markets, as overexposed traders were forced to unwind positions. Such events often act as a “reset” for market health, flushing out excessive leverage and setting the stage for more sustainable growth. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) fell to its lowest point since April. This decline implies that stablecoin liquidity — or the potential buying power sitting on the sidelines — has risen substantially relative to Bitcoin’s market capitalization. Historically, when stablecoin liquidity increases after major sell-offs, it often signals an accumulation phase that precedes recovery. BTC Attempts Recovery After Sharp Correction Bitcoin is showing signs of stabilization after its steep decline to the $103,000 level on Friday. The daily chart reveals that BTC has rebounded sharply, currently hovering around $115,000. This recovery suggests that buyers are stepping in around key demand zones, defending the 200-day moving average — a historically critical level for maintaining long-term bullish momentum. Despite the bounce, Bitcoin remains below the $117,500 resistance, a level that previously acted as strong support. Bulls must reclaim and close above this zone to confirm a continuation toward $120,000 and potentially retest the $125,000 range. Until then, the price remains within a consolidation phase following an extreme liquidation event. The moving averages (50-day and 100-day) show a near-term bearish crossover risk, reflecting the market’s cautious tone. However, the quick rebound from last week’s capitulation indicates strong underlying demand and the potential for a higher low formation — a constructive technical sign. If BTC manages to hold above $112,000 and regain $117,500, momentum could shift back in favor of buyers. Conversely, failure to sustain these levels could expose the market to another retest of lower supports around $108,000.

These Bitcoin Charts Could Be Ones To Watch In a shock to the market, Bitcoin ended last week with a steep crash, falling from above $122,000 to below $110,000. The coin managed to make some recovery on Sunday, and that rebound has held so far into Monday. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Selling: $50 Million Exiting Wallets Every Day However, while BTC appears to be rebuilding its structure, its direction remains unclear, as noted by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in an X thread. Maartunn has shared a few key charts that could determine whether the recovery will hold or fade. First, the analyst has revealed a chart that points out a similarity between the recent Bitcoin price action and the November 2021 bull market top. As displayed in the above graph, BTC broke above its weekly resistance with the recent price rally, but immediately fell below the line after the crash. A similar failed breakout also took place back in November 2021. According to Maartunn, such a trend typically signals exhaustion. On-chain data also suggests the cryptocurrency is currently trapped below a notable resistance level, as the chart for the UPRD shows. The UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) here is an indicator that tells us about the amount of Bitcoin that was last purchased/transferred at the various price levels that the asset has visited in its history. From the metric’s chart, it’s visible that a significant amount of supply has its cost basis between $117,500 to $120,000. The holders of these coins would naturally be underwater right now, so there is a chance that if BTC recovers to their break-even level, they might panic sell, fearing going into losses again. Given the scale of the supply involved, selling pressure of this kind could be notable on a retest of the range, potentially making it a major resistance barrier for the asset. A support level that could be key is the average cost basis or Realized Price of the short-term holders (STHs).

53109577,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=835315,1760407423,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53109577.jpeg,Bhutan migrates national digital ID to Ethereum,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bhutan-migrates-digital-id-to-ethereum/,"The Kingdom of Bhutan is gradually migrating its National Digital Identity (NDI) platform to the Ethereum blockchain, marking a landmark step in the digital transformation agenda for this Himalayan nation. The move makes Bhutan the first country to base its national identity system on a public blockchain, thereby enhancing transparency, trust, and citizen control over their personal information. The migration from NDI to Ethereum is at the core of Bhutan’s vision to create a decentralized, secure, and self-sovereign digital community. This integration will enable the NDI to generate verifiable credentials, sign digital documents, and prove identity natively on Ethereum’s public, distributed network. By building its core identity system on Ethereum, Bhutan aims to reduce its reliance on centralized databases, a common vulnerability to hacking, manipulation, and data leakage. This philosophy for the nation is in sync with India’s “technology with values” philosophy, which encourages integrity and ethics, inclusion, and empowerment through innovation. The launch of Bhutan’s National Digital Identity on Ethereum marks a significant milestone in establishing the country as a leader in the realm of digital government, according to Prime Minister Lyonchen Tshering Tobgay. He said that by utilizing Ethereum’s globally distributed and decentralized infrastructure, they aimed to enhance the security, transparency, and availability of Bhutan’s critical systems. He added that this milestone underscored their vision of creating an interoperable and user-owned identity system, one that connects Bhutan to global ecosystems while upholding His Majesty the King’s vision of a secure, inclusive, and digitally empowered society. Shortly after the 2023 election, Bhutan’s National Digital Identity (NDI) was established, the first and only national system worldwide to offer self-sovereign identity (SSI) at a population-wide scale. His Royal Highness also emerged as the country’s first digital citizen during the launch, highlighting Bhutan’s leadership in people-centered digital innovation. Bhutan gains global recognition through blockchain collaboration Aya Miyaguchi, the president of the Ethereum Foundation , praised Bhutan’s move as a way blockchain could be employed to create open and inclusive systems that work for citizens — and not just institutions. Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, also praised the initiative, stating that decentralized digital identity is a fundamental building block for the future of the internet and that he is pleased to see innovative teams, such as uPort, developing self-sovereign solutions. He added that Bhutan’s adoption of an open architecture built on Ethereum demonstrated the purpose behind creating the platform — to drive meaningful and positive change through open-source technology. From the outset, Bhutan has sought to establish a transparent network that serves its citizens as well as those beyond its borders. Anchoring in a public blockchain enables the Government of Bhutan to allow its citizens to verify their credentials from anywhere in the world, while preserving privacy and control. This differs from many remote identification systems based on opaque, centralized infrastructure controlled by governments or the private sector. The government aims to migrate the entire NDI platform onto Ethereum by early 2026. When it’s fully rolled out, Bhutanese citizens will be able to prove certain things about themselves without disclosing their personal information, as cryptographic proofs are used instead of the usual ID checks. Driving innovation through blockchain Besides its national identity system, the country is studying more extensive uses of blockchain technology in various aspects of governance and social services. In 2025, the nation also hosted a decentralized applications (dApp) hackathon in Paro, with a partnership from the Ethereum Foundation. The event was attended by over 70 developers who worked on creating digital tools based on Bhutan’s identity framework. The projects included verifying land records, implementing transparent citizen feedback systems, and tracking provenance for locally made products. Bhutan’s NiaoDai Interchain has also formed a global partnership with iDen2, a decentralized identity protocol, to jointly develop Phenix—a modular identity solution for use worldwide. The partnership will aim to combine Bhutan’s real-world experience in deploying a national digital identity with the iDen2 open-source technology, enabling other countries and organizations to replicate Bhutan’s success.
