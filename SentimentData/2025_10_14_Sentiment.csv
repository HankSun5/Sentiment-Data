Traders and investors are carefully observing XRP’s momentum, but the search for the next breakout candidate does not end there. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is slowly gaining attention as a showstopper set to replicate the same kind of explosive growth. Already in Phase 6 of its presale and having sold out over 65%, MUTM is more than a speculation coin, it’s a carefully crafted DeFi ecosystem that incorporates innovative functionality, community-governance, and a roadmap structured for long-term growth. With momentum in its current presale and increasing investor curiosity, MUTM may be the altcoin to focus on alongside Ripple as both tokens set their sight on hefty gains in 2025. Ripple Price Prediction: Ready to Record a Sudden Jump to $5 XRP is now trading near the $2.70 support level, a region it has tested several times, showing strength and continued investor demand. So long as this support level remains, there may be continued momentum for a swift push toward the $5 mark, spurred by renewed buying demand and favorable sentiment. Even if the overall market gets volatile, XRP’s finding a floor above $2.70, and $2.60 as the next important safety net, indicates that there’s still a clear direction ahead for bulls. As market players hold out for this possible breakout, eyes are looking to emerging altcoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which has been making a lot of noise as investors are looking for the next high-priority project. Mutuum Finance Presale Buzz Builds Up Steam Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining investor attention this week following tremendous speed in Phase 6 of presale. The tokens are currently valued at $0.035, a 16.17% increment from the previous round. Over 16,910 investors have already purchased generating over $17.25 million, healthfully depicting an emerging market confidence in the bright DeFi future of Mutuum Finance. With over 65% sold in Phase 6, early investors are acquiring their buy-ins before the next increment. Even collateral management is optimized, for eventual ultimate power-to-borrow by mutual complementing leveraging off the related holdings, with the ultimate bankruptcy risk elimination and overall platform health. Real-Time Data via Chainlink Oracles To achieve proper, stable prices and risk valuation, Mutuum Finance utilizes Chainlink oracles for feeds of USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, sophisticated data feeds, and decentralized exchange TWAPS also ensure that valuation derived from a protocol remains accurate, no matter record-record volatility or illiquidity. Mutuum’s lending and borrowing protocol has a launch impending. Version 1 (V1) of it will debut on Sepolia Testnet in Q4, 2025, and it will have key components which are as follows: liquidity pools,mtTokens,debt tokens, liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be provided at the launch for collaterals, lending, and borrowing and will give the users the efficient, scalable, and secure DeFi. The platform also provides floating-, fixed-, and floating/fixed-degree tools and balances the supply versus the demand for the liquids as well as stabilizes the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance to Blast Off Ripple (XRP) registers resilience near $2.70, predicting a possible jump to $5, but altcoin investors looking for the next alt to have high potential are focusing on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Phase 6 of the presale of MUTM has already generated more than $17.25 million from over 16,910 investors, and 65% of tokens have been sold. Its forthcoming Sepolia Testnet protocol for lending and borrowing, involving liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot, coupled with Chainlink oracle-led pricing and sound risk management, make MUTM a secure, scalable, and efficient DeFi ecosystem. Early investors must invest now to acquire MUTM tokens prior to the presale progressing, and reap huge gains.

Related Reading: ‘BNB Isn’t Crumbling’: CZ Slams Critics Stirring Fear And Doubt The rally comes after a sharp sell-off triggered by geopolitical tensions earlier this month, followed by an aggressive rebound fueled by whale accumulation and institutional inflows. According to CoinGlass, daily trading volume jumped 55% to $10.7 billion, while open interest rose 25%, signaling fresh leveraged positions betting on continued upside momentum. BNB’s sharp turnaround mirrors broader market stabilization but with stronger conviction. Traders are now eyeing a move toward $1,450–$1,500, a region that would mark a new all-time high for the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. BNB's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: BNBUSD on Tradingview CZ Attributes BNB Price Rally to Genuine Market Demand Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) weighed in on the rally, emphasizing that BNB’s recent strength comes from organic market demand, not artificial liquidity support. “BNB has no market makers,” he stated, adding that the price recovery reflects the community’s belief, builder activity, and deflationary mechanisms that continue to burn tokens. CZ also praised BNB Chain ecosystem contributors such as Venus and Binance, who “took hundreds of millions out of their own pockets to protect users” during the recent volatility, a move he described as a demonstration of “different value systems.” His comments helped solidify investor sentiment, with analysts noting that CZ’s transparency about internal market structure has reassured traders that BNB’s rally is fundamentally driven rather than speculative. The token’s deflationary model and sustained ecosystem utility continue to underpin long-term confidence. Can BNB Break $1,500 Next? From a technical standpoint, BNB’s breakout above $1,236 resistance has activated bullish momentum, with the RSI hovering near 65, showing strong but not overbought conditions. MACD crossover and robust volume spikes point to further upside potential. A close above $1,349 (the October 7 high) could propel the token toward $1,400–$1,452, with the next key psychological milestone at $1,500.

Historically, “Uptober” has often marked the beginning of extended bull runs. Last Monday, Bitcoin rallied to a new ATH, although Trump’s Friday announcement of 100% tariffs on China scuppered crypto’s progress and resulted in some of the worst intraday price performance ever seen. Still, many crypto old-hands say this was the shakeout the market needed. Historically, crypto has a habit of crashing badly before every major bull run. They argue that it was a cleansing event, which squeezed out the over-leveraged and the fickle-handed. XRP ($XRP): ChatGPT Predicts a Surge to $20 ChatGPT projects that Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could potentially surge to between $10 and $20 before the New Year, a nearly eightfold jump from its current price of $2.57 if it hits the upper end. Source: ChatGPT XRP progenitor Ripple this year won a five-year legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), propelling XRP to $3.65 on July 18, its first all-time high (ATH) since 2017. Over the last 12 months, XRP’s price has soared by 381%, making it the best-performing large-cap unpegged crypto. During the same timeframe, Bitcoin rose by 83%, and Ethereum’s price appreciated 67%. Technical analysis shows three distinct bullish flag setups throughout 2025, including two during the summer months, signals often preceding a strong breakout that hasn’t materialized yet. Analysts now expect October’s historically bullish seasonality, along with possible ETF approvals, clearer U.S. crypto legislation, and more Ripple partnerships, to catalyze the march to $20 Dogecoin ($DOGE): ChatGPT Predicts Doge Could Leap Well Beyond Doge Army’s $1 Target Launched in 2013 as a lighthearted joke, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has evolved into a top-tier cryptocurrency, boasting a $31 billion market capitalization within the broader $67 billion meme coin sector. Its staying power is down to an active global community and increasing use cases in online payments. Currently trading around $0.20, with an RSI hovering near 40 and trending upward, Dogecoin has surged 9% in 24 hours with plenty of headroom left for further upward moves this week. Over the last 24 hours, DOGE outperformed Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana, all of which are recovering quickly from the flash crash, but Dogecoin is exhibiting its meme coin tendency to multiply daily crypto price trends. Chart patterns across 2025 highlight multiple bullish formations, laying the groundwork for a bullish breakout. According to ChatGPT’s projection, DOGE could finish the year between $1.50 and $3, with the upper range representing an aggressive stretch target. A more conservative expectation would place the token between $0.25 and $0.40. Given its previous all-time high was $0.7316 during the 2021 bull market, any move past the Doge Army’s long-sighted $1 target is wishful. Mainstream adoption continues to grow: Tesla still accepts Dogecoin for merchandise, while platforms such as PayPal and Revolut have integrated DOGE transactions into their ecosystems. Pepe ($PEPE): ChatGPT Predicts Meme Coin Favorite Reclaiming Its All-Time High Debuting in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) now commands a market cap of $3.2 billion, the largest among non-dog-themed tokens. Inspired by Matt Furie’s “Boy’s Club” comic, Pepe’s deep webcomic/meme has made it a viral sensation across crypto circles and beyond. Despite heavy competition, Pepe maintains healthy liquidity and strong community engagement, at times buoyed by cryptic but bullish nods from likely fan Elon Musk on his X profile. Currently trading near $0.0000075, the token remains about 73% below its December 2024 peak of $0.00002803. In ChatGPT’s optimistic scenario, Pepe could reclaim its previous all-time high, nearly quadrupling in value from current levels, if it crosses sticky resistance at $0.000018. With an RSI near 34, Pepe is currently trading at a low price, making now an attractive point to accumulate. As investor confidence returns, Pepe has a shot at a new ATH a year after the last. Missed out on DOGE? Enter Maxi Doge (MAXI): A Contender Guzzling Community Hype and Degen Power A new Dogecoin challenger has hit the presales market called Maxi Doge ($MAXI) . Early investors are piling into MAXI, having already backed the presale with nearly $3.6 million in early contributions. Having watched his cousin Dogecoin’s success enviously from the sidelines, MAXI decided enough was enough. He’s here to blow up bigger than DOGE, and he’s been pumping weights to manifest this, as he wins the hearts and minds of fellow crypto degens. Built on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, MAXI fosters active community participation through active Telegram and Discord groups, trading challenges, and upcoming brand partnerships. Of the total 150.24 billion tokens, 25% are allocated to the “Maxi Fund,” a reserve dedicated to marketing and strategic collaborations. Staking is already live, offering yields of up to 85% APY, although rewards fluctuate as the staking pool grows. The ongoing presale prices tokens at $0.0002625, with incremental increases tied to funding milestones. Investors can join using MetaMask or Best Wallet .

53102953,https://cryptonews.com/?p=436910,1760394600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/53102953.jpeg,"Best Crypto to Buy Now 13 October – XRP, Solana, Cardano",https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-13-october-xrp-solana-cardano/,"Last week was very dramatic for crypto, but it gave us several signs that the industry may be moving towards its biggest run yet. Bitcoin surged to an unprecedented all-time high (ATH) of $126,080 last Monday, propelling the entire digital asset market upward. Investor attention also continued flooding into altcoins and the best meme coins , many of which have already set fresh valuation milestones in 2025. However, Trump’s Friday announcement of 100% tariffs on China sent stocks and crypto reeling, with crypto turning into an absolute bloodbath. In the space of an hour, it was not uncommon to see leading cryptos shed 30%. Many argue the sell-off was good for the industry as it squeezed out over-leveraged players, lining the way for an imminent bull run. This is not just hope; this is a historical pattern. With that in mind, let’s see which altcoins are the best to buy ahead of a crypto gold rush. Ripple (XRP): 2025’s Cross-Border Payment Leader Poised for More ATHs XRP ($XRP) , the token powering Ripple’s ultra-fast, low-cost payment system, continues to show its superiority to legacy payment rails like SWIFT. Backing from the UN Capital Development Fund and collaborations with several major U.S. banks have propelled XRP to the third-largest crypto by market capitalization, now hovering near $157 billion. Ripple’s recent unveiling of RLUSD, a USD-pegged stablecoin, underscores its ambition to capture the expanding stablecoin industry. Over the past 12 months, XRP has climbed 387%, hitting its first new high in seven years at $3.65 on July 18. It outperformed Bitcoin more than 4x, which grew 83% in the same timeframe. With a relative strength index (RSI) near 40, XRP appears primed for a rebound after a 13% dip in price since last Monday. Meanwhile, the overall $4.02 trillion crypto market has rebounded 5%, as it quickly recovers from the crash. Technical indicators show two bullish flag formations on XRP’s summer charts, awaiting a breakout. Should ETF approvals arrive by mid-October, positive sentiment could push XRP toward the $5–$10 range, or possibly higher. Solana ($SOL): Ethereum’s Top Challenger and This Week’s Breakout Star Solana ($SOL) remains one of the fastest and most efficient blockchain ecosystems, now commanding a market cap of around $107 billion. Its total value locked (TVL) has risen to over $11.3 billion , reflecting robust growth in its DeFi ecosystem. Anticipation is building for potential Solana spot ETF approvals in the U.S. this month, a move that could invite large-scale institutional inflows, similar to those enjoyed by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. However, the US government’s ongoing partial shutdown has meant that previous deadlines are up in the air Solana’s RSI sits at 42 and rising, as it returns to convergence with its 30-day moving average, indicating timely recovery. Support holds firm around $150, preventing steep declines, with resistance at $250, a level that, if broken, could spark another sharp rally. Revisiting its prior ATH of $293.31, or even surpassing $500, remains possible before 2025 concludes. Cardano ($ADA): The Eco-Friendly Smart Contract Network Targeting 2026 Growth Cardano ($ADA) has sustained momentum and investor confidence throughout 2025, rising 101% in the last 365 days and outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Created by Charles Hoskinson, an Ethereum co-founder, Cardano emphasizes a scientific, energy-efficient design, built upon a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus. Its academic approach has even influenced portions of Ethereum’s ongoing roadmap. With a current market capitalization of over $32 billion, ADA would need to triple its value to seriously contend with Solana and challenge Ethereum’s dominance. Now trading around $0.7114, ADA has gained 10% in the last 24 hours, suggesting very rapid post-crash re-accumulation. Favorable conditions could lift ADA toward $1.50 by autumn, and possibly test its $3.09 ATH by year’s end. Even without major policy shifts, steady adoption trends could still see ADA approach $2 within 2025. From a technical standpoint, ADA formed a bullish flag pattern over the summer, a setup often preceding major upward movement. Although it briefly lost momentum amid September’s broader market pullback, the pattern remains without a clear breakout. Key resistance levels sit near $1.15, with strong support zones between $0.65 and $0.70. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): Bitcoin Layer-2 to Revitalize Bitcoin? Among 2025’s most talked-about newcomers, Bitcoin’s vital new Layer 2, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , is rapidly attracting investor attention, raising over $23.3 million in presale funding. The project aims to become an integral part of Bitcoin’s ecosystem by upgrading Bitcoin’s scalability and functionality through a Layer-2 solution infused with meme culture energy. Analysts forecast potential 10x or greater returns following launch. Developed on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER offers smart contract support, low-cost, high-speed transactions, and a Canonical Bridge that enables near-instant Bitcoin transfers, dApp integration, and meme token interoperability. A Coinsult audit recently verified zero security vulnerabilities, reinforcing investor confidence. The HYPER token powers this ecosystem through governance, staking, and transaction fees. Early backers can earn up to 50% APY from staking while participating in DAO governance. Visit the official presale website or follow Bitcoin Hyper on X and Telegram for more information.

Despite the US-China trade war–driven liquidation event that wiped out bullish setups for most altcoins , SOL has reaffirmed historical support at $173. Whales seem to be treating the 24% weekly decline as a discount, with a sharp spike in the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicating heavy accumulation likely led by large holders. SOL Chaikin Money Flow.

CoinGlass data adds weight to the trend, showing nearly $27 million in Solana exchange outflows, suggesting whales are moving holdings to self-custody in anticipation of a recovery. Solana Price Prediction: Whales are Positioned for a $1,000 Surge? The bounce at $173 has validated the lower boundary of a six-month rising wedge , with the pattern now approaching its apex and momentum building fast. This support zone has once again acted as a launchpad, shifting attention back toward a potential breakout. SOL / USD 1-day chart, ascending wedge pattern. Source: TradingView. On the 1-day SOL/USD chart , the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reversed sharply from a near-oversold reading of 33 , while the MACD histogram signals seller exhaustion, suggesting bulls are regaining control. The key breakout level sits at $300 , marking Solana’s all-time high from earlier this year. If SOL flips that level into support, it could enter price discovery mode , opening the door to a rally toward $500 , a 160% upside from current levels. In the short term, the $190 demand zone will be crucial. A confirmed bounce from here could set a higher base for a sustained uptrend. Looking ahead, macro factors like interest rate cuts , corporate treasury buying , and potential spot ETF approvals could push SOL toward the $1,000 mark , a 415% surge as the bull market gains steam. SNORTER: The Tool to Make the Most of the Marker Rebounds Solana has a history of starting surges in its meme coin market. Its last all-time high saw the birth of 10x–1000x coins like Fartcoin and Melania. Now, Solana’s next meme wave is forming, and Snorter ($SNORT) might be the edge traders need to catch it early Snorter Bot is built for competitive trading: limit-order sniping to grab the sharpest entries, MEV-resistant swaps that shield you from frontrunners, copy trading that mirrors proven winners, and rug-pull protection that helps filter out scams before you commit. Just as importantly, Snorter guides exits. It helps traders lock in profits at the right moment, often the difference between a small win and a huge one. The stats look solid too. The presale has raised almost $4 million, while early stakers are still earning up to 108% APY before the next phase begins next week. And the timing couldn’t be better. The macro narrative is driving capital back into risk assets like meme coins—making Snorter even more valuable as momentum builds across the sector.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency is regaining ground after last week’s selloff, lifted by renewed corporate buying and easing geopolitical stress between the U.S. and China. The headline move came from Strategy, the largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally, which quietly bought 220 BTC for $27 million just before prices dipped to $110,000. Despite volatility, the firm now holds 640,250 BTC, valued at around $73 billion. This latest purchase, financed through preferred share sales, nudged Strategy’s average purchase price to roughly $74,000. Analysts see it as yet another show of faith. “Large holders like Strategy don’t flinch in market swings; they anchor Bitcoin’s long-term floor,” one market strategist told reporters. Such steady institutional positioning continues to signal confidence, keeping the broader market structure intact and setting the tone for the next potential rally. BlackRock’s $94B ETF Strengthens the Case Adding to the momentum, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, recently likened Bitcoin to gold in a CBS interview , marking a complete reversal from his earlier skepticism. “Crypto has a role, just like gold does,” he said. JUST IN: $12 trillion BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says, “There is a role for crypto the same way there is a role for gold.” “This is not a bad asset.” pic.twitter.com/PeTORJ3PHB — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) October 13, 2025 BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust now manages roughly $94 billion, and half its investors are first-time clients. That mix of institutional and retail demand is deepening Bitcoin’s mainstream footprint, reinforcing its identity as “digital gold” amid inflation worries. Fink’s endorsement has fueled renewed investor trust. Retail interest is surging, widening the crypto market base. Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative continues to mature. Wall Street’s growing embrace of Bitcoin adds another layer of validation, suggesting that the asset’s next phase of adoption could come from traditional portfolios seeking stability and diversification. Trump’s BTC Holdings Add Political Weight In another surprising twist, President Donald Trump has become one of Bitcoin’s biggest individual holders. His company, Trump Media, purchased $2 billion in Bitcoin earlier this year, giving him an indirect stake of roughly $870 million through his 41% ownership. JUST IN: Forbes says President Donald Trump ""is now one of the largest #bitcoin investors on the planet,"" owning an estimated $870 million in BTC pic.twitter.com/uvCtkvDdv4 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) October 13, 2025 The move mirrors Michael Saylor’s playbook at MicroStrategy, turning Trump Media into a Bitcoin-treasury-style company. Since the purchase, Bitcoin’s price has risen nearly 6%, reflecting growing optimism around the alignment between political influence and crypto adoption. Market watchers now view this convergence, between Wall Street, corporate America, and political power, as the strongest signal yet of Bitcoin’s institutional legitimacy. Bitcoin Technical Setup: Bulls Target $122K Technically, Bitcoin trades in a tight consolidation channel between $112,700 and $117,600. A breakout above $116,100—the key 50% Fibonacci retracement—could trigger renewed bullish momentum toward $119,800–$122,500. The RSI at 56 shows improving buying strength, while lower candle wicks highlight consistent dip accumulation. If resistance holds, BTC could retest $111,200, where strong support aligns with the 23.6% Fib retracement. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview For short-term traders, a close above $116,000 sets up a possible continuation pattern, while institutions continue to treat every dip as a buying opportunity. With sentiment improving, ETF inflows steady, and macro tensions easing, Bitcoin’s path toward $122K may only be getting started. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of Bitcoin on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult, the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $23.4 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013105 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems. If Bitcoin built the foundation, Bitcoin Hyper could make it fast, flexible, and fun again.

53103840,605059,1760396423,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53103840.jpeg,Are XRP Futures ETFs Good For The Price? Expert Breaks Down What You Should Know,https://bitcoinist.com/are-xrp-futures-etfs-good/,"According to crypto analyst Jake Claver, XRP futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) don’t actually help the token’s price. He explains that these products do not purchase real XRP tokens. Instead, they trade contracts that settle in cash. Because they don’t buy or lock away tokens, there is no real demand or supply pressure on XRP. In contrast, spot XRP ETFs could have a much bigger effect. These would require fund managers to buy and hold actual XRP tokens, removing them from circulation. As a result, once these spot ETFs are approved, demand from institutional investors could push prices higher. Jake Claver Explains Why XRP Futures ETFs Don’t Drive Real Demand Jake Claver explains that futures ETFs don’t buy a single XRP token. They are cash-settled contracts, meaning investors are only trading paper agreements, not the tangible asset . Fund managers buy and roll these futures contracts before they expire, and even if delivery ever happens, they immediately sell the tokens right back. This process keeps XRP’s actual supply untouched. Claver calls this “paper trading dressed up in an ETF wrapper.” It looks like a real investment in XRP, but it is not. Since futures ETFs never hold the actual token, they do not create any pressure on XRP’s supply. There is no actual buying demand, and that means no upward push on price. He also notes that this setup only checks a regulatory box for the SEC. The SEC usually wants six months of futures trading before approving any spot ETF. For Claver, XRP’s futures ETFs are part of that early stage, not a significant price driver. Why Spot XRP ETFs Could Trigger A Real Supply Shock While futures ETFs have little real effect, Claver believes spot ETFs could change the game. Unlike futures, spot ETFs require fund managers to buy actual XRP tokens for every dollar invested. Those tokens are then held in custody by regulated institutions like Coinbase or Anchorage, removing them from the open market. Each share of the ETF is backed by real XRP, often between five and fifty tokens per share, and these tokens stay locked unless investors sell. Claver compares this to what happened with Bitcoin. Futures ETFs have existed since 2017, but Bitcoin’s real growth only began when spot ETFs launched in January. According to Claver, XRP is now in a similar position. The market has already met the SEC’s futures requirement, meaning spot ETFs could soon be approved. When that happens, institutional investors will need to buy large amounts of XRP in a market with very low liquidity. The launch of spot XRP ETFs could trigger intense price discovery and what Claver calls a “mathematical supply shock.” He believes the real move for XRP will start when institutions compete for actual tokens in a market that’s already running dry. Futures ETFs may have opened the door, but spot ETFs could be what finally pushes XRP into its next significant phase.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-13 23:00:23

Meanwhile, new altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE are drawing early attention as investors position for the next crypto uptrend. Bitcoin Price Prediction: $150K Remains Possible The Bitcoin price prediction for $150,000 by 2025 remains unchanged, even after a 10% pullback to around $102,759. Analysts say the dip is normal profit-taking after weeks of heavy accumulation. Over $5.6 billion in long positions were liquidated as volatility picked up, but institutional inflows continue to balance the sell pressure. BlackRock, Fidelity, and ARK Invest have expanded their Bitcoin exposure, fueling growing optimism among long-term holders. Geoffrey Kendrick from Standard Chartered still believes Bitcoin could reach as high as $200,000 if institutional capital keeps flowing at this rate. Recent ETF data backs this view. Spot Bitcoin ETFs added $2.71 billion in weekly inflows, bringing total assets to nearly $159 billion , or 7% of Bitcoin’s market cap. That shows big investors are still accumulating through structured products, even as short-term traders exit positions. ETF Activity Shows Confidence in Bitcoin Future Bitcoin’s short-term correction has not stopped ETF investors from buying the dip. Monday alone saw $1.21 billion in inflows, the second-largest single-day total since launch. This pattern suggests long-term allocators are using temporary price drops to build positions. BlackRock’s IBIT fund now holds over $65 billion , leading the market, while Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s GBTC showed smaller outflows. Analysts call this a short-term shakeout, not a reversal. Vincent Liu from Kronos Research noted, “Capital keeps flowing into BTC as allocators double down on the digital gold conviction trade.” With 31 new crypto ETF applications awaiting SEC review, institutional access to Bitcoin is expanding faster than ever, reinforcing why many still call it the best crypto to buy now . Key Bitcoin Price Highlights Bitcoin dropped 10% to $112,759 on Friday on Trump announcement $5.6B in long positions liquidated during the correction. ETFs logged $2.71B inflows this week despite volatility. Analysts hold to the $150K Bitcoin price prediction for 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A New Altcoin Gaining Buzz Before Bitcoin’s Next Move As Bitcoin gears toward a new rally phase, MAGACOIN FINANCE has caught early attention as a best crypto to buy now alongside BTC. Priced under $0.0006 , it is still new with a small market cap, making it one of the few altcoins that could post a 20x surge if momentum builds this quarter. Analysts believe that once Bitcoin breaks above $150K, fresh liquidity will flow into newer coins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Its early stage and compact price range create room for faster expansion compared to larger-cap assets. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE: Price below $0.0006 , early entry opportunity Small market cap, room for rapid expansion Could reach $0.0012 this quarter as Bitcoin rallies Community-backed and building fast How Traders Should Position Now Traders watching this Bitcoin price prediction may see the current dip as a setup for the next leg higher.

Related Reading: ‘BNB Isn’t Crumbling’: CZ Slams Critics Stirring Fear And Doubt According to reports, the court’s approval on October 13 allows the exchange to move ahead with a court-supervised recovery process tied to the $234 million hack that hit the platform in July 2024. Creditor Vote And Numbers Based on reports from the company, the revised plan won broad backing from affected account holders. In an August revote, 95.7% of participating scheme creditors voted in favor, and those votes came from 143,190 participating creditors representing about $196 million in approved claims. The strong turnout and result were used by WazirX to press its case to the Singapore court. Thank you to everyone who supported this difficult phase of WazirX. The Singapore High Court has approved the scheme. Its your support and love that has made this possible ❤️ Now we set out on the next phase to work hard and create value for everyone. We’re here because of YOU… — Nischal (Shardeum) 🔼 (@NischalShetty) October 13, 2025 The hack itself exploited a Safe Multisig wallet in mid-July 2024 and drained a large pool of user funds. Investigations and media accounts linked the breach to advanced cyber operators, and the theft forced WazirX to freeze both crypto and rupee withdrawals while legal options were explored. What Users Will Receive According to several outlets, users may recover a substantial portion of lost funds under the approved plan. Reports have said recoveries could reach up to 55% of the losses, delivered as a mix of immediate liquid payments and so-called Recovery Tokens that represent remaining claims to be fulfilled over time. WazirX has said the first wave of payouts — in stablecoin or USDT equivalent — would follow once the scheme takes effect. That mix means some users will get cash-equivalent payments quickly while others will hold tokens that the company intends to redeem as it regains assets or generates revenue. The plan shifts part of the repayment responsibility to entities inside India to comply with local rules, a change that was highlighted during court rounds. The road to approval was not straight. The Singapore court had earlier rejected a first version of the scheme after judges raised questions over the plan’s structure and oversight. That decision forced WazirX and its advisers to rework the proposal and secure a fresh vote from creditors before returning to court. Related Reading: XRP Traders Face Fresh Selling Pressure As Large Holders Move Out Next Steps And Timeline If the scheme becomes effective under the court’s timetable, WazirX says distributions of available liquid assets will begin within 10 business days. That window is expected to trigger the initial USDT transfers while RTs are recorded for the remainder of approved claims. The exchange will still need to finish legal formalities and coordinate with payment processors and regulators.

Fresh demand from TradFi markets could give XRP the momentum it needs to confirm the breakout of a year-long ascending triangle pattern. Although the weekend’s mass liquidation event invalidated most short-term bullish setups, this wider structure remains in play. XRP / USD 1-day chart, year-long ascending triangle pattern. Source: TradingView. Momentum indicators now refocus attention on the breakout, reaffirming $1.50 as a potential bottom. The RSI has sharply reversed after dipping into oversold territory at 30, while the MACD histogram shows a possible bottom forming below the signal line—signaling buyers are returning as sellers lose steam. The key breakout threshold sits at $3.40, a resistance level that has capped upside throughout the pattern. Once flipped to support, XRP could rally 210% toward its $8 technical target . In the near term, however, traders should watch for a bounce from the $2.70 demand zone to confirm higher support for a sustained uptrend. Looking further ahead, expanding exposure to U.S. TradFi markets and U.S. interest rate cuts to fuel risk-on sentiment could propel XRP toward $15 running into 2026—a potential 500% gain. While the $1,000 XRP price target remains distant right now, these new touchpoints for mainstream capital inflows create a strong foundation for it to be realized long-term. PepeNode: The New Way to Earn This Cycle? Pepe took over the meme world last cycle, turning a viral frog into one of crypto’s biggest cultural moments. Now, feeding off that same energy, a new offshoot, PepeNode ($PEPENODE) , is adding something the original never had: real passive income. Other meme coins have tried before; Shiba Inu brought staking, but PepeNode goes a step further with a fresh mine-to-earn model. Mining without any hardware needed. Just log in, acquire virtual nodes, assemble rigs, and start generating rewards across proven meme coins. The stats look solid too. The presale has already exceeded $1.7 million , while early stakers are still earning up to 740% APY before the next phase begins. With the added fuel of 70% burns on all $PEPENODE spent on nodes and rigs, deflation supports long-term token value. And the timing couldn’t be better. The macro narrative is driving capital back into risk assets like meme coins, making PepeNode’s rewards model even stronger as momentum builds across the sector.

David Namdar, Chief Executive Officer at CEA Industries, said that BNB’s latest positive performance is not unexpected at all. Rather, it is the result of years of investing in robust ecosystem growth initially. BNB is on again The 32nd $BNB burn in July destroyed ~1,595,600 BNB (~$1.024B USD). With $BNB near all-time highs again, I'm expecting the next burn to pack even more firepower. What’s your estimate for the burn amount & USD value? #BNBBurn @BNBNetworkCo — David J. Namdar (@namdar) October 10, 2025 He believes that the market is just catching up to the “credibility, scale, and utility of the BNB ecosystem.” His company holds the world’s largest BNB Coin treasury, owning 480,000 tokens worth over $660 million at the time of writing. BNB Price Prediction: BNB Recovers After Hitting Key Support During Flash Crash BNB volumes have gone up by 72.3% in the past 24 hours, as the token hit a new all-time high at $1,370. This figure accounts for 7% of the asset’s circulating supply, underscoring the strength of the buying spree. The daily chart shows a sharp reaction from buyers as BNB touched $900 , with above-average volume confirming it as a key support level. Today’s spike suggests momentum is building, and further gains could be on the horizon. The $1,350 zone remains a critical resistance. A breakout above it would likely confirm the start of a new leg higher, potentially pushing BNB toward $2,000 as traders recover from Friday’s volatility. While the BNB ecosystem is known for its scalability, it still ranks as the third-largest chain by total value locked (TVL) . But what if the next big breakout doesn’t come from BNB or Solana? A new presale called Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is turning heads by tapping into the massive, untouched value on the Bitcoin network , using Solana-grade speed to unlock staking, DeFi, and more through a purpose-built layer-2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Raises $24M to Launch Its Powerful L2 Since its launch, Bitcoin (BTC) holders have not been able to earn passive income on their investment as the network does not support the launch of smart contracts. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) changes this with the launch of a side chain that will allow investors to hold, stake, and lend their assets to further monetize their holdings. It all starts with the Hyper Bridge – a Bitcoin-native solution that safely holds users’ BTC tokens in a designated Bitcoin wallet. The protocol immediately mints the corresponding amount of assets on the Hyper L2 to give investors access to a growing number of decentralized apps (dApps) built on this Solana-based side chain. By leveraging the power of the second largest smart contracts network in the space, Bitcoin Hyper will overcome the hurdles that have prevented the top crypto from taking over as the top DeFi chain. To buy $HYPER while it is still available at a discounted presale price, simply head to the Bitcoin Hyper official website and link up your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to invest.

However, several market and structural factors suggest that this milestone remains far from reach. Despite community efforts and ecosystem growth, the project’s fundamentals and market position create significant barriers. Without major shifts in supply, utility, and institutional backing, the goal of $0.001 may remain unattainable. Enormous Token Supply and Weak Institutional Adoption The most significant hurdle to Shiba Inu is the enormous amount of tokens of the coin.Despite burning over 41% of the original supply, largely through Vitalik Buterin's significant 2021 burn, approximately 589 trillion tokens remain in circulation. It may take decades or even centuries to bring the supply down to the level that would sustain $0.001 at the present levels. Every price rally requires massive capital inflow, and it is hard to maintain the momentum. Another issue is institutional adoption. Unlike Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Solana , which have attracted significant institutional investment, Shiba Inu's market remains dominated by retail participants. Valour Inc., a Swedish ETP issuer, launched a SHIB-focused exchange-traded product on Sweden's Spotlight Stock Market.The exposure is low and has not been able to lure high institutional capital or enhance credibility among the traditional investors. Leadership Concerns and Limited Ecosystem Utility Transparency and leadership issues have also raised red flags within the Shiba Inu community. Shiba Inu's anonymous leadership structure continues to deter serious institutional capital from entering the ecosystem.The project operates under pseudonymous leadership, with Shytoshi Kusama at the helm. While anonymity initially aligned with crypto's ethos, it now poses accountability concerns. Prominent blockchain projects like Ethereum and Cardano benefit from visible, accountable leaders, something Shiba Inu still lacks. Although it has introduced Shibarium, ShibaSwap, and the Shib Metaverse, experts say these projects have not generated meaningful utility or adoption beyond speculative trading. The development team's attention appears divided across multiple projects. Kusama's previous endorsement of SHY, a separate meme token, redirected community focus and liquidity away from the core SHIB ecosystem. Such actions dilute investor confidence and fragment the community's resources. Internal tensions within the leadership team have surfaced publicly. Developer Kaal Dhairya acknowledged this discord, noting that ”some so-called leaders who benefited from Shiba Inu have walked away.” Team conflicts typically result in delayed development milestones and reduced community trust. The combination of excessive token supply, absent institutional support, anonymous leadership, limited utility, and internal conflicts creates a formidable barrier to the $0.001 target. Each factor independently presents significant challenges.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|BUSINESS|TRADING|ETH,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-13 23:29:57
53104736,https://cryptonews.com/?p=436902,1760398200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/53104736.jpeg,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 13 October – XRP, Cardano, PENGU",https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-price-prediction-today-13-october-xrp-cardano-pengu/,"The market has bounced back strongly over the weekend, with the crypto price prediction for XRP, Cardano, and PENGU looking much more positive today. These coins have all posted bullish gains in the past 24 hours, and their technicals and fundamentals suggest that more rallies will be coming soon. And as the market recovers and enters an increasingly buoyant phase, we take a look at an up-and-coming token that could potentially outperform once it launches in the next few weeks. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Overselling Clears Way for ETF-Driven Push to New ATH XRP has rebounded by 10% in the past 24 hours, although its current price of $2.63 represents an 11% drop in a week and a 15% decline in a month. On the other hand, XRP retains a very solid 392% increase in the past year, with the coin’s fundamentals remaining as bullish as they were prior to last week’s liquidation-fuelled selloff. The most positive thing XRP has on its horizon is the incoming launch of numerous XRP ETFs, which will drive significant institutional investment in the altcoin. And with Ripple continuing to expand its cross-border payment and stablecoin business, demand for XRP is only going to increase in the medium- and long-term. Source: TradingView Its chart today suggests that the coin could bounce back strongly from the weekend’s dip, with its indicators beginning to rise from heavily oversold positions. For example, its relative strength index (yellow) has now risen above 40 after slipping below 30 a couple of days ago, while its MACD (orange, blue) has bottomed out. From here, we may see the XRP price rise consistently, driven by ETF launches and ongoing Ripple growth. It could hit $3 by the end of October, before breaking its current ATH of $3.65 by the end of November. Crypto Price Prediction: Cardano ($ADA) – L1 Development and Canary ETF to Boost ADA by 2026 At $0.7216, ADA has risen by 12% in the past 24 hours, although it remains down by 15% in the past week and by 22% in the last 30 days. These may be disappointing declines, but as with XRP, this overselling has created the conditions for a big rally in the near future. ADA is also looking forward to the launch of a multi-asset ETF, offered by Canary, and once it goes live, it could result in a big boost. There’s also the fact that Cardano is one of the most well-established and reputable layer-one networks in crypto, with its platform undergoing regular development and updating . While it remains relatively small compared to the biggest L1s (e.g., Ethereum and Solana), its steady development will boost its utility and adoption over time, boosting the ADA price in turn. Source: TradingView And today, ADA’s chart also reveals a coin that is beginning to bounce back after some very heavy selling. Based on how oversold it has been recently, we could see the ADA price return to $1 by the end of the month, while making it back above $3 by the end of the year. Crypto Price Prediction: Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) – Meme Token to Surge on the Back of NFT Sales and ETF PENGU has posted a substantial 16% gain today, but at $0.02551, it remains down by 18% in a week and by 30% in a month. Although it has faced challenges over the past couple of months, PENGU’s prospects appear very promising. For one, Canary has filed to launch an ETF that would invest in PENGU and also in Pudgy Penguins NFTs. This would provide a massive boost to PENGU, especially when so few meme tokens (with the exception of Dogecoin) are likely to have their own ETFs anytime soon. PENGU also benefits from the ongoing popularity of the Pudgy Penguins NFT series, which boasts total sales worth $714.6 million , as well as a current daily volume of $5 million. Its chart today suggests that it too could be breaking out soon, given how much the market has been overselling it. Source: TradingView If it could decisively break through the $0.030 resistance level, then it we could witness a surge towards former highs. It may reach $0.040 by the middle of November, while entering 2026 above the $0.10 level. PEPENODE Raises $1.8 Million as Anticipation Builds for Mine-to-Earn Token With the market rebounding strongly from the weekend’s selloff, now may be an ideal time to invest in newer tokens, which could post outsized gains once the end-of-year rally gets into full swing. One new token that looks particularly good in this respect is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), which is an Ethereum-based mine-to-earn token that has begun generating lots of hype. So close… but so far. Time to upgrade those nodes to get some more https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/dlsXwoKUoE — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) October 11, 2025 Launching later in the year, PEPENODE will enable its users to build their own virtual mining rigs. They can use these rigs to earn rewards in other meme tokens (such as Pepe and Fartcoin), while they can increase their rewards by spending PEPENODE to acquire more nodes. This mechanic could create strong demand for PEPENODE, and judging by the amount it has raised in its presale—over $1.8 million—investors already appear interested. This is also helped by the fact that you can stake PEPENODE for staking yields, which are currently just above 700% APY. Investors can join its presale at the official PEPENODE website, where it currently costs $0.0011005, although this price will continue to rise until the sale ends.

The consumers are alleging that the deal violates anti-trust laws, and has led to Microsoft artificially inflating prices of its generative AI services. The proposed class action was filed in a San Francisco federal court and claims that Microsoft used a secret, exclusive cloud computing deal with OpenAI to illegally limit the supply of computational power essential to run OpenAI’s popular platforms, ChatGPT included. The lawsuit further argues that this alleged restriction on the market has hurt millions of users by driving subscription prices up while diminishing product quality. The consumers accuse Microsoft of market manipulation Microsoft has invested more than $13 billion in OpenAI to date. The tech giant first announced a $1 billion partnership in 2019, in a deal that established its Azure as the key cloud computing service for the ChatGPT maker. This initiative, the plaintiffs are positive, was used to corner the emerging generative AI market. According to the court papers, the agreement allowed Microsoft to take advantage of OpenAI’s ground breaking success for its own benefit, at the same time while it developed competing products like Microsoft Copilot. It further alludes to a price war among AI services experienced earlier this year, emphasizing that ChatGPT prices remained “substantially higher” than its competitors, allegedly because of Microsoft’s market manipulation, according to the plaintiffs. According to a Reuters article , while the lawsuit admits that some of the tightest restrictions have recently eased with OpenAI reportedly beginning to buy compute power from Google in June this year, it however warns that the threat remains in place. The plaintiffs describe the arrangement as “a sword of Damocles over OpenAI wielded by one of its principal competitors,” suggesting that Microsoft may re-impose the restrictions any time. Now, the consumers are seeking unspecified damages for alleged overcharges dating back to the public launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. Additionally, they are requesting a court order to permanently stop Microsoft from enforcing the allegedly anti-competitive limits on OpenAI. Microsoft has been under some regulatory scrutiny for some time. The tech giant recently narrowly escaped the risk of a multibillion-euro fine after agreeing on a deal with EU to loosen the grip of its workplace chat service, Teams, on the professional software market. This followed over a year of antitrust bickering which was triggered by complaints from rival platforms, which later led to the EU accepting commitments regarded as binding from the Microsoft. The commitments were in relation to Microsoft being required to sell versions of its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites without Teams, as the Cryptopolitan previously reported. As for the latest case, both Microsoft and OpenAI had no immediate comment on the lawsuit, neither did attorneys at Bathaee Dunne for the 11 consumers who filed the lawsuit had a comment immediately. OpenAI, which was founded as a nonprofit in 2015 but has since restructured into a for-profit entity, is not named as a defendant in the case.

The swift rebound underscores renewed buyer confidence following last week’s sharp correction from record highs. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Pushes Higher Again – Has It Finally Found Its Short-Term Bottom? While MNT remains below its $2.84–$2.86 all-time high, the strong recovery suggests bulls are regaining control, potentially setting the stage for another push toward the upper range if momentum holds. Spot activity exploded, with daily trading volume up more than 60% to about $1.2 billion, while futures open interest climbed 9% to $269.7 million, a signal that speculative demand is accelerating alongside spot buying. MNT's price bounces back following major losses on the daily chart. Source: MNTUSD on Tradingview Fundamental Tailwinds: RWAs, Stablecoin Liquidity, and Exchange Distribution Beyond the chart, Mantle’s rally is grounded in clear catalysts. The network’s Tokenization-as-a-Service (TaaS)stack is pulling real-world asset issuers on-chain, while the launch of USD1, a new stablecoin building on Mantle, is injecting fresh liquidity and utility into its DeFi rails. Distribution is another edge: Mantle’s deepening Bybit integration (treasury programs, listings, and roadmap alignment) is funneling sustained order flow, not just one-off hype. Analysts also highlight Mantle’s modular design (execution on Mantle with EigenDA for data availability and OP-stack upgrades) that lowers costs and improves throughput, important for tokenization, trading, and payments use cases. Can Mantle (MNT) Bulls Clear $3? The Levels and Scenarios Momentum favors further upside as a decisive close above $2.87 could open the door to $3.00, with extended targets near $3.60 if volume and open interest continue to rise. On the downside, $2.50–$2.55 is initial intraday support, followed by the must-hold $1.90–$2.00 zone; losing that would risk a deeper retrace toward $1.60–$1.75 where buyers last reloaded. For now, breadth (spot + derivatives), rising participation, and a tight, orderly trend argue for trend continuation rather than a blow-off top.

This is important, as it coincides with a time when the crypto market is starting to recover from a massive correction over the weekend. XRP To Rebound From Major Support According to Rietveld, XRP’s price is approaching an important support zone around $2.785, which could serve as the foundation for a strong bullish reversal. He noted that XRP is likely near its local bottom and that a rebound from this level would be normal, where cryptocurrencies surged shortly after major corrections. The analyst noted that traditional equity markets, especially in the United States, are hitting new all-time highs, even as the broader crypto market is consolidating. This divergence has occurred multiple times before, but liquidity eventually rotates from the stock market into digital assets and causes explosive upward movements. Rietveld pointed out that a similar pattern was observed in early March, April, and May, when stocks peaked just before Bitcoin and altcoins went on a major rally. Institutional And Sovereign Interest Building In Crypto Rietveld’s analysis also highlighted increasing institutional appetite for cryptocurrencies, which he believes will be a major catalyst for the next market expansion. He cited data showing that over 60% of institutional investors plan to increase their exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies beyond what they already have. This trend, he said, is a very good sign. Rietveld also mentioned that aside from private institutions, several sovereign wealth funds, including those in Luxembourg, Denmark, and the United States, are preparing to allocate portions of their portfolios to Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Particularly, he referenced news about Luxembourg, which r ecently confirmed that it is assigning 1% of its sovereign wealth fund to Spot Bitcoin ETFs. The analyst described this as the early stage of a broader capital migration worth trillions of dollars from traditional markets into cryptocurrencies. Rietveld’s comments extended beyond technicals and market inflow trends. The analyst offered a strong critique of the global financial system by accusing central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve, of mismanagement and corruption through unchecked money printing and debt accumulation. In his view, the fiat currency system is unsustainable, and cryptocurrencies like XRP are the best option for financial independence. He encouraged investors not to succumb to fear or market uncertainty, noting that the periods of widespread panic, like the current one, are the best buying opportunities. Those who are patient and are accumulating at these low prices are the ones positioning themselves to benefit the most when the next strong crypto rally rolls in.",XRP|altcoins|bitcoin|Levi Rietveld|ripple|Spot Bitcoin ETFs|US Federal Reserve|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|BTC|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-14 00:00:34

Concerns about the government’s forthcoming budget were behind the slowdown, new figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) show. Overall, total retail sales increased 2.3% in September over the same month last year — after climbing by 3.1% in August and 2.5% in July. Sales at stores open for at least a year, excluding newly opened ones, also declined to 2% from 2.9%. Retailers say a mix of inflation, tax uncertainty, and unpredictable weather has put the brakes on spending. One-quarter of consumers are holding out as Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves gets set to unveil her first full budget in November, research shows. The new administration is attempting to strike a balance between promoting growth and fulfilling green investment promises, while also carrying an increasingly heavy public debt load. The uncertainty is clearly having an impact on household activity, according to Helen Dickinson, Chief Executive of the BRC. Sales at food retailers rose modestly, driven more by inflation than volume. Shoppers were increasingly trading down to cheaper brands or buying in smaller quantities, KPMG’s retail tracker said. Non-food sales, including clothing and household goods, dropped steeply — roughly 0.7% in September compared with 1.8% the previous month. Unseasonably warm weather also impacted demand for cold-weather items, such as coats and boots. Retailers had hoped to see earlier gains from autumn collections, but consumers continue to wait until it’s more seasonally appropriate before sprucing up their wardrobes. Shops prepare for tough ‘golden quarter’ Now retailers are entering into what is called the “golden quarter” — the all-important last three months of the year when profits are driven by Christmas shopping . But the outlook is mixed. John Lewis Partnership Plc has unveiled its largest-ever seasonal recruitment drive, taking on 13,700 temporary workers at its department stores, warehouses, and Waitrose supermarkets. The company is well-positioned to meet its full-year profit targets, Chairman Jason Tarry said, even after reporting a loss in the first half. Likewise, the UK’s second-biggest grocer, J Sainsbury Plc, which owns Argos, is to recruit 19,000 temporary workers to cope with the holiday season rush. The supermarket giant anticipates an explosion in online orders and in-store visits this November and December, but cautions that shoppers are likely to remain picky. Linda Ellett, UK Head of Consumer, Retail and Leisure at KPMG, said spending remained highly targeted as shoppers remained cautious. She noted that retailers were relying on promotions and carefully planned product ranges to attract customers and boost sales in the lead-up to the Christmas season. Technology sales offered one bright spot, with a lift from the introduction of Apple’s new iPhone and Apple Watch models in mid-September. But other discretionary categories, such as home decor and apparel, were order of magnitude slower. Meanwhile, shop price inflation increased to 1.4% in September, up from 0.9% in August – its highest since February, according to BRC data. Higher import costs and energy prices continue to squeeze margins. Tax concerns contribute to pressure on retailers. Retailers are also dealing with potential tax ripple effects in Reeves’ November budget, beyond the impact on consumer spending. The government is considering changes to business rates — the property tax paid by shops — that could disproportionately hit large stores. The BRC has cautioned that introducing a new tax band for big retailers could lead to store closures and job losses, particularly among department store chains already struggling with high costs. Small businesses are especially vulnerable. Some warn that a further rise in business rates would push them into closure. The Federation of Small Businesses has called for the Treasury to freeze or cut the levy next fiscal year in an effort to help stop further decline on Britain’s high streets. Retail analysts say the current slowdown illustrates a precarious balancing act for policymakers. Tax increases could threaten to erode the already fragile consumer confidence, but postponing fiscal reforms may exacerbate Britain’s budget shortfall. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The incident has also sparked debate about the unique features that separate decentralized finance (DeFi) from traditional finance (TradFi), and whether DeFi can truly remain permissionless when its front-end gateways comply with sanctions regimes designed for TradFi. Uniswap faces backlash over blanket restrictions The issue was made public on X by Artem Chystiakov, a Ukrainian DeFi builder known as Arvolear, who posted an open appeal to Uniswap Labs after finding that the platform’s front end was unavailable for Ukrainian IP addresses. He said the reason Uniswap has been giving so far is that “Ukraine is present on the OFAC sanctions list provided on the U.S. Department of the Treasury website.” However, Chystiakov pointed out that Uniswap has misinterpreted the information, adding, “It is clearly stated that no goods, services, or technology must be provided to both the so-called DNR/LNR and the Crimea regions of Ukraine. Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities/regions are not mentioned whatsoever.” Chystiakov said he had first raised the issue with Uniswap support under ticket number “169045,” but nothing has been done on the matter, so he went public with an open letter calling for the company to lift the ban on Ukraine. The restrictions appear to stem from Uniswap Labs’ sanctions compliance tools, which use IP-based geolocation to prevent users in certain regions from accessing the front end. The issue has also made its way to Change.org where a petition titled “Restore Uniswap Access for Ukrainian Citizens,” was filed. So far, the signatories have been relatively few but has since gathered support from across the DeFi community. Compliance clashes with crypto’s open access ethos Uniswap’s Terms of Service explicitly prohibit use from jurisdictions under U.S. economic or trade sanctions. According to the policy published on its support site , users may not access the interface if they are located in or affiliated with such regions. This language mirrors obligations set by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which maintains sanctions lists covering entities in Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk, but not the rest of Ukraine. Critics say that Uniswap Labs, which develops and hosts the popular user interface for the Uniswap protocol , has overreached in its compliance efforts. The future of access and accountability in DeFi Chystiakov insists that the problem is not about a lack of alternatives; Ukrainian users can still access the protocol directly via blockchain explorers, third-party interfaces, or VPNs, but about principle. He wrote on X that “It’s more than just UI availability, rather true crypto values they fail to follow.” According to Chystiakov , “It’s as simple as ‘the face of defi’ project failing to hold its promise of global accessibility and censorship resistance. Absolutely pathetic and coward behavior… How can we claim to change the financial world when we can’t even dare to change ourselves? DeFi idea is cracking right here.” The Ukrainian DeFi community is now urging Uniswap Labs to implement more targeted compliance measures, blocking only the sanctioned regions and individuals rather than the entire country. As of the time of writing, neither Uniswap nor its founder, Hayden Adams, have publicly sent a response to Chystiakov post on X. However, the company has previously defended its use of compliance tools. Still, the incident has revived a fundamental question for the DeFI movement, which is, can a protocol truly be “open and permissionless” if its main access point is subject to unilateral corporate or political control?

Industry leaders like Solana (SOL) are continuing to dazzle, delivering lightning-fast settlements and a burgeoning ecosystem that entices both retail and institutional investors However, as altcoins compete for headlines, there emerges a new contender, building momentum stealthily and turning heads among investors that seek the unconventional. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) finds itself, right now, in Phase 6 of its presale, having sold out in excess of 65% already, signaling a wave of confidence in a project designed to deliver exponential growth. Mutuum Finance blurs together strategic innovations and a roadmap that makes it a serious contender to become a leader among tomorrow’s best altcoins to deliver come 2025. With the momentum behind the presale picking pace and a solid footing being established, Mutuum Finance has a strong likelihood to re-establish the definition of a next 100x cryptocurrency. Solana Price Analysis Sol (SOL) currently faces a vital 4-hour support level of $190.8, retaining just above essential lows following a recent rout. Momentum indicators continue to point towards the downside, implying further losses until a clear positive reversal sign, i.e., a pin bar or engulfing candle that has the potential to haul SOL towards $209.2 in the near term, appears. Erosion of support for $190.8 could bring lower levels of $180.7 and even $168.2 into play, retaining the near-term perspective bearish until SOL can convincingly retake and maintain levels higher than $209.2. While market players focus on these key movements, the markets’ quest for strong, high-potential altcoins beyond the established names is gaining momentum, an area seeing fledging project Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gain a lot of attention. Mutuum Finance Takes Off During Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) remains in good stride, its sixth presale now 65% full. Investor appetite remains extremely strong, with over 16,910 investors putting over $17.25 million worth into the project so far. Those are all-time records for MUTM and reflect the unstopping global confidence globally into the platform’s DeFi long-term prospect and potential ecosystem. Follow-up to its quest to scale its decentralized ecosystem, Mutuum Finance’s latest news is that it will release its lending and borrowing protocol . Version 1 (V1) of the Platform will launch on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 of 2025. The initial launch will contain major features including liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and the liquidator bot that will serve as a building block to a healthy, efficient, and scalable DeFi architecture. The protocol has also instituted an in-real-time system of risk and liquidity management that are integrated beneath the same to be able to function and stay stable in the event of distress. The protocol also liquidates automatically illiquid or under-collaterallised positions, as well as capping levels of exposure to risk to avoid contagion from happening between pools of assets. ETH and stablecoins are anchor collateral coins that give stabilizing base support to higher-risk coins. Adaptive reserve factor allocation across classes of assets optimizes ultimate risk versus reward optimization through enhanced general system coverage for the reserves. In addition, the Mutuum Finance protocol also hedges the volatility in real-time together with the liquidity and adjusts dynamically to suit changing market conditions. It dynamically offsets Exposure management and short-selling pressures to avert forced liquidation so that even the most extreme market corrections have healthfully balanced the collateralization. Systemic risk in Real-Time DeFi, thus, is contained and the DeFi platform stable, strong, and consistent in spite of volatile market conditions. Top Altcoin to Invest in 2025 As Solana (SOL) crosses key supports around $190.8, altcoin investors seeking high-potential altcoins are focusing on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Its Phase 6 presale has already raised more than $17.25 million from more than 16,910 investors, and 65% of tokens sold already suggest good market confidence. Its upcoming Sepolia Testnet lending and borrowing protocol, consisting of liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot, along with real-time risk and liquidity management, makes MUTM a scalable, secure, and efficient DeFi ecosystem. Pre-emptive investors seeking to capitalize on the next 100x crypto gain must invest in MUTM tokens now before the presale advances.

The drop came amid what analysts describe as the largest liquidation event in crypto market history, wiping out billions in leveraged positions across major exchanges. While bulls briefly lost control during the panic, ETH has since begun to stabilize, with renewed buying interest emerging near key demand zones. Related Reading: Bitmine Receives 23,823 Ethereum From BitGo As Institutional Accumulation Continues Onchain analyst Maartunn highlighted that leverage is once again building up on Ethereum, signaling that traders are returning to the market following the reset. According to his data, open interest on ETH surged significantly over the past 24 hours — a sign that speculative activity is resuming as volatility cools. This renewed leverage could set the stage for another decisive move, either fueling a short-term relief rally or inviting further liquidations if momentum fades. The coming days will be crucial for Ethereum, as bulls attempt to reclaim the $4,000 level to confirm a sustainable recovery. Market sentiment remains cautious but optimistic, with onchain data showing large holders and institutions continuing to accumulate ETH despite recent turbulence — a potential signal of long-term confidence in the asset’s resilience. Leverage Returns to Ethereum: A Risky Revival In Market Activity According to Maartunn, Ethereum’s Open Interest has surged by +8.2% within the past 24 hours — a clear sign that leverage is flowing back into the market. This rapid rise comes just days after the largest liquidation event in crypto history, where overleveraged traders were wiped out during the sudden crash. Now, it seems many are trying to “trade their money back,” reigniting short-term volatility and speculation across exchanges. Maartunn notes that while these so-called “revenge pumps” often create strong intraday rallies, they rarely sustain long-term momentum. Historically, around 75% of similar leverage-driven recoveries tend to revert, leading to renewed pullbacks once liquidity and funding rates normalize. Only about 25% manage to extend into lasting uptrends, typically when supported by fresh spot buying or renewed institutional inflows. This data underscores the precarious balance Ethereum currently faces. The jump in Open Interest signals revived market participation, but also introduces the risk of another wave of forced liquidations if traders overextend their positions. For now, ETH’s short-term recovery remains largely fueled by derivatives activity rather than spot demand. The next few days will be pivotal in determining Ethereum’s direction. If price holds above the $4,000 region with sustained volume, it could confirm that bulls are regaining control. However, a sudden drop in Open Interest or sharp funding spikes could signal that the rally is overextended — setting the stage for another correction.

The daily chart shows that ETH quickly rebounded from the 200-day moving average (red line), confirming it as a major area of demand. Price is now consolidating near $4,150, attempting to build momentum after a strong bullish candle on high volume — a potential sign that buyers are regaining control. However, ETH faces immediate resistance near the $4,250–$4,300 zone, which coincides with the 50-day moving average (blue line). This area previously acted as strong support, and reclaiming it would be essential for confirming a shift back into bullish structure. The 100-day moving average (green line) is now flattening, reflecting the market’s cautious sentiment following the massive liquidation event. Related Reading: Solana Network Activity Drops 50%: Is The Rally Built On Weak Fundamentals? If bulls manage to sustain price action above $4,000, the next targets lie near $4,500 and eventually $4,750. Conversely, failure to hold the 200-day MA could open the door to a deeper retest of $3,600 or lower. For now, Ethereum’s recovery remains technically constructive, but it must overcome these resistance levels to confirm that the recent rebound is more than just a short-term reaction to oversold conditions.

Total crypto market cap jumped roughly 5%, with over $550 billion flowing back into digital assets after a panic sparked by talk of 100% U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Bitcoin (BTC) reclaimed $115,000 (+3%), Ethereum (ETH) climbed to $4,142 (+8.2%), and XRP traded near $2.54. High-beta majors joined the rebound: BNB surged 14% and Solana (SOL) gained 7%. Trade War Fears Ease as China Clarifies Export Rules and Trump Softens Tone The bid returned as China’s Ministry of Commerce clarified its rare-earth export controls are legal but not a ban, with compliant civilian applications to be approved. President Donald Trump also struck a more conciliatory tone, posting that the U.S. wants to “help China, not hurt it,” easing fears of a near-term trade war escalation. The shift follows the largest crypto liquidation on record, over $19–$20 billion in 24 hours, as over-levered longs were flushed in Friday’s cascade. Prediction markets now price sharply lower odds of full tariffs by Nov. 1, aligning with Monday’s broad risk-on bounce. Institutions Buy The Dip As ETF Momentum Steadies From a deeper perspective, the flows stayed constructive. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw only minor daily outflows ($4.5M on Friday) and remain net positive by nearly $6B for October, signaling continuing institutional demand via regulated vehicles. On-chain watchers also flagged Marathon Digital adding 400 BTC ($46M) through FalconX in early Monday trade, consistent with treasuries opportunistically accumulating into weakness. Sentiment gauges improved from “extreme fear,” while social data on Stocktwits flipped bullish for BTC, with some traders eyeing a retest of $140K if macro tailwinds persist. Levels To Watch: Support, Resistance, And Catalysts Technically, BTC’s swift recovery places $114,000–$117,000 as near-term support, with resistance layered around $121,000–$126,000 (the recent ATH zone). ETH faces supply near $4,200–$4,300, while XRP watchers highlight $2.60–$2.65 as a hurdle to unlock momentum toward $3.00. Macro remains the key swing factor, as any renewed tariff saber-rattling or U.S. data surprises (especially amid a patchy government-statistics calendar) could reignite volatility.

This significant rise has resulted from increased sales of costly electric vehicles and luxury cars. During this month, data released highlighted that American car purchasers spent an average of $50,080 on new vehicles. This spending represents a 3.6% increase from last year. Record EV sales, fueled by the expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit, further pushed prices upward, making new cars less affordable for many consumers. Erin Keating points out the influence of wealthier families on the American car market Erin Keating, an Executive Analyst and Senior Director of Economic and Industry Insights at Kelley Blue Book’s parent company, Cox Automotive, noted that the days of the $20,000 car have disappeared from the market. Based on her argument, the current car market is greatly influenced by wealthier families. According to Keating, many cost-conscious car buyers will wait for vehicle price drops or opt for used cars. This cautious behavior stems from the surge of new car prices, which have increased more than 25% over the last five years. At this time, Americans attracted more attention in the car market, making significant purchases of expensive trucks and SUVs while ignoring affordable options that once appealed to first-time buyers. Following these price hikes , reports from S&P Global research revealed that s everal young buyers have shifted their preferences to used vehicles or are maintaining their older ones longer, as the average age of cars on the road has exceeded twelve years. Additionally, individuals buying new vehicles secure seven-year or longer loan term extensions. Meanwhile, according to reports from researcher Edmunds.com, the average car payment per month escalated to $754 in the third quarter. One in five individuals purchasing a new automobile is spending a monthly budget of more than $1,000 on car loans. Concerning the federal tax credit, many consumers had rushed to make EV purchases to be eligible for the credit, resulting in price hikes. Moreover, this escalation in sales led battery-powered vehicles to account for a record 12% of the US car market. Kelley Blue Book reported that electric models recorded an average selling price of $58,124 in September. Luxury vehicles, on the other hand, also recorded impressive sales in September. To illustrate this, over 60 models worth average prices exceeding $75,000 made up 7.4% of all new car sales that month. This reflected a surge from 6% the previous year. Trump’s extensive tariff policies raise tension in the car market The full effects of President Donald Trump’s tariffs on inflation have not been fully realized, as automakers absorb much of the added costs. Regarding this situation, analysts raised concerns that carmakers would eventually have to pass these costs on to consumers to sustain their profits. “Tariffs have established new cost pressures for the car industry,” Keating said, pointing out a powerful combination of EVs and high-end automobiles as the main influencers of the pricing trends in September. In the meantime, Ford Motor Co. anticipated that its profits would drastically decline this year amid the escalating effects of Trump’s tariffs. This highlights the considerable changes in Washington policies interfering with the car industry. Apart from Ford, the automaker, based in Dearborn, Michigan, forecasted that its adjusted earnings before interest and taxes would decline by as much as 36% this year . This reduction is mainly due to the net tariff effect of $2 billion, which equals roughly $500 million more than Ford had estimated earlier. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The company said it purchased Ether more aggressively during the recent market volatility, bringing its total holdings to over 3 million ETH, representing roughly 2.5% of the cryptocurrency’s total supply. BitMine’s average purchase price for the recent acquisitions was $4,154 per token. Between Friday and Monday, the firm acquired 202,037 ETH, valued at approximately $827 million, according to a statement on X. This increase pushed BitMine’s overall crypto portfolio to $13.4 billion, which includes $12.9 billion in cryptocurrency and “moonshot” investments, 192 Bitcoin, $104 million in cash, and a $135 million stake in Nasdaq-listed Eightco Holdings. The purchases came amid a sharp market correction on Friday, which triggered around $19 billion in liquidations over the weekend. Tom Lee, chairman of BitMine and head of research at Fundstrat, said the market downturn created an opportunity to buy Ethereum at discounted prices. “The crypto liquidation over the past few days created a price decline in ETH, which BitMine took advantage of,” Lee said. He added that the company is now “more than halfway towards our initial pursuit of the ‘alchemy of 5%’ of ETH.” Lee also highlighted the broader investment logic, stating, “Volatility creates deleveraging, and this can cause assets to trade at substantial discounts to fundamentals, or as we say, ‘substantial discount to the future,’ and this creates advantages for investors, at the expense of traders.” BitMine’s approach may influence other institutional investors to adopt similar long-term accumulation strategies. Interest in the company extends beyond crypto investors, as its stock, BMNR, was recently the 22nd most widely traded on U.S. markets, averaging over $3.5 billion in five-day trading volume as of Friday. Despite this, BMNR’s stock price fell 11% over the past five days, following a short position by Kerrisdale Capital, which criticized BitMine’s business model as “on its way to extinction.” The company’s dual focus on cryptocurrency and traditional equities reflects a broader trend of institutional participation in digital assets.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-10-14 01:06:54

The world’s biggest memory chipmaker and South Korea’s most valuable company is riding the artificial intelligence wave that has reshaped the global semiconductor market. Samsung’s operating profit in the July-September quarter jumped to 12.1 trillion won ($8.5 billion), surpassing analysts’ forecasts of about 9.7 trillion won, according to preliminary results released on Tuesday. Revenue increased to 86 trillion won, a steep gain from the previous year’s 67.4 trillion won. AI surge drives record chip profits The performances represented Samsung’s best since early 2022, and suggested that its chip division was rebounding strongly from a two-year industry downturn. Now, the recovery in memory chip pricing and global AI development is causing profits to leap. Average DRAM prices increased by roughly 172% year-over-year in the third quarter, and NAND flash memory also posted double-digit growth, according to TrendForce. These chips are crucial for the AI servers that underpin large language models, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, as well as data centers operated by tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. Samsung has been scrambling to narrow the gap behind its smaller competitor, SK Hynix, which currently dominates the market for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in AI accelerators. Most of Nvidia’s HBM3E chips, which are crucial for training and running AI models, are provided by SK Hynix. But Samsung is quickly gaining ground. It recently received certification from Nvidia for its 12-layer HBM3E chips and secured an order from AMD, enabling it to tap into the fast-growing AI server market. The certification will enable Samsung to initiate mass shipments within the next few months, positioning it to compete head-to-head with SK Hynix and Micron, according to people familiar with the industry. Investors bet big on Samsung’s future in AI. The strong quarter has helped lift investor confidence that Samsung is on track to regain leadership in the semiconductor industry. Its shares have surged more than 60% since the beginning of June, driven by hopes for AI demand and a recovery in memory prices. Both Samsung and SK Hynix recently signed deals to provide chips for OpenAI’s “Stargate” project, an ambitious initiative to construct one of the world’s largest AI data centers. Stargate’s estimated demand could potentially consume 40% of global DRAM production, underscoring the significant demand for processing power from AI. Park Jae-kyung, an analyst at Daishin Securities, said Samsung’s profit surge marked a watershed moment, noting that the company was not only recovering but also re-emerging at the forefront of the AI revolution. In memory as well as beyond, Samsung’s display and mobile divisions performed well. But premium smartphone panel earnings benefited from robust sales of foldable devices and OLED panels. The company’s Galaxy Z Fold6 and Flip6 models had helped prop up the mobile income line, contributing to a less lopsided growth picture among divisions. Analysts predict that Samsung’s semiconductor profit will surge through 2025, driven by faster-than-anticipated global demand for AI servers. The company informed investors on its most recent earnings call in July that it anticipated strong growth in high-end memory products for servers in the second half of the year. Still, risks remain. Samsung faces challenges related to geopolitical tensions, export controls, and supply chain disruptions — especially after the United States recently tightened restrictions on exporting chip technology to China. The company has also been under pressure to improve its profitability in the foundry business, where it trails its Taiwanese rival, TSMC. Analysts from Morgan Stanley, Citi, and Goldman Sachs have all updated their Samsung share price forecasts in the past week to reflect high, continued memory prices and better chip yields. According to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Masahiro Wakasugi, Samsung has returned to the game, describing the nexus of AI-driven demand, squeezed supply, and improved technology across its products — as well as high interest rates — as having created a “double whammy” for profitability.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. China Renaissance’s reported plan to raise $600 million for a BNB-focused investment vehicle , with Binance founder Changpeng Zhao's YZi Labs investing alongside, may look like a straightforward bet on Binance’s ecosystem. But Singapore-based market maker Enflux argues it’s something deeper: a signal that Asian institutions are building a different kind of crypto exposure than their Western counterparts. “Regional capital allocators are seeking exposure to infrastructure tokens that drive transaction flow, not just store-of-value assets,” Enflux said in a note to CoinDesk, framing the China Renaissance move as part of a broader divergence between East and West. BNB is a great example of this. Binance, of course, isn't a listed company, but BNB serves as something very close to a stock. Its value is a proxy for market sentiment and confidence in Binance. While U.S. and European markets have leaned into tokenized Treasuries, funds, and real-world assets, Asia’s capital markets are increasingly constructing crypto-native liquidity networks centered around exchange, staking, and transaction infrastructure. ""This ties into the broader shift where Asian capital markets are building out their own layer of crypto-native liquidity networks while Western markets tokenized TradFi,"" Enflux continued. The logic is straightforward. Value should be accrued by activity, not scarcity. Tron's move to create a publicly listed company to give investors listed exposure to activity on the TRX network – which is heavily used to send USDT around Latin America – follows the same train of thought. If Enflux’s thesis is right, the China Renaissance fund could be an early blueprint for Asia’s next wave of institutional products: permanent capital vehicles that hold the pipes of the crypto economy, not just its gold. Market Movement: BTC: BTC is trading above $114,500, relatively flat as the market stabilizes after last weekend's volatility. ETH: ETH rose 1.5% to $4,230 as network activity picked up, even as U.S.-listed Ethereum ETFs saw $118 million in outflows. Gold: Gold surged 2% to a record $4,103 an ounce as renewed U.S.-China trade tensions and expectations of further Fed rate cuts drove investors toward safe-haven assets. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed Tuesday as Trump’s conciliatory remarks on China failed to offset renewed trade tensions, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 1.34%.

53109413,604864,1760407211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53109413.jpeg,Bitcoin Market Structure Resets For A Fresh Start: Data Hints At Price Recovery,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-market-structure-resets-for-a-fresh-start/,"Bitcoin has faced one of its most volatile weeks in recent history, plunging to $103,000 on Friday in a dramatic 15% drop that erased billions in market value within hours. The sudden sell-off triggered widespread liquidations across the crypto market, wiping out leveraged positions and sparking panic among traders. However, price action is now showing early signs of recovery, with some analysts suggesting that this sharp correction could pave the way for a stronger, more sustainable uptrend. According to a recent report from CryptoQuant, this event marks one of the most severe market resets ever recorded, with potential ripple effects expected to shape price behavior for months to come. Following Bitcoin’s peak last week, open interest — a measure of futures market activity — dropped sharply by $12 billion, from $47 billion to $35 billion. This represents one of the largest contractions in derivatives positioning seen in recent years. Such massive deleveraging historically precedes a healthier market structure, as excessive speculation is flushed out. While volatility remains elevated, the combination of reduced leverage and renewed inflows from stablecoin reserves could position Bitcoin for a gradual recovery — if demand holds steady and buyers regain confidence in the coming sessions. Market Reset Clears the Path For Bitcoin The CryptoQuant report highlights a notable shift in Bitcoin’s market structure following Friday’s massive correction. Funding rates, which had been declining steadily for months, briefly turned negative during the capitulation event — a clear sign that traders flipped bearish in panic. However, these rates have since normalized to modestly positive levels, indicating that sentiment is stabilizing and short-term speculation is being replaced by more balanced positioning. Another key metric, the Bitcoin Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR), also dropped significantly after reaching levels not seen since 2022. This sharp reduction points to a widespread deleveraging across derivatives markets, as overexposed traders were forced to unwind positions. Such events often act as a “reset” for market health, flushing out excessive leverage and setting the stage for more sustainable growth. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) fell to its lowest point since April. This decline implies that stablecoin liquidity — or the potential buying power sitting on the sidelines — has risen substantially relative to Bitcoin’s market capitalization. Historically, when stablecoin liquidity increases after major sell-offs, it often signals an accumulation phase that precedes recovery. BTC Attempts Recovery After Sharp Correction Bitcoin is showing signs of stabilization after its steep decline to the $103,000 level on Friday. The daily chart reveals that BTC has rebounded sharply, currently hovering around $115,000. This recovery suggests that buyers are stepping in around key demand zones, defending the 200-day moving average — a historically critical level for maintaining long-term bullish momentum. Despite the bounce, Bitcoin remains below the $117,500 resistance, a level that previously acted as strong support. Bulls must reclaim and close above this zone to confirm a continuation toward $120,000 and potentially retest the $125,000 range. Until then, the price remains within a consolidation phase following an extreme liquidation event. The moving averages (50-day and 100-day) show a near-term bearish crossover risk, reflecting the market’s cautious tone. However, the quick rebound from last week’s capitulation indicates strong underlying demand and the potential for a higher low formation — a constructive technical sign. If BTC manages to hold above $112,000 and regain $117,500, momentum could shift back in favor of buyers. Conversely, failure to sustain these levels could expose the market to another retest of lower supports around $108,000.

These Bitcoin Charts Could Be Ones To Watch In a shock to the market, Bitcoin ended last week with a steep crash, falling from above $122,000 to below $110,000. The coin managed to make some recovery on Sunday, and that rebound has held so far into Monday. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Selling: $50 Million Exiting Wallets Every Day However, while BTC appears to be rebuilding its structure, its direction remains unclear, as noted by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in an X thread. Maartunn has shared a few key charts that could determine whether the recovery will hold or fade. First, the analyst has revealed a chart that points out a similarity between the recent Bitcoin price action and the November 2021 bull market top. As displayed in the above graph, BTC broke above its weekly resistance with the recent price rally, but immediately fell below the line after the crash. A similar failed breakout also took place back in November 2021. According to Maartunn, such a trend typically signals exhaustion. On-chain data also suggests the cryptocurrency is currently trapped below a notable resistance level, as the chart for the UPRD shows. The UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) here is an indicator that tells us about the amount of Bitcoin that was last purchased/transferred at the various price levels that the asset has visited in its history. From the metric’s chart, it’s visible that a significant amount of supply has its cost basis between $117,500 to $120,000. The holders of these coins would naturally be underwater right now, so there is a chance that if BTC recovers to their break-even level, they might panic sell, fearing going into losses again. Given the scale of the supply involved, selling pressure of this kind could be notable on a retest of the range, potentially making it a major resistance barrier for the asset. A support level that could be key is the average cost basis or Realized Price of the short-term holders (STHs).

53109577,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=835315,1760407423,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53109577.jpeg,Bhutan migrates national digital ID to Ethereum,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bhutan-migrates-digital-id-to-ethereum/,"The Kingdom of Bhutan is gradually migrating its National Digital Identity (NDI) platform to the Ethereum blockchain, marking a landmark step in the digital transformation agenda for this Himalayan nation. The move makes Bhutan the first country to base its national identity system on a public blockchain, thereby enhancing transparency, trust, and citizen control over their personal information. The migration from NDI to Ethereum is at the core of Bhutan’s vision to create a decentralized, secure, and self-sovereign digital community. This integration will enable the NDI to generate verifiable credentials, sign digital documents, and prove identity natively on Ethereum’s public, distributed network. By building its core identity system on Ethereum, Bhutan aims to reduce its reliance on centralized databases, a common vulnerability to hacking, manipulation, and data leakage. This philosophy for the nation is in sync with India’s “technology with values” philosophy, which encourages integrity and ethics, inclusion, and empowerment through innovation. The launch of Bhutan’s National Digital Identity on Ethereum marks a significant milestone in establishing the country as a leader in the realm of digital government, according to Prime Minister Lyonchen Tshering Tobgay. He said that by utilizing Ethereum’s globally distributed and decentralized infrastructure, they aimed to enhance the security, transparency, and availability of Bhutan’s critical systems. He added that this milestone underscored their vision of creating an interoperable and user-owned identity system, one that connects Bhutan to global ecosystems while upholding His Majesty the King’s vision of a secure, inclusive, and digitally empowered society. Shortly after the 2023 election, Bhutan’s National Digital Identity (NDI) was established, the first and only national system worldwide to offer self-sovereign identity (SSI) at a population-wide scale. His Royal Highness also emerged as the country’s first digital citizen during the launch, highlighting Bhutan’s leadership in people-centered digital innovation. Bhutan gains global recognition through blockchain collaboration Aya Miyaguchi, the president of the Ethereum Foundation , praised Bhutan’s move as a way blockchain could be employed to create open and inclusive systems that work for citizens — and not just institutions. Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, also praised the initiative, stating that decentralized digital identity is a fundamental building block for the future of the internet and that he is pleased to see innovative teams, such as uPort, developing self-sovereign solutions. He added that Bhutan’s adoption of an open architecture built on Ethereum demonstrated the purpose behind creating the platform — to drive meaningful and positive change through open-source technology. From the outset, Bhutan has sought to establish a transparent network that serves its citizens as well as those beyond its borders. Anchoring in a public blockchain enables the Government of Bhutan to allow its citizens to verify their credentials from anywhere in the world, while preserving privacy and control. This differs from many remote identification systems based on opaque, centralized infrastructure controlled by governments or the private sector. The government aims to migrate the entire NDI platform onto Ethereum by early 2026. When it’s fully rolled out, Bhutanese citizens will be able to prove certain things about themselves without disclosing their personal information, as cryptographic proofs are used instead of the usual ID checks. Driving innovation through blockchain Besides its national identity system, the country is studying more extensive uses of blockchain technology in various aspects of governance and social services. In 2025, the nation also hosted a decentralized applications (dApp) hackathon in Paro, with a partnership from the Ethereum Foundation. The event was attended by over 70 developers who worked on creating digital tools based on Bhutan’s identity framework. The projects included verifying land records, implementing transparent citizen feedback systems, and tracking provenance for locally made products. Bhutan’s NiaoDai Interchain has also formed a global partnership with iDen2, a decentralized identity protocol, to jointly develop Phenix—a modular identity solution for use worldwide. The partnership will aim to combine Bhutan’s real-world experience in deploying a national digital identity with the iDen2 open-source technology, enabling other countries and organizations to replicate Bhutan’s success.

Polymarket Bettors Eye November Funding Bill Timeline According to the poll , 84% of participating Polymarket bettors believe that Congress will pass a funding bill by November 30. Meanwhile, just 30% of bettors predict a funding bill will advance through Congress by October 31. Lastly, just 1% of bettors estimate a deal will be done by October 15, particularly given the short timeline. The Polymarket poll’s latest figures come as the U.S. government shutdown nears entering its third week after U.S. lawmakers failed to agree on key spending bills ahead of the October 1 deadline. Thousands of federal employees have already been laid off because of the political dysfunction, with Vice President JD Vance telling Fox News in a recent interview that more jobs will be on the line if Congress does not find a solution. “The longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be,” Vance said. “To be clear, some of these cuts are going to be painful.” During a Cabinet meeting at the White House last Thursday, Trump vowed to cut “only” Democratic programs in response to the shutdown.

On Friday, Bitcoin plunged to $103,000 within minutes, triggering a wave of panic across the market as overleveraged positions were wiped out and Altcoins lost more than 80% of their value in the same period. The sudden correction left investors questioning whether this marked the end of the bull phase or simply a reset before the next leg up. Related Reading: Bitmine Receives 23,823 Ethereum From BitGo As Institutional Accumulation Continues Despite the chaos, key onchain data paints a more optimistic picture. Top analyst Darkfost highlights that the supply of ERC-20 stablecoins continues to grow, especially on Binance, the exchange that remains the undisputed leader in trading volume. This surge in stablecoin reserves suggests that liquidity is quietly rebuilding beneath the surface, as investors prepare for re-entry rather than full-scale retreat. In crypto cycles, rising stablecoin balances often act as a precursor to renewed buying pressure, indicating that capital is sitting on the sidelines, waiting for the right moment to return. As volatility cools down, the stablecoin supply could play a decisive role in shaping the market’s next major move. Liquidity Surges As Binance Hits Record High Reserves Darkfost shared data showing that the ERC-20 stablecoin supply on Binance has seen a massive surge over the past two months, rising by $10 billion since August, from $32 billion to $42 billion. This marks the highest level of ERC-20 stablecoin reserves ever recorded on the exchange, a significant milestone that signals renewed liquidity inflows into the market. This sharp increase in stablecoin reserves suggests two major dynamics at play. First, investors continue to deploy capital into the crypto market through stablecoins, a common precursor to renewed accumulation and trading activity. Second, Binance’s dominance in global trading volume remains unchallenged, with increasing user participation demanding more available liquidity on the platform. While part of this increase may stem from investors rotating capital back into stablecoins after the recent market crash, this explanation alone doesn’t capture the full picture. Binance typically adjusts its reserves in response to active trading behavior, meaning this spike is more likely linked to rising demand and capital readiness than to risk aversion. Despite recent volatility and sharp liquidations, the data show that liquidity is flowing back in, positioning the market for a potential rebound. If this trend continues, stablecoin accumulation on Binance could serve as the foundation for the next major leg up across Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem. Related Reading: From $254M To $78.5B: Tron USDT Growth Drives Network Valuation Stablecoin Dominance Spikes: Capital Rotates After Market Crash The chart shows a sharp rise in stablecoin dominance, which recently spiked above 9% before cooling to around 8.15%. This move reflects a rapid flight to liquidity following last week’s extreme volatility, when Bitcoin plunged below $105K and altcoins saw significant losses. Historically, such spikes in stablecoin dominance indicate that traders are exiting risk assets to hold stablecoins, waiting for market stabilization before redeploying capital. Interestingly, the pullback from 9% to 8% suggests that the panic phase may already be easing. The market appears to be entering a reaccumulation phase, where stable capital is preparing for the next major move. On a technical level, stablecoin dominance remains well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, signaling persistent strength in liquidity reserves. Related Reading: Solana Network Activity Drops 50%: Is The Rally Built On Weak Fundamentals? If dominance continues to consolidate near these highs while Bitcoin stabilizes, it could create the foundation for renewed inflows into risk assets. In other words, money hasn’t left the market—it’s waiting on the sidelines. Stablecoin dominance above 8% generally marks periods of strong capital positioning, often preceding new market uptrends. The current setup, therefore, highlights growing investor caution but also a buildup of dry powder that could soon reenter the market.

As fear grips Bitcoin, analysts are turning to Cardano (ADA) and Ethereum (ETH) as the best crypto to buy now . Bitcoin Price Prediction: Fear Index Sparks Buying Debate The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has crashed to 27 , its lowest level in six months, after President Trump announced a 100% tariff on Chinese imports . The sudden move triggered panic across the crypto market. Bitcoin dropped sharply to $102,000 before bouncing back above $112,000 on Binance’s futures. Over $19 billion in long and short positions were wiped out within 24 hours. Analysts say this marks one of the most volatile trading sessions since April. Despite the chaos, some traders now see opportunity. Bitwise Europe’s research head, Andre Dragosch , said on X that the firm’s sentiment index dropped to its lowest since mid-2024, calling it a contrarian buying signal . In past cycles, similar drops in sentiment preceded rebounds. Bitcoin’s previous fear low in April saw prices rise more than 30% within weeks. Analysts now eye a short-term recovery zone between $110,000 and $120,000 , making BTC one of the best crypto to buy now. Bitcoin Market Snapshot Fear & Greed Index: 27 (Fear) 24h liquidations: $19.27 billion Short-term BTC recovery zone: $110K – $120K Analysts call it a contrarian buying signal Cardano Price Prediction: Whales and Retail Traders Build Together Cardano (ADA) dropped nearly 60% in one day during the tariff-driven selloff but quickly rebounded to around $0.65 . Despite heavy losses, whales and retail traders are quietly adding to their holdings. Data from Santiment shows wallets holding 10M–100M ADA increased by 0.14 billion ADA , equal to about $89.6 million at current prices. This steady build-up during a crash suggests conviction among large holders. The Money Flow Index also shows inflows returning, meaning buyers are gradually stepping in. ADA’s Hydra scaling upgrade continues to drive optimism, capable of processing up to 1 million transactions per second (TPS) in tests. Analysts believe this could attract new dApp developers and help ADA stabilize once the market regains balance Cardano Highlights ADA rebounds to $0.65 after 59% drop Whale wallets added $89.6M ADA Hydra upgrade enables 1M TPS in tests Traders eye recovery toward $1 if sentiment improves Ethereum Price Prediction: Steady Use Supports $10K Target Ethereum remains active despite selling pressure. On-chain data shows over 9.5 million daily contract calls , the highest since mid-2024. The RWA (real-world asset) sector on Ethereum now holds $11.7 billion , up from $1.5 billion a year ago. Institutional activity through spot Ether ETFs and corporate treasury accumulation has helped maintain engagement on the network. Analysts view this as proof of lasting demand. Traders note that ETH could briefly dip under $4,000 , but many expect recovery toward $10,000 once volatility fades. The ETH network’s reliability , with zero downtime since inception, continues to make it the go-to blockchain for stablecoin and RWA projects.

Bitcoin As Non-Asset Class? The firm issued a stark warning to its clients, advising them to steer clear of Bitcoin. HL emphasized that the cryptocurrency holds “no intrinsic value” and should not be included in their life savings or retirement strategies. In a statement, HL acknowledged that while Bitcoin has delivered positive long-term returns, it has also undergone extreme volatility, making it a riskier investment compared to traditional assets like stocks and bonds. The firm asserted that Bitcoin does not qualify as an asset class and lacks the characteristics necessary for inclusion in growth or income portfolios. Furthermore, HL noted that performance assumptions for cryptocurrency are challenging to analyze, reinforcing the view that it lacks intrinsic value . Hargreaves Lansdown is the third major financial institution to issue such a warning recently, joining Deutsche Bank and Elliott Management in expressing skepticism about the value proposition of cryptocurrencies. Just days prior, Deutsche Bank informed its clients that Bitcoin is “backed by nothing,” although it anticipates that the cryptocurrency may eventually be adopted as a reserve asset by central banks. In January, activist investor Elliott Management cautioned its clients about an “inevitable collapse” of Bitcoin, citing its lack of substance as an asset. Crypto Market Rebounds While Hargreaves Lansdown’s assessment of Bitcoin’s volatility and risk is valid, it is important to note that Bitcoin has also proven to be a profitable investment. Following the recent collapse in prices, Bitcoin has shown signs of recovery, priced at around $114,200, reflecting a 83% increase year-to-date (YTD), significantly outpacing the S&P 500 . Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, also climbed on Monday nearly 9% to hover around $4,130. After dipping below the $4 trillion threshold on Friday, the total market capitalization rebounded to reach approximately $3.9 trillion. The price fluctuations followed a disastrous Friday that saw over $19 billion evaporate from traders’ positions, marking the largest one-day liquidation event . Within a span of 24 hours, Bitcoin lost more than $200 billion in market capitalization and dropped nearly 10% in value, while Ethereum suffered an even steeper decline of almost 14%.

ETH is now showing positive signs and might rise further toward the $4,400 level. Ethereum started a recovery wave above the $4,000 and $4,120 levels. The price is trading above $4,120 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $4,150 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it trades above $4,320. Ethereum Price Gains Traction Ethereum price started a recovery wave above the $3,850 level, like Bitcoin . ETH price formed a base and was able to recover above the $4,000 level. The price cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the main drop from the $4,758 swing high to the $3,422 low. The bulls were able to push the price above the $4,200 pivot level. Besides, there is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $4,150 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $4,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,250 level. The next key resistance is near the $4,400 level. The first major resistance is near the $4,440 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the main drop from the $4,758 swing high to the $3,422 low. A clear move above the $4,400 resistance might send the price toward the $4,500 resistance. An upside break above the $4,500 region might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,550 resistance zone or even $4,650 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,300 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,150 level and the trend line. The first major support sits near the $4,120 zone. A clear move below the $4,120 support might push the price toward the $4,050 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,950 region in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,880.

Analyst Egrag Crypto has presented a structured comparison, drawing on past events to illustrate where the current movement sits in XRP’s broader historical framework. His latest chart highlights three major declines, coupled with a striking liquidation statistic that distinguishes this downturn from prior episodes. #XRP – Keeping It Simple: Major Drops (Binance Chart): December 2017: #XRP dropped by 99%. SEC Lawsuit (2021): We saw a 77% drop. Recent Drop: Just yesterday, XRP fell by 78% Liquidation Stats COVID Crash: $1.2 billion in liquidations. FTX Crash: $1.6 billion… pic.twitter.com/9unpMSdksJ — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 12, 2025 A Pattern of Major Corrections In his breakdown, Egrag points to three critical instances of deep corrections in XRP’s trading history. The first occurred during late 2017, a period marked by extreme volatility across the crypto market, in which XRP suffered a near-total retracement. The next major decline followed the regulatory challenges that emerged in 2021, when XRP dropped by approximately 77%. The most recent move, recorded just days ago, saw XRP fall by 78%, placing it beside previous substantial declines that preceded key structural shifts in the chart. These comparisons are not presented for dramatic effect but to establish that large-scale drawdowns have been a recurring feature of XRP’s price behavior. Egrag’s focus is on the consistency of these declines and the phases that followed them, rather than on short-term sentiment. Liquidations on an Unprecedented Scale One of the most notable elements in Egrag’s observation is the comparison of liquidation figures across major market shocks. During the COVID crash, liquidations reached around $1.2 billion. The collapse tied to the FTX exchange saw approximately $1.6 billion in liquidated positions. The latest event, however, far exceeded registering an estimated $19.6 billion in total liquidations . This scale is significant because it reflects a market heavily exposed to leveraged positions. The forced unwinding of these positions contributed to the severity of the movement, amplifying selling pressure beyond standard market activity. While past liquidation events were impactful, none approached the level seen in this latest episode, raising broader questions about leverage management across the digital asset space. Technical Implications and Market Sentiment Egrag’s analysis does not attempt to forecast immediate direction but instead underscores a recurring technical theme: historically, extreme corrections have often been followed by extended accumulation phases and, in some cases, substantial upside movements. The emphasis is placed on the aftermath of crashes—how price structures evolve once extreme selling pressure subsides. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Rather than issuing directives, the analyst frames the present moment as one of decision for market participants. Individuals may choose to exit positions to remove uncertainty, or they may hold through volatility with the expectation of long-term structural recovery . The message is clear that each choice carries responsibility, and no external commentary should dictate personal financial decisions. Stability and Perspective Within Volatility While the current decline has understandably raised concern, Egrag’s presentation is rooted in perspective rather than alarm. By placing recent events alongside historical data, he encourages a careful view of XRP’s movement, acknowledging both risk and possibility. The reminder to remain steady is aimed not at dismissing market stress but at emphasizing informed decision-making over reaction. For long-term holders , the analysis serves as a data-driven reference point. For newer participants, it illustrates how extreme volatility formed part of XRP’s market cycle. What follows will depend on broader market conditions, regulatory advancement, and sentiment recovery. However, the historical framework provided offers a structured basis for interpretation rather than speculation.

The week closed quietly with just $159 million in outflows on Friday. With this, 2025’s year-to-date inflows have climbed to $48.7 billion, already exceeding last year’s record total. Digital asset exchange-traded products (ETPs) saw explosive trading last week, as they registered a record $53 billion in weekly volume. This figure is nearly double 2025’s average pace. Friday’s $15.3 billion turnover marked the highest single-day figure ever recorded. Following the tariff-driven market drop, total assets under management declined 7% from the previous week’s peak to $242 billion. Altcoin Flows Stay Resilient Investors poured $2.67 billion into Bitcoin over the past week, which pushed cumulative 2025 inflows to $30.2 billion. Though strong, that figure remains short of 2024’s $41.7 billion benchmark, according to the latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report. Friday’s market sell-off generated record trading volumes of $10.4 billion; however, the actual daily net flow was modest, standing at just $0.39 million. Meanwhile, Ethereum attracted $338 million in inflows last week but faced significant $172 million outflows on Friday, which was the largest among all digital assets. This indicates that investors viewed it as particularly exposed during the correction. Meanwhile, enthusiasm around the upcoming US ETFs for Solana and XRP appears to be waning, as inflows eased to $93.3 million and $61.6 million, respectively. Investment flows into altcoin-based products were modest but steady. For instance, Chainlink pulled in $3.2 million while Sui recorded $2.3 million in inflows. Cardano and Litecoin added smaller amounts, receiving $0.8 million and $0.2 million. Multi-asset products, on the other hand, deviated from the broader positive sentiment, registering significant outflows of more than $35 million for the period. In regional terms, the United States overwhelmingly dominated inflows, drawing more than $3 billion in fresh investments. Switzerland came next with $132 million, followed by Germany at $53.5 million and Australia at $9.9 million. Canada posted smaller inflows of $3.8 million. Meanwhile, Sweden led outflows with $22 million, while Brazil and Hong Kong reported declines of $10.1 million and $9.3 million each. Market Still on Shaky Ground Financial markets were rattled overnight after tensions between the US and China escalated unexpectedly. The sell-off began when President Trump accused China of “holding the world captive” through sweeping export restrictions on rare earth elements. Investors quickly fled risk assets, which pushed the Nasdaq down 3.5% and the S&P 500 down 2.7%. Bitcoin wasn’t spared either, as it briefly collapsed to $102K before recovering to $115K amid a record $19 billion in liquidations. According to QCP Capital, with global liquidity tightening and policy risks soaring, “market positioning remains defensive across risk assets heading into the new week.” The post Bitcoin Dominates Fund Flows With $2.67B Influx, But Still Trails 2024’s Peak appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Bitcoin|Ethereum|Solana|XRP,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|ASIA,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-10-14 03:33:44

These are projects that combine strong fundamentals, transparent presales, and community growth. Among them, BullZilla ($BZIL) stands out with measurable ROI, followed by established players and high-potential newcomers such as Bitcoin Cash (BCH), MoonBull, La Culex, Avalanche (AVAX), SUI, Stellar (XLM), and Chainlink (LINK). Each project offers its own angle of innovation and return potential. From presale transparency to cross-chain expansion, these coins are being closely watched by analysts anticipating the next bull run. 1. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Presale Turning Heads with Massive ROI BullZilla ($BZIL) has quickly gained recognition as one of the most promising new 1000x coins of 2025. Currently in Stage 6 (Going Full Send!), BullZilla is redefining transparency in presales with detailed price stages and verifiable progress metrics. The current price sits at $0.0001524, with over $880,000 raised, 2,900 holders, and 31 billion tokens sold. The project’s structured pricing model ensures steady growth and predictability for early investors. So far, those who joined in earlier stages have seen an ROI of 2550.43%, while the ROI potential from Stage 6C to listing is projected at 3358.93%. At this stage, a $1,000 investment earns approximately 6.56 million $BZIL tokens, valued at $34,000 at the listing price of $0.00527141. The next stage, 6D, will bring a 4.37% price increase, from $0.0001524 to $0.00015907, continuing the presale’s upward momentum. BullZilla’s roadmap includes staking utilities, NFT integration, and cross-chain expansion. Its consistent delivery, strong community engagement, and precise ROI tracking make it a standout among new 1000x coins. The BZIL crypto presale is attracting retail and institutional investors alike who are drawn to verifiable returns and community-driven growth. 2. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Returning to Form with Payment Utility Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has experienced a strong resurgence during this year’s Uptober rally. As one of Bitcoin’s earliest forks, BCH remains focused on fast, low-cost peer-to-peer payments. It recently surpassed $600 for the first time since 2021, driven by renewed adoption among global merchants and payment processors. According to CoinMarketCap, BCH’s transaction activity has increased as investors diversify away from high-fee networks. Its growing relevance in everyday payments and developing economies positions it as a top contender among the new 1000x coins with practical use cases. With increasing global demand for scalable payment options, BCH’s combination of stability and efficiency makes it a strong player for investors seeking value and adoption-driven growth. 3. MoonBull (MOBU): The DeFi-Powered Meme Coin on the Rise MoonBull (MOBU) is currently in its presale phase and is redefining meme coin economics. Built on Ethereum, it merges humor with high-performing DeFi mechanics. Each transaction contributes to liquidity, burns tokens, and rewards holders through reflections. The project’s 23-stage scarcity model ensures that the token’s value rises progressively. It’s staking APY of 95%, instant referral bonuses, and locked liquidity demonstrate a strong focus on sustainability. MoonBull’s smart contract has been verified for security, and its roadmap includes cross-chain staking and an AI-based staking optimizer that dynamically reallocates rewards. MoonBull represents the next generation of meme coins that go beyond hype. With its combination of DeFi integration and high-yield staking, it’s becoming one of the most talked-about new 1000x coins among crypto enthusiasts and DeFi investors. 4. La Culex (CULEX): An Upcoming Presale Built for Longevity La Culex (CULEX) is an upcoming presale project that blends meme energy with long-term tokenomics. With a total supply of 200 billion tokens, the allocation is 45% for presale, 15% for staking rewards, 20% for liquidity locked for 18 months, and 2% for burns. The project features 32 presale stages, each increasing token scarcity and price, aiming for a listing value of $0.007. Investors can earn up to 80% APY staking rewards through the Hive Vault and benefit from a 12% referral system on the Bite Chain. La Culex ensures safety with audited contracts, locked liquidity, and zero transaction tax. Its structured growth model and secure ecosystem make it one of the new 1000x coins to watch before it goes live. 5. Avalanche (AVAX): Scaling DeFi and Real-World Assets Avalanche (AVAX) has established itself as a key player in scalable blockchain infrastructure. With sub-second transaction times and low fees, it’s a hub for DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise blockchain adoption. Recent partnerships with global financial firms have positioned Avalanche at the center of real-world asset tokenization (RWA). According to Decrypt, its subnets are being adopted by institutions aiming to issue digital securities and tokenized debt. AVAX’s deflationary model, growing developer base, and institutional collaborations put it among the top new 1000x coins with strong long-term fundamentals. As tokenization expands, Avalanche is likely to play a central role in bridging traditional finance with decentralized ecosystems. 6. SUI: Redefining Speed and Developer Accessibility SUI continues to impress as one of the fastest-growing Layer-1 networks. Built with the Move programming language, it offers near-instant finality and unmatched scalability, capable of handling over 300,000 transactions per second. Its architecture enables developers to build high-performance dApps and games with low latency. According to The Block, SUI’s adoption among Web3 gaming studios has increased rapidly, making it a preferred choice for NFT marketplaces and DeFi protocols seeking efficiency. With continuous ecosystem growth and developer incentives, SUI has secured its position among the most promising new 1000x coins. Its combination of performance and developer-friendly infrastructure sets it apart in the crowded Layer-1 race. 7. Stellar (XLM): Expanding Global Financial Access Stellar (XLM) continues to be a cornerstone in global payment innovation. Its mission to connect banks, businesses, and users through fast, affordable cross-border transfers has made it a favorite for institutions adopting blockchain technology. Recent collaborations with global fintech companies have expanded Stellar’s use in stablecoin transfers, remittances, and tokenized asset issuance. The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) continues to support ecosystem growth by partnering with financial institutions across developing regions. With increasing real-world adoption and low transaction fees, XLM remains one of the new 1000x coins with long-term sustainability. Its focus on accessibility and inclusivity makes it a reliable hold in any diversified portfolio. 8. Chainlink (LINK): Powering Real-World Data in Blockchain Chainlink (LINK) continues to dominate as the leading decentralized oracle network. It provides trusted data to power smart contracts across blockchains, making it indispensable for DeFi, insurance, and supply chain systems. The introduction of the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) has strengthened its role in connecting multiple blockchains. Chainlink’s recent partnerships with major banks and enterprises highlight its growing real-world importance. As on-chain and off-chain worlds converge, LINK’s role in securing reliable data will only expand. For investors focused on infrastructure-driven growth, Chainlink remains one of the strongest new 1000x coins with real utility and institutional demand. Conclusion The next generation of new 1000x coins is emerging across diverse sectors, from DeFi and payments to infrastructure and presales. BullZilla leads the pack with its clear ROI model and transparent growth structure. Bitcoin Cash, MoonBull, and La Culex add momentum through scalability and tokenomics, while Avalanche, SUI, Stellar, and Chainlink deliver utility and institutional relevance. For investors seeking early entry before the market’s next significant surge, these eight projects represent a balanced mix of innovation and potential.

BTC plunged to as low as $103K before rebounding, leaving traders and analysts assessing whether this correction marks the beginning of a deeper retracement or just another shakeout. Adding intrigue to the situation, a mysterious whale, known by many as a “BitcoinOG,” profited more than $160 million in just 30 hours during the crash. The trader reportedly executed large short positions on both Bitcoin and Ethereum, perfectly timing the market’s downturn. Now, in a surprising twist, this same entity is doubling down. Lookonchain data shows that the trader has opened additional short positions totaling 1,423 BTC—worth approximately $161 million at current prices. The move has sparked widespread speculation across the crypto community. While some see it as a calculated hedge anticipating further downside, others interpret it as a potential market manipulation attempt. Regardless, Bitcoin’s ability to recover amid such heavy short positioning will be a key test of market resilience in the days ahead. Bitcoin OG Moves Another 100 BTC: A Signal or a Setup? According to data from Lookonchain, the mysterious trader known as “Bitcoin OG” has just deposited another 100 BTC—worth approximately $11.48 million—into Kraken within the past hour. Depositing BTC to exchanges like Kraken often signals a potential intent to sell or to use the coins as collateral for derivatives trading. Given that this trader has already built a massive short position—currently estimated at 1,423 BTC ($161 million)—this additional transfer may suggest that the individual is either increasing leverage or preparing for further downside. It’s a classic playbook move: send BTC to an exchange ahead of shorting or market-making activity. However, such transactions can also act as psychological catalysts, amplifying fear across the market. When large wallets move funds after volatile events, it often triggers panic among retail traders, who interpret it as a prelude to another sell-off. The coming days will therefore be crucial. If Bitcoin holds above $113K–$115K despite these bearish signals, it could indicate that selling pressure is being absorbed by strong hands. Conversely, failure to maintain this support could trigger another cascade of liquidations toward the $108K–$110K zone. In short, the market is entering a decisive phase—where Bitcoin’s resilience will either confirm recovery or pave the way for another sharp leg down. Price Faces Resistance as Recovery Slows Bitcoin’s daily chart shows the market struggling to regain momentum after last week’s dramatic sell-off. Following the drop to $103K, BTC rebounded sharply but now faces resistance near the $117,500 level — a critical zone that previously acted as both support and resistance throughout August and September. The price is currently trading around $114,300, sitting just below the 50-day moving average (blue line), while the 100-day (green) and 200-day (red) moving averages remain slightly below, supporting the current structure around $112K and $107K, respectively. This alignment suggests that BTC remains in a medium-term uptrend, but the current consolidation could define the next major move. If Bitcoin manages to close above $117,500, it could confirm a bullish continuation toward $122K and eventually retest the $125K level. Conversely, failure to break through resistance may trigger renewed selling pressure, potentially dragging the price back toward $110K or even $107K. Momentum indicators show that buyers are cautious, with limited follow-through after each rally attempt. For now, Bitcoin’s outlook remains neutral to slightly bullish—but traders should watch for confirmation of direction around the $117.5K mark, which will likely determine whether the next leg is a recovery or another corrective wave.

Bitcoin On-Chain Fundamentals Losing Strength? According to a CryptoQant Quicktake post by contributor TeddyVision, Bitcoin’s Network Activity Index has been consistently trending below its 365-day moving average (MA) for most of 2025. The decline shows a structural slowdown in the Bitcoin network’s on-chain usage. Related Reading: Bitcoin Decouples From Miner Flows With -0.15 Correlation – What It Means For Price? For the uninitiated, the Bitcoin Network Activity Index measures how actively users are interacting on-chain – tracking metrics like transaction counts, active addresses, and transfer volumes. A rising index suggests growing organic usage and adoption, while a declining one indicates slowing network engagement. To recall, the Bitcoin network activity surged ahead of price back in 2023-24. At the time, Bitcoin price witnessed organic expansion in price, primarily driven by genuine on-chain usage. However, the trend has changed significantly in 2025. For the most part, this year saw Bitcoin liquidity circulating off-chain, while on-chain traffic has dwindled. As a result, the Network Activity Index has tumbled below the 365-day MA. That said, BTC price has held between $100,000 to $120,000, creating a widening gap between the digital asset’s valuation and network fundamentals. The CryptoQuant analyst remarked: Capital keeps rotating, but not expanding – most flows happen off-chain, through ETFs, custodians, and synthetic exposure, while genuine on-chain demand remains subdued. TeddyVision stated that the recent capital rotation in the Bitcoin market is not indicative of its strength, but rather it is just “momentum running on fumes.” The analyst added that when the Bitcoin network usage stagnates while price keeps on increasing, valuations stop reflecting adoption and start tracking assumptions. To conclude, although Bitcoin is not collapsing just yet, the fall in its network usage activity speaks volumes about its falling fundamentals. That said, all may not be over for BTC just yet. In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto noted that the Bitcoin bull market is not over yet. The analyst stated that a Bitcoin bear market will only start if it loses the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the weekly chart. Q4 2025 Bullish For BTC? While the recent flash crash to $102,000 may have spooked BTC bulls, several industry experts are still confident that the digital asset will continue to make new record highs in the last quarter of 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Prediction: Why The Price Will Cross $140,000 By The End Of October Crypto market expert Ash Crypto recently predicted that BTC is likely to hit as high as $180,000 in Q4 2025. Similarly, fresh data from Binance suggests that BTC could be on track to $130,000. In the same vein, noted crypto analyst Egrag recently forecasted that BTC only needs a minor catalyst to surge to $175,000. At press time, BTC trades at $114,076, up 0.8% in the past 24 hours.

53113347,https://timestabloid.com/?p=86280,1760414563,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Projected XRP Price If Pension Funds Allocate 5% into XRP,https://timestabloid.com/projected-xrp-price-if-pension-funds-allocate-5-into-xrp/,"XRP could record one of its most significant price increases if American pension funds diversify even a small share of their holdings into digital assets. Estimates suggest that allocating just 5% of total U.S. pension assets to XRP could push its value above $70 , positioning it among the top beneficiaries of institutional adoption in the cryptocurrency market. Growing Institutional Interest in Crypto Institutional investors, including pension funds and retirement managers, are gradually showing more openness to cryptocurrencies. In recent years, both defined-benefit plans and 401(k) accounts have started experimenting with small exposures to digital assets. These allocations are typically introduced through spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or through companies with direct crypto exposure, such as MicroStrategy (MSTR). So far, the level of investment remains conservative, ranging between 0.1% and 1% of portfolio allocations. Many fund managers continue to exercise caution due to crypto’s volatility and perceived risk. Critics, including the advocacy group Better Markets, have described such moves as potentially irresponsible for retirement accounts. Still, the number of public entities allowing crypto investments is rising. As of April 2025, reports indicate that at least 17 U.S. states had either authorized or were reviewing proposals to permit crypto investments for reserve funds, while 16 states had done the same for their pension systems. Pennsylvania notably introduced legislation in late 2024 allowing its state treasurer and pension programs to gain exposure to Bitcoin. A study published by the CFA Institute, initially in 2022 and updated in 2024, revealed that 94% of state and local pension plans and 62% of corporate pension funds now hold crypto-related investments, whether directly or indirectly. Policy Changes Under the Trump Administration A major policy shift came when President Donald Trump issued an executive order instructing the Department of Labor (DOL) to review and update its guidelines regarding alternative investments within 401(k) retirement accounts. This order overturned the DOL’s earlier position from May 2022, which had warned against crypto allocations in retirement funds due to potential volatility and fraud risks. The revised policy now gives fiduciaries more flexibility to include digital assets, which could encourage broader participation from pension institutions. Should this happen, pension funds could start to allocate small but impactful portions of their portfolios to alternative assets, like XRP, potentially reshaping the token’s market dynamics. XRP Price Projection Based on 5% Allocation According to data from the Investment Company Institute, total assets under U.S. pension funds and retirement accounts reached $45.8 trillion as of June 30, 2025. These figures encompass both defined-benefit and defined-contribution plans, including 401(k). Presently, XRP trades near $2.60 , with a market capitalization of approximately $147.6 billion and a circulating supply of about 59.9 billion tokens. If pension funds were to direct 5% of their collective holdings, around $2.29 trillion, into XRP, the resulting capital inflow would significantly expand the asset’s market capitalization. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market behavior in crypto often exhibits a multiplier effect, where capital inflows trigger price increases larger than the initial investment. Analyst Dom previously noted that XRP has historically shown multiplier effects of over 200x. Even applying a conservative 2x multiplier, a $2.29 trillion investment would elevate XRP’s total valuation by roughly $4.58 trillion. Adding this figure to the current capitalization of $147 billion results in a projected market value near $4.73 trillion. Dividing this by XRP’s 60 billion token supply yields an estimated price of approximately $78.70 per coin. While such projections remain hypothetical, they illustrate the scale of potential growth if institutional investors fully embrace digital assets. A modest allocation from the pension fund sector alone could drastically reshape XRP’s market position , especially if regulatory conditions continue to evolve favourably.

The price is now showing positive signs but faces a major hurdle near the $2.620 level. XRP price is attempting a recovery wave above the $2.50 zone. The price is now trading above $2.520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.650 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it settles below $2.50. XRP Price Struggles Near Resistance XRP price found support and started a strong recovery wave above $2.20, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to climb above the $2.250 and $2.320 levels to enter a positive zone. There was a decent increase above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.05 swing high to the $1.40 swing low. However, the price seems to be facing a major barrier near the $2.650 level. Besides, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.650 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $2.520 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.60 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.650 level and the trend line. It is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.05 swing high to the $1.40 swing low. A clear move above the $2.650 resistance might send the price toward the $2.70 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.720 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.80. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $2.650 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.550 level. The next major support is near the $2.50 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.50 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.30. The next major support sits near the $2.2680 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $2.220. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now near the 50 level.

Despite strong community enthusiasm and years of promotion, several fundamental and structural challenges make such a milestone highly improbable under current conditions. The Core Issue: Excessive Token Supply The greatest barrier to Shiba Inu’s $0.001 target is its overwhelming token supply. Although approximately 41% of the initial supply has been permanently removed from circulation, mainly due to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s large-scale burn in 2021, the asset still maintains a circulating supply of around 589 trillion tokens. This figure remains too high to support substantial price growth without enormous capital inflows. Given the current burn pace, it would likely take several decades to reduce supply to a level where $0.001 could be feasible. Even small price increases now require disproportionately large amounts of new investment, making each upward movement progressively harder to sustain. Limited Institutional Engagement Shiba Inu’s growth has largely relied on retail enthusiasm, with minimal participation from institutional investors. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana, which have each attracted attention from major asset managers and corporations, SHIB has not yet secured any significant institutional adoption. Although Sweden-based Valour Inc. launched a Shiba Inu exchange-traded product (ETP) to provide limited exposure, the initiative has not meaningfully boosted investor confidence or liquidity. The absence of a U.S.-listed spot ETF further reinforces the perception that SHIB remains a speculative asset rather than a serious investment vehicle. Anonymity and Leadership Concerns Another challenge lies in the project’s governance structure. Shiba Inu’s leadership, headed by the pseudonymous developer Shytoshi Kusama, has chosen to remain anonymous . While anonymity once added intrigue to the project’s identity, it now raises transparency and accountability issues that deter institutional investors. By comparison, projects led by visible figures such as Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum) or Charles Hoskinson (Cardano) have earned more credibility, partly because investors can assess the leadership’s track record and intentions. Shiba Inu’s lack of identifiable management continues to restrict its legitimacy in traditional financial spaces. Insufficient Utility and Adoption Despite efforts to expand its ecosystem through initiatives like Shibarium, ShibaSwap, and the Shib Metaverse, the project has yet to establish a core use case that drives consistent demand beyond speculation. These developments have generated community excitement but have not translated into sustained real-world utility or significant on-chain activity. Fragmented Focus and Internal Disputes In recent months, Shiba Inu’s leadership has also been linked to projects outside its primary ecosystem. Shytoshi Kusama’s support for the separate meme token “SHY” is a notable example. Such diversions risk fragmenting the community’s focus and redirecting liquidity away from SHIB itself. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Further complicating matters, internal disagreements have reportedly surfaced among developers. In a public statement, developer Kaal Dhairya alluded to tensions within the team, noting that several individuals who previously benefited from Shiba Inu had departed the project. Internal divisions of this nature can slow progress, delay deliverables, and erode investor confidence. Shiba Inu’s path to $0.001 is obstructed by structural realities that extend far beyond community enthusiasm. Its massive circulating supply, lack of institutional adoption, anonymous leadership, and absence of strong utility collectively undermine the token’s long-term potential. Until these core challenges are addressed and the project demonstrates measurable progress in reducing supply and increasing practical adoption, the $0.001 dream is likely to remain out of reach for investors.

Lee went on to explain how the leverage flushout and volatility caused panic selling and discounts to asset fundamentals. “Volatility creates deleveraging, and this can cause assets to trade at substantial discounts to fundamentals, or as we say, ‘substantial discount to the future’ and this creates advantages for investors, at the expense of traders.” Millions of traders were liquidated when markets tanked following insider whales opening massive short positions just before a major announcement from the US President.

Gold prices hit another record high of $4,160 per ounce on Tuesday, with investors ramping up safe-haven buying. Singapore’s economy expanded 2.9% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2025, slowing from an upwardly revised 4.5% in Q2 as weakness in manufacturing weighed on overall performance. The Monetary Authority of Singapore left its monetary policy unchanged on Tuesday, maintaining the rate of appreciation of the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER) band, with no change to its width or centre. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 2.61% to around 47,590, while the broader Topix Index lost 0.7% to 3,175 in post-holiday trade on Tuesday, with Japanese shares declining for a second session. The Japanese yen fell to around 152.3 per dollar on Tuesday, extending losses from the previous session, as mounting political uncertainty dampened investor sentiment. On Friday, Japan’s Komeito party announced its withdrawal from the ruling coalition led by the Liberal Democratic Party, deepening doubts over Sanae Takaichi’s policy agenda and complicating her path to the premiership. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.27% to climb above 3,900 on Tuesday, ending a two-day losing streak amid signs of easing US-China trade tensions, with both sides indicating readiness to restart negotiations, and the offshore yuan edged lower to around 7.14 per dollar on Tuesday, trading within a narrow range. China and the U.S. are escalating their trade war by imposing new port fees on ocean shipping firms starting Tuesday, targeting vessels that transport goods and making maritime trade a new front in their ongoing trade war. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday that President Trump remains on course to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month as both nations seek to defuse tensions over tariffs and export controls. Looking ahead, investors will closely watch China’s upcoming inflation report, expected to show a modest year-on-year contraction and a slight monthly gain. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 1.05% to 25,956 in Tuesday morning trade, attempting to recover following six consecutive sessions of losses. India ( SENSEX ) fell 0.26% Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.16% to 8,868 on Tuesday, marking its third consecutive session of losses and remaining at its lowest level in nearly two weeks, as notable declines in major banking stocks outweighed strong performances in the mining and gold sectors. The Australian dollar stabilized around $0.651 on Tuesday, as minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia's October meeting indicated that the central bank saw no urgency for additional rate cuts. The RBA held its cash rate at 3.6% in September 2025, following a 25bps cut in the previous month, keeping borrowing costs at its lowest since April 2023. On the economic front, Australia's NAB Business Confidence Index rose to 7 in September 2025, up from a three-month low of 4 in August, remaining above its long-term average. The South Korean won hovered near 1,427 per dollar on Tuesday, showing little change from the previous session, as markets cautiously evaluated recent signals from Seoul and Washington amid ongoing trade negotiations. South Korea is in talks with the U.S. to establish a bilateral foreign exchange swap line as part of a broader trade deal, amid concerns that proposed U.S. investments could disrupt its currency market. In the U.S. on Monday, all three major indexes ended sharply higher on Monday, rebounding from Friday’s steep sell-off after President Trump struck a softer tone on US-China trade tensions, assuring that relations with Beijing “will all be fine.” Investors now await quarterly results from major banks including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs later in the day. U.S. stock futures edged lower on Tuesday: Dow -0.17% ; S&P 500 -0.41% ; Nasdaq -0.55% . Currencies: ( JPY:USD ), ( CNY:USD ), ( AUD:USD ), ( INR:USD ), ( HKD:USD ), ( NZD:USD ).

According to The Big Whale, the product, scheduled for launch in early 2026, is seen as a significant step toward strengthening the bridge between traditional finance and the cryptocurrency world. France-based Amundi, a giant with approximately €2.3 trillion in assets under management, ranks among the top ten largest asset managers globally. Founded in 2010 through the merger of the asset management units of Crédit Agricole and Société Générale, the company has maintained steady growth in Europe's financial markets ever since.

53117167,https://invezz.com/?p=2923484,1760419235,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,XRP price prediction as the XRPR ETF inflows continue,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/14/xrp-price-prediction-as-the-xrpr-etf-inflows-continue/,"XRP price crashed to a low of $2.5440, down by over 30% from the year-to-date high. Ripple was trading at $2.5485, up sharply from last Friday’s low of $1.7768. This article explores whether XRP is a good investment as the XRPR ETF nears a $100 million milestone. XRPR ETF growth is accelerating The recently launched REX-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR) is firing on all cylinders. It has achieved over $92 million in assets, less than a month after its launch, a sign that there is robust demand from institutional investors. XRPR ETF has gained assets despite its high expense ratio of 0.75%. In contrast, most spot Bitcoin ETFs have a ratio of less than 0.25%. As such, its continued inflows is a sign that there is substantial demand for the coin from institutional investors. The Teucrium 2x XRP ETF (XXRP) has also had substantial inflows in the past few months and now has over $355 million in assets under management. These ETFs mean that the spot XRP ETFs by more mainstream companies like Franklin Templeton, Invesco, and Bitwise will be more popular in Wall Street if the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves them after the government shutdown ends. Analysts expect that XRP ETFs will have billions in inflows and assets in the first year of launch. JPMorgan analysts expect the funds will have over $8 billion in inflows in the first year. American investors have had substantial interest in the crypto industry. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have had over $62.4 billion in inflows since their inception, while Ethereum funds have had over $14.48 billion in inflows. The two have over $130 billion and $28.75 billion in assets under management. XRP price chart | Source: TradingView Other catalysts for the Ripple price The other main catalyst for the XRP price is the ongoing stablecoin growth. Data shows that the Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin has over $839 million in assets, a robust growth for a coin that was launched late last year. RLUSD is widely used, with its daily volume being $105 million. RLUSD’s success is important because some of the supply is in the XRP Ledger network. It is also notable that after Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act. There are other catalysts, including its growing market share in the RWA industry, where its total assets have jumped to $361 million, up by 3.39%. Some of the top RWA assets in the platform are VERT Capital, RLUSD, OpenEden Digital, Archax, Ondo, and Braza Crypto. XRP price technical analysis XRP price chart | Source: TradingView The daily timeframe chart shows that the XRP price has plunged in the past few weeks, moving from a high $3.6650 to $2.53. It has moved below the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). The coin has formed a giant hammer candlestick, which is a common bullish reversal pattern. Still, the most likely scenario is where the token resumes the downward trend and move to the support at $2. A move above the resistance point at $2.84, the 200-day moving average will invalidate the bearish view.

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000359. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000583 and an average trading price of $0.000560 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The recent launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1?

Momentum is weak, but hints of recovery are emerging in the short term. FLOKI on the daily timeframe Floki’s daily chart for October 14 reveals a fragile consolidation phase following a steep correction from the $0.000108 level. The price is currently around $0.00007421, slightly below the mid-Bollinger band ($0.00008598), signaling continued bearish pressure. The lower Bollinger band near $0.00006363 acts as key support, while resistance is capped at $0.000086 and $0.000108. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains in bearish territory, though the histogram bars are fading red, hinting at declining bearish momentum, but no confirmed bullish crossover yet. The RSI at 48.14 indicates a neutral to slightly bearish stance, suggesting room for a potential rebound if buying volume returns. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the 4-hour timeframe, Floki shows early consolidation signs as the alligator’s moving averages tighten near $0.000074–$0.000077, indicating a potential volatility expansion ahead. The price action remains sandwiched between the green and red lines of the alligator, reflecting indecision. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The MACD histogram has turned slightly positive at $0.00000144, hinting at a bullish divergence. However, a sustained move above $0.0000768 is needed to confirm a short-term upward breakout. If buyers hold above $0.000073 support, momentum could carry Floki to $0.000078–$0.000082 in the near term. Conversely, a rejection near $0.0000768 may lead to a retest of $0.000068–$0.000070 support.

A move above $0.000076 could trigger a mild rally toward $0.000085, but a failure to hold above $0.000072 risks another dip toward $0.000065. The market remains cautious and range-bound, pending confirmation of a stronger breakout. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~11x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a market cap of up to $95 to $100 billion to hit $0.01, over 95x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

FLOKI historic price sentiment Floki Inu price history by Coingecko From late 2021 to 2023, Floki experienced significant volatility. After reaching an all-time high of $0.0003437 in late 2021, prices fluctuated throughout 2022, ranging from $0.0001004 to $0.0005815. In early 2023, the price surged but corrected by March, stabilizing around $0.0003143 by April and closing the year at $0.0003502.

The market crash was triggered by a Truth Social post from US President Donald Trump threatening tariffs on China, which sent prices plunging and caused major disruptions on Binance. Some users reported being unable to close positions, while others saw altcoins briefly display “zero” prices. Despite the chaos, BNB rebounded to a new all-time high on Monday. Binance also faced lingering technical issues, with Binance Wallet and Trust Wallet users reporting delayed balance displays and pricing glitches caused by network congestion and oracle strain. BNB Chain Launches $45M Airdrop BNB Chain unveiled a $45 million “reload airdrop” to help users recover from losses suffered during last Friday’s historic crypto market crash, which wiped out roughly $20 billion in liquidations. The initiative will distribute BNB tokens, which are currently valued at around $1,276 each, to more than 160,000 eligible addresses. According to the network, the airdrop will begin this week and finish by early November. Partners like Four Meme, PancakeSwap, Binance Wallet, and Trust Wallet will help to facilitate the distribution. BNB Chain was originally developed by Binance but is now maintained by a decentralized community. It said the effort is meant to support retail traders that were impacted by the extreme volatility seen last week. Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao confirmed that rewards will be allocated randomly among eligible participants. The airdrop comes just days after one of the most dramatic sell-offs in crypto’s history, triggered by a Truth Social post from US President Donald Trump threatening 100% tariffs on Chinese imports. The shock sent markets tumbling, and Binance was quickly caught in the center of the storm as users reported platform glitches during the chaos. Some traders claimed they were unable to close their positions during the sell-off, while others pointed to issues like altcoins briefly showing “zero” prices on Binance, even though they continued trading normally elsewhere. (Source: Binance ) Adding to the controversy, Ethena’s synthetic stablecoin, USDe, plunged to $0.65 on Binance while maintaining near-peg levels on other exchanges. Ethena Labs founder Guy Young attributed the anomaly to Binance’s reliance on internal order book data for its oracle, where liquidity was thinner compared to external sources. Binance later issued a statement assuring its users that its core futures systems remained functional throughout the crash. The exchange blamed the “zero price” glitch on a decimal configuration issue and explained that some brief price drops were due to thin liquidity triggering old limit orders. Binance also confirmed that it compensated affected users holding depegged assets like USDe, BNSOL, and WBETH, covering $283 million in total losses. Despite the turbulence, BNB rebounded strongly, and hit a new all-time high on Monday morning. BNB price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Binance Wallet Glitches Persist Meanwhile, Binance’s infrastructure faced even more strain in the aftermath of Friday’s crypto market crash, as balance display issues persisted across its self-custody product, Binance Wallet, into Monday. The platform confirmed on X that it was “temporarily experiencing lag” due to network congestion, preventing some users from viewing wallet data. Binance explained that the affected information required “buffering time to display” and said its team was working to resolve the issue. The disruption followed similar glitches on Binance’s trading platform, where abnormal price readings affected several altcoins during the market’s steep decline. Some users claimed they were unable to interact with their assets, with one even reporting a loss of more than $130 after being unable to sell BNB. The Binance Wallet problems came shortly after Trust Wallet — another self-custody platform founded by Binance’s Changpeng “CZ” Zhao — also experienced issues over the weekend. On Sunday, Trust Wallet said that some users were unable to see their balances due to a “market data sync issue,” though it later announced that the problem was fixed within about four hours. Despite the resolution, several users continued to report inaccurate balance displays afterward. Trust Wallet’s head of communications, Dami Odufuwa, said that the glitch was limited to fiat balance visibility and did not affect users’ ability to trade, swap, or stake tokens. Odufuwa reassured people that all assets were secure and that the issue stemmed solely from temporary market data synchronization errors. Trezor analyst Lucien Bourdon suggested that the incorrect balance displays across Binance Wallet and Trust Wallet were likely caused by the record liquidations during the crash, which overwhelmed pricing and oracle servers.

According to market analyst Phursey, the transfers included a staggering 145 million XRP, valued at roughly $340 million, moved to Binance alone, while additional chunks were seen flowing through Bitfinex and various unknown wallets. As a result, the massive XRP transfer has sent shockwaves through the community, sparking intense debate over its intent. Some analysts view it as a routine exchange reshuffle, a liquidity realignment ahead of increased trading activity. Notably, exchanges often shift assets between hot and cold wallets, consolidate reserves, or rebalance inventories ahead of onboarding institutions or facilitating large OTC trades. From this angle, a massive transfer to Binance may simply signal routine custodial management or preparation for legitimate trading activity, not a planned sell-off. Therefore, analysts supporting this view typically look for confirming patterns like phased movements, redistribution to known custodians, or matching inbound flows that suggest standard operational behavior. Conversely, others suspect a more calculated move, entailing a strategic liquidity prep to offload tokens before a possible market correction. At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at $2.54 per CoinGecko data . XRP Set to Benefit as RLUSD Adoption Accelerates Across DeFi and Payments According to prominent crypto observer SMQKE, XRP is poised to directly benefit from the accelerating demand for RLUSD, Ripple’s native stablecoin built to bridge liquidity across decentralized finance (DeFi), enterprise payments, and on-chain settlements. RLUSD, issued by Ripple and fully backed 1:1 with U.S. dollar reserves, has quickly emerged as one of the most promising new entrants in the stablecoin market. Its growing traction among institutional users and DeFi protocols signals a shift toward deeper utility within the XRP Ledger (XRPL) ecosystem, one that could drive sustained demand for XRP itself. As RLUSD adoption expands, analysts anticipate a ripple effect across the broader XRPL network. Developers are expected to integrate the stablecoin into DeFi applications, automated market makers (AMMs), and cross-border payment rails. This integration would enhance on-chain liquidity and attract new capital inflows, while simultaneously increasing transaction volumes, a key factor in XRP’s market utility. SMQKE highlights that Ripple’s dual-asset strategy, pairing its stablecoin RLUSD with XRP, gives it a powerful edge over rival blockchains. As RLUSD gains traction among enterprises and fintechs as a settlement medium, XRP’s role as the core bridge for liquidity and value transfer grows increasingly vital. Therefore, the coming wave of enterprise integrations could reignite institutional interest in XRP. Leveraging Ripple’s global payment partnerships, RLUSD introduces a compliant, transparent gateway for faster, low-cost remittances. This synergy between stablecoin liquidity and XRP utility could trigger a self-reinforcing cycle of adoption, cementing XRPL’s position as a leading network for real-world finance. Conclusion Whether the massive XRP transfers signal routine exchange management or the first tremors of a major market shift, one thing is certain, investor confidence is on edge. The XRP Army’s sharp vigilance highlights a maturing market where transparency, timing, and liquidity shifts can move billions in mere minutes. Meanwhile, RLUSD’s rapid adoption signals more than just another stablecoin milestone, it marks a defining moment for Ripple’s ecosystem. As institutions, DeFi developers, and payment providers flock to the XRP Ledger to harness RLUSD’s stability and efficiency, XRP is regaining prominence as the core bridge for global liquidity.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-14 05:39:14

The move enables nearly 800,000 citizens to verify their credentials on a public blockchain, marking it the first of its kind. According to the Ethereum Foundation President Aya Miyaguchi, the integration of the system on Ethereum “is now fully operational.” “This milestone marks not only a national achievement but a global step toward a more open and secure digital future for the long term,” Miyaguchi posted on X . 1/ Today, Bhutan celebrates a historic milestone, becoming the first nation to anchor its national digital identity system on Ethereum. @VitalikButerin and I were honored to join the launch ceremony on behalf of the Ethereum community, graced by His Royal Highness. pic.twitter.com/KA4tOYbsJ4 — Aya Miyaguchi (@AyaMiyagotchi) October 13, 2025 Aya Miyaguchi, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, joined Bhutan’s prime minister, Tshering Tobgay, and crown prince on Monday at the launch ceremony. Bhutan Government’s Decentralized Adoption The move aligns with Ethereum’s 10th anniversary , underscoring a shared commitment to open public data. “When I first visited Bhutan in May 2024, I felt a strong resonance between Bhutan and Ethereum: both believe that visions for the future must be grounded in strong foundational values,” wrote Miyaguchi. “It’s deeply inspiring to see a nation commit to empowering its citizens with self-sovereign identity.” Ethereum boasts a globally distributed network of validator nodes. By leveraging the blockchain, Bhutan’s NDI benefits from greater decentralization, transparency and resilience. With this integration, Bhutan’s national digital identity system can now issue Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and enable digital signing directly on Ethereum. “By leveraging Ethereum’s globally distributed network, we are strengthening the security, transparency, and resilience of Bhutan’s digital infrastructure,” said Lyonchen Tshering Tobgay, the Prime Minister of Bhutan. National ID System From Polygon to Ethereum Blockchain Per a Bhutan Times report , His Royal Highness The Gyalsey of Bhutan launched its National Digital Identity in 2023 and became the first digital citizen. In August 2024, the South Asian nation made a transition of its national digital self-sovereign identity from Hyperledger to Polygon . Bhutan adopted the Polygon Blockchain, and its zero-knowledge protocols, aiming to enhance the system’s scalability, ensuring it can handle high transaction volumes without compromising performance. “Bhutan’s transition reflects what Ethereum was always designed for — empowering individuals with sovereignty over their own data, fostering trust without central points of failure, and enabling inclusive digital systems that serve people first,” Aya Miyaguchi added. Besides, the Bhutan government is also staking Bitcoin, becoming the fifth-largest nation to hold the asset in treasuries.

Lookonchain on Tuesday posted blockchain data showing the investor entered at $115,783 and currently holds a 3,440 BTC short position worth about $392.67m, with an unrealized profit near $5.7m and a liquidation threshold of $128,030. Despite Bitcoin rebounding to around $115,000 over the weekend, the trader has added to the position aggressively, indicating a renewed bearish conviction.

Market watchers are now mulling whether this is an attempt to shake out weak longs or part of a larger, calculated push toward another engineered collapse. In a prior episode, the same wallet gained notoriety after opening massive shorts just before Donald Trump’s tariff announcement triggered a sharp market drop , netting an estimated $160m in profits. That trade stoked debate over whether political signals and insider timing were colluding, especially since the trader has been branded a “Trump insider” in crypto circles. Other Hyperliquid Whales Join “Trump Insider” In Mounting Bearish Positions Compounding the tension, other heavy hitters on the Hyperliquid platform are also placing bearish bets . Whale 0x9eec9 currently holds $98m in shorts across DOGE, ETH, PEPE, XRP, and ASTER. Whale 0x9263 is wagering $84m against SOL and BTC. These are not impulsive bets by retail speculators, but decisive moves by seasoned players betting on coordinated downside. Since the crash, markets have seen an increase in hedging activity and put buying, pointing to growing bearish sentiment. Nonetheless, the sheer size and timing of these bets maintain pressure on Bitcoin and crypto markets, especially as volatility returns to centre stage.

News Background XRP’s rebound from Friday’s sub-$1.58 liquidation lows lost steam overnight as fresh whale activity hit exchanges. A single 23.9 M XRP transfer (≈ $63 M) to Binance coincided with selling pressure that erased early gains. The move came as open interest jumped 2.4 % to $1.36 B, suggesting leveraged positioning remains elevated even after the $32 B market-cap recovery that followed Trump’s tariff-driven crypto rout. Broader risk markets stabilized as trade-war rhetoric softened, but derivatives desks flagged renewed short build-ups near $2.65–$2.66. Price Action Summary XRP traded a $0.11 band (4 %) from $2.54 to $2.66 between Oct 13 05:00 and Oct 14 04:00. Volume exploded to 244.6 M at 13:00 — nearly 3× the 91.8 M average — confirming aggressive dip-buying near $2.55. Price peaked at $2.66 during 20:00 hour before sustained sell-off drove a $2.55 close. Bears extended control into the final hour, breaking $2.57 support on 4 M volume at 04:10, then consolidating $2.55–$2.56 into close. Technical Analysis The $2.55–$2.56 zone continues to anchor near-term support after repeated high-volume defenses. Resistance is firm at $2.65–$2.66 where profit-taking and whale flows triggered multiple rejections. Momentum bias leans bearish while XRP trades below its 200-day MA ($2.63), though a sustained reclaim above $2.60 could reset the structure for another $2.70 test. Volume remains the key tell: spikes on dips show institutions buying weakness, but lower highs suggest supply still outweighs demand. What Traders Are Watching $2.55 support — can it hold through weekend Asia sessions? Reaction to $2.65–$2.66 resistance zone on next uptick.

The data center project will cover three separate campuses in Adavivaram, Tarluvada, and Rambilli villages, with the firm aiming to start operations by mid-2028. Overall, the initiative supports Andhra Pradesh’s plan to build 6 gigawatts of data center capacity by 2029. Nara Lokesh, the region’s IT minister, commented , “It’s not just about the jobs. It’s about the larger ripple effect that it creates, the economic activity it creates.” The Visakhapatnam project will include submarine cables and metro fiber infrastructure Earlier, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu had hailed Google’s project a “game-changer,” saying it represents the single largest investment India has seen since its financial overhaul. Per project details, Google will channel the investment through its Indian arm, Raiden Infotech India Ltd. The cluster’s construction will also require laying and landing three high-capacity submarine cables, as well as setting up dedicated landing stations and metro fiber infrastructure. Currently, the firm and its subsidiaries have established 29 data center sites in 11 countries worldwide, including the US, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, and several in Europe. The planned Visakhapatnam cluster is poised to be its biggest in Asia so far. In December 2024, six months into his tenure, Naidu formalized an agreement with Google through a memorandum of understanding. Insiders noted that Google had listed several infrastructure requirements for its data center infrastructure. Naidu had also earlier proposed revisions to the IT and Copyright Acts aimed at advancing data city projects. The Indian government later issued a draft policy setting out a roadmap for data center development. In May, a Google Asia Pacific delegation then toured Visakhapatnam, guided by Lokesh as they assessed prospective locations. Now, its data project will be incorporated into India’s maiden International AI Infrastructure Hub, envisioned as a digital powerhouse supporting industrial growth and technological innovation. India’s data center market is forecasted to surpass $100 billion by 2027 India has also attracted companies seeking to enhance their AI systems. Amazon recently announced plans to invest over $233 million in India by 2025. The fund will be used to expand its operational infrastructure, develop new technology for its fulfillment network, and enhance delivery safety. The investment builds on Amazon’s earlier investments, which were used to create an operational network to deliver to all serviceable pin codes in the country. The e-commerce powerhouse, rivaling Walmart’s Flipkart and Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Retail in India, revealed in June 2023 plans to invest around $26 billion in the country by 2030. The announcement was timed after Amazon CEO Andy Jassy met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the US and announced further investments of $6.5 billion. However, Amazon did not specify how that number is broken down. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan , Amazon’s cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS), also announced that it would invest approximately $12.9 billion, equivalent to 1.06 trillion rupees, in India by the end of 2030. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has described the technologies as a lever for India’s economic transformation and an instrument for lifting millions out of poverty. But scarce water and unpredictable electricity may thwart his expansion plans. Lokesh’s Telugu Desam Party, led by his father, is heavily entwined in Modi’s development strategy. The government of Andhra Pradesh is attracting investors with affordable land and reliable power. Naidu first made his name in the late 1990s, when he helped turn Hyderabad into a global tech hub with companies like Microsoft and Oracle setting up shop there. Having leveraged its political strength to push through corporate-friendly policies at the state level, including further moves against trade unions and other workers’ rights, the party is now using its influence to push for federal policies that will strengthen companies investing widely in Andhra Pradesh. Lokesh remarked, “We are willing to have conversations which might even require policy intervention at the federal level.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",Tech|Google,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-14 05:46:12

Key Takeaways: South Korea’s FIU has resumed reviewing Binance’s acquisition of Gopax, with approval possible by late 2025. The review of Gopax’s executive changes effectively serves as a test of Binance’s qualification as a controlling shareholder. Binance’s $4.3 billion US settlement appears to have eased South Korean regulators’ earlier AML-related concerns. According to a Tuesday report from Newsis , the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) is now reviewing Gopax’s formal report on changes to its key executives, a move tied directly to Binance’s ownership stake, and the review is reportedly progressing favorably. Approval could come as early as the end of 2025. Binance’s Fate in Korea Hinges on Executive Review Under South Korean law, there is no separate system for assessing the suitability of major shareholders in crypto exchanges. As a result, the FIU’s review of Gopax’s executive changes effectively serves as a vetting process for Binance’s qualification as a controlling shareholder. Binance first acquired a 67% stake in Gopax in February 2023, becoming its largest shareholder. The exchange and Gopax jointly filed the executive change report in March 2023, but local regulators froze the approval process over anti-money laundering (AML) concerns. The delay coincided with Binance’s legal troubles in the US , where the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) accused the company of unregistered operations and AML violations. Binance later reached a $4.3 billion settlement with US authorities, which appears to have eased South Korean regulators’ concerns , Newsis said. 4/ Whereas Gopax is one of the central exchanges severely damaged by @FTX_Official 's collapse, @Binance used IRI to invest in #Gopax . With #Binance 's investment, @GOPAX_kr will resume the customer withdrawal of deposited assets, including interests. pic.twitter.com/IVPx57Y20l — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) February 7, 2023 Gopax is among the few South Korean exchanges authorized to handle cash-to-crypto transactions, a designation that requires strict compliance with KYC and AML standards. The platform suffered a major liquidity crisis in early 2023 after its DeFi partner, Genesis Global Capital, froze withdrawals tied to Gopax’s GoFi product. Following Genesis’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, roughly $47 million (₩56.6 billion) in user funds were left inaccessible. Binance’s acquisition of Gopax was initially framed as a rescue effort, aimed at restoring customer confidence and injecting funds to compensate affected users. However, as regulatory hurdles dragged on, Binance reportedly explored selling part of its Gopax stake to local cloud provider Megazone to lower its ownership share, a deal that ultimately collapsed in late 2024, The Bell reported. South Korea Orders Crypto Exchanges to Halt Lending Services In August, South Korea’s financial regulator moved to rein in risky lending practices in the digital asset sector, ordering local exchanges to suspend all crypto lending services until a proper regulatory framework is established. The crackdown came amid South Korea’s broader pivot toward regulated crypto adoption. Authorities are lifting restrictions on institutional trading and preparing to approve the country’s first spot crypto ETFs . President Lee Jae Myung’s administration is also working on a stablecoin framework pegged to the Korean won, signaling a more open approach to digital finance despite the latest curbs. More recently, Dunamu, the operator of South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Upbit, unveiled a new custody service aimed at corporate and institutional clients, as regulatory green lights for virtual asset investments spark growing demand for secure storage solutions. The service stores all deposited digital assets in cold wallets, entirely offline and insulated from internet-based threats, to shield holdings from cyberattacks and other external breaches.

Citi has been working in this area for the last two to three years and significant progress has been made, Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships and innovation in the bank's services unit, told CNBC. “We are continuing to explore different types of assets. We expect to launch with a reliable custody solution that we can offer to our asset managers and other clients within the next few quarters.” Traditional financial institutions, which for years avoided cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, have begun to enter the arena after US President Donald Trump's administration established a more favorable regulatory framework for digital assets. New legislation like the GENIUS Act specifically targets specific areas, including stablecoins. Related News: Developers of One of the Major Altcoins of 2021 Bull Announce They Have Repurchased a Significant Amount of Tokens In the crypto world, custody services can take various forms, from digital asset exchanges holding user funds to institutions' self-custody systems. Citi's planned service will reportedly allow the bank to directly hold crypto assets. Chatterjee said Citi is working on both a homegrown technological solution and evaluating third-party partnerships. “For some asset types, we may have entirely in-house solutions, but for others, we may also use agile, third-party solutions. We are not ruling out any options at this time.” As with all custody services, there are risks such as cyberattacks and asset theft. However, heavily regulated banks like Citi are considered a safer alternative due to their long history of asset protection. Not every Wall Street bank is keen on this strategy. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon stated that his bank would offer cryptocurrency purchases to its clients but would not store these assets. *This is not investment advice.

Related Reading: XRP Reclaims Market Momentum With $30 Billion In Fresh Inflows, A Rally Underway? Chinese Investment Plans $600 Million Fundraiser On Monday, Bloomberg reported that Beijing-based Chinese investment bank China Renaissance Holdings Ltd. is planning a fundraiser for a new BNB-based public vehicle backed by YZi Labs Management Ltd. According to the news media outlet, China Renaissance aims to raise $600 million to create a publicly listed DAT company dedicated to accumulating BNB in the United States. YZi Labs, formerly known as Binance Labs, reportedly plans to invest $200 million in the deal alongside the Hong Kong-listed bank. Sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that YZi Labs met with a group of executives bullish on BNB for dinner in early October. China Renaissance, alongside other firms reportedly involved in setting up BNB hoarding companies, sent a representative to the event. It’s worth noting that the two companies recently announced a strategic partnership to “advance the development of BNB and the BNB Chain ecosystem,” which has been gaining momentum over the past few months. In August, China Renaissance shared that it had signed a strategic cooperation agreement with YZi Labs, aiming to “shape institutional pathways for digital asset adoption — from compliant product development to enterprise-level RWA applications” and create “meaningful synergies between the two ecosystems.” The investment bank also revealed its plan to invest around $100 million in BNB as part of its proprietary holdings, becoming the first Hong Kong-listed company to allocate the cryptocurrency as a proprietary digital asset. BNB Treasury Company Trend The Chinese investment bank initiative follows the growing trend of launching crypto-based DAT companies. This trend has seen the launch of dozens of new Treasury Companies and the investment of billions of dollars into these vehicles in the past couple of months. Last week, the world’s largest BNB Treasury Company, CEA Industries, announced that its treasury holdings have reached a total of $663 million in cash and crypto assets. As part of its goal to own 1% of the altcoin’s total token supply by the end of 2025, the Nasdaq-listed company now holds a total of 480,000 BNB tokens, valued at $585.5 million by October 6. In late September, Kazakhstan announced the launch of the Alem Crypto Fund, its first crypto reserve fund, aimed at long-term investment in digital assets, with Binance Kazakhstan as a strategic partner. Related Reading: ‘BNB Isn’t Crumbling’: CZ Slams Critics Stirring Fear And Doubt As part of the partnership, Alem Crypto Fund made BNB its first investment to highlight “the trust in the Binance ecosystem” and embark on “a new chapter for institutional recognition of cryptocurrencies in Kazakhstan.” Amid the surge in BNB-based funds, the altcoin has recorded a massive 36% rally in the last month, breaking past the $1,000 barrier and hitting multiple all-time highs (ATHs), reaching its most recent high of $1,370 on October 13. As of this writing, BNB is trading at $1,281, a 4% increase in the weekly timeframe.

According to price feeds, XRP traded around $2.57 at the time of reporting, up 7.5% for the day after tumbling to $1.20 over the weekend and staging a recovery of more than 100%. ETF Filings Move Forward Based on reports from ETF watchers, amendments have gone in for a number of spot XRP ETF applications. ETF analyst Nate Geraci posted that firms including Grayscale, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, WisdomTree and Canary Capital filed updates. Some documents now list ticker symbols — Grayscale’s would be GXRP, Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ and Canary’s XRPC — which market participants view as one of the last procedural steps before approval. Grayscale’s decision was scheduled for October 18, while Bitwise’s had an expected date of October 22. XRP is a bit cheaper today as well. https://t.co/hnmrIxpV6I — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) October 11, 2025 Regulatory Pause Hits Timetable Reports have disclosed that the ongoing US government shutdown has reduced the Securities and Exchange Commission’s capacity to finish certain review actions. Reporter Eleanor Terrett said the agency is operating with a skeleton crew and has suspended functions that include accelerating registration statements and declaring S-1s effective, steps required for funds to begin trading. With a new generic listing standard now in place and the SEC asking issuers about withdrawing related 19b-4 filings, conventional deadlines may not hold. Prediction markets put the chance of the shutdown becoming the longest in US history at about 49%, which adds uncertainty to timing. Price Action And Community Reaction Deaton posted a light comment on X, writing “XRP is a bit cheaper today,” which was followed by a thoughtful emoji. That remark echoed a common refrain among XRP holders who see the current lull as an entry point while institutional products near readiness. At press time, XRP’s rebound from a low near $1.20 to roughly $2.57 shows how quickly the token moved in recent sessions. Analysts note that continued filing updates suggest issuers expect approvals once normal SEC operations return. Realize that the market cap of XRP went down by a ~$100Billion (a recorded low of $1.17), then bounced back up a ~$100Billion in MC on very little Net Flows in comparison. Trust, when they’re ready to rocket this thing to infinity, it won’t take as much money as anyone thinks. https://t.co/59IiEhO2lX pic.twitter.com/wtQntCPzKA — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) October 10, 2025 Market Drops And Liquidations The broader crypto market suffered a rapid decline that intensified the drama. Based on market-cap metrics, total crypto value fell from $4.09 trillion at noon yesterday to about $3.3 trillion by nine PM (UTC), a loss of nearly $800 billion within nine hours. Community commentators pointed to heavy liquidations during that event. Chad Steingraber said the crash triggered what he called the largest XRP long liquidation in history, around $422 million, and he pointed to unusual exchange flows as part of the post-crash analysis.

Known for his adherence to traditional charting principles, Brandt shared a multi-decade view of XRP’s performance, showing what he considers to be a remarkably consistent technical setup extending back to 2014. As a student of classical charting principles and history, has there ever been a purer long-term chart? $XRP pic.twitter.com/rbA2Mp955A — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) October 13, 2025 A Clear Long-Term Structure The chart presented by Brandt highlights XRP’s behavior over multiple market cycles, capturing the asset’s early consolidation, its sharp rise during 2017, and the extended compression phase that followed. The long-term formation is built upon symmetrical patterns and defined trendlines, showing how XRP has respected its technical boundaries over years of market fluctuations. At the time of Brandt’s post, XRP was trading near $2.63, forming a compact consolidation range just below the $2.83 simple moving average. The structure suggests that XRP has maintained a disciplined chart pattern, one that aligns closely with traditional accumulation and breakout cycles observed in classical technical analysis. Brandt’s interpretation points to XRP as an example of how an asset can demonstrate clear, sustained structural integrity even in a highly speculative market. Different Interpretations from Market Observers Brandt’s post prompted several comments from traders and investors offering their own interpretations of the chart. A user identified as Mr. Skies noted that, based on his experience, assets that accumulate for long periods tend to deliver stronger upward movements once they emerge from extended consolidation. His statement reflects a view shared by many traditional market analysts who regard prolonged basing structures as potential precursors to major advances. In contrast, another commenter, known as lostintheoldworld, took a more reserved stance, suggesting that XRP could continue moving sideways for another five or six years. This reflects a cautious interpretation, emphasizing that long-term structures do not necessarily translate to immediate action. Adding a broader perspective, a user under the name A Concerned Observer discussed the difference between data-driven analysis and emotionally influenced speculation. While parts of the XRP community tend to rely on sentiment and speculative narratives, he remarked that Peter Brandt often makes objective, evidence-based assessments of both positive and negative conditions in various markets. He also mentioned that he began buying XRP at $0.40 and appreciates its performance, but encouraged the community to stay grounded amid speculation about riddles and hidden predictions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Classical Charting and Market Discipline Brandt’s post reinforces his long-standing commitment to classical charting methods, which rely on the study of recurring price structures rather than market sentiment. The repeated appearance of symmetrical consolidations and clearly defined trend formations in XRP’s history supports the argument that the asset has matured into one of the most technically coherent charts in the crypto market. The consistency of XRP’s long-term pattern aligns with the type of disciplined behavior often seen in markets that adhere to fundamental technical principles. While Brandt’s analysis does not make any forward price prediction, his focus remains on how XRP’s chart has maintained structural clarity through multiple cycles.

The crash, fueled by renewed US–China trade tensions, wiped out more than $20 billion in liquidations across major exchanges. Yet amid the chaos, Remittix has captured attention as the best crypto project to buy now, raising $27.4 million from 678 million tokens sold at $0.1166 each. Bitcoin Price Action: A Market Shaken But Not Broken Source: Kamran Asghar The volume of liquidated Bitcoin exceeded that of the 2022 selloff, and the Bitcoin crash caused a general panic in the cryptocurrency markets. Having hit its annual peak, analysts identified leveraged trading and profit-taking as the primary reasons behind the sudden fall of Bitcoin. It was subsequently found that the price recovered later to above $114,000, which indicated a high demand. The market strategist Michael van de Poppe emphasized that to sustain the upward trend, it is necessary to ensure that the support is at the 20-week moving average of $113,300 or higher. The analysts estimate that, as long as it does not exceed this point, Bitcoin may hit a high of $125,000 to $150,000 in Q4. Any further fall below $110,000 may, however, unlock additional losses to a possible $98,000. The traders are on their toes as volatility continues in the Bitcoin story of this week.

53117359,605429,1760422107,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53117359.jpeg,4 Altcoin có thể đạt đỉnh mới trong tuần thứ ba của tháng 10 bất chấp thị trường sụp đổ,https://bitcoinist.com/4-altcoins-poised-for-new-highs-october-2025-vn/,"Mặc dù thị trường tiền điện tử toàn cầu vừa trải qua một đợt sụt giảm mạnh, một số altcoin vẫn đang thể hiện sức mạnh đáng kinh ngạc và tiến gần đến mức đỉnh lịch sử (ATH). Nhà đầu tư xem đây là cơ hội để tích lũy trước đợt phục hồi tiếp theo. Dưới đây là 4 altcoin được giới phân tích đánh giá có tiềm năng bứt phá trong tuần tới: USELESS, Mantle, Ethereum và Bitcoin Hyper. USELESS (USELESS): Gần như phục hồi hoàn toàn sau cú sập USELESS là một trong số ít meme coin vẫn duy trì giao dịch gần mức đỉnh bất chấp cú sụt giảm toàn thị trường vào thứ Sáu. Hiện đồng coin này chỉ còn cách mức ATH $0.444 khoảng 19,7% , cho thấy lực mua mạnh mẽ so với phần lớn altcoin khác. Trong 24 giờ qua, USELESS đã tăng 67% , giao dịch quanh $0.368 , đang cố gắng giữ vùng hỗ trợ $0.364. Đường trung bình EMA 50 ngày tiếp tục củng cố xu hướng tăng, mở ra khả năng kiểm định lại đỉnh cũ trong ngắn hạn . Nếu lực bán sớm xuất hiện, USELESS có thể điều chỉnh xuống dưới vùng $0.292, thậm chí về $0.230, làm mất đi tín hiệu tăng hiện tại. Mantle (MNT): Chờ bứt phá để lập đỉnh mới Mantle đang nổi lên như một ứng cử viên sáng giá trong nhóm altcoin tiềm năng có thể lập đỉnh mới. Hiện token này giao dịch quanh $2.15 , cách mức ATH $2.87 khoảng 33% . Tuy mức tăng này khá cao, nhưng đà 32% trong 24 giờ gần nhất cho thấy MNT hoàn toàn có thể đạt được. Nếu giá phá vỡ kháng cự $2.29 và biến nó thành hỗ trợ, MNT có thể tiếp tục tăng hướng về $2.87 , thiết lập kỷ lục mới. Tuy nhiên, nếu thị trường suy yếu hoặc áp lực bán tăng, việc giảm dưới $1.92 có thể đưa giá trở lại vùng $1.77 , làm mất động lực tăng. Ethereum (ETH): Duy trì vị thế dẫn đầu trong nhóm altcoin lớn Ethereum hiện đang giao dịch ở mức $4,162 , ngay dưới vùng kháng cự quan trọng $4,222 . Sau khi bật mạnh từ $3,742 , ETH đã tăng 10% chỉ trong 24 giờ, cho thấy niềm tin nhà đầu tư vẫn còn mạnh mẽ. Theo mô hình Ichimoku Cloud , xu hướng ngắn hạn của ETH vẫn tích cực. Nếu ETH thành công trong việc biến $4,222 thành hỗ trợ, giá có thể tăng lên $4,500 , thậm chí kiểm tra mức kháng cự tiếp theo ở $4,956 . Ngược lại, nếu không thể duy trì vùng này, ETH có nguy cơ điều chỉnh về $4,000 hoặc thấp hơn, xóa đi phần lớn lợi nhuận gần đây. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): Ẩn số mới của mùa altcoin 2025 Bên cạnh ba đồng trên, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) đang thu hút sự chú ý nhờ hướng đi khác biệt — mang lại khả năng mở rộng và tốc độ cao cho mạng Bitcoin . HYPER đang phát triển giải pháp Layer-2 cho Bitcoin, sử dụng Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) để đạt tốc độ giao dịch dưới một giây và gần như không tốn phí. Mô hình này giúp Bitcoin có thể hỗ trợ dApp, DeFi và các meme coin , điều vốn dĩ mạng chính (Layer-1) không làm được. Presale của HYPER đã huy động được hơn 22,7 triệu USD , phản ánh niềm tin của nhà đầu tư vào tầm nhìn dự án. Nhiều chuyên gia tin rằng HYPER có thể trở thành một trong những altcoin dẫn đầu làn sóng tăng giá quý IV/2025 khi công nghệ Layer-2 cho Bitcoin bước vào giai đoạn thương mại hóa. Truy cập Bitcoin Hyper Tổng kết USELESS, Mantle, Ethereum và Bitcoin Hyper đại diện cho bốn hướng phát triển khác nhau trong thế giới altcoin — từ meme coin cộng đồng đến nền tảng blockchain cấp doanh nghiệp.

His latest chart outlines a precise technical picture of where XRP currently stands and what it must achieve to re-establish a bullish structure. The analysis illustrates how XRP is trading below a dense cluster of EMAs—specifically the 9, 21, 50, 100, and 200-day indicators—an area that often determines whether momentum favors buyers or sellers. Egrag’s post highlights three significant price reactions along the 200-day EMA where XRP previously found support before rallying. The most recent point, however, shows the token once again hovering near these key averages, signaling a make-or-break zone for short-term direction. His analysis suggests that unless XRP pushes decisively back above this range, the asset could remain under pressure and risk extending its current consolidation phase. #XRP – Moving: WE NEED #XRP To get it's Ass above the EMA's. pic.twitter.com/WqzXmKGk3j — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 12, 2025 Charted Targets and Support Zones The chart presents defined levels to watch both above and below the current trading price. On the upside, XRP must first regain the 2.30 and 2.65 regions before approaching higher objectives near 3.13 and 3.44. These levels mark zones of previous resistance where sellers have historically emerged. Should momentum return and volume increase, a move toward the 3.13 area would represent a significant technical recovery. To the downside, Egrag identifies the 1.76 level as the primary structural support, with the 1.58 region acting as an even deeper cushion if broader weakness persists. These levels coincide with earlier reaction points on the chart where XRP stabilized before prior rallies. The setup essentially outlines a broad trading range, within which XRP’s next move will likely define its direction for the remainder of the year. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Responses Reflect Divided Outlook Responses to Egrag’s post offered differing perspectives. Market observer Vincent warned that the market remains vulnerable to quick retail-driven selloffs, often triggered by impulsive traders reacting to social media posts. He suggested such volatility could prolong XRP’s recovery phase even after brief rallies. Another commenter expressed confidence in the broader upward trend but mentioned that one more downward move may occur before the next significant breakout, referencing a potential “gooseneck” formation seen in prior setups. These reactions illustrate the current division among traders—some cautious about short-term volatility, others optimistic about the medium-term trajectory once XRP clears technical barriers. Technical Implications and Forecast From a technical standpoint, XRP’s failure to close above the 50 and 100-day EMAs could sustain the current neutral-to-bearish tone. However, a sustained breakout above these averages would reassert upward strength and could shift sentiment toward the higher resistance targets marked by Egrag . The EMA cluster effectively serves as a control zone for market structure, and reclaiming it would mark a pivotal signal of renewed momentum.

Our dYdX price prediction for 2025 expects a maximum price of $3.55. In 2030, we expect the dYdX price to touch $29.58. The dYdX exchange captured significant attention last year. The platform aimed to migrate its existing dYdX tokens from Ethereum to this new mainnet. However, in the fall of 2024, the platform disclosed that it was reducing its workforce by 35%. As dYdX’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does dYdX have the potential to hit the $10 mark soon?” or “Will dYdX ever go up?” or “Where will dYdX be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our dYdX price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency dYdX Token dYdX Price $0.377 (+2.3%) Market Cap $413.34 Million Trading Volume $11.92 Million Circulating Supply 787.63 Million dYdX All-time High $4.53 (Mar 08, 2024) All-time Low $0.4954 (Apr 09, 2025) 24-hour high $0.38 24-hour low $0.365 dYdX price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.377 Price Prediction $ 0.471094 (-25.40%) Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Sentiment Bullish Volatility 5.04% Green Days 18/30 (60%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.62838 200-Day SMA $ 0.621281 14-Day RSI 46.8 dYdX price analysis: dYdX faced bullish pressure toward $0.377 TL;DR Breakdown: dYdX price analysis shows that dYdX faced buying pressure toward $0.377 Resistance for dYdX is at $0.4108 Support for dYdX/USD is at $0.2921 The dYdX price analysis for 14 October confirms that dYdX faced a surge as buyers gained confidence. Currently, buyers are dominating, resulting in an upward push toward $0.377. dYdX price analysis 1-day chart: dYdX price surges toward $0.377 An analysis of the daily dYdX price chart shows the token faced buying pressure after the price made a surge above immediate Fib levels. As a result, buyers are now aiming for a hold above $0.377 mark. The 24-hour volume surged to $12.2 million, showing a surge in interest in trading today. dYdX is trading at $0.377, surging by over 2.3% in the last 24 hours. dydX /USDT price chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level but trades around 30, hinting that sellers are controlling momentum. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. dYdX/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for an immediate correction The 4-hour dYdX price chart suggests that bulls strengthen their position as they aim for a hold of the price above the EMA trend lines. Currently, buyers are holding the price around the EMA20 trend line. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a bearish region at 0.93, showing that short-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate a downward trend. However, the MACD trend line has formed green candles above the signal line, and the indicator aims for a positive momentum, strengthening long-position holders’ confidence. dYdX technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.629506 BUY SMA 5 $ 0.626593 BUY SMA 10 $ 0.623829 BUY SMA 21 $ 0.632192 BUY SMA 50 $ 0.62838 BUY SMA 100 $ 0.614458 BUY SMA 200 $ 0.621281 BUY Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.619515 BUY EMA 5 $ 0.619828 BUY EMA 10 $ 0.623568 BUY EMA 21 $ 0.629308 BUY EMA 50 $ 0.622148 BUY EMA 100 $ 0.622503 BUY EMA 200 $ 0.709744 SELL What to expect from dYdX price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms that dYdX is attempting a dip below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing an upside recovery rally in the coming hours. If dYdX’s price holds momentum above $0.4108, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.6408. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the dYdX price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.2921, beginning a bearish trend to $0.2180. Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX up today? The overall dydx market sentiment is bullish as buyers strongly defended support channels. This has resulted in a strong buying pressure. Will dYdX Recover? If buyers hold above $0.4 level strongly, we might see a strong recovery in the coming hours. What is the dYdX price prediction for 2025? In 2025, dYdX is predicted to reach a minimum level of $3.86. Traders and investors can expect a maximum level of $4.55 and an average price of $3.96 if the bulls show up. Will dYdX reach $10? Depending on market sentiment, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future. It is advised to seek independent professional consultation and investment advice from experts before investing in the crypto market, which has high price volatility. Recent news/opinion on dYdX dYdX has updated its 2025 roadmap, outlining plans to launch a Telegram trading integration as the platform faces declining earnings. According to the roadmap, dYdX plans to roll out a series of software upgrades that include a partner fee share, scale and TWAP orders and designated proposers, targeting the reduction of end-to-end trading latency. dYdX price prediction October 2025 September was a bearish month for dYdX as the altcoin dropped toward $0.55. dYdX’s price might attempt to surge toward $0.75 from its recent low and be pushed further, at least $0.9, if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection by the bearish side, leading to a consolidation around $0.45. dYdX price prediction Minimum price Average price Maximum price dYdX price prediction October 2025 $0.45 $0.75 $0.9 dYdX price prediction 2025 The price of 1 dYdX is expected to reach a minimum level of $0.4 by the end of 2025.

Traders can expect an average price of $6.11 throughout 2026. If the market stays positive, we expect the dYdX price to trade well above $5 by 2027. However, the future market potential for dYdX entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment in long-term holding. dYdX historical price sentiment dydx price history: CoinStats dYdX price started trading in December 2023, hovering below $3.5. In January 2024, the price of dYdX faced a decline as it recorded a low of $2.4. However, in March, the dYdX surged exponentially and touched a high near $4.3. After that, dYdX initiated its bearish rally and hovered around $1 till November. However, dYdX soon recovered following Trump’s victory in the elections, skyrocketing toward $2.6 in December of 2024. Since then, dYdX has been declining and is consolidating below the $1 mark. By the end of April, dYdX price surged toward $0.68. In May, dYdX price surged toward $0.76 but it later declined toward $0.5 in early June. By the end of June, dYdX had declined toward $0.41. In July, the token surged toward $0.7 but failed to maintain buying demand and dropped below $0.6. In August, dYdX again surged toward $0.76 but declined later toward $0.6. By the end of September, dYdX price declined toward the low of $0.55.",Crypto Price Predictions|dYDX,EN,0,0,TRADING|DYDX|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BUSINESS|WLD|ALTCOIN|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-14 06:49:30

Secure real-world yields in 4 easy steps If the mechanics of mortgage debt investment leave you a little confused, you don’t need to worry. CoinLander makes the whole investment process simple, transparent, and fully automated. Step 1: Choose from real estate-backed investment pools with clear details on potential returns, risk, and duration.

Vitalik Buterin Joins!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/a-surprise-ethereum-eth-move-comes-from-a-country-that-surprised-with-its-bitcoin-assets-vitalik-buterin-joins/,"A new move came from Bhutan, the South Asian country that stands out with its support for Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies. Bhutan, which has been quietly making moves into cryptocurrency, recently moved its national ID system to Ethereum. Accordingly, Bhutan is migrating its self-sovereign identity (SSI) system, covering approximately 800,000 people, from its previous base, Polygon (POL), to the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain. The technical integration with Ethereum has been completed, and the full migration of all credentials is scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of next year. While Bhutan is the third country to implement a blockchain-based national ID system, currently only a few countries, such as Brazil and Vietnam, have partially adopted similar systems. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and ETH Foundation President Aya Miyaguchi attended the launch ceremony. Miyaguchi stated that this is the world's first national-level Ethereum identity integration. “The country's commitment to granting its citizens a self-governing identity is very impressive. This integration is a world-first initiative and a step toward an open and secure digital future. This move represents not only a national achievement but also a global step toward a more open and secure digital future in the long term,” said Aya Miyaguchi. Bhutan has been running its ID system on Polygon since August 2024, and on Hyperledger Indy before that. *This is not investment advice.

The drop of the market’s Fear Index to 34 earlier in the week – its lowest level since May – has analysts turning their focus to Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE as the top altcoins to buy during market fear heading in to Q4 2025. Although the sentiment remains a tad sceptical, history has revealed that periods of fear often present the best accumulation opportunities. Ethereum ETF Inflows Defy Market Volatility Ethereum is garnering significant institutional interest as spot ETF products are outperforming expectations. The ETF for the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) recently ended trading at $30.20, with total inflows of $621 million in early October, more than double all of last month. After dipping towards $3400 last week because of global macro tensions, the price of ETH stabilised above the $4000 mark. According to analysts, Ether remains strong due to accumulation from the ETF-driven ETH future, while other altcoins face liquidation. In the short duration, ETH is expected to rally towards $4280 on continued buying, a push towards $4600-$4800 is expected if the markets stabilize and BTC reclaim support above $120K. Cardano (ADA): Whale Accumulation Amid Market Fear Cardano (ADA) is among the most bought digital assets during the latest correction. In the last week, large holders of ADA have added over 70 million ADA, indicating strong confidence despite weakness. Cardano Price Chart: CoinMarketCap ADA has been changing hands at the $0.84 to $0.86 range at the moment. If market sentiment improves, analysts predict the price could rise towards the $0.93 to $1.12 range at some point in October. Despite the selloff, the Hydra scaling upgrade has garnered institutional interest as forecasts expect monthly gains of 14 to 18% when conditions improve. Whale operations activity and steady developer progress show that ADA continues to remain one of the best altcoins to buy in fear, especially for long-term investors betting on network growth. XRP: ETF Anticipation and Institutional Rotation XRP is staying over the $2.70–2.80 support zone due to heavy selling pressure. Experts predict significant fluctuations in XRP as many firms will be making their spot ETF decisions after October 18 and before October 25, 2025. Major firms like Grayscale, Franklin Templeton and WisdomTree have made applications. Meanwhile, JPMorgan estimates inflows for the ETF to be around $8-$20 billion during the first year on approval. XRP is currently in the $2.72 to $3.04 range, but it may reach $4.00 to $4.50 in November following the approval of ETFs. Data on the blockchain shows that whale accumulation has stabilised. Thus, whales are ready for post-ETF rally making XRP one of the best altcoins to buy. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Verified and Rising During Market Fear While established assets like Ethereum, ADA, and XRP dominate institutional coverage, analysts are also flagging MAGACOIN FINANCE as an emerging high-ROI altcoin that has benefited from early accumulation during the downturn. Analysts note that MAGACOIN FINANCE’s scarcity-driven tokenomics, verified ecosystem, and community growth across multi-wallet support (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet) make it a credible diversification choice during high-volatility phases. Many investors view it as a hedge against market fear, with projections indicating a 20x–33x ROI potential post-listing. Thus making it one of the best altcoins to buy during market fear. Conclusion With Ethereum ETF inflows strengthening, Cardano whale accumulation rising, and XRP ETF speculation driving rotation, analysts are beginning to view the current fear-driven environment as a setup for recovery. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a standout high-upside altcoin , offering verifiable audits, community trust, and strong investor momentum — qualities that make it one of the most credible new entrants heading into 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been fully audited and verified by Hashex , confirming its smart-contract integrity and investor protection. Analysts note that few presales offer this level of transparent, certified security backed by Certik review. As sentiment gradually turns from fear to accumulation, the combination of institutional-grade assets like ETH, ADA, and XRP — alongside emerging audited projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE — could define the next major rally cycle.

This reverse takeover transaction will see Brag House acquire House of Doge, a move that has received unanimous approval from both companies’ Boards of Directors, also expected to propel Dogecoin’s mainstream adoption. House Of Doge Shares Now Available With this latest move announced on Monday, Dogecoin is now accessible not only to institutional investors but also to retail investors, allowing them to engage in Dogecoin’s projects and future developments. Individuals now have the opportunity to become shareholders in House of Doge, granting them a stake in the organization’s operations and decision-making processes. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Bottom Around $70,000? Arthur Hayes Says Correction ‘Very Normal’ In A Bull Market In the press release, both entities asserted that the establishment of a 20-year partnership between House of Doge and the Dogecoin Foundation ensures the financial backing necessary for continued development of Dogecoin for years to come. Notably, this comes on the heels of DogeOS smart contract Layer 2, and the impending launch of the Dogecoin Fractal side-chain for the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs), further enhancing Dogecoin’s development and utility. Marco Margiotta, CEO of House of Doge, stated: Since launching House of Doge, we’ve built momentum across every layer of the Dogecoin ecosystem, from establishing the Official Dogecoin Treasury with ZONE to forming alliances with Robinhood for developing new yield-bearing products, as well as our exclusive ETP/ETF partnership with 21Shares. Now, we’re bringing what we’ve built to the public markets. Expert Unveils 4 Bullish Targets For DOGE Earlier this year, House of Doge collaborated with 21Shares, alongside the Dogecoin Foundation to launch Europe’s first Dogecoin ETP. The product’s performance has led to an expanded partnership with 21Shares, including the filing for a US Dogecoin Spot ETF and a Dogecoin 2X Levered ETF, both currently under review. In parallel, House of Doge established the Official Dogecoin Treasury in partnership with CleanCore Solutions (NYSE: ZONE), which was founded on September 5, 2025. This Treasury currently holds over 730 million Dogecoin, serving as a foundational element of House of Doge’s financial infrastructure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Not Over?

Market expert Jonathan Carter noted on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) that new bullish targets for Dogecoin have emerged following Friday’s market downturn. He indicated that the memecoin has successfully tested the symmetrical triangle support on its daily chart, signaling a potential rebound. According to Carter’s analysis, consolidation combined with divergence signals suggests a setup for a bounce, with price targets set at $0.25, $0.31, $0.37, and $0.47.

BitMine’s Total Ethereum Holdings Surpass 3 Million NYSE-listed Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum network company BitMine today disclosed that it had bought an additional 202,037 ETH during the crypto market crash over the weekend. Notably, the market crash led to a massive $19 billion in liquidations. According to the announcement, BitMines’ total crypto holdings now comprise of 3,032,188 ETH, bought at an average price of $4,154. In addition, the firm holds 192 BTC, a stake in Eightco Holdings worth $135 million, and unencumbered cash worth $104 million. BitMine continues to reign as the largest publicly-traded Ethereum treasury in the world, and the second-largest overall global crypto treasury, trailing Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which holds digital assets worth a total of more than $73 billion on its balance sheet. BitMine Chairman, Tom Lee, said: The crypto liquidation over the past few days created a price decline in ETH, which BitMine took advantage of. We acquired 202,037 ETH tokens over the past few days pushing our ETH holdings to over 3 million, or 2.5% of the supply of ETH. We are now more than halfway towards our initial pursuit of the ‘alchemy of 5%’ of ETH. BitMine’s share is also experiencing renewed interest as its ETH bet continues to get bigger. Today, the company’s stock, BMNR, is up 3.4%, trading at $54.45 at the time of writing. Recent data from BitMine suggests that, based on its average five-day trading volume, BMNR was the 22nd most traded stock on US-based exchanges, witnessing a trading volume of $3.5 billion on Friday. Opinion Still Split On ETH Utility While 2025 is seeing unprecedented interest in Ethereum as a viable corporate treasury asset, some industry experts are still on the fence. The strongest opposition comes from staunch Bitcoin advocates. For instance, recently Bitcoin maximalist Nick Szabo warned that Ethereum has a “fundamental problem,” adding that most of its use-cases are largely external to ETH’s market value. Similarly, crypto entrepreneur Samson Mow noted that ETH’s price is being “propped up” by $6 billion in Korean retail money. He added that Ethereum’s recent bullish price action is not entirely due to its market demand. That said, some ETH bulls are firmly behind the digital asset. SharpLink CEO Joseph Chalom recently remarked that Ethereum is a superior treasury asset compared to BTC. At press time, BTC trades at $4,165, up 1% in the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|bitcoin|BitMine|Bitmine Immersion Technologies|crypto|Crypto Market|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|ETH|ethereum analysis|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-14 07:00:38

Bitpanda will now offer the bank’s EUR CoinVertible (EURCV) and USD CoinVertible (USDCV) directly to retail users across Europe through its platform and DeFi wallet. The move makes Bitpanda the first retail broker in Europe to enable customers to earn yield on the CoinVertible stablecoins. Users will be able to lend and borrow against these assets within supported onchain protocols, such as Morpho and Uniswap. Jean-Marc Stenger, CEO of SG-FORGE, said the collaboration marks a “decisive step forward” in bringing regulated assets into DeFi. The CoinVertible tokens, both compliant with the EU’s MiCA framework, are designed to provide bank-grade stability in blockchain environments that often rely on unregulated alternatives. For Bitpanda, the partnership represents another step toward bridging traditional finance with Web3. Co-CEO Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad said the integration “creates real ways people can benefit from Web3,” pointing to future work around the Vision token and the planned Vision Chain. Since 2024, the two firms have worked to make stablecoins more accessible under European regulation.

Rather than focusing solely on future price projections, the post addressed the importance of structured profit-taking, particularly in light of last week’s market crash. This combination of confidence and caution presents a perspective for experienced holders who are preparing for potential large price movements. $350-$400 XRP isn’t too bad…I still think we see $1000+ Be sure you take profits at all different price points because you never know what happens. Case in point…the huge crash on Friday https://t.co/AA6mcHJk1v — The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) October 12, 2025 High-End Projections with Realistic Interim Expectations RemiReliefX referenced potential future pricing scenarios in which XRP reaches between $350 and $400 , noting that even such significant valuations would not represent the ceiling. The commentator maintained a broader expectation that XRP could ultimately move beyond $1,000 in the long term . These numbers, while ambitious, were delivered with an underlying message: conviction in an asset’s future does not remove the need for strategic exits along the way. This outlook is consistent with a growing segment of market participants who foresee substantial appreciation over multiple cycles. However, RemiReliefX did not frame these figures as guarantees but rather as possibilities that require patience, awareness, and disciplined portfolio management. The Central Message: Take Profits in Stages A key point made was the necessity of taking profits at different price levels. According to RemiReliefX, waiting for a single peak price without locking in incremental gains can leave investors vulnerable to sudden retracements. This advice was reinforced by referencing the sharp decline observed on Friday, which served as an example of how quickly gains can be reduced if positions remain fully exposed. The reminder was directed especially at those who hold long-term positions and may be reluctant to sell any portion of their holdings. The practical approach outlined encourages securing returns gradually so that a market correction does not erase potential life-changing gains. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Reactions: Practical Concerns and Skepticism Responses from other users reflected a broad range of sentiment. Someone expressed a desire for a more modest outcome, stating that even a $10 to $20 price floor for XRP is enough to impact their lives. Another emphasized that while staged profit-taking is frequently discussed, very few actually act on it, and the recent crash reinforced why action is more important than theory. There were also skeptical voices who challenged the feasibility of the high projections, pointing out that XRP has struggled to sustain even $3 levels this year. This segment of the community questioned how such ambitious targets can be justified when recent price performance has remained constrained. Balancing Conviction with Discipline RemiReliefX’s message ultimately underscores the dual responsibility of long-term holders: maintaining conviction while implementing safeguards. The commentary did not discourage belief in substantial upside but insisted that belief should not override strategy. By promoting structured profit-taking, the post acknowledges that volatility is an inherent part of the market and must be navigated with foresight rather than emotion.

It’s the backbone of the DeFi world, a reference layer for many layer-2 and cross-chain projects and it benefits from upgrades. However, at the current level, the prospects of wild gains seem far-fetched. For investors looking for explosive growth, there is a new DeFi project worth watching. Ethereum Price: Why ETH Might Fall Short Of Expectations ETH has strong fundamentals. It’s central to the smart contract ecosystem and it’s continuously evolving. But there are headwinds. Gas fees, scalability bottlenecks and tight competition from newer layer-1 and layer-2 alternatives could constrain explosive growth. Critics will point out that for ETH to hit $50,000, its market cap would have to dwarf everything else in crypto and it would need to absorb massive capital flows from traditional finance. Without that kind of tidal wave, to push past even $20,000 will be a heroic feat. If you’re looking for gigantic upside in a shorter time frame, that’s where newer projects start to look more tempting. Remittix: The Disruptor You Might Be Overlooking Remittix is not your average vaporware token. It’s positioning itself as a cross-chain PayFi solution that allows users to send crypto directly into real bank accounts across 30+ countries. The developer team is hyping wallet beta launches, live FX conversions, referral income, real use for freelancers and merchants and central exchange listings in the pipeline. Early buyers are already shouting on social media about being up multiples. Some analysts are even dubbing Remittix “XRP 2.0.” Its presale has pulled in over $27.4 million with 679+ million tokens sold. There are also reports that BitMart and LBank will be among the first exchanges to list it. When compared to established coins, Remittix argues it has sharper utility for everyday payments, smoother UX and flexibility across chains. If they deliver, the gain potential is far higher than with ETH. Why Remittix Is Gaining Traction Real-world payments: You can send crypto that lands as fiat in bank accounts Cross-chain support: Bridges multiple networks to expand reach Low gas fee crypto mechanics baked in for efficiency Verified by security firms (CertiK, etc) which adds trust for early stage crypto investment Referral rewards program: Earn 15% USDT from those you bring in, claimable daily If you’re an investor hunting for the next big altcoin or fastest growing crypto in 2025, Remittix is shaping up to be a leading contender.

In a recent interview with CNBC, JPMorgan’s Scott Lucas has reconfirmed that the bank will allow clients to trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. That won’t happen now – the company is still exploring how crypto integrates into its broader markets strategy. Lucas described JPMorgan’s position as an ‘and’ strategy, meaning the firm will focus on balancing existing financial infrastructure with emerging blockchain opportunities. On trading crypto, Lucas stated: Jamie [Dimon] was pretty clear during investor day [….] custody is not on the table at the moment. —Scott Lucas, CNBC Interview While JPMorgan will not offer custody services now, the firm has been experimenting with deposit tokens and stablecoins. He also highlighted JPMorgan’s deposit token prototype, JPMD , which is designed to enable real-time, 24/7 cross-border settlements, serve as on-chain collateral, and offer seamless integration with existing deposit systems. He also added that trading clients would also have the option of using stablecoins for transactions and exploring new blockchain-based financial workflows. Lucas’s interview is a clear signal that JPMorgan wants to bridge traditional financial markets with blockchain infrastructure. Earlier this month, its research division said Bitcoin may be undervalued compared to gold and that the Bitcoin-to-gold volatility ratio has fallen below 2.0, improving its risk-adjusted appeal. Analysts projected that $BTC could reach $165K, roughly 39% above current levels if the ‘debasement trade’ continues. Earlier this year, JPMorgan considered a policy to lend clients against Bitcoin and crypto holdings , which would make it the first bank to accept crypto as loan collateral. With JPMorgan doubling down on Bitcoin trading and blockchain innovation, a new wave of institutional momentum is taking shape. And it could push top altcoins farther than ever before. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a Layer 2 scalability solution for Bitcoin, is ready to capture the momentum that Wall Street is finally embracing. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): The Altcoin Powering Bitcoin’s Fastest & Most Scalable Layer-2 Despite being the crypto that started it all, Bitcoin’s aging infrastructure suffers from poor speed (max 7 transactions per second), lack of compatibility for dApps and smart contracts, and high transaction costs. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to address these issues with its next-generation Layer 2 network, designed to be both fast and scalable. Integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) , it takes transaction speed to a few seconds (compared to a few minutes or hours). The secret potion behind Bitcoin Hyper’s operations is its Canonical Bridge , which lets deposit $BTC and mint an equivalent amount on the L2 network as wrapped $BTC. You’ll be able to use it on the upcoming dApps on the L2, with very low transaction fees and minimal latency. At the heart of this booming ecosystem lies $HYPER, the network’s native token. You can use $HYPER as a transaction fuel, staking asset, governance token, and priority access key to token launches, new dApps, and ecosystem rewards built on Bitcoin Hyper. Read about Bitcoin Hyper in our detailed guide here. Bitcoin Hyper’s presale has been a soaring success, with the project having already raised $23.5M so far. The price of one token today is $0.013115, and the staking rewards are at a juicy 50%. If our $HYPER price predictions materialize , one token could increase to $0.20 by 2026.

It was last down nearly 3% to $111,856. The broader crypto market fell sharply, with total market cap sliding 3.2% to $3.8 trillion. Ethereum dropped 4% to $4,012, BNB plunged 10% to $1,205 and XRP slipped 5.5% to $2.47. Markets approach Powell’s speech amid sharp swings, fueled by renewed US-China trade tensions and steep declines in digital asset prices. Powell is scheduled to speak on the economic outlook and monetary policy at the NABE Annual Meeting in Philadelphia on Tuesday. Analysts expect his tone to sway sentiment on rate cuts and whether the crypto descent deepens or stabilizes. Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech tomorrow could trigger a crypto market crash as traders await guidance on interest rates and economic policy amid U.S.-China trade tensions. #CryptoMarket #Powell #FederalReserve https://t.co/uYtW13jgYK — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 13, 2025 Political Uncertainty Fuels Investor Anxiety Across Risk Assets Last week, President Donald Trump escalated tensions by announcing plans to impose 100% tariff on all Chinese goods imported to the US starting Nov. 1. The move triggered massive market turmoil, wiping more than $125b from global crypto valuations in hours. Markets found some footing on Monday after Trump softened his tone on China. Still, the shock left traders on edge and primed for further swings. Lukman Otunuga, senior market analyst at FXTM, said the reaction “underscores just how sensitive investors remain to political risk and trade uncertainty.” He added that the US–China tensions and a dragging government shutdown could keep markets jittery. Large Liquidations Expose Fragile Leverage But Highlight Strong Projects Kevin Lee, chief business officer at Gate, expects downward pressure to persist near term as geopolitical risks and tariffs weigh on sentiment. He sees the Fed’s expected rate cut on Oct. 28–29 as a possible turning point to ease conditions for risk assets. Yannik Schrade, CEO of Arcium, argued that large liquidations like the weekend’s $19b wipeout act as a market filter, exposing weaker leveraged positions while drawing focus to utility-driven projects. He cited Zcash’s relative resilience and Umbra’s $155m raise in confidential DeFi infrastructure as signs of focus amid volatility. Attention now turns to Powell, whose remarks could decide whether crypto finds relief or slides deeper into decline.

Key Takeaways: California’s new law protects unclaimed crypto from forced liquidation, keeping assets in their original form under state custody. Senate Bill 822 expands the state’s Unclaimed Property Law to cover digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Custodians must notify owners before reporting assets as unclaimed and transfer the exact crypto type. Governor Gavin Newsom signed Senate Bill 822 into law over the weekend, ensuring that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto assets remain in their original form when transferred to state custody under the state’s Unclaimed Property Law (UPL). The bill, authored by Senator Josh Becker (D-Menlo Park), passed both chambers unanimously in September before receiving the governor’s approval on Saturday. California Expands Unclaimed Property Law to Cover Dormant Crypto Assets The law updates California’s decades-old UPL, which governs how the state handles dormant financial assets such as abandoned bank accounts, securities, and insurance proceeds. Under the new provisions, digital financial assets are now officially classified as intangible property subject to the same framework, addressing a long-standing legal gap over how to treat inactive crypto holdings. The change applies to accounts that remain untouched for at least three years following failed contact attempts. Previously, ambiguity around digital assets had left custodians and exchanges uncertain about their responsibilities and reporting procedures. Under SB 822, digital asset custodians are required to notify apparent owners between six and twelve months before assets are reported as unclaimed. Notifications must follow a standardized form approved by the Controller’s Office, allowing users to reclaim or reactivate their holdings before state intervention. California just passed a bill to seize #Bitcoin left idle on exchanges. After 3 years of inactivity, assets can be taken by the state under 'Unclaimed Property' laws. Bill now heads to the Senate. pic.twitter.com/nl1pQPWkvW — TFTC (@TFTC21) June 4, 2025 Once the escheatment process begins, holders must transfer the exact type and amount of the asset, along with the relevant private keys, to a state-approved custodian within 30 days. These custodians must hold valid licenses issued by the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. The Controller may later convert unclaimed crypto to fiat after 18 to 20 months, with rightful owners still entitled to reclaim their assets or equivalent sale proceeds. Alongside SB 822, Governor Newsom also signed Senate Bill 243, which establishes the nation’s first legal guardrails for AI “companion” chatbots. Michigan Lawmakers Advance Bitcoin Bill Last month, Michigan lawmakers revived House Bill 4087 , which would let the state allocate up to 10% of funds to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, potentially joining Texas, Arizona, and New Hampshire in sovereign crypto initiatives. The move positions Michigan alongside a growing list of states eyeing Bitcoin as a hedge and strategic reserve asset, joining early movers like Texas, New Hampshire, and Arizona. International momentum is building as well. The Philippines recently introduced a bill to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve with a 20-year lockup period. Meanwhile, El Salvador, the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender , is reportedly adding gold to its national reserves. Pakistan has also taken a major policy turn with its plans to establish a government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, announced in May 2025 by Bilal Bin Saqib, head of the Pakistan Crypto Council.

Bloomberg reported earlier Tuesday that China sanctioned U.S. units of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean in a move that reignited fears that the trade conflict with Washington could spiral, just days after both sides signaled restraint. Stocks in Asia tumbled, equity futures in the U.S. and Europe followed, and crypto traders were again forced to de-risk after a brief weekend bounce. Contracts tied to the S&P 500 dropped 0.7%, Nasdaq 100 futures lost 1%, and Japan’s Nikkei fell more than 3%, marking its worst session in nearly two months. The yen reversed losses and strengthened against the dollar. Gold and silver both erased earlier gains in heavy afternoon selling, while 10-year Treasury yields eased to near 4.03% as investors moved to safety. Crypto again tracked risk. Bitcoin fell 3% to $111,869, Ethereum dropped 4% to around $4,000, and BNB slid more than 10% after outperforming last week. XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin all fell between 5% and 6% in the past 24 hours. Total liquidations hit $630 million, with long positions making up two-thirds of the wipeout, according to CoinGlass . The correction extends a volatile stretch that began with U.S. President Donald Trump’s 100% tariff threat on Chinese imports last week — a shock that triggered crypto’s largest-ever liquidation event. Nearly $20 billion in positions were erased across derivatives markets in 24 hours, per Hyperliquid data, before a short-lived rebound over the weekend.

Washington imposed a new wave of trade barriers in the last 48 hours, involving a 100% duty on imported Chinese semiconductors and Chinese-made electric vehicles, along with enhanced export controls on software related to AI and rare earth elements. Beijing quickly struck back, suspending exports of major battery metals and applying licensing regulations to U.S. technology companies based in mainland China. The moves have prompted universal market panic, eradicating more than $9.1 billion in world equity value and catapulting risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, into a tumultuous trajectory. As institutional investors hasten to rebalance portfolios, veteran investors are turning to digital assets that can hedge against rising trade-driven volatility. Most notably, Ripple (XRP), Ethereum (ETH), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are becoming top choices. XRP is continuing to enjoy growing cross-border payment integrations, Ethereum is still the foundation of decentralized apps and institutional DeFi activity, while Mutuum Finance, currently in Phase 6 of its presale, with a whopping 65%+ sold and $17.3 million raised by 17,000 investors, is garnering attention as a new-age hedge against uncertainty. Taken together, the three cryptocurrencies provide a strategic combination of stability, growth, and long-term outlook as the rising China–U.S. trade war drives up trade-driven volatility. XRP Price Prediction: Crucial $2.47 Point Might Determine Next Direction XRP is trading at $2.47 currently, a turning point that will decide its short-term future direction. Sticking with resilience above that point can precipitate a bullish rebound, taking the token potentially into the $3.02–$3.37 area with bulls firmly back in control. A conclusive slide back under $2.47 is likely to induce a retest back to the $1.95 support level prior to a sustainable rebound taking hold. This crossroads is a crucial turning point for investors, with the immediate days ahead potentially holding the key to XRP’s future path to year-end 2025. As investors consider XRP eagerly, they are already turning their attention to nascent potential Mutuum Finance (MUTM) instead, a token that is gathering traction fast in a market characterized by shifting momentum and newcomers to the top. Ethereum Price Forecast: Levels to Trade Amid Trade War Flashpoint Ethereum (ETH) stands at a crossroads with rising China–U.S. trade tensions whetting indecision across world markets. A possible deepening of the current tariff dispute would witness ETH briefly sweeping or backtesting its even lows, a short-term risk-off sentiment signifier, though experts point out that a recovery back above the $3,300 level will confirm the return of bullish sentiment and potentially pave the way to a charge at $4,000 if the markets regain their composure. With traders eagerly awaiting U.S. policy guidance and overall direction across the markets, many investors are also taking a glance across the wider crypto market with a view to spotting potential newcomers that would become top performers as soon as steadying volatility settles the focus firmly in the direction of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Surges in 2025 Mutuum Finance is the buzz these days in the DeFi scene, with its presale achieving 17,000+ investors and securing a tremendous $17.3+ million in funds to-date. Already at Phase 6 and 65% taken during this phase, the token value stands at $0.035 at present, signifying a steady market demand along with rising investors’ confidence. The platform is set to unveil its lending and borrowing protocol . V1 will be launched on the Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025 and will feature integral product construction blocks such as liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be accommodated for borrowing, collateralization, and lending and will be accessible at launch time, providing multi-asset, plug-and-play DeFi accessibility. Institutional and retail consumers will be provided with secure, efficient, and user-friendly decentralized finance products. The China–U.S. trade war just escalated further, U.S. new tariffs and Chinese export bans have wiped out $9.1B in world value. During times of turbulence in markets, investors are flocking to stable cryptos. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is at the forefront with $17.3M generated, 17,000 investors, and 65% Phase 6 sold. DeFi technology and an upcoming Q4 2025 Testnet release provide Mutuum Finance with a top-of-the-line volatility hedge. Get in on the Mutuum Finance presale today, 2025’s top crypto play.

The device integrates GPUs, CPUS, networking, CUDA libraries, and AI software. The new release has been integrated with the GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip. It can deliver up to 1 petaflop of AI performance and 128 GB of unified CPU-GPU memory in a compact desktop form factor. The supercomputer uses ConnectX-7 200 Gb/s networking and NVLink-C2C technology, which provides five times the bandwidth of the fifth-generation PCIe. Huang says DGX Spark will democratize AI computing power NVIDIA’s CEO, Jensen Huang, revealed that the DGX Spark returns the firm to its original mission of democratizing AI computing power. “In 2016, we built DGX-1 to give AI researchers their supercomputer. I hand-delivered the first system to Elon at a small startup called OpenAI, and from it came ChatGPT. With DGX Spark, we return to that mission, placing an AI computer in the hands of every developer to ignite the next wave of breakthroughs.” – Jensen Huang , NVIDIA CEO The DGX Spark enables developers to run inference on models with up to 200 billion parameters and fine-tune models of up to 70 billion parameters locally, eliminating the need to rely solely on cloud or data center services. The latest blog revealed that the DGX Spark has been preloaded with the full NVIDIA AI software stack, including CUDA libraries and NIM microservices. The software stack enables immediate deployment of AI workflows, including image generation, vision search, and language model tuning. Early adopters include Anaconda, Google , Hugging Face, Meta, Microsoft, JetBrains, Docker, and LM Studio, who have validated and optimized their tools for Spark. Research institutions, such as NYU’s Global Frontier Lab, have also begun testing the unit. Kyunghyun Cho, professor of computer and data science at NYU, said that the DGX Spark allows them to access petascale computing on a desktop. He added that it enables rapid prototyping and experimentation with advanced AI models, even for privacy-sensitive applications such as healthcare. DGX Spark runs on NVIDIA’s Linux-based DGX OS and is purpose-built for developing and training AI models, rather than consumer applications. Users can also link two Spark systems to support models of up to 405 billion parameters. Huang personally delivered one of the first DGX Spark units to Elon Musk at SpaceX’s Starbase facility in Texas to commemorate the launch, echoing the 2016 delivery of the original DGX-1 to OpenAI. NVIDIA stock jumps 2.88% today following the announcement NVIDIA announced that the DGX Spark will be available for order starting October 15 through NVIDIA’s website and select partner manufacturers, including Acer, ASUS, Dell Technologies, GIGABYTE, HP, Lenovo, and MSI. It will also be available at Micro Center retail outlets in the U.S. and will be made globally available through the AI lab’s distribution network later. 🚨NVIDIA and its partners will start shipping DGX Spark — the world’s smallest AI supercomputer.⁰⁰Early recipients are testing, validating and optimizing their tools, software and models for DGX Spark.

The company recently announced a $100 billion GPU supply agreement with OpenAI and a $6.3 billion deal with CoreWeave. Cryptopolitan reported that the AI chip maker will invest $100 billion into OpenAI to help the AI lab build massive data centers centered on NVIDIA’s processors. The companies revealed that OpenAI will deploy NVIDIA systems that will require 10 gigawatts of power collectively. The gigawatt measure, used more often now to better describe large AI chip clusters, sets the scale of the project. Jensen Huang told CNBC’s Jon Fortt in San Jose, California, that 10 gigawatts equals around 4 to 5 million GPUs. That matches what the AI chip maker expects to ship this year, twice as much as last year. According to Google Finance data, NVIDIA stock was trading at $188.32 at the time of publication, representing a 2.88% increase over the past 24 hours. The stock has also maintained a positive YTD of +40.23%, showing sustained positive investor confidence in the AI chip maker’s performance. Get seen where it counts.

Prices have rebounded since. Despite the sudden sell-off and the subsequent quick recovery, Bitcoin’s market-value-to-realized-value (MVRV) ratio continues to signal a mid-cycle expansion. This essentially means the market remains structurally healthy and well below the overheated phase seen in prior bull runs. Market Still in Expansion Mode According to recent analysis shared by CryptoQuant, the MVRV ratio currently stands near 2.0, which is significantly under the historical overvaluation threshold of 4.0 that previously represented cycle peaks in 2013, 2017, and 2021. By contrast, readings below 1.0 have historically coincided with major accumulation phases such as those in 2015, 2018, and 2020. The current mid-range level implies that most investors are sitting on profits. Despite this, sentiment has not reached euphoric extremes. Supporting the mid-cycle narrative, on-chain metrics reveal that long-term investors are holding steady and avoiding major selling activity. In addition, steady institutional ETF inflows and a notable decline in miner selling pressure align with a maturing but still constructive market phase. In previous instances, each Bitcoin cycle has unfolded in three clear stages – recovery (MVRV 4) – with the current readings closely resembling mid-2020 levels before the last major breakout. These factors point toward a period of structural consolidation rather than the formation of a macro top. Supply Shock Brewing At the same time, Bitcoin’s exchange reserves have dropped to their lowest level in more than a decade. Data shows that the total Bitcoin held on centralized exchanges has fallen to approximately 2.4 million BTC, down from more than 3.5 million in 2020. This represents one of the longest and most consistent outflow trends in the flagship crypto asset’s history. Experts believe that the continued decline in exchange-held coins reduces immediate selling pressure and potentially implies that investors are increasingly transferring their holdings to cold wallets and institutional custody solutions. Historically, exchange reserves rose sharply between 2013 and 2018 as trading activity expanded with the growth of centralized platforms. However, since 2020, reserves have steadily decreased in tandem with rising institutional adoption, the launch of spot ETFs, and a stronger preference for long-term storage. On-chain metrics indicate that “smart money” continues to accumulate, while large-scale withdrawals suggest increasing confidence in BTC’s long-term value.

His comment referred to the asset’s long-term price movement, which has followed clear and repeatable technical patterns. Clear Structure in Multi-Year Chart Brandt pointed to a symmetrical triangle formation between 2014 and 2017. XRP broke out of that pattern in late 2017, which led to a price rally that peaked above $2. After this move, the asset entered a new phase of sideways movement from 2018 to mid-2025, forming what appears to be an ascending wedge. As a student of classical charting principles and history, has there ever been a purer long-term chart? $XRP pic.twitter.com/rbA2Mp955A — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) October 13, 2025 Notably, that structure also broke to the upside, taking XRP to a new all-time high of $3.65. At the moment, the price is trading just under the 200-week moving average, near $2.83. This level is acting as resistance while the price consolidates. Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto said the chart remains one of the strongest in the space. “This has been my bias for a while and nothing has changed in the last 48 hours,” they wrote. They expect XRP to move into double-digit territory before the current cycle ends. A similar view came from EtherNasyonaL, who compared today’s structure with past cycles. In both cases, XRP broke a long-standing resistance and returned to retest an earlier support area. “Don’t underestimate XRP,” the analyst said, pointing to a consistent upward trend over time. Source: EtherNasyonaL/X Trading Range and Key Liquidity Zones XRP was priced at $2.45 at press time, down 6% in the past 24 hours and 18% over the last week. Despite this, volume data shows strong interest around $2.50, which is now a key price level. Cryptoinsightuk shared liquidity charts for XRP.

BNB Has Been Rising Since Parallel Channel Breakout Much like the rest of the cryptocurrency sector, BNB suffered a price crash on Friday, but while the rest of the market has been unable to make a full recovery, the altcoin has already retraced to the pre-crash level, and surpassed it. Related Reading: Bitcoin Direction Still Unclear: Analyst Says Watch These Key Charts Earlier on Monday, the coin even managed to set a new all-time high (ATH) above $1,370. Thus, it would appear that unlike Bitcoin, the coin’s ATH exploration period hasn’t cooled off yet. And it’s possible that BNB will only climb further in the near future, if the technical analysis (TA) pattern shared by analyst Ali Martinez in an X post is anything to go by. The pattern in question is a Parallel Channel, which forms whenever an asset’s price observes consolidation between two parallel trendlines. The upper level of the pattern acts as a resistance barrier, while the lower one provides support. Together, they keep the price locked inside the channel. When one of these levels fails to hold, the asset can witness a continuation of trend in that direction. A surge above the resistance line is naturally a bullish signal, while a fall under the support a bearish one. The 3-day price of BNB was stuck inside a Parallel Channel for a few years before it found a breakout earlier this year, as the chart shared by Martinez shows. Since the breakout, BNB has been exploring new highs, implying the bullish effect of the Parallel Channel resistance break may be in effect. From the graph, it’s apparent that the coin has so far climbed up half as much distance as the width of the channel. Generally, Parallel Channel breakouts are considered to be of the same length as the width of the channel. If the cryptocurrency is following this pattern, then it may be targeting the level a full height above the channel. “It looks like BNB wants to push toward $2,400!” notes the analyst. A surge to this target of $2,400 from the current level would imply an increase of almost 89% for the coin. It now remains to be seen whether the asset will follow this path suggested by the Parallel Channel. Related Reading: XRP Whales Are Selling: $50 Million Exiting Wallets Every Day In another X post, Martinez has pointed out that the 1-day price of Bitcoin has also been traveling inside a Parallel Channel for the last few months. As displayed in the chart, Bitcoin is trading near the midline of the Parallel Channel after its plunge. It will now be interesting to see whether it continues its decline to the $100,000 lower level or not. BNB Price At the time of writing, BNB is trading around $1,270, up 4% over the last week.

53121384,605323,1760428850,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53121384.jpeg,Hyperliquid Unveils HIP-3 Upgrade: Users Can Now Launch Custom Perpetual Futures Exchanges,https://bitcoinist.com/hyperliquid-unveils-hip-3-upgrade-custom-perpetual/,"Hyperliquid (HYPE), a Layer-1 platform that has made notable strides in the cryptocurrency sector this year, has announced its latest upgrade, HIP-3. This upgrade marks a significant step toward decentralizing the perpetual futures listing process, allowing users and developers to deploy their own perpetual futures exchanges on the platform. What To Expect From Hyperliquid’s Latest Upgrade The Hyperliquid protocol will facilitate builder-deployed perpetuals (HIP-3), with a minimum viable product (MVP) of this feature currently active on the testnet. Builder-deployed perpetuals will share many characteristics with HyperCore, the blockchain-based engine of Hyperliquid’s trading platform, including spot deployments and the allocation of new, high-performance on-chain order books. In terms of deployment logistics, gas fees in HYPE will be determined through a Dutch auction conducted every 31 hours, with a single auction covering all HIP-3 perpetual decentralized exchanges (DEXs). For the mainnet, the staking requirement is set at 500,000 HYPE, although this requirement is anticipated to decrease as the infrastructure matures. Any amount staked above the current requirement can be withdrawn. Importantly, the staking requirement will be upheld for 30 days even after all of a deployer’s perpetual markets have been halted. Any deployer meeting the staking criterion can establish one perpetual DEX , with each DEX featuring independent margin, order books, and deployer settings. Deployers can use any quote asset as collateral for a DEX. However, assets that fail to satisfy the permissionless quote asset criteria will lose their status based on an on-chain validator vote, which would also disable any perpetual DEXs utilizing that asset as collateral. Future Enhancements In terms of asset deployment, the first three assets introduced in any perpetual DEX will not require participation in the auction process. Any additional assets will go through a Dutch auction with the same hyperparameters as the HIP-1 auction . This Hyperliquid’s HIP-3 auction for additional perpetuals will be shared across all DEXs. Future enhancements are planned to improve the user experience regarding the reservation of assets for time-sensitive deployments. Currently, only isolated margin mode is required, while cross-margin support is projected for a future upgrade. Markets under HIP-3 will incorporate established sources of trading fee discounts, including staking discounts, referral rewards, and aligned collateral discounts. From the deployer’s perspective, the fee share is fixed at 50%. For users, fees will be double the usual rates applied to validator-operated perpetual markets , although the protocol will collect the same fee regardless of whether the trade occurs on an HIP-3 or a validator-operated platform. At the time of writing, the platform’s native token, HYPE, is trading at around $39.84. This represents a significant 17% drop over the past week, in line with the wider crypto market crash on Friday, when the token fell as low as $20.8.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-says-xrp-game-over-heres-the-significance/,"Crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto has highlighted a major development for XRP, indicating over 1.5 billion XRP in payments within just 24 hours. He described this as a major indicator of renewed network momentum, suggesting that large-scale institutional activity is likely driving the surge. According to Steph, the sudden rise in transaction volume cannot be explained by retail movement alone, indicating that bigger players are once again using XRP for settlement and cross-border transactions through RippleNet and related payment systems. He noted that such spikes in payment activity demonstrate XRP’s growing adoption in real-world use cases, particularly in institutional payment corridors. This development, he said, reinforces XRP’s strength as a digital asset designed for liquidity and large-scale financial operations. #XRP Game Over… pic.twitter.com/Y7wizo9QQ9 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 12, 2025 Market Structure and Technical Positioning Steph provided detailed insight into XRP’s technical outlook, noting that while the asset recently pulled back slightly from the $3.09 mark, it remains above crucial support levels. He explained that XRP’s current trading position above its key 200-day moving averages—$2.62 for the EMA and $2.56 for the SMA—signals that it is in a broader uptrend. Despite short-term consolidation, he emphasized that XRP’s technical foundation remains solid. He also observed that the $2.70 range continues to serve as a strong support zone, where XRP has repeatedly rebounded in recent weeks. This consistency, combined with surging payment volume, supports the argument that XRP could be gearing up for another move higher. Steph compared this setup to earlier market phases that preceded major rallies, suggesting the potential for a breakout if on-chain activity remains high. Institutional Momentum and Broader Sentiment According to Steph, the sharp increase in XRP payments aligns with growing institutional participation in the market. Large transactions of this magnitude typically come from financial institutions leveraging XRP for settlements or liquidity management He linked this renewed activity to broader market optimism, noting that Bitcoin’s climb near its all-time high of $122,000 and improving sentiment in the crypto sector have created favorable conditions for assets like XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Steph believes that Q4 has entered a more bullish phase, with rising confidence across digital markets. He also mentioned ongoing ETF filings for XRP , interpreting them as signs of institutional commitment to the asset’s long-term potential. Outlook for XRP’s Next Move Steph emphasized that XRP’s ability to stay above the $3 mark will be critical to sustaining its upward trend. Should payment activity remain consistent and technical indicators hold firm, he expects XRP to test the $3.30 resistance level soon. Breaking through that threshold could open the door to new all-time highs before the end of the quarter. He concluded by stating that XRP is in a strong market position, both technically and fundamentally. The surge in daily transactions highlights the increasing role of institutional players and suggests the market may be preparing for another phase of expansion.

At this point, the shutdown has delayed the approval of altcoin ETFs like XRP and Solana (SOL), which are awaiting approval from the SEC. Apart from this, it also postponed the approval process of cryptocurrency bills in the USA. Investment bank TD Cowen has indicated that the US cryptocurrency bill could be delayed beyond the November 2026 elections. US investment bank TD Cowen has predicted that the passage of a major cryptocurrency market structure bill could be delayed until after the November 2026 midterm elections, The Block reported. The bank said Republicans and Democrats were negotiating a bill on how the cryptocurrency sector should be regulated, but things were not going well. Negotiations on the bill, known as the CLARITY Act, have reportedly stalled due to behind-the-scenes disagreements between the Democratic and Republican parties. On this point, TD Cowen stated that it was not impossible for progress to be made in the next 12 months, but that there were more reasons to delay the bill at present than to accelerate it. “We are not suggesting there are no avenues for action in the next 12 months. Our argument is that there are more reasons for senators to delay action than to act quickly.” The bank said the biggest obstacle to the legislation is Democrats' demand to ban senior government officials, including President Donald Trump, and their families from owning crypto companies. The CLARITY Act aims to establish a regulatory framework for the crypto industry by defining the roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in the cryptocurrency sector. A provision added to the bill also defines secondary assets. This provision will clarify which digital assets and cryptocurrencies are and are not considered securities. CLARITY covers much more comprehensive cryptocurrency regulations, unlike GENIUS, which covers a more limited topic such as stablecoins. The US House of Representatives approved the cryptocurrency regulation bill, called the CLARITY Act, in July 2025. *This is not investment advice.

Analysts expect a rebound across the top altcoins, with MAGACOIN FINANCE also drawing attention as traders seek fresh opportunities after the recent pullback. Solana Price Prediction: Can SOL Hold the $217 Level? Solana price sits near $217, a key level that traders are watching closely. The coin has pulled back after recent gains but remains inside its longer-term rising structure. A clean reaction above $217 could set up a return toward $230–$235, which has acted as a ceiling for weeks. Analysts note that defending this area keeps Solana’s broader uptrend alive. If buyers take control near this level, the next wave higher could reach $240 and possibly $250 as confidence returns to the market. However, if price breaks below $210, a dip toward $200 is still possible before the next attempt higher. The current consolidation shows that traders are cautious but not ready to abandon the bullish setup yet. Overall, Solana price prediction remains optimistic as long as it stays above $210–$217. The coin continues to attract participants looking for medium-term upside if Bitcoin begins to rise again. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Bulls Eye $120K Recovery Bitcoin price dropped from its $126,000 high and briefly tested the $102,000 zone. Analysts say this move is part of a normal reset after the market’s strong rally. Data from Glassnode shows that a large number of traders accumulated Bitcoin around $117,000–$119,000, suggesting demand remains healthy. Experts like Stockmoney Lizards and Ted Pillows believe that after this “flush,” Bitcoin will likely turn higher again. If Bitcoin holds above $118,000, the next recovery phase could push prices back toward $125,000–$130,000. The recent drop in futures open interest by $4.1 billion also indicates that leveraged positions are cooling off, which often clears the path for steadier price growth. For now, the Bitcoin price prediction favors a recovery once short-term pressure eases. Many traders view this dip as a setup for a stronger fourth-quarter rally. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The New Altcoin to Watch As Solana and Bitcoin draw attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE is fast becoming a name to watch. Analysts say it could see the strongest price action once Bitcoin rebounds, which makes it one of the best crypto presales right now. Because it’s newer and has a low market cap, this altcoin is seen as more agile and better positioned to react when major coins start moving. If Bitcoin gains 20%, MAGACOIN FINANCE could rise between 200% and 2,000%, according to early projections. Those who missed the Dogecoin run in 2021 are watching this project closely as a new opportunity in the market. MAGACOIN FINANCE is audited by CertiK and HashEx, adding credibility and user confidence to its ecosystem. What Traders Should Do Now Traders watching Solana and Bitcoin should keep an eye on the $217 and $118K zones. A recovery from these levels could trigger a wider market rally. For those looking for early movers, MAGACOIN FINANCE may offer a new entry point before broader adoption begins.

The Controller can convert later under defined conditions. Qualified custodians must meet security, segregation, and audit standards. Process and timelines Before escheat, holders must attempt owner contact and provide notice within the statutory window. After transfer, owners reclaim the same asset type rather than sale proceeds. Exchanges and custodians face reporting, recordkeeping, and asset-mapping requirements. Market context California is the first state to codify explicit in-kind treatment for unclaimed crypto.

Bessent said the restrictions reflected China’s internal economic struggles and an attempt to pull down other economies along with it. His comments came just three weeks before President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet President Xi Jinping during the Asia-Pacific summit in South Korea. Bessent accuses China of using export bans to pressure other countries Bessent said Beijing’s new export controls on rare earths and critical minerals are a desperate move from a struggling economy . He believes China was trying to spread its own economic problems to other nations instead of fixing them at home. “This is a sign of how weak their economy is, and they want to pull everybody else down with them.” He explained that China remains the largest supplier of rare earths and critical minerals for manufacturing electronics, vehicles, and renewable energy products. But the country risks damaging the same industries that help fuel its own economy by cutting off or restricting exports. “If they want to slow down the global economy, they will be hurt the most,” Bessent warned. The Treasury Secretary stated that China was facing a “recession or depression,” where growth had nearly halted and confidence among businesses was waning. He thinks Beijing’s leaders were trying to export their way out of trouble by controlling supplies and pushing global markets to react in their favor. But he says this approach was only creating more mistrust and pushing other countries to reduce their dependence on Chinese goods. Bessent made these comments shortly after President Donald Trump threatened to impose a new 100% tariff on Chinese imports starting on November 1. Washington prepares countermeasures and questions China’s internal motives US officials said they were surprised by the sudden and wide-ranging nature of China’s new restrictions on critical minerals, especially since the move came only a few weeks before the Asia-Pacific summit. They said Beijing wanted to gain an advantage before the talks by showing that it could affect key global industries if its demands were ignored. Intel suggests that the government had drafted countermeasures weeks earlier, like requiring American companies exporting software to China to obtain a special license. This law would slow down many parts of China’s technology industry, including its artificial intelligence sector, chip design firms, and large telecommunications companies. People directly involved in the trade negotiations said that Chinese trade negotiator Li Chenggang had warned the US side months earlier that Beijing would take what he called “extreme steps” if Washington did not meet its conditions. Bessent and other senior American officials said that China’s aggressive actions are a result of its rivalry with the United States and divisions within its own government. Different groups in Beijing are competing for control over trade and economic policy, making it difficult for Beijing to send a clear message. Officials in Beijing said Washington escalated the situation by adding thousands of Chinese companies to its trade blacklist at the end of September, but American officials rejected this argument. One senior official said Beijing’s explanation was only a “pretext” meant to justify a plan that had already been in motion for months. “You can’t prepare this kind of export control in two weeks.” Another senior official stated that Beijing’s recent actions were “disproportionate,” and that the United States had attempted to remain calm and open to discussion. At the same time, China responded with policies aimed at causing maximum harm. The official stated that Washington offered to hold several private meetings to discuss the restrictions, but China refused to attend any of them. President Trump even accused China of trying to damage the global economy and warned that the United States would not hesitate to respond if Beijing continued. Chinese officials reached out to Washington to reopen talks within hours of that statement, which suggested that the public pressure had forced them to change their approach. Bessent explained that internal disagreements, economic troubles, and political pressure were making Beijing act more unpredictably than before. He added that the United States wanted to maintain open communication to prevent the situation from spiraling out of control, while preparing countermeasures.

While most meme coins fade after short-term hype, utility-driven platforms are now taking the spotlight. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , still priced at just $0.035 in its presale, is among those gaining attention for its real economic model and structured roadmap. Experts tracking early-stage DeFi cycles predict that this under-$1 token is on track for a 500% price surge by Q1 2026 as its lending system and staking ecosystem come online. All the factors that will help in taking the token to 500% plus growth will be discussed in this article. Mutuum’s presale momentum shows investor confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already gathered strong investor traction during its Phase 6 presale. The project has raised over $17.25 million from more than 17,000 holders, with about 65% of this phase already sold. Its current token price stands at $0.035, and the next phase will lift the price to $0.040 — a 15% jump. This creates a clear window for those still deciding where to begin investing in crypto before the next stage kicks in. Such consistent presale growth signals genuine demand, not just hype. Unlike meme-driven tokens that rely on speculation, Mutuum’s buyers are drawn by its transparent DeFi model and long-term utility. With each presale milestone, the platform strengthens its position as a project with measurable goals and an expanding base of engaged users. A dual lending system that powers real utility At the center of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be a lending and borrowing system designed to bring steady growth and strong token activity. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model will let users lend assets like ETH, BTC, and stablecoins into audited smart contracts. In return, they will receive mtTokens that represent their deposits plus interest. For instance, a user who lends $10,000 in USDT will earn about $1,500 in a year at an estimated 15% APY. Borrowers will also benefit from Mutuum’s efficiency. By using collateral such as ETH, a borrower will be able to take loans without selling their crypto. For example, $1,000 worth of ETH collateral will allow borrowing up to $750 USDT. This two-sided utility — where lenders earn and borrowers unlock liquidity — creates continuous usage for the protocol, increasing demand for the MUTM token and its ecosystem activity. From testnet validation to full launch rollout The team has recently announced via the X post that the launch of V1 of protocol on Sepolia Testnet, scheduled for Q4 2025. It will serve as the foundation for Mutuum’s technical validation. During this phase, developers will test key modules such as the Liquidity Pool, the Debt Token structure, and the automated Liquidator Bot. For now, the testnet will only include ETH and USDT, helping ensure a secure, transparent lending and borrowing process. This early testing stage will attract developers and institutional users who value proof-backed functionality before mainnet deployment. Once the full beta Launch follows which is expected at the token live event, users will gain access to live lending, borrowing, and staking modules with more assets. These features will help the community explore borrowing and lending flows in real time and understand how mtToken staking works. The beta will also serve as a public engagement stage, allowing early participants to experience Mutuum’s features before expected exchange listings and large-scale adoption. The buy-and-distribute system strengthens token value One of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s most exciting mechanisms is its buy-and-distribute structure. Platform revenue will be used for open-market purchases of MUTM tokens. The repurchased tokens will then be distributed as rewards to mtToken stakers. This design means every platform activity — lending, borrowing, or staking — contributes to continuous token demand. It functions like a reward cycle where users receive direct benefits for supporting ecosystem growth. Such alignment between user participation and token performance sets Mutuum apart from other DeFi protocols. As staking pools expand, more revenue will circulate back to users, making staking not just an investment, but an income-generating model. This is one of the reasons analysts project substantial price appreciation heading into 2026, as consistent buybacks and staking rewards fuel ongoing market interest. A simple investment example shows how early conviction in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) pays off. An investor who placed $5,000 during Phase 1, when tokens were priced at $0.01, received 500,000 MUTM. At the current presale price of $0.035, that investment is already valued at $17,500. If the analysts’ 500% forecast unfolds by Q1 2026, the same portfolio will be worth $105,000. Such growth highlights why well-built DeFi tokens are now seen as the next major wave in investing in crypto. Final call before the next price jump Analysts in the DeFi market think that utility-based tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be the best investments in the bull market of 2026. 65% of Phase 6 has already been sold, and the price will go up soon. There isn’t much time left to join before the next reset. MUTM is a better option for investors who are tired of tokens that are based on hype. It has a token based on genuine yield, a clear plan, and a strong community that encourages involvement. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is displaying all the signs of becoming a breakthrough business even before it goes live on exchanges. It has a staking, lending, and buyback structure that makes it one of the few DeFi projects that is ready for long-term use. You can still get in at $0.035, but not for long.

53125119,https://invezz.com/?p=2923784,1760433237,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Insiders call MUTM best buy after SOL; 600% gains forecast,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/14/insiders-call-mutm-best-buy-after-sol-600-gains-forecast/,"Solana (SOL)’s rise from under a dollar to triple digits remains one of the greatest crypto success stories. Now, market insiders are drawing strong parallels between Solana (SOL)’s early momentum and the current trajectory of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . With its lending mechanics, stablecoin model, and buyback-driven rewards, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being called the “SOL of decentralized lending.” Experts project a 600% price surge in the short run, as adoption and listings push it into mainstream visibility. So here are the following reasons why market insiders call MUTUM the best crypto to invest besides SOL. Presale hype and a dual lending model that drives real utility The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is in Phase 6, priced at $0.035. Overall $17.25 million has already been raised, and 65% of this phase is sold. The project now has more than 17,000 holders and a total supply of 4 billion tokens. When Phase 7 begins, the price will rise to $0.04, a 15% increase from the current entry point. For early investors, this is becoming one of the most promising opportunities in 2025 for those focused on investing in crypto with utility and yield at its core. An analyst, who forecasted Solana (SOL)’s 40x rise in its early stage, predicts Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to climb from $0.06 at listing to $0.42–$0.48 by early 2026. That is a 600% gain in a shorter time frame than most altcoins deliver. A $5,000 presale purchase today would turn into $30,000–$40,000 once the listing targets are reached. The projected price is not just a random speculation but it is based on real utility that the platform delivers. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate through a dual lending model — Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the P2C system, users will lend assets like ETH or USDT directly into smart contracts that power the protocol’s liquidity pools. Each lender will receive mtTokens equal to their deposits (1:1 ratio). For example, a lender placing $10,000 worth of USDT will receive mtUSDT tokens, earning consistent yield as borrowers use those funds. These mtTokens will also serve as collateral within the ecosystem, allowing lenders to participate in staking and earn additional MUTM rewards. Borrowers will interact with the protocol by posting collateral to access loans. Suppose a user deposits $1,000 worth of ETH; they can borrow up to 75% of that value. This structured borrowing approach will protect both lenders and the system itself. At its core, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to build a self-sustaining lending economy where users can lend, borrow, and stake — all while generating organic demand for the MUTM token. Stablecoin and Oracle precision: The real engine of growth The upcoming stablecoin within Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be minted only when users borrow against approved collateral. Every time a loan is repaid or liquidated, those stablecoins will be burned, reducing circulation and maintaining a consistent peg at $1. Overcollateralization will remain mandatory, guaranteeing that every issued stablecoin stays fully backed. Governance will adjust borrowing interest rates dynamically — increasing when the stablecoin price falls below $1 and lowering when it trades above. This will create a natural balancing mechanism for price stability and user confidence. That stability will lead to continuous demand. As more users engage with the platform for lending or borrowing, the utility of MUTM will expand. Price feeds for all assets will come through Chainlink’s oracles, with fallback feeds from other decentralized sources. These accurate valuations will prevent manipulation and ensure fair liquidations. This reliability will attract more deposits and increase Total Value Locked (TVL). When TVL rises, lending activity grows, producing more protocol revenue. A defined share of this revenue will be used to repurchase MUTM tokens from the market. The repurchased tokens will then be distributed to mtToken stakers, turning every cycle of activity into a tangible source of token demand. High pool utilization will drive up borrowing rates, attracting fresh capital from yield-seeking investors. Low utilization will reduce borrowing costs, encouraging more borrowing and system efficiency. This cyclical flow of capital — from deposits to borrowing to revenue to buybacks — is designed to keep MUTM value consistently supported by actual platform use. Institutional confidence and listing readiness Security has been one of the main reasons institutional analysts have placed Mutuum Finance (MUTM) alongside Solana (SOL) in long-term watchlists. The project is under CertiK audit, undergoing manual review and static analysis. Its Token Scan Score stands at 90.00, and the Skynet Score is 79.00 — both indicators of strong contract safety. A $50,000 bug bounty program further supports the team’s focus on transparency and protection. These security measures will play a key role in gaining exchange listings and investor trust. The team also planned to launch its V1 of the protocol on Sepolia Testnet by Q4 2025, starting with ETH and USDT. It will also include main features such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to make the system safe and efficient. This testing phase will allow developers and liquidity providers to validate all system flows before the mainnet rollout, reducing execution risk. Final word: The next SOL moment Solana (SOL) once traded below $1 before it rose more than 40x. Market insiders now see a similar structure forming around Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Its mix of lending utility, stablecoin stability, and automated buybacks creates an ecosystem where demand grows naturally. With Phase 6 already 65% sold and the next phase price set to rise to $0.04, this is one of the final entry points before listing momentum begins. For those investing in crypto this quarter, adding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) beside SOL is not just diversification — it is positioning for the next major breakout in decentralized finance.

The bank is exploring both in-house technology solutions and potential third-party partnerships, with Chatterjee stating “ we’re hoping that in the next few quarters, we can come to market with a credible custody solution ” for asset managers and other clients. Wall Street Coming to Crypto? Citi Said Yes The upcoming service would involve Citi holding native cryptocurrencies on behalf of clients. Chatterjee said the bank may deploy entirely in-house designed solutions for certain assets and client segments, while using third-party lightweight solutions for other asset types. The bank is “ not currently ruling out anything ” regarding its custody strategy. Citi’s move contrasts with JPMorgan’s stance, which is that while its bank will allow clients to buy cryptocurrencies, it will not yet hold custody of the assets. JUST IN: JPMorgan confirms on CNBC that they will allow clients to trade #Bitcoin and crypto but not yet launch custody services pic.twitter.com/N2oYWPwwhL — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) October 13, 2025 However, JPMorgan has also expressed interest in changing that next year. The custody plans build on Citi’s broader digital asset ambitions announced throughout 2025. CEO Jane Fraser confirmed in July that Citi is “ looking at the issuance of a Citi stablecoin ” while developing tokenized deposit services for corporate clients seeking 24/7 settlement capabilities. The bank already offers blockchain-based dollar transfers between New York, London, and Hong Kong offices, operating around the clock. Chatterjee said discussions with clients are underway to identify use cases for sending stablecoins between accounts or instantly converting them into dollars for payments. Wall Street Consortium Eyes G7 Stablecoin as Competition Intensifies Earlier this month, nine global banking giants, including Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Bank of America, Banco Santander, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, MUFG Bank, TD Bank Group, and UBS, announced plans to develop a jointly backed stablecoin focused on G7 currencies. Nine banks, including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, unite to launch G7-backed stablecoin as market could hit $50T in payments by 2030 and $1.2T by 2028. #Banks #Stablecoin https://t.co/oqPhgT5v9w — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 10, 2025 The consortium will explore issuing reserve-backed digital payment assets available on public blockchains, with each unit pegged one-to-one against traditional fiat currency. The coalition confirmed it is already in contact with regulators across relevant markets. Notably, earlier this year, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo reportedly held exploratory discussions about this shared stablecoin venture. However, those talks remained conceptual until the confirmation this month. The banking giants are rushing in as the business model is proving extraordinarily lucrative for existing issuers who earn substantial yields on Treasury securities and cash equivalents backing their tokens. Given this adoption trajectory, Bloomberg Intelligence projects stablecoins could process more than $50 trillion in annual payments by 2030. However, while banks seem geared towards adoption, it might also be out of, as Standard Chartered warned earlier this month that stablecoin adoption could drain more than $1 trillion from emerging market banks by 2028. The threat prompted the Bank of England to initially propose ownership caps between £10,000 and £20,000 for retail customers. However, following criticism, regulators are now preparing to allow exemptions for firms like crypto exchanges, which require large holdings for liquidity and settlement purposes. Citi Balances Stablecoin Opportunities Against Deposit Flight Fears Citi’s aggressive digital asset expansion comes despite warnings from its own analyst Ronit Ghose , who cautioned in August that stablecoin interest payments could trigger 1980s-style deposit flight from traditional banks. Ghose drew parallels to when money market funds skyrocketed from $4 billion to $235 billion in seven years, draining deposits from banks whose rates were tightly regulated. Between 1981 and 1982, withdrawals exceeded new deposits by $32 billion as consumers chased higher returns. Major U.S. banking groups, including the American Bankers Association and the Bank Policy Institute, urged Congress to close what they called a “ loophole ” in the GENIUS Act, which allows crypto exchanges and affiliated businesses to offer yields on third-party stablecoins. The groups cited Treasury estimates that yield-bearing stablecoins could trigger up to $6.6 trillion in deposit outflows, fundamentally changing how banks fund loans and manage liquidity. However, crypto industry groups pushed back, with Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal dismissing the banking lobby’s efforts as an “ unrestrained effort to avoid competition. “ This was no loophole and you know it. 376 Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate rejected your unrestrained effort to avoid competition. So did one President. It's time to move on. https://t.co/CGCGxDqKNa — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) August 13, 2025 Coinbase Research particularly released a dedicated report to the “banking threat” narrative, claiming it found no meaningful correlation between stablecoin adoption and deposit flight for community banks over the past five years. For Citit, Fraser framed their approach as responding to client needs and the broader shift toward always-on instant settlement, stating that “ digital assets are the next evolution in the broader digitization of payments, financing, and liquidity. ” With $2.57 trillion in assets under custody, Citi’s 2026 launch may be the beginning of a strategic adoption of crypto on Wall Street.

This time, DeFi benefitted from fees and managed to control its liquidations. DeFi and perp DEXs performed better following the October 10-11 market shakedown. The DeFi space, including perpetual DEXs, still saw liquidations, but showed it was much more stable compared to the 2022 crash. As Cryptopolitan reported , crypto faced $19B in liquidations, the worst event since the crash of FTX. However, this time around, DeFi showed relatively limited crisis effects. This time around, DeFi has more reliable collaterals, including those based on tokenized T-bills and more reliable stablecoins. ETH collaterals are at much more conservative price levels, with limited liquidations. Currently, ETH has just under $1B in liquidatable values, starting at $1,548, way below market valuations. Perp DEXs open interest attempts a recovery Perpetual DEXs were the most affected, losing over 50% of their open interest on liquidations. Open interest on all perp DEXs was at $25.75B before the crash, later dipping to lows of $13.71B. Perp DEXs value locked started recovering, bouncing from lows of $13B up to $17B. Despite this, the liquidations hurt the trust in perpetual DEXs, after many traders were liquidated and lost their entire positions. | Source: DeFiLlama . Within days, open interest recoveded to over $17B in total, where Hyperliquid still held over $8.24B in open interest, based on DeFiLlama data. Hyperliquid itself reported a delayed drop to $6.24B, down from $15B during regular trading times. Perpetual DEXs still carry over $33B in daily volumes, with record activity for the past week. Over $264B were traded during the week of October 6-12, matching the weekly record for DEXs activity. The perp DEXs liquidations came in the middle of a highly competitive narrative, where old and new perp DEXs attracted peak activity. The crash and on-chain liquidations were especially harmful, as more retail traders attempted to hold leveraged positions, getting exposed to outsized risk. Top perpetual DEX tokens also took a hit, with weekly losses between 16% and 45% for the leading protocols. HYPE sank to $38.71 , as the sector is still attempting a recovery of value locked, open positions, and token valuations. Lending protocols, DEXs benefit from higher fees DEX trading saw its biggest weekly activity of over $177B in the week of 6-12 October. The outlier result followed a general trend of DEXs activity expansion. Uniswap and PancakeSwap remained the biggest activity hubs, with no signs of distress. The recent DEXs activity also coincided with a wave of meme token trading on the Binance ecosystem. Lending protocols had a bigger shock due to their underlying structure. Total value locked remained at over $83B, with Aave at the lead. However, total amount borrowed fell below $50B for the first time since August, as users avoided the risk of opening loans. Briefly, the annualized yield of Lido’s stETH jumped to 7.05%, later returning to its usual range. Overall, DeFi lending decreased its outsized yields during previous market downturns, offering more conservative earnings for a lower risk of liquidations.

Experts predict 800% gains in new DeFi token,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/14/next-big-crypto-of-2025-experts-predict-800-gains-in-new-defi-token/,"A new wave of crypto attention is forming, and this time, it is not around a meme coin. Analysts tracking recent whale movements believe Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be one of the most promising DeFi launches of 2025. With strong utility and working testnet in line, experts expect the $0.035 presale token to be the next big name as crypto prices rebound. Presale numbers that are stronger than any memecoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still in Phase 6 of its presale and continues to attract investors shifting from speculative assets toward real-yield DeFi models. Current presale data shows rapid growth. The token price stands at $0.035, with about $17.25 million raised combining all phases. Overall 17,000 holders have joined, while 65% of the 170 million tokens in this phase are already sold. The next phase will lift the price to $0.040, a 15% jump that analysts expect to happen soon as the presale accelerates. An early investor who swapped SOL for MUTM during Phase 1 bought 1,000,000 tokens at $0.01 for $10,000. That position is now valued around $35,000, a 3.5× value gain. At the expected listing price of $0.06, that value reaches $60,000, a 6× rise. Analysts see an 800% upside scenario from the current $0.035 level to $0.315, meaning that the same Phase 1 investor’s tokens would reach $315,000 — a 31.5× increase. But what actually raises the price up? We will discuss them in detail below. Why analysts believe MUTM can surpass DOGE The reason for this prediction lies in how Mutuum Finance (MUTM) works. While DOGE grew from community culture and hype, its price movements depend heavily on social trends. MUTM’s design focuses on real financial activity — lending, borrowing, and staking. This difference ties token demand directly to platform usage rather than to social momentum. MUTM will introduce two lending models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). Both are designed to create ongoing demand for the token. In the P2C model, lenders deposit assets into smart contracts and receive mtTokens that represent their pool share. For example, a user lending $12,000 worth of USDC earns mtUSDC, which accrues about 14% annual yield, adding around $1,680 yearly. On the borrower side, someone posting $1,500 in AVAX as collateral will be able to borrow up to $1,125 — about 75% of their deposit value. This setup will create steady demand for borrowing and lending while producing protocol revenue that can support long-term growth. Meanwhile, the P2P side allows users to lend tokens like PEPE or TRUMP directly to others, negotiating interest rates and durations for higher returns. By separating riskier tokens from the main liquidity pools, Mutuum will keep its system stable and efficient. How the buy-and-distribute engine builds real value Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built around a “buy-and-distribute” mechanism that rewards active participation. Revenue from interest and liquidations will go to the protocol treasury. From there, the system will buy back MUTM tokens from the open market and send them as rewards to mtToken stakers. This direct link between user activity and token demand will create a continuous cycle of value flow. The more users borrow, lend, or repay, the more revenue the protocol generates, and the stronger the buyback pressure becomes. This model aligns user rewards with platform success and transforms regular lending activity into constant market demand. The project’s development timeline adds another layer of confidence. A beta version will expectedly launch when the token goes live, allowing early partners to test lending, interest accrual, and liquidation systems. This early validation will reduce technical risks before the public rollout. Mutuum’s risk framework will also help maintain a balanced ecosystem. Loan-to-value ratios will range from 35% to 75% depending on the asset, and liquidation thresholds from 65% to 80% will secure collateralized positions. Reserve factors between 10% and 55% will ensure liquidity during volatile market phases. So in that way Mutuum is perfectly secure for all the involved parties which will appreciate users to participate without any hesitation. To bring the features into practical use, the team has announced the launch of the V1 of the protocol on Sepolia Testnet is expected to go live in Q4 2025, showing ETH and USDT lending pairs along with debt tokens and liquidation bots. This step will demonstrate the system’s efficiency and help attract institutional liquidity when the full version launches. Final outlook Experts tracking large transactions are clear about one thing — big investors are shifting from hype-driven coins to utility-driven protocols. The move from DOGE toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) reflects a new preference for on-chain yield and transparent mechanics that tie token value to real activity. An 800% upside projection for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is grounded in numbers and growing adoption. With 65% of Phase 6 already sold and the next phase at $0.040 set to open soon, this is one of the last opportunities to secure tokens at a lower entry point.

Ethereum (ETH), already exhibiting robust recovery form, has had its ascent halted as investors consider the risk that increased tariffs pose to liquidity and international tech sentiment. But against this backdrop, investors are turning their focus to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rapidly emerging DeFi token currently in Phase 6 of its presale, with more than 65% already sold. Created with innovation and stability in mind, Mutuum Finance is establishing itself fast as the next token set to experience meteoric growth, providing investors with a potential early entry point in what many believe is 2025’s top digital asset. Ethereum Price Prediction: A Temporary Decline Before the Next Parabolic Breakout? Ethereum’s most recent price action is telegraphing a cooling off, with Support 1 having been broken, suggesting a short-term bearish move. The $3,900 level has also been flipped to resistance, and with ETH remaining south of this juncture, a move lower into the $3,000 area appears ever more likely. Traders will find this decline a great accumulation point, with $3,000 acting as a perceived key area to acquire long-term exposure. In order to achieve its next key upsurge, however, ETH will need to move decisively above the $4,800 resistance, a move that will pave the way for a move higher up to $10,000 in the next cycle. As Ethereum steadies its price and investors prepare for the next great move, more attention is also being paid to up-and-coming project Mutuum Finance (MUTM), suggesting a larger thirst for high-upside potential in the crypto environment. Mutuum Finance in Q4 The Mutuum Finance presale is already at Phase 6 with a total amount exceeding $17.3 million and 17,000 investors. So far, this has been a demonstration of increasing confidence in the direction that the project has been heading and makes Mutuum Finance a very credible ecosystem for investors with sustainable return target and long-term gain. There is also an active Loan-to-Value (LTV) mechanism and liquidation process integrated that react to price shock independently in order to achieve firmness against shocks. Reserve multipliers that are in the 10%-35% range, calibrated based on collateral risk profiles, have yet another level of surety and consequently a firmer platform too. MUTM also offers a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program whose vulnerability classification comprises four levels, namely, critical, the major, the minor, and the low. This is also complemented by the open architecture design of the platform with security-by-design, keeping the DeFi protocol stable, robust, and secure to the users. Mutuum Finance Borrowing & Lending Protocol Up next for the platform is the launching of a lending and borrowing protocol that is revolutionary. Version 1 (V1) of the protocol will be introduced on Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025 and will have significant functionalities to comprise the liquidities pool, mtTokens, debt token, and liquidator bot. Day-one support to lend, borrow, and collateralize the ETH and the USDT will be present and the users will be able to have a DeFi experience that is open-ended, scalable, and efficient. Mutuum Finance is Expected to be DeFi Next Big Powerhouse As Ethereum rides out choppy short-term sentiment in response to the Trump tariff increase, focus is falling on innovation-driven assets such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Having generated over $17.3 million, with 17,000 investors on board and 65% of its Phase 6 presale already gone, the project’s traction is a testament to growing market optimism. Secured with sophisticated risk controls, an auto LTV mechanism, and a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, Mutuum Finance is putting itself at the forefront as one of the safest and future-looking DeFi protocols in the market. It is now time for early adoption hopefuls to think about Mutuum Finance before the presale is complete.

53125122,https://invezz.com/?p=2923786,1760434350,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,California passes law to protect unclaimed crypto from forced liquidation,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/14/california-passes-law-to-protect-unclaimed-crypto-from-forced-liquidation/,"California has passed a law that protects unclaimed cryptocurrency from being forcibly converted to cash, making it the first state to offer such explicit safeguards. California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Senate Bill 822 on Oct. 14, effectively updating the state’s Unclaimed Property Law to include digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies, and becoming the first US state to do so. Senate Bill 822 , which was authored by Senator Josh Becker of Menlo Park, was designed to address the legal uncertainty around how the state should handle dormant crypto holdings that remain unclaimed. Under the new framework, it has been clarified that digital financial assets are a form of intangible property and must be treated under the same legal framework as unclaimed bank accounts, stocks, and other securities. If a crypto account remains untouched for three years, despite reasonable efforts to contact the owner, the assets are deemed abandoned and transferred to the state. However, unlike traditional practice, where assets are liquidated, the law mandates that these digital assets be preserved in their original form. Further, entities holding digital assets must notify account holders six to twelve months before those assets are reported as unclaimed. The notification must be done using a standardised form approved by the State Controller, and if the account holder takes any action during this window, the three-year countdown resets. Furthermore, companies are required to transfer the actual crypto asset, along with the associated private keys, directly to a custodian selected by the Controller within 30 days after the final reporting deadline. The Controller has the power to choose one or more licensed custodians to manage these assets, but the law requires that these custodians hold valid state-issued licenses from the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. Only after a waiting period of 18 to 20 months can the Controller convert the unclaimed crypto into cash. If the rightful owner comes forward during this period, they are entitled to receive their original assets rather than the fiat equivalent, but after conversion, claimants would receive the cash proceeds instead. Before the bill was signed into law, previous iterations and related legislative efforts took a more ambiguous approach. A notable example was Assembly Bill 1052, which passed through the California Assembly in June but drew a lot of criticism from the crypto community. It lacked clear language on asset preservation, leaving many to assume the state would liquidate digital assets upon seizure, while some were concerned that simply holding their Bitcoin without frequent activity could be grounds for the state to take custody. Although the bill did require the state to first attempt contact before any seizure, it failed to offer concrete protections that would ensure the crypto was returned in its original form. At the time, critics warned it could drive users away from regulated exchanges altogether and into more opaque parts of the ecosystem. California passes crypto-related legislations Beyond SB 822, California has introduced other legislation that addresses certain regulatory grey areas that previously existed. Back in March, lawmakers amended Assembly Bill 1052 to include protections for crypto payments and self-custody, with the revised bill now allowing businesses and individuals to accept digital assets as payment and banning public agencies from restricting the use of hardware wallets. It also prevents public officials from promoting or transacting in digital assets that might create a conflict of interest. More recently, Assembly Bill 1180 received unanimous approval in the State Assembly. That measure would create a pilot program for allowing certain state fees to be paid in cryptocurrency.

53125123,https://invezz.com/?p=2923900,1760434352,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Dogecoin, Pepe & MUTM: Three cryptos to watch in Q4",https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/14/dogecoin-pepe-mutm-three-cryptos-to-watch-in-q4/,"Dogecoin and Pepe dominate every meme chart this quarter. They move on pure community energy, driving waves of excitement across social media. But serious investors know that every strong portfolio needs balance — a fun meme token, a high-volatility play, and a real DeFi project built for utility and yield. This is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters the picture. While Dogecoin and Pepe rely on community momentum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines active utility, a growing presale, and long-term earning logic that appeals to both whales and retail investors. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) remains one of the most popular memecoins in 2025. Its price has shown strong swings throughout the year. The coin is driven mainly by community excitement and social media hype. DOGE provides opportunities for short-term gains, but it does not offer revenue-backed utility or structured yield. Investors seeking predictable returns might find Dogecoin (DOGE) less stable. DOGE will continue to attract traders who enjoy memecoin culture and speculation. Pepe (PEPE) Pepe (PEPE) has experienced viral growth on social media in 2025. Its popularity has caused rapid price surges and sharp fluctuations. Returns on PEPE are highly unpredictable. It has limited functional use and does not provide structured benefits to holders. As a result, Pepe (PEPE) is largely speculative compared to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which offers systematic demand drivers and real DeFi utilities. PEPE will mainly appeal to traders seeking excitement and short-term swings. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale and testnet launch First thing first, the presale stats and numbers of holders justifies the project’s authenticity and strong fundamentals. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is currently in Phase 6 at $0.035. Over $17.25 million has already been raised and more than 17,000 holders onboard. The total token supply stands at four billion MUTM, and the next phase will lift the price to $0.04 — a 15% increase. In addition to that unlike various memecoins, the project’s team has recently announced the launch of V1 of the protocol on Sepolia Testnet for ETH and USDT lending pairs planned for Q4 2025. It will include main features such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to make the system safe and efficient. These steady developments make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a standout DeFi entry alongside two of crypto’s biggest meme icons. Stablecoin logic and lending simplicity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a lending model that works for both everyday users and professional investors. The system will have two parts: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. In the P2C model, lenders will deposit assets like USDT or ETH into the protocol’s smart contracts. For every deposit, they will receive mtTokens in a 1:1 ratio. These mtTokens will represent the lender’s share in the liquidity pool and will keep earning yield as borrowers use the funds. For example, a lender staking $10,000 in USDT will receive mtUSDT tokens and earn interest automatically over time. On the other side, borrowers will post crypto collateral to receive loans. If a borrower deposits $1,000 worth of SOL, they will be able to borrow up to 75% of that value, depending on the loan-to-value ratio. When borrowers repay their loans, the debt tokens will be burned, restoring balance to the system. If prices drop sharply, a Liquidator Bot will step in to handle automatic liquidations, protecting the platform from losses. This controlled structure will form the backbone of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s stablecoin ecosystem. Every stablecoin will be minted only when users borrow against approved collateral and will be burned when loans are cleared. The system will remain overcollateralized to keep its $1 peg safe. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) governance will adjust interest rates to maintain the peg: higher rates when the stablecoin trades below $1 and lower rates when it trades above. This simple feedback loop will build trust, stability, and predictable returns for all users — three traits missing from many meme-driven projects. Each cycle of borrowing, repaying, and liquidating will drive activity on the protocol. More transactions will mean higher revenue, which will later fund open-market buybacks of MUTM. The bought-back tokens will then be distributed to mtToken stakers as rewards. This natural cycle will turn participation into direct token demand, giving Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a long-term value structure beyond speculation. Oracles, security, and smart demand creation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will rely on Chainlink’s oracle system for live, accurate price feeds. These oracles will ensure that collateral values, liquidation events, and loan ratios stay fair for all users. Backup feeds and aggregated data from decentralized exchanges will add another layer of reliability, building confidence among both lenders and borrowers. As borrowing increases, pool utilization will rise. When utilization grows, interest rates will automatically increase, which will attract more lenders looking for better yields. This will deepen liquidity, when liquidity expands, borrowing will also rise, creating a larger base for platform revenue. Each transaction in this loop will help grow the protocol’s treasury, which will later be used for MUTM buybacks and staking rewards. The result is a balanced growth system where activity, liquidity, and token demand all move together. In addition to that, security remains central to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The project is undergoing a full CertiK audit using manual review and static analysis. Its Token Scan Score stands at 90.00, and its Skynet Score is 79.00. A $50,000 bug bounty program is also live, rewarding community members who find vulnerabilities before the platform’s mainnet launch. This proactive structure makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) one of the most credible DeFi projects preparing for market debut in 2025. A known analyst, who correctly called DOGE’s 60x rise in 2021, expects Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to reach $1.20 by mid-2026, up from a projected listing price of $0.06. That represents a 1,900% gain from today’s presale price of $0.035. At that level, a $2,000 investment now would grow to $38,000, showing why crypto predictions continue to favor MUTM among early-stage DeFi assets. The smart trio for Q4 Pepe and Dogecoin will always be the most popular memes, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) adds genuine DeFi value to the fun. It combines staking rewards, governance control, a clear roadmap, and genuine use cases that make people want to own the token. DOGE and PEPE are fun, but MUTM will make money. With 65% of Phase 6 having sold and the next phase costing $0.04, the greatest time to get in is quickly closing. Adding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to your portfolio along with Dogecoin and Pepe is a smart move for investors looking to have fun and make money in the fourth quarter. This is one of the most talked-about combos in this year’s crypto forecasts.

The case includes a Hyperliquid trader who reportedly earned over $150 million by shorting assets just before Donald Trump announced tariffs on imports from China. Sources cited by Eye suggest that some Hyperliquid positions may have relied on information obtained from individuals close to the U.S. President. The main channels of information dissemination are said to include: A leak from the foreign policy organ of the Communist Party of China An insider crypto trading ring operating extensively within the White House Key Figures and Alleged Frontmen According to the investigation’s author, the key figures are Zach Witkoff and Chase Herro, both of whom allegedly had access to high-ranking officials and shared confidential data with select traders in advance. This allowed them to open highly profitable short-term positions before White House announcements. Eye added that Trump’s eldest sons may also be involved, although only Witkoff and Herro’s names have been confirmed so far. Analysts had previously linked one Hyperliquid user’s exceptionally successful trades to former BitForex CEO Garrett Jin, but new information suggests Jin may have been a frontman. It is reported that on the night of October 10, 2025, the crypto market collapsed following Trump’s announcement of 100% tariffs on imports from China.

The collaboration will produce a series of high-quality tutorials led by internationally recognized generative artists, with each tutorial culminating in an exclusive artwork release on EditArt , a leading generative art platform on the Tezos blockchain. This announcement is the next step in the ongoing commitment to advancing generative art education, as demonstrated by the Museum of the Moving Image’s presentation of Compositions in Code: The Art of Processing and p5.js – a major exhibition on view through August 24, 2025 – organized in partnership with the Tezos Foundation and in association with the Processing Foundation. The tutorial series combines the Processing Foundation’s 20+ year legacy of making programming accessible to artists with the Tezos Foundation’s commitment to fostering digital art innovation on the Tezos blockchain. Each participating artist will create an in-depth tutorial exploring p5.js 2.0’s and create a generative artwork for EditArt, the intuitive co-creation platform where collectors shape the code using simple sliders to collect their own unique final outputs. This initiative builds on the Tezos Foundation’s longstanding support for generative art, following its acclaimed presentations at Art Basel Hong Kong and Miami in 2021 and 2022, where interactive experiences introduced global audiences to the creative possibilities of blockchain-powered art. In 2024, the Tezos Foundation’s partnership with Musée d’Orsay also presented Lumina (Σ Lumina). An interactive generative installation by artist Agoria, it was created in collaboration with artist Johan Lescure and made available to museum visitors. “This partnership aligns perfectly with our mission to expand access to creative coding tools and support artists worldwide,” said Xin Xin, Co-Executive Director of the Processing Foundation. “By combining educational content with real-world applications on platforms like EditArt, we’re creating a complete pathway for artists to learn, create, and share their work with collectors.” “We’re thrilled to support the Processing Foundation in bringing world-class creative coding education to a broader audience,” said Aleksandra Artamonovskaja, Head of Arts at Trilitech. “This initiative not only celebrates the tools that have shaped digital art history but also demonstrates how blockchain technology can create sustainable opportunities for artists and educators alike.” The tutorial series is expected to launch in late 2025, with videos released monthly. All content will be freely accessible, continuing the Processing Foundation’s commitment to open-source education that has empowered generations of digital artists since 2001. About Processing Foundation The Processing Foundation promotes software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology-related fields. Their core mission is to empower people of all backgrounds to learn how to program, and to promote diversity in the creative coding community. Founded by Casey Reas and Ben Fry, Processing has become one of the most influential programming environments for artists worldwide. About Tezos Tezos is a cutting-edge, energy-efficient blockchain.

The Japanese company began buying Bitcoin in April 2024, saying it wanted to become Japan’s MicroStrategy by being the first major listed crypto treasury in the country. Its stock rallied in popularity during the first four months or so, hitting an all-time high in mid-June and another in August, as traders flooded in, betting on Bitcoin and Metaplanet’s vision. But that bullish run didn’t last. Metaplanet’s shares have since plunged by about 70%, bringing its market value and debt combined to a point where it is below the total worth of its Bitcoin stash. The company’s own metrics showed an mNAV of 0.99 earlier this week, meaning the market now values Metaplanet at less than its crypto reserves. Metaplanet loses investor trust as Bitcoin stock fever cools The whole idea behind companies like Metaplanet, known in the industry as digital asset-treasury firms, or DATs, was to give stock investors exposure to Bitcoin without needing to touch actual tokens. It became a trend. Over the summer, most of these companies traded at a premium to their holdings. But that phase is done. Now, firms like Metaplanet are struggling. Buying has slowed down. Stock prices are falling. The hype is gone. Mark Chadwick, a Japan equity analyst who writes on Smartkarma and previously worked at Jefferies, said this looks like a bubble bursting. “I still see this crypto treasury stock decline as a popping of a bubble,” Mark said. He also pointed out that while the euphoria has cooled, some Bitcoin believers might see this as a good moment to buy the stock cheap. Metaplanet’s own website shows it now holds more than 30,000 Bitcoin, valued at around $3.4 billion. To keep expanding its crypto portfolio, the company’s shareholders recently backed a proposal to issue preferred shares, a hybrid form of equity and debt. In September, it raised about $1.4 billion through an international equity sale aimed at funding further Bitcoin purchases. Crypto markets rocked by Trump’s tariff threat and record losses On Friday, traders suffered a record $19 billion in liquidations, wiping out leveraged positions across multiple exchanges. The chaos began after U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans for 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, sending global markets into panic. For several tense hours, crypto markets echoed traditional finance’s worst instincts, a rush to exit. An altcoin index tracking smaller tokens beyond Bitcoin and Ether dropped up to 40% in minutes as liquidity vanished. The meltdown exposed old problems that keep haunting the industry: excessive leverage, poor liquidity, and the way exchanges report liquidations. A technical glitch on Binance made things worse, but the exchange later said it paid $283 million in compensation to affected users but insisted the error didn’t trigger the historic market crash. Nearly $20 billion worth of positions were liquidated across exchanges, according to data from Coinglass, though we’d like to point out that the real figure was likely higher since Binance limits how often it reports liquidations. Investigations later focused on Binance and decentralized trading platform Hyperliquid . Coinglass reported that over $10 billion in leveraged bets were wiped out on Hyperliquid and another $2.4 billion on Binance. “Hyperliquid is a blockchain where every order, trade, and liquidation happens onchain,” Jeff Yan, the platform’s co-founder, said in an X post on Monday. “Anyone can permissionlessly verify the chain’s execution, including all liquidations and their fair execution for all users.” For an industry that spent the past three years trying to restore confidence following the catastrophic collapse of crypto exchange FTX, Friday was an ugly reminder of how tenuous those gains are.

The wallet has since added another $127 million in BTC shorts, after depositing $40 million USDC to the Hyperliquid platform. The total active BTC short is now close to $300 million. Wallet Linked to Billions in Crypto According to StarPlatinum, wallet address 0xb317… controls more than $10 billion in assets, including over 46,000 BTC and a large amount of staked ETH.

Jin has denied any connection to the wallet. Still, the pattern appears consistent: large USDC deposits, shorts opened just before news breaks, and funds withdrawn after the price move. Community Raises Questions Over Timing Some traders believe the timing is too precise to be random. EGRAG CRYPTO responded to the Arkham report, writing , “If this whale makes money from this trade based on Trump announcement in the next hours or days, then he should be investigated.” Others echoed similar concerns, suggesting this may go beyond normal trading strategy. Janis Kluge, a researcher at SWP Berlin, added , “Crypto people are realizing today what it means to have unregulated markets: Insider trading, corruption, crime, and zero accountability.” Following the crash, over 250 wallets on Hyperliquid reportedly lost millionaire status. Another trader reportedly opened a 40x long position on Bitcoin during the same period. Binance, which was also mentioned in market rumors, denied any technical failure during the event and called the incident a “ display issue .” As we reported , the platform said all core systems stayed online and confirmed $283 million in user compensation.

Schiff Says Bitcoin Crash Is a “Warning” In an October 14 X post, the economist dismissed the belief that Bitcoin’s recent flash crash was a buying opportunity, framing it instead as a sign of deeper instability. “The Friday Bitcoin flash crash wasn’t a buying opportunity but a warning,” Schiff wrote, adding that the next time its price falls, even a post from President Trump might not be enough to help it recover. Schiff believes that its metal counterpart’s surge exposes the “fiction” of Bitcoin as digital gold, suggesting that the cryptocurrency’s perceived role as a safe-haven asset is unraveling. “The bottom can drop out of Bitcoin at any time,” he added. Bitcoin recently experienced a sharp correction that dragged it to a low of $110,201 on October 10. On the other hand, gold has continued setting fresh highs this year, crossing the $4100 mark. In a separate post, the financial commentator doubled down on his position, stating that gold and silver continue to surge while Bitcoin and Ethereum keep declining. He warned that crypto investors are in for a rude awakening and will soon learn a valuable but costly lesson. His latest remarks follow weeks of commentary claiming that Bitcoin’s underperformance against the precious metal is a warning that the cryptocurrency is in a deeper bear market. The gold advocate went as far as predicting that the leading digital currency will soon crash. BTC Price Outlook Bitcoin’s brief rebound on Monday has since faded, with the cryptocurrency now trading around $111,800. This marks a nearly 10% drop in the past week and over 11% below its record high above $126,000 that it hit in August. The decline follows last week’s market crash, which led to a rise in bearish trading and an increase in put options expiring at the end of October, according to Hendrik Ghys, founder of Thalex Global. Ghys said that market volatility has eased to around 40 percent in the short term, showing that the panic has cooled as traders adjust their risk. Market makers who buy during dips and sell during rallies remain cautiously hopeful, expecting to manage their positions more effectively if volatility continues to fall.

53125220,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=835548,1760435808,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53125220.jpeg,European officials push for sovereign AI development,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/europe-races-to-build-sovereign-ai/,"European officials are intensifying their efforts to secure a leading position in the global AI race. In recent weeks, Europe’s tech giants, including SAP SE and ASML Holding NV, have invested billions in homegrown AI ventures and EU-oriented tools. National leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, have also made big promises to fund huge data hubs , framing them as crucial infrastructure for both security and the economy. Not to mention, in conversations with more than two dozen European officials and tech leaders, many expressed concern that failing to scale up local AI investment could lead to talent being drawn abroad, ceding the next tech revolution to the US once again. There are still concerns that Europe’s AI industry is reliant on US technology The leaders are sounding alarms that the region’s dependence on a few powerful American firms could prove risky if Trump’s trade conflicts flare up again. In EU circles, talk of a “kill switch” has already grown, a shorthand for fears that Trump could order US firms to disable services in Europe to gain political advantage. However, despite its ambition, Europe has yet to demonstrate that it can muster the talent, technology, or capital necessary to compete with the AI superpowers in Washington and Beijing. The region may hold promise in AI-powered software, cloud infrastructure, and military systems. Still, few are convinced it can keep up in the capital-intensive race to produce top-tier chips and large language models. Nonetheless, the European Commission has introduced two new initiatives aimed at helping the region capitalize on the benefits of artificial intelligence and remain globally competitive. One plan, the Apply AI Strategy , focuses on speeding up AI integration in key sectors and government services. The second, the AI in Science Strategy , seeks to make Europe a hub for AI-based research. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen commented, “I want the future of AI to be made in Europe. Because when AI is used, we can find smarter, faster, and more affordable solutions.” Additionally, during a high-profile September meeting with Huang and fellow US tech luminaries, Starmer unveiled over £31 billion ($41 billion) in AI investment commitments. However, their meeting did stir backlash over Britain’s growing reliance on American companies. Alexandra Geese, a German lawmaker in the European Parliament, who has long urged Europe to wean itself off American technology, even remarked, “At this moment, Europe is so dependent that we don’t have much bargaining power. You become a colony.” Meanwhile, Macron has been promoting Crespo’s Pigment as a key component of Europe’s tech future, highlighting its expanding customer base in France and the UK. Still, its competitiveness depends on American-made AI from OpenAI —technology that Microsoft largely funds. Europe maintains that it’s embracing the concept of “sovereign AI”, though it’s clear that there are a few contradictions, including how SAP’s “sovereign” program, billed as “made in Germany, for Germany,” still depends on OpenAI’s technology. Nevertheless, determined to prove Europe can compete, local players are ramping up fast. For instance, Amsterdam-based Nebius clinched a contract with Microsoft worth up to $19 billion. Black Forest Labs of Germany also partnered with xAI and Meta on image-generation AI. Mistral, backed by ASML and others, reached an €11.7 billion valuation, confirming its status as Europe’s AI flagship. UK university spinouts are not pulling in enough investments However, a report warns that university spinouts in critical UK industries, from AI and quantum to life sciences, are struggling to attract enough local investment and are increasingly seeking growth opportunities in the US. Over the past five years, just three companies emerging from UK universities have managed to raise at least £500 million ($667 million), according to Parkwalk Advisors and Beauhurst. Around 1,000 spinouts attracted as much as £5 million ($6.6 million) in funding during the period, suggesting strong early-stage investment activity. Yet few managed to raise above £20 million ($26.5 million), according to a report. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Analysts Reveal a Penny Coin Outperforming XRP and ADA in ROI,https://timestabloid.com/whats-the-best-crypto-to-buy-now-analysts-reveal-a-penny-coin/,"As global crypto prices start recovering, investor attention is shifting from large-cap names to smaller DeFi projects showing real utility and measurable growth. Among these, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing analyst focus as a presale-stage token designed to reward long-term holders through lending yields and continuous buybacks. It combines practical borrowing mechanics with revenue-based rewards that many larger networks still lack. XRP — Slower Regulatory Path XRP remains focused on cross-border payments and legal clarity. Its price movement often follows court updates or regulatory news instead of organic market growth. While its network is efficient, long-term ROI has been limited by external factors rather than on-chain adoption. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) differs because its value drivers are entirely on-chain — yields, staking rewards, and token buybacks tied to protocol revenue. This makes MUTM more directly aligned with its user base than tokens waiting for regulatory green lights. Cardano (ADA) — Strong Research, Slower Adoption Cardano (ADA) is known for its academic foundation and scientific approach to blockchain development. However, its DeFi layer and yield products have been slower to build. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will take a more direct path by focusing on active lending and borrowing systems from launch — offering participants clear utility and income streams. This practical approach is why analysts expect MUTM to achieve faster ROI growth compared with ADA in the near term. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Gaining Ground Presale is one of the best factors that is attracting many buyers during this crypto crash. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale where the token price stands at $0.035. Overall with about $17.25 million already raised and more than 17,000 holders. Roughly 65% of the 170 million tokens allocated for this phase have been purchased. Phase 7 will raise the price to $0.040 — a 15% increase — marking the last discounted entry window before the next jump. The total supply is 4 billion MUTM. An early investor who joined Phase 1 ($0.01) with $10,000 worth of ETH and SOL received 1 million MUTM. At the current $0.035 presale price, that holding is now valued at $35,000 — a 3.5x gain (+250%). When the planned listing price reaches $0.06, the same stake will reach $60,000. Analyst projections for $0.24 after listing place that holding at $240,000 — a 24× return (+2,300%). This growth pattern comes from two clear design strengths: on-chain lending and revenue-driven buybacks. These will create continuous buying activity from protocol earnings, adding natural demand pressure as the ecosystem expands. Unique Dual Lending Model That Appreciate the Demand Users will be able to lend assets through the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model. For example, a lender depositing $15,000 USDT into the pool will receive mtUSDT tokens at a 1:1 ratio. Assuming an average 15% annual yield, this position will generate $2,250 in passive income while the principal remains available, subject to pool liquidity. Borrowers will secure loans by posting collateral. A user posting $1,000 worth of ETH will be able to borrow up to 75% LTV (loan-to-value), or $750. This system lets users access liquidity without selling their long-term assets. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also launch a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) layer where tokens like PEPE or SHIB can be loaned and borrowed in direct agreements. Lenders will set rates based on risk, creating a separate market for less-liquid assets without affecting the main pools. Perpetual Buy-and-Distribute System & Beta Roll Out Part of Mutuum’s revenue — from interest spreads and liquidation fees — will be used to buy MUTM tokens on the open market. These tokens will then be distributed to mtToken stakers as rewards. This creates a continuous buying cycle linked to protocol activity, making the token economy directly benefit active participants. Additionally before potential listing on top known exchanges, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch a beta phase to show real mtToken yields and lending flows. This will increase trust and total value locked (TVL) ahead of potential exchange integration. To bring more practicality, recently the team has announced the launch of V1 of the protocol on the Sepolia Testnet that will cover ETH and USDT assets with liquidity pools, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot. The protocol will apply LTV rules to manage market volatility: stablecoins and ETH up to 75% LTV (80% liquidation threshold), while volatile assets stay within 35 to 65% ranges. Reserve factors between 10 and 55% will add further safety layers. These LTV rules bring more stability throughout the lending experience thus appreciating large investments without any exposed risk. This reliability ensure trustworthy environment and more activity will eventually take MUTM demand up. Final Verdict — A Last Discounted Window With 65% of Phase 6 already sold and the next phase set to raise the price to $0.040, this presale phase is the last opportunity to enter before the 15% increase. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines real DeFi utility and governed buybacks that will directly benefit its participants. Analysts tracking crypto prices and ROI performance expect the token’s economic structure to outperform legacy projects like XRP and Cardano (ADA) for early participants who join before the next price step.

Strategy Has Bought Another $27.2 Million Worth Of Bitcoin As announced by Strategy co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor in an X post , the Bitcoin treasury company has just made a new purchase. The buy, which occurred between October 6th and 12th, involved a sum of 220 BTC at an average price of $123,561 per token or a total cost of $27.2 million. Strategy has been a pretty consistent buyer of the cryptocurrency in recent months, but last week was one of those rare occasions where it took a break from the usual Monday acquisitions. Although the latest purchase is on the smaller side, it nonetheless signals a return of accumulation for the firm. According to the press release, this buy was funded using sales of STRF, STRK, and STRD at-the-market (ATM) stock offerings. Strategy now holds 640,250 BTC, with a total acquisition cost of $47.38 billion. At the current exchange rate, the company’s BTC treasury is at a profit of almost 55%. Michael Saylor’s firm isn’t the only Bitcoin treasury company that has recently expanded its reserves. As pointed out by blockchain sleuth Lookonchain in an X post , MARA Holdings has bought another 400 BTC. As is visible in the Arkham Intelligence data shared by Lookonchain, MARA received the sum from a wallet attached to FalconX , an institutional digital assets prime brokerage, at a total price of $46.31 million. Unlike Strategy’s purchase, which took place above $123,000, MARA’s acquisition seems to have occurred to take advantage of the post-crash BTC prices, coming in at about $115,800. Prior to the buy, the mining company held 52,850 BTC. Now, with the new 400 BTC addition, its treasury has grown to 53,250 BTC. The firm continues to be the second-largest Bitcoin treasury behind Strategy, as data from BitcoinTreasuries.net shows. The acquisition from MARA Holdings suggests that while Bitcoin’s crash was violent and caused massive liquidations, institutional interest in the cryptocurrency still remains. Speaking of the price plunge, investor morale took a huge hit by the latest market volatility. As the Fear & Greed Index created by Alternative shows, the investor sentiment dipped into the extreme fear territory during the weekend. Sunday’s value of 24 was the lowest that the indicator had seen since April. With Bitcoin observing some recovery, sentiment in the sector has marked an improvement, although it continues to be at a fear value of 38. It now remains to be seen how the trader mentality will develop in the coming days and whether investors will be able to break out of the spell of fear.

According to reports, the move came even as the wider crypto market took a heavy blow — a nearly $20 billion wipeout tied to leveraged positions — leaving many tokens under pressure while BNB pushed onward. The token also stood out in the top 20 by market cap by closing the week with a 10% gain.

After a rally to $860 in July, BNB fell about 14% to $728 and then resumed its rise. It later reached $1,075 before pulling back to $930, and it rode that momentum into the early October peak. During the market-wide sell-off that followed, BNB dipped back toward $855 but then recovered and surged to the current all-time high of $1,375, before easing to around $1,272 in the latest swings. Based on reports, the token has shown repeated cycles of sharp advances followed by manageable declines — a pattern some traders read as an ongoing bull run. #BNB swallowed that dump & made a new ATH binance super cycle. pic.twitter.com/8sihgznGky — Big Wiz 🧸📈💰 (@WisdomMatic) October 13, 2025 Traders Spot Parabolic Upswing A number of market voices have described the most recent pattern as parabolic. One prominent trader, posting under the name Big Wiz, said BNB “swallowed” last week’s crash and then went on to print new highs. Charts shared by analysts show steep curves and quick pullbacks, which have been met with buying rather than long-lasting sell pressure. This type of action has led to talk of a “Binance supercycle,” though that phrase is speculative and remains unproven. Some market participants say the rally reflects genuine demand for the token. Others worry that concentrated buying or internal factors could be inflating prices. Speculation And Skepticism Remain Reports have disclosed that not everyone agrees on the cause of the rally. Some investors point to active product launches and community interest on BNB Chain as drivers.

In a recent post , he shared a chart that mirrors XRP’s historical price behavior, implying that the current consolidation could precede a major breakout. The chart shows a striking comparison between XRP’s past accumulation phase before its 2017 surge and its present multi-year structure, suggesting a similar explosive trajectory could follow. The visual analysis highlights a pattern where XRP remained in an extended period of low volatility before entering a sharp upward move. Amonyx’s chart indicates that XRP is potentially approaching a comparable position, signaling a possible parabolic advance from its current price level. The suggestion of a “calm before the storm” encapsulates his belief that the digital asset market may soon experience substantial volatility centered around XRP. The calm before the storm… What’s coming next will change everything. None of you are ready. $XRP https://t.co/XZGqSKnCuA — Amonyx (@amonbuy) October 12, 2025 Historical Parallels and Technical Context Amonyx’s chart presents two key phases of XRP’s price behavior. The first occurred between 2014 and 2017, where XRP spent years trading sideways before launching into a dramatic rise that peaked near $3.84. The second mirrors that same structure in recent years, with XRP hovering within a tight range after a series of smaller rallies. According to the chart, the asset could be on the verge of repeating that historic move , with a suggested target that exceeds previous highs. The technical resemblance between the two formations is central to Amonyx’s outlook. His projection suggests that the extended consolidation has built sufficient structural support for a potential breakout. Although not every historical pattern guarantees a future repetition, his chart implies that the broader market conditions might be aligning with a similar setup to that of XRP’s last major bull run. Community Reactions and Diverging Opinions The post drew mixed responses from the community. Some users echoed Amonyx’s optimism, emphasizing that XRP’s extended period of accumulation could lead to a major shift once momentum returns. X user JO remarked that when the move begins, it may catch many market participants off guard, reflecting a belief that a large portion of traders remain unprepared for an upward reversal. However, not all participants shared the same enthusiasm. Another user, Corrupt, expressed skepticism, arguing that XRP had multiple opportunities to surge in the past but failed to do so, even during Bitcoin’s new all-time highs. He noted that despite positive developments surrounding XRP, price action has remained subdued. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Similarly, user Alan voiced frustration, pointing out that for some holders, XRP’s value remains significantly lower than it was eight years ago, underlining the sentiment of long-term disappointment among certain investors. XRP’s Outlook Amid Market Uncertainty While Amonyx’s analysis reflects an optimistic technical perspective, market participants remain divided over whether XRP can replicate its historic gains . The contrasting reactions show the asset’s complex position within the broader cryptocurrency landscape as it is caught between long-term confidence from supporters and persistent skepticism from critics. If Amonyx’s projection holds, the coming months could mark a turning point for XRP, potentially signaling a breakout from its prolonged consolidation phase. However, if current resistance levels remain firm, the asset may continue to trade within its existing range until stronger catalysts emerge.

In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $110K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Click to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its goal – to bring Bitcoin’s blockchain to modern standards. This means compatibility with dApps, smart contracts, and seamless DeFi programmability for developers. The L2 will run on a Canonical Bridge, combined with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), for native compatibility with Solana. You’ll be able to build token programs, LP logic, oracles, games, NFT infrastructure, DAOs, and much more. All without reinventing the wheel. To engage with the L2, you’ll deposit $BTC to a designated address monitored by the Canonical Bridge. The Relay Program verifies the details, and then mints an equivalent number of wrapped $BTC on the L2. You can also withdraw your original $BTC at any time. If you’re looking for the newest insights on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Hyper, you’re in the right place. We update this page regularly throughout the day with the latest insider insights for Bitcoin maxis and Bitcoin Hyper fans. Keep refreshing to stay ahead of the pack!

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis Bitcoin continues to enjoy strong support from the $107K-$110K zone, which also coincides with the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). Together, these support levels should provide ample fuel for the token to continue its longer-term bullish trajectory. That said, BTC is down nearly 3% so far today, and it’s crucial for the digital gold to hold above the $112K level if it wants to set up for a bullish rally in Q4 2025. The first step towards doing that would be to reclaim the 200 EMA on the 4-hour chart. The token is currently trading below it. The last time Bitcoin crossed the 200 EMA from below on the 4-hour chart, it skyrocketed nearly 12% to reach new all-time highs. If we see something similar this time around, BTC could not only surpass its current ATH but also target somewhere around $130K. JPMorgan Dives Into Bitcoin Trading — Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Surfs the Institutional Wave October 14, 2025 • 10:06 UTC Scott Lucas, Head of Markets at JPMorgan, in a recent interview with CNBC, reaffirmed that the bank is moving forward with plans to allow clients to trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. He also stated that the bank’s initial focus is to balance existing financial infrastructure with emerging blockchain opportunities, and so, custody is not on the table at the moment . In other news developments, JPMorgan has also been experimenting with digital tokens and stablecoins. The bank’s deposit token prototype, JPMD , designed to enable real-time, 24/7 cross-border settlements, is now being tested in the US. With Lucas’s interview highlighting JPMorgan’s intent to merge Wall Street’s legacy systems with blockchain technology, emerging projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) emerge as an on-ramp for retail traders to benefit from the crypto revolution. $HYPER serves as the backbone of the Bitcoin Hyper ecosystem, powering the function across its layer-2 network. You can use $HYPER for transfers, smart contract execution, on-chain interaction, and stake it for passive rewards. Dive deeper into Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) in our in-depth guide. FUD Could Signal When to Buy Crypto as Bitcoin Hyper Raises $23.5M October 14, 2025 • 10:06 UTC The best time to buy crypto could be when the market is filled with fear, uncertainty, doubt (FUD) due to world events, according to Santiment analyst Brian Q. This comes after US President Donald Trump’s recent threat to raise tariffs on Chinese goods resulted in approximately $20B in liquidations over the weekend. When FUD creeps in, Brian Q said that smart traders ‘scooped up more while the crowd was in panic.’ Despite the recent shock, some of the best crypto presales continued to pump, including Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . The project, which aims to develop a Layer 2 network for the Bitcoin ecosystem, has raised over $23.5M in its ongoing presale. Read ‘What is Bitcoin Hyper’ for more details on the project.

From Wall Street to Your Wallet: Meet Maxi Doge ($MAXI) — The Next Crypto To Explode October 14, 2025 • 10:06 UTC Dogecoin ($DOGE) is now on the rebound after its plunged to $0.10 from $0.25 during the market crash last Friday. At the time of writing, DOGE trades at $0.2116, marking a 12.98% daily recovery. Analyst Daan Crypto Trades posted on his X that the recent Doge coin ($DOGE) price behavior mirrors patterns observed often before explosive rallies. Another crypto analyst, Ali Martinez identifies the $0.19-$0.21 range as the key ‘but the dip’ support zone. He also reiterates from historic data that DOGE remains in a long-term ascending channel, with potential targets at $0.48 and $1 mark, anticipating a 373% rally from current levels. With RSI near 42 , Analysts also expect sideways trading before a possible breakout if support holds above $0.20. Meanwhile, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) — a rising gym-bro–themed meme coin is rapidly gaining investor attention, with recent whale buys of $314,432 and $313,833 , highlighting the growing confidence in the project.

Tom Lee Says Stablecoins May Be Fueling Gold’s Rally — Snorter Token Could Be the Next Crypto to Explode October 14, 2025 • 10:06 UTC Fundstrat’s Tom Lee believes stablecoins like Tether (USDT) may be the catalyst for the recent gold price rally, one of the strongest since 1979. In a recent interview with CNBC , Lee suggested that stablecoins’ expanding supply, especially Tether, could make them one of the largest buyers of gold today, as their issuers are keen on backing the tokens with tangible assets. He sees Tether as a ‘meeting ground’ between Bitcoin and gold investors. On other news, gold hit a record high of above $4,100 today , highlighting its explosive rally amid global market turbulence. Lee also noted that the crypto liquidations during last Friday’s market crash could be up to four times higher than the reported $19B due to exchange frequency limits. Although he called the sell-off a ‘gift’ for equities, predicting that the S&P could gain 200 points by mid-November, traders are exploring emerging presale opportunities as the market rebound unfolds.

MSTX appeals to investors bullish on cryptocurrency adoption and seeking amplified returns from Bitcoin's and Strategy's price movements through leverage. Strategy is one of the largest owners of cryptocurrencies, with digital asset holdings exceeding $64.0B in the second-quarter. Despite strong recent returns, MSTX carries high volatility and beta slippage risk, making it suitable mainly for tactical, high-risk investors. MSTX is a compelling option for those expecting continued Bitcoin appreciation and institutional crypto adoption, but not ideal for income-focused strategies. The Defiance Daily Target 2X Long MSTR ETF ( MSTX ) is a high-risk, high-reward investment option for investors with a favorable long term view on Strategy ( MSTR ) and cryptocurrencies, especially the world’s largest digital asset Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). The MSTX has achieved double-digit net asset value returns since its inception, and offers investors a leveraged way to play both Bitcoin and Strategy. I like the leveraged nature of the MSTX, given its potential for out-sized gains, and see the ETF has a buy for investors with an optimistic outlook on the development of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Data by YCharts Previous rating I have not previously covered the MSTX, but did analyze Strategy ( MSTR ) amid a major buying spree of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) that made the company one of the largest corporate owners of the digital currency: Bitcoin Recovery Creates Less Risk . The MSTX is a potentially compelling investment product for investors that have 1) A favorable view on cryptocurrency adoption rates, especially Bitcoin, 2) Look for outsized upside potential through the use of leverage meant to magnify Strategy’s price movements. Strong investment profile, impressive return history The MSTX does not directly own shares of Strategy, but manages to gain long exposure through the application of derivatives (i.e. swaps). I covered Strategy previously, and up-graded shares to hold, as my outlook on digital assets improved. Bitcoin recently reached a series of new all-time highs and remains key to the cryptocurrency market as a major gauge for investor sentiment. Further, the cryptocurrency regulatory environment turned decidedly pro-crypto in 2025 with the passing of the Genius Act which introduced a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers. Stablecoin issuers like Circle Internet Group ( CRCL ), which had a very successful IPO earlier this year, are an important part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Stablecoins allows investors to move in and out of more volatile cryptocurrencies quickly and efficiently, which helps add liquidity to the marketplace. The MSTX has as its primary investment goal to magnify daily price returns of Strategy: in fact, the ETF seeks to achieve 200% of the daily return of Strategy’s shares and achieves this through the utilization of leverage. Strategy is one of the largest Bitcoin owners in the world and the company has engaged in transactions worth billions of dollars to buy more Bitcoins through the use of both equity and debt. As a result, Strategy is now one of the largest corporate owners of Bitcoin in the world: as of end of the June quarter, Strategy’s digital assets were valued at $64.4B . Strategy is building a strategic treasure reserve which equals approximately ~3% of the total Bitcoin supply. As of the end of the June quarter, the company owned close to 630k Bitcoins. This holdings has now risen to more than 640k Bitcoins . Strategy The MSTX allows investors to magnify Strategy's volatility and potentially benefit from a continuation of Bitcoin’s bull-run. Earlier last week, Bitcoin made a new all-time high above ~$125,800 as sentiment improved and investors sought out high risk assets. However, at the end of last week, a major crypto sell-off ensued as the U.S. government threatened new tariffs on China, apparently in retaliation for Chinese export restrictions on rare earth minerals. The ETF has achieved strong double-digit net asset value returns since its inception on August 14, 2024. And although the MSTX only has a very short performance history, I believe that it could provide investors with a great way to play the rise of Bitcoin as well as growing institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. Defiance Daily Target 2X Long MSTR ETF The ETF has a strong return history since inception -- its NAV increased by more than 50%. As I will discuss in the risk section below, the MSTX has under-performance risk, however, related to a phenomenon called 'volatility decay' (or beta slippage). Nonetheless, the MSTX could be a strong tactical asset allocation instrument for investors that expect sharp upside movements in the price of Strategy (and Bitcoin). The ETF charges investors 1.29% in expenses annually... which is a high percentage, but not unusually high in the market for leveraged ETFs or high-yield income products. With Strategy likely reporting robust results for its third-quarter amid higher Bitcoin prices, I believe the ETF could be a potential candidate to generate alpha for investors. Additionally, major Bitcoin ETFs, such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (NASDAQ: IBIT ), have recently seen favorable asset inflows , further underpinning the idea that investors have become much more willing to take risk in the marketplace. A continuation of this trend could obviously be a major catalyst for Bitcoin as well as other cryptocurrencies that don't dominate the digital asset market. Upside potential if Bitcoin makes new highs The MSTX did worse relative to another highly popular ETF, the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY ) which is a covered call ETF seeking to monetize a synthetic long position in Strategy. The MSTY did considerably better in the last year than the MSTX -- the MSTY had a total return of 89.2% compared to a return of 43.0% for the MSTX -- but these differences occurred mainly due to the different objectives the ETFs have. The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF's primary investment objective is the generation of income via a covered call strategy, not the magnification of daily investment returns. Data by YCharts Risks with MSTX The biggest risk for the ETF is high volatility. MSTX has proven to be highly volatile over time which is a reflection of both the underlying volatility of Strategy as well as the use of leverage. Leveraged ETF products also have a risk called ' beta slippage ' which implies that over time, due to the daily rebalancing of an ETF’s leverage position, tracking inefficiencies can emerge that poses under-performance risks. Because of this beta slippage, the MSTX may be more appropriate for investors with a high risk tolerance that want to use the ETF as a tactical asset allocation instrument to magnify short term price movements. Final thoughts The Defiance Daily Target 2X Long MSTR ETF is a potentially attractive investment option for investors that have a favorable view on Strategy -- and by extension of Bitcoin -- and believe that cryptocurrency adoption is going to rise… which could propel the price of the world’s largest digital asset to new all-time highs in the months ahead. What I like about the MSTX is that the leveraged ETF provides investors leveraged exposure to Strategy (via derivatives), and Bitcoin, which allows investors with a favorable outlook on cryptocurrencies to potentially achieve serious alpha potential. While the ETF also has considerable down-side risks, I believe the investment proposition is still very attractive for investors with a high risk tolerance.",MSTX,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-14 10:10:53

Despite the weekend turbulence, it’s among the largest cryptocurrencies when measured by market cap. Backed by one of the busiest developer ecosystems in the sector, Solana still looks strong. Its network processes thousands of transactions per second and continues to attract DeFi and NFT projects. For new investors, there are other opportunities that may create larger gains. Solana’s upside looks limited and is highly leveraged to the global appetite for risk assets. Wild moves in the crypto market opened space for smaller projects like Digitap ($TAP), which is turning heads in presale markets thanks to its app listing with both the Apple App Store and Google Play. Solana’s price swoons with wider crypto market Solana is at the tail end of a strong year, climbing more than 60% as trading activity picked up and confidence in its technology returned. With its low fees and high settlement speed, it remains a leading option for developers building consumer apps. Still, at just under $200 a coin, the investment profile is different from a few years ago. Large-cap tokens like Solana tend to move with the broader market and attract institutional flows, but the days of tenfold gains from small inflows are behind it. Solana at a Glance (Oct 2025) – Price: $200 – Market Cap: ~$108B – Yearly Change: +60% From Tap-to-Pay to ATMs: Digitap brings crypto to life Digitap is a new player with a simple pitch: make crypto work like the fiat money people already use. The app functions as a wallet for both fiat and digital assets, and its co-branded Visa card allows holders to spend directly anywhere Visa is accepted. Over the weekend Digitap’s app was listed on both the Apple App Store and Google Play, so people can go live with the platform in minutes. The Visa cards Digitap offers are compatible with Apple Pay and Google Pay for tap-to-pay purchases, offers virtual cards for secure online shopping, and allows users to order custom physical cards for ATM withdrawals or in-store spending. Privacy is central to Digitap’s design. Onboarding can be done without mandatory KYC, accounts are protected through offshore banking partners, and transactions are not tracked or resold. For many investors, this is the appeal — while infrastructure tokens like Solana depend on developer adoption, Digitap’s value is tied to everyday financial activity. The payments industry alone generated more than $2.4 trillion in global revenues in 2023 and is projected to keep growing at around 7% annually. At the same time, digital wallet adoption has passed 4.3 billion users worldwide, showing how quickly consumers are moving toward app-based finance. Notably, each swipe or transfer feeds back into the $TAP token through a buy-back-and-burn system, which makes supply scarcer as usage grows. How Digitap’s presale model bakes in ROI from the start Digitap is still in presale, and its funding model has been structured to favor early buyers. Tokens are currently listed at $0.0159, with the next stage moving to $0.0194. Every stage steps the price higher, meaning that early participants gain as allocations sell out. So far, more than half of the current stage has been taken up. For small investors, the attraction lies in the combination of accessibility — buying in at cents instead of hundreds of dollars — and the staged pricing ladder, which builds returns into the process before public listing.

Solana has proven its place as a leading blockchain, with the scale and stability that come with a $108 billion valuation. Digitap is just starting out, offering a consumer product designed to bring crypto into daily spending while rewarding early participants in its presale. For investors, the decision often comes down to appetite. Solana offers reliability and infrastructure growth, but big gains are harder to find at its size. Digitap is an up and comer, and its Visa card and presale mechanics make it attractive. With an app that almost anyone can download and use, Digitap is well placed to grow into one of the largest markets on earth.

Glassnode Weighs In,https://cryptopotato.com/was-last-weeks-deleveraging-event-a-necessary-reset-for-the-bitcoin-market-glassnode-weighs-in/,"Friday, October 10, was one of the most memorable days in crypto history. The market witnessed its largest liquidation event amid trade tensions between the U.S and China. This incident spread across and has affected several parts of the market, including the spot, futures, and derivatives segments. While the event led to massive losses for investors, the market research firm Glassnode believes the deleveraging was a necessary reset for the market. A Necessary Reset As the market witnessed the wipeout of more than $19 billion in open interest, futures funding has dropped to levels not seen since the 2022 bear cycle. Leverage unwound rapidly, triggering widespread liquidations and a sharp market reset. Indicators like the Bitcoin Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) have demonstrated the extent of the reset. The RSI fell 26% from 71.7 to 52.8, indicating a shift from strong bullish momentum to neutrality. Spot CVD declined 3,883.5% from $8.6 million to -$326.9 million. The RSI demonstrates cooling buying momentum, while spot CVD shows intensified sell pressure. The former reflects a moderation in market enthusiasm, while the latter indicates growing bearish sentiment amid trader anticipation for further downside. On the other hand, futures open interest has contracted, reflecting a decline in risk across derivatives markets as investors realize losses. The open interest has decreased from $48.7 billion to $45.1 billion, while funding rates have plummeted by over 51%, from $2.9 million to $1.4 million. Additionally, perpetual CVD has dropped below its low statistical band, signaling intense selling pressure and dominant bearish sentiment. Confidence Slowly Rebuilding Furthermore, open interest in the options market has risen 12.9% as traders reposition themselves for new volatility regimes. This rise signals meaningful market engagement and moderate speculative or hedging activity. Glassnode analysts say the modest rise in skew indicates renewed demand for downside protection as investors exercise more caution. These shifts in rates and open interest cleared excess leverage, recalibrated short-term sentiment, and reduced speculative positioning. Amid the latest development, the broader market structure has remained intact with continued exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows and elevated spot trading volumes. With leveraged participants flushed out, structural capital and institutional demand remain present. The market is now in a consolidation phase, with confidence slowly rebuilding across the spot and derivatives segments.

In the earnings report, JPMorgan said its net income climbed 12% from a year earlier to $14.39 billion, equal to $5.07 per share, beating the $4.84 per-share forecast from LSEG. The bank’s revenue surged by 9% to $47.12 billion, roughly adding $700 million above estimates. So far this year, major U.S. lenders have benefited from President Donald Trump’s economic agenda, while lighter oversight of mergers and capital requirements has boosted dealmaking. Stock indexes S&P, the Dow, and Nasdaq have made over a dozen all-time highs this year too, which lifted wealth-management units at banks like JPMorgan , giving them a tailwind from client gains in risk assets, according to the report. Trading desks and investment bankers fuel a $700 million surprise JPMorgan’s CEO Jamie Dimon said each major business line delivered strong results but warned that the economy faced growing uncertainty . “While there have been some signs of a softening, particularly in job growth, the U.S. economy generally remained resilient,” he said in the earnings report. “However, there continues to be a heightened degree of uncertainty stemming from complex geopolitical conditions, tariffs and trade uncertainty, elevated asset prices and the risk of sticky inflation.” Jamie added that the corporate and investment bank saw fees rise 16% as equity-capital-markets and M&A activity picked up amid favorable market conditions. The markets division brought in a record $8.9 billion in quarterly revenue, up 25% year over year, driven by higher client activity and demand for financing. In consumer banking, JPMorgan ranked #1 in U.S. retail deposits for the fifth consecutive year and added over 400,000 new checking accounts in the quarter, according to Jamie. Wealth management posted another milestone with 43,000 first-time investors, while JPMorgan’s asset and wealth management division reported $6 billion in revenue and $109 billion in net inflows. Jamie told employees and shareholders that: “I want to thank our exceptional employees across the globe. Their passion and dedication set us apart and enable us to be trusted partners for our clients and communities, including consumers, small and large-sized businesses, schools, cities, states and countries.” Costs climb, loan-loss reserves grow, but profits keep rising JPMorgan’s net interest income hit $24.1 billion, up 2%, helped by larger revolving balances in card services and higher wholesale deposits. Excluding the markets division, it stood at $23.4 billion, roughly unchanged from last year, as lower interest rates and thinner deposit margins offset some gains. Non-interest revenue totaled $23 billion, a 16% increase, lifted by higher asset-management fees, stronger investment-banking results, auto lease income, and payments growth, according to the report . Expenses rose as well. Non-interest expense reached $24.3 billion, up 8%, reflecting higher pay, a larger front-office workforce, more brokerage and distribution costs, steeper auto lease depreciation, and heavier marketing spending. Those were partially balanced by lower legal costs. JPMorgan also increased its cushion for potential loan losses. The provision for credit losses stood at $3.4 billion, compared with $3.1 billion last year. Net charge-offs climbed by $506 million to $2.6 billion, led by the wholesale and credit-card units. The firm added $810 million in reserves, including $608 million in consumer lending and $205 million in wholesale. In the same quarter last year, the reserve build was $1 billion, with charge-offs at $2.1 billion. Across the broader industry, large banks have widened their lead over smaller lenders. The KBW Bank Index is up nearly 15% this year, while the KBW Regional Banking Index has slipped about 1%. Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo also reported on Tuesday, with Bank of America and Morgan Stanley set to follow Wednesday.

Analysis Firm CEO Shares Updated Views!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-dogecoin-doge-be-preparing-for-a-major-rise-analysis-firm-ceo-shares-updated-views/,"Dogecoin (DOGE), one of the star altcoins of the 2021 bull market, rose as high as $0.76 in May 2021. DOGE, which is approximately 70% below its 2021 ATH, rose to as high as $0.5 in January this year. Afterwards, DOGE, which could not escape the downward trend, fell to the level of $0.2. While people are wondering when the biggest memecoin Dogecoin will experience a big rally again, one analyst said that Dogecoin has not yet reached enthusiasm and short-term investors are saving. Joao Wedson, founder and CEO of cryptocurrency analysis company Alphractal, evaluated the latest situation of DOGE in his analysis shared from his X account. Analyzing various indicators on Dogecoin, Wedson first noted that in December 2024, DOGE reached ATH for the current cycle, exactly at the CVDD Alpha line. Stating that the CVDD Alpha line is a special measurement indicator for cycle tops, Wedson stated that according to this indicator, DOGE may have reached its cycle top. However, the analyst, who also looked at the Reserve Risk indicator, noted that the December 2024 peak was weak and lacked strong on-chain interest compared to other peaks. Still, he noted that the Reserve chart has perfectly predicted every DOGE peak since 2016. Wedson then noted that short-term investors are accumulating more DOGE each day, according to a Hodl Waves chart. According to the analyst, this chart shows that the supply is increasing by up to six months. On this point, the analyst noted that historically, the short-term investor accumulation pattern for Bitcoin (BTC), DOGE, and other cryptocurrencies has tended to push prices higher. According to Wedson, this is due to the influx of new speculative money into the market and an increase in Realized Market Value. Finally, Wedson touched on the MVRV Z-Score indicator. According to the analyst, the MVRV Z-Score hasn't shown the kind of over-exuberance we've seen in 2021 or previous cycles. As a result, Wedson noted that given the current circumstances, it is important to monitor the behavior of Dogecoin holders daily, as continued accumulation of Dogecoin could signal that the price could rise in the near future. Dogecoin has not yet reached euphoria, and Short-Term Holders are accumulating. In December 2024, Doge reached its ATH for the current cycle exactly at the CVDD Alpha — our custom metric for cycle tops, based on Cumulative Value Days Destroyed, which is a highly accurate… pic.twitter.com/KCXhNoahxo — Joao Wedson (@joao_wedson) October 13, 2025 *This is not investment advice.

As hope for ADA’s short-term rebound sees diminishing returns, a growing number of investors are turning their attention to brighter prospects within the DeFi market, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast becoming a top candidate. Already in Phase 6 of its presale and more than 65% sold out, Mutuum Finance is garnering notice based on its progressive ecosystem, robust tokenomics, and early traction with investors. As sentiment cools off older altcoins such as ADA, Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming investors’ new hope for the next bastion of high growth potential in 2025. Cardano ADA Price Prediction: A Test at Key Support Level Can Decide Its Next Move Cardano (ADA) has been under pressure of late, currently trading in the area of the $0.56–$0.57 support region, a spot that was recently a main area of support. Remaining above this spot will be imperative for ADA’s short-term outlook, a favorable rebound possibly resuming a move back up to the $0.6250 resistance, a move through that potentially unlocking the door to $0.75 or beyond. Should ADA not hold this support, this can be a sign that there is also ongoing pressure on the bottom during periods of general indecision within the overall market. As investors are eager for a sign that Cardano will be able to get back on a positive trajectory, many are also starting to look at alternate avenues within the realm of DeFi, with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) already garnering acceptance throughout the market as something to consider. Mutuum Finance Presale Run Mutuum Finance (MUTM) remains in the spotlight with strong momentum as it plods along in Phase 6 of presale, driving an impetus to aggressive interest. Up to this point, over 17,000 investors have invested over $17.3 million, registering continued confidence in the project’s future and exactly where it is in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Mutuum Finance protocol achieves liquidation terms and Loan-to-Value (LTV) that are in real-time, dynamic, and updated as the market evolves. This enables the platform to hedge volatility significantly, thereby rendering the platform far safer in times of volatile markets. Mutuum Finance is launching the first-ever version of its new lending and borrowing protocol during Q4 2025 on Sepolia Testnet. The extensive list of main functions will include the likes of mtTokens, liquidator bot, and debt tokens among other functionality to work towards top-notch usability and efficiency. ETH and USDT will be active on the day the collateral is loaned/borrowed, hence having active, scalable, high-speed DeFi activity. Safety Improvement The project’s security measures protect the protocol from the influence of market shock as well as makes all stable. MUTM’s lending management platform is built to maximize lending ability, together with overall capital efficiency, by continued leveraging of highly correlated holdings. Insolvency risk is reduced, and the platform will provide for a stable, secure, and sustainable DeFi borrowing and lending experience. Mutuum Finance Positions Itself as the Intelligent Money Play for 2025 While Cardano (ADA) cannot seem to spark renewed momentum around its main support area, enthusiasm is evidently moving away from seasoned investors and toward new DeFi disruptors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is perhaps the most notable substitute, having already garnered in excess of $17.3 million from a minimum of 17,000 investors during its Phase 6 presale. With its flexible Loan-to-Value (LTV) mechanism, liquidation process that is automated, and sound security infrastructure, it has a distinct advantage in terms of stability and performance, characteristics that investors are growing to appreciate in uncertain times. The planned debut of its lending and borrowing protocol on Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025 cemented its long-term growth storyline even further. For early exposure to the future giant in decentralized finance, this is the time to invest in the Mutuum Finance presale and get ahead of the next breakout cycle of the market.

XRP Is Prepping to Repeat Major History,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-sht-is-getting-real-xrp-is-prepping-to-repeat-major-history/,"Digital asset traders are revisiting an old chart pattern that once defined a major turning point for cryptocurrencies. A recent post on X by crypto proponent Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie) compared the current market structure to Bitcoin’s movement during the 2020 COVID crash. The image she shared placed two charts side by side, with the first showing Bitcoin’s sharp drop and subsequent surge in 2020, and the second showing the present decline , which she attributed to President Donald Trump’s tariffs against China. The resemblance has fueled renewed optimism among investors tracking XRP’s next move. The comparison highlighted how Bitcoin’s price fell dramatically before staging one of the strongest rallies in its history. Amelie’s chart suggested that if history repeats, XRP could benefit from Bitcoin’s momentum. Sh*t is getting real Coming soon: #XRP double digits! pic.twitter.com/E4JbGtQULf — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) October 12, 2025 Market Dynamics and XRP’s Position In previous cycles, Bitcoin’s major rebounds have tended to lift the altcoin market . XRP has often shown strong relative performance during these phases, leading analysts to monitor its reaction closely. The argument circulating among traders is that Bitcoin’s dominance sets the tone for liquidity flows, while XRP’s resilience against Bitcoin in recent months may position it for potential gains. Historically, when Bitcoin stabilized after sharp declines, altcoins such as XRP often saw accelerated moves, and market participants are treating the current correction as a setup for something big. Amelie believes this setup could send XRP to double digits as Bitcoin targets new peaks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Sentiment and Technical Factors Amelie’s post reflects a broader sentiment shift within the digital asset community, where traders point to historical performance as a reference point for XRP’s next moves. The chart’s inclusion of horizontal resistance levels adds credence to this prediction, as Bitcoin has spent recent sessions under a horizontal resistance level. If Bitcoin’s recovery resembles the post-2020 trend, XRP’s established use cases in cross-border payments and its growing institutional adoption could attract renewed capital inflows. Outlook for XRP Holders The growing attention on XRP’s technical setup comes as global markets adjust to new policy developments and shifting trade narratives. For many investors, the focus has turned to whether Bitcoin can repeat its prior recovery trajectory. A successful rebound could validate Amelie’s comparison and intensify speculation across altcoins. While traders await confirmation of any sustained uptrend, the chart serves as a visual reminder of how quickly XRP could reach Amelie’s double-digit target .

The growing adoption rate of the XRP Ledger Protocol could push XRP to $13.41, with a possible maximum trading value of $14.30 in 2028. In 2031, the target price for XRP is between $21.45 and $23.24, with an average price of $22.35. XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future. Whether it will reach new highs or continue to grow steadily remains to be seen, and despite its history of legal battles with the Securities and Exchange Commission, this digital asset will undoubtedly play an important role in global financial institutions. So, how high can XRP realistically go? Will XRP reach 5 dollars? Let’s answer these questions in our XRP price prediction.

The coin’s price is currently trading at $2.43 after a strong correction. Concurrently, the cryptocurrency has lost 6.17% of its value in the last 24 hours.

The Bollinger Bands are expanding, and the indicator’s arms are far apart, leading to high volatility in the market. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $3.20. Conversely, its lower limit, indicating support, has moved to $2.37. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present within the neutral region. The indicator’s value has decreased to index 35.05 in the past 24 hours. The descending curve on the RSI graph reflects a rising selling pressure. If the bearish momentum continues to intensify, further downside is possible. XRP price analysis on the 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis for the XRP coin also shows a bearish trend in the market, as price levels are decreasing. The XRP/USD value recently decreased to $2.44 in the past few hours, as the selling pressure is forming below the moving average line. XRP/USD 4-hour price chart.

Ripple price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events, as the price movement is in a downward direction. The coin’s price has decreased to a low of $2.43 over the last 24 hours. The coin has lost up to 6.17 percent of its value. Technical indicators give bearish signals, and the price charts also project a bearish market scenario for the day. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple, along with the rising adoption, might boost the XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisitions and CBDC developments make XRP a good long-term investment option. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. It is advised to proceed with caution Why is XRP down? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has decreased as selling pressure took hold, bringing the price to $2.43 during the day. The RSI decreased to 35.05 at the same time and is in neutral territory. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $4.47 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to increase significantly. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by the end of this year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.65, achieved on July 18, 2025. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a chance of reaching $20 by 2030. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Still, the token provides a good buying opportunity to investors looking for long-term goals. However, one’s own research is advised before making the investment decision. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is trading at five times its value from last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $23.24 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Cryptopolitan reported that Ripple CTO David Schwartz is stepping back from his daily duties at Ripple Labs after more than 13 years at the firm. He also noted that he isn’t leaving the company permanently and will join the company board. He will stay as CTO Emeritus, an honorary title. XRP price prediction October 2025 According to the Ripple price prediction, in October 2025, XRP could reach a maximum price of $3.60. The average trading price is expected to be $2.92 for the month, while the lowest it can go, as per XRP cost estimation, is $2.30, considering the current XRP sentiment.

XRP historic price sentiment XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. By the middle of May, XRP touched $2.57, and in July, it marked a new all-time high of $3.65. Near the start of August 2025, XRP was trending above $3, showing significant growth as the market sentiment was tilting toward the positive side; however, it lost $3 by the end of the month.

Speakers debated the catalysts behind institutional adoption — from on-chain fund issuance to regulatory clarity and interoperability — and the milestones Ethereum must cross to sustain its lead in decentralized finance and tokenized assets. Thoughts Following ‘Black-Friday’s’ Crypto Crash “Friday was a terrible day for humans,” Chalom said. “People lost their skin, some their lives. If the ecosystem can’t self-police itself, leverage works itself through — in any market.” Chalom, who spent two decades at BlackRock, said the crash exposed the dangers of excessive leverage and the tight correlation between decentralized finance (DeFi) and centralized exchanges. “Most of what you saw, which was sadly closed out, was insidious leverage garbage — and you can quote me on that,” he added. Joseph Chalom @SharpLinkGaming at #DAS2025 “Friday was a terrible day for humans. People lost their skin, some their lives.

Centralized systems have become abusive. We need censorship resistance, which comes from rigorous decentralization — and systems that integrate artificial intelligence and decentralized protocols.” What Joe Lubin's paying attention to in the next couple of years: pic.twitter.com/HnmyOWaxd9 — Digital Asset Summit 2025 (@blockworksDAS) October 14, 2025 Both speakers agreed that the road to trillions will not be paved by speculation, but by resilient, decentralized infrastructure capable of supporting the next generation of global finance.

Key Takeaways: Poland says Russia’s GRU is using cryptocurrency to fund sabotage and cyberattacks across the EU. The payments help Moscow evade Western intelligence tracking and bypass financial sanctions. Poland has tightened crypto regulations to close potential funding loopholes used by Russian agents. The method, he said, allows Moscow to conceal financial flows and evade detection by Western intelligence services, according to a Monday report by the Financial Times . Russia’s GRU Funding Sabotage Operations with Cryptocurrency Sławomir Cenckiewicz, head of Poland’s National Security Bureau, told the FT that Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU, has been using crypto to finance operations ranging from sabotage to cyberattacks on critical infrastructure. “A network of agents recruited by Russia’s GRU military intelligence agency, which was uncovered in Poland in 2023, had to a high extent been financed with cryptocurrency,” Cenckiewicz said, adding that Warsaw believes Moscow continues to rely on such methods. Last month, Poland’s lower house of parliament approved new legislation tightening oversight of the crypto-asset market, including prison terms for violators. Cenckiewicz said the measure is also meant to block Russian funding routes. “The Polish intelligence services are very much interested in this whole legislative process, to ensure there are no gaps that would allow foreign powers to use [crypto] to finance their agents,” he said.

Russia is using cryptocurrency to fund hybrid attacks on EU states."" pic.twitter.com/iKvtTFrqXr — RussiaNews (@mog_russEN) October 13, 2025 The Kremlin has increasingly turned to digital assets to bypass Western sanctions and sustain operations after its banks were excluded from the Swift payment system following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. “When we look at the cyber domain, Poland is now in a state of war [with Russia]; it’s not a state of threat any more,” Cenckiewicz warned. Over the past year, Polish authorities have shut down two Russian consulates and expelled several Russian and Belarusian diplomats accused of aiding sabotage networks. Cenckiewicz said these officials were “the first layer” of infiltration, noting that Moscow now depends on “ad hoc” local agents paid small sums in crypto. “There is no doubt that the Russians had some assets among these people,” he added. EU Eyes Sanctions on Russian Ruble-Backed Stablecoin A7A5 As reported, the European Union is weighing a fresh round of sanctions targeting A7A5, a ruble-backed stablecoin that has rapidly become the largest non-US-dollar pegged token in the world. The move would prohibit EU-based individuals and companies from interacting with the token, either directly or via intermediaries. The EU’s efforts follow similar moves by the US and UL, which in August sanctioned Capital Bank of Central Asia and its director, Kantemir Chalbayev, along with Kyrgyz exchanges Grinex and Meer, all accused of helping Russia’s financial sector evade restrictions. A7A5 was launched in February by A7, a cross-border payments firm owned by Moldovan fugitive banker Ilan Shor and Russia’s state-owned lender Promsvyazbank (PSB). Both entities are under US, UK, and European Union sanctions.

The WDK also contains a starter wallet for iOS and Android. The WDK template wallet features full non-custodial support, multiple mnemonic backup options, and a complete DeFi module covering USDT, USDT0, lending, swapping, and more. According to Tether , the wallet has already undergone auditing, with an emphasis on strengthening protection at the code level.

WDK template wallet expands DeFi tools for crypto users The company presented the WDK Template Wallet as a tool for developers and users alike. The wallet comes with built-in DeFi support and is undergoing security audits to strengthen trust. The project, according to Tether executives, is expected to become the backbone for a new generation of wallets. Additionally, it will enable developers worldwide to adapt the kit, allowing them to create custom wallets that integrate DeFi tools directly. The company described this move as part of its plan to provide the framework for billions of wallets. The project also offers flexibility for developers building at different scales. Ardoino explained that teams can fork the template, add specific branding or functions, and publish directly to their audiences. This reduces development time while ensuring the wallet maintains audited security layers. The demo provided by the company showed that the wallet supports Tether’s USDT and USDT0 while enabling flexible seed backup strategies. Ardoino emphasized that these options simplify onboarding without sacrificing control, ensuring users keep custody of their funds. He added that the interface was designed with reusable UI components for faster development cycles. Ardoino confirmed the WDK can run on both desktop and mobile operating systems. This cross-platform support was described as central to Tether’s approach, making wallet deployment scalable for global projects. To that end, developers are expected to begin testing broader integrations once the codebase is made publicly available. Ardoino expects “trillions” of new self-custody wallets to be created with the instruments of the new WDK. As a result, the new generation of crypto users will have “pure freedom” in their crypto journeys. The rapid minting of USDT raises questions Tether began the month by minting approximately $1 billion worth of USDT on the Ethereum blockchain. Tether minted $775.8 million on October 10 and another $771 million on October 11. This represents one of the largest short-term issuance bursts this year. With this expansion, Tether’s total supply now stands at $180 billion, including $80 billion on Ethereum alone. The rapid minting of USDT has intensified scrutiny over whether Tether is maintaining sufficient reserves to back each token. Any perceived shortfall could erode trust in Tether and the stablecoin sector as a whole. According to Tether, the tokens are ready but not yet in circulation because this minting is a “authorized but not issued” transaction. The usual reason for this is to ensure that future issuance requests are met promptly. Meanwhile, the CEO of Tether’s portfolio company, Rumble, expects USDT’s market cap to add 500% “sooner than everyone thinks.” The USDT stablecoin, Tether’s flagship product, achieved a new all-time high in terms of circulating supply. With the USDT market cap currently exceeding $175 billion, it is responsible for 56.4% of the net stablecoin scene volume.

The firm, as of Oct 14, now holds 30,823 Bitcoin worth approximately $3.4 billion, yet trades for less than the value of its crypto assets. Notably, this growing financial imbalance facing Metaplanet is happening to the majority of digital asset treasury companies worldwide. From All-Time Highs to Trading at Discount Metaplanet’s shares reached an all-time high in mid-June but have since declined by about 70%, making the company the first major Bitcoin treasury firm to consistently trade below its holdings. Source: Google Finance At the time of publication, the share is trading at 482 Yen ($3.21), down 12.36% today. According to Bloomberg, Mark Chadwick, a Japan equity analyst who publishes research on Smartkarma, described the decline as “ a popping of a bubble .” Chadwick believes that the “ general euphoria ” surrounding Bitcoin stockpiling has cooled, although “ long-term Bitcoin bulls ” may view Metaplanet’s discount as a buying opportunity, he noted. The downturn coincided with broader market turmoil. Crypto traders faced a record $19 billion in liquidations on October 10 after President Donald Trump announced harsher tariffs on China, triggering severe volatility that sent most major tokens tumbling. Reacting to the massive liquidation, Bitcoin, for instance, dropped to 6 6-month low, trading very closely to $101K. Quarter of Bitcoin Treasuries Now Trade at Discount as Bubble Deflates Metaplanet is far from alone in its struggles. K33 Research reports that a quarter of all public companies holding Bitcoin now trade at market values below their BTC holdings, with 26 out of 168 Bitcoin-holding firms trading at a discount. The most dramatic collapse hit NAKA, the merger vehicle of KindlyMD and Nakamoto Holdings, which lost 96% of its market value from its peak and now trades at just 0.7x NAV, down from 75x. Other firms, including Twenty One, Semler Scientific, and The Smarter Web Company, have similarly fallen below their net asset values. Industry-wide premiums have also compressed sharply. The average mNAV across treasury firms dropped from 3.76 in April to 2.8, while daily Bitcoin accumulation by these companies slowed to just 1,428 BTC in September, which is the weakest pace since May. Several companies have resorted to desperate measures. ETHZilla, formerly 180 Life Sciences, secured $80 million in debt from Cumberland DRW to fund a $250 million share buyback after its stock fell 76% from August peaks. Electric vehicle firm Empery Digital expanded its debt facility to $85 million for buybacks, despite holding $476 million in Bitcoin, which exceeds its $378 million market cap. Analysts have been warning about this burst since the beginning of the year. Back in June, VanEck warned that companies approaching parity with their Bitcoin holdings risk “erosion” rather than “capital formation.” The firm’s head of digital assets research, Matthew Sigel, recommended pausing share issuance programs if stocks trade below 0.95 times NAV for 10 or more trading days. No public BTC treasury company has traded below its Bitcoin NAV for a sustained period. But at least one is now approaching parity. As some of these companies raise capital through large at-the-market (ATM) programs to buy BTC, a risk is emerging: If the stock trades at or near… — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) June 16, 2025 Corporate Accumulation Slows 95% as Strategy’s Premium Collapses Monthly corporate Bitcoin adoption has declined by 95% since July , according to CryptoQuant data, which shows that only one company adopted Bitcoin in September, compared to 21 in July. The decline comes as 205 publicly traded companies have announced digital asset treasury strategies with a collective $117 billion funneled into crypto. Strategy Inc., formerly MicroStrategy and the sector’s bellwether, has seen its mNAV premium crash from 3.89x in November 2024 to 1.44x following the launch of IBIT ETF options earlier this year. Strategy’s monthly Bitcoin purchases have also plummeted from 134,000 BTC in November 2024 to just 3,700 BTC in August 2025, though the company added 6,000 BTC in the first 10 days of September. The firm now holds 640,250 BTC at a cost basis of $74,000 per coin, which translates to over $24 billion in unrealized gains. Source: SaylorTracker Back in August, Sentora research also identified critical vulnerabilities in corporate Bitcoin strategies, warning that “ idle Bitcoin on a corporate balance sheet is not a scalable strategy in a rising-rate world .” Most treasury companies engage in negative-carry trades, borrowing fiat currency to acquire non-yielding assets without adequate risk mitigation. Rising interest rates intensify these pressures, making it increasingly difficult to manage risk. Just like Sentora, Coinbase Research also warned last month that the sector has transitioned from guaranteed premiums to a “ player-versus-player ” competitive phase where most participants face potential failure during adverse credit cycles. Both firms believe that without Bitcoin evolving to generate yield, corporate treasuries remain structurally vulnerable to market downturns and rising rates.

XRP’s sitting around $2.88, and analysts say it’s forming a “cup and handle” pattern that could push the price to $5 if momentum holds up. And $10 is the main goal. However, an under $0.005 altcoin named Little Pepe gets all the investments and targets the $0.50 mark. Market Shifts from Speculation to Strategy Crypto never sleeps, and this season is proof of that. While XRP fans are talking charts and RSI movements, retail investors are chasing something fresher. That’s where Little Pepe steps in. It’s in Stage 131, priced at $0.0022, with nearly $26.9 million raised out of $28.7 million. That’s about 95% done, and it’s clear folks don’t want to miss this one. For XRP, the key support sits at $2.60. If it stays above that level, it might push toward $5. But while Ripple’s fate depends on chart patterns, Little Pepe’s rise feels more organic, driven by hype, humor, and a solid community that’s not slowing down anytime soon. A Tale of Two Movements Both coins are doing their own thing, Ripple’s all about fintech and partnerships, while Little Pepe’s mixing memes with real blockchain tech. Fast, cheap, secure, it’s wrapped in a frog suit. Funny, right? But it’s working. And somehow, they balance each other out. Ripple’s looking at ETF talks and big-money inflows. Little Pepe’s rallying the internet crowd from the ground up. Two totally different worlds, yet both show how diverse crypto has become. Community Strength Over Price Speculation Ripple’s crowd watches every move like hawks. Reports said 160 million XRP moved around recently, and people started whispering about whales taking profits. Still, the mood’s mostly positive, RSI is climbing, and traders think the chart still looks healthy. Little Pepe’s community? A whole different vibe. It’s not about charts, it’s about memes, giveaways, and energy. The Mega Giveaway (the one with 15 ETH in rewards) has turned the hype meter way up. The team drops updates, and fans drop memes. It’s chaos, but it's the good kind. Security and Trust Matter Too Even though one’s a meme and the other’s a blue-chip altcoin, Ripple and Little Pepe care about security. Ripple’s been around forever, with big partnerships and a steady rep. Little Pepe just got CertiK -audited and scored 95.49%, which is pretty damn good for a project this new. Investors love that. It gives them peace knowing there’s some real work behind the jokes. That kind of trust goes a long way in a space where rug pulls happen every other day. Charting the Next Big Move Analysts are buzzing that XRP might soon swing at that $3.20 resistance level before shooting up toward $5. Meanwhile, Little Pepe’s getting close to wrapping up the stage 13th of its presale, and experts are already hyped about what’s next. The price jump is showing a decent ROI for early birds. And market experts already think the token will touch the $0.50 mark. It’s kind of cool seeing both stories unfold. One coin is fighting to break out of old resistance, and the other is just starting its journey. Different roads, but both are catching serious attention in 2025. Author's Note Whether XRP really hits $5 or Little Pepe becomes the next meme king, one thing’s for sure: crypto’s never boring. Traders are hedging bets between Ripple’s stability and Pepe’s wild potential. Both could win, honestly. Haven’t peeked at the Little Pepe presale yet? Check it out before the current stage is completed and the price bumps to $0.0023. And if you’re all about those community vibes, swing by the Little Pepe Telegram . Updates, memes, and maybe even some surprises are waiting for you.

Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency community is also turning its attention to a new and vibrant contender, Little Pepe, priced below half a cent, yet making significant strides in its funding goals. Understanding the Market's Dynamics The crypto landscape is continuously evolving, with different tokens representing various facets of the market's diversity. Ripple, with its strong foundation in fintech solutions, contrasts sharply with Little Pepe, a meme-inspired cryptocurrency that combines humor with blockchain technology. This juxtaposition showcases the broad spectrum of opportunities within the crypto world, from serious financial applications to light-hearted community engagements. Ripple's Strategic Positioning Currently positioned at around $2.88, Ripple is speculated by analysts to be forming a ""cup and handle"" pattern—a bullish signal in chart analysis that could propel its price toward the $5 mark, with aspirations of eventually reaching $10. With significant support at $2.60, the cryptocurrency's fate seems tied to its technical chart performance. Little Pepe's Emergence in the Crypto Scene In an interesting turn of events, the altcoin Little Pepe, which is still in its funding phase with a current price of just $0.0022, has captured the interest of many investors. The project has successfully raised nearly $26.9 million out of a targeted $28.7 million, demonstrating a robust community support and a high level of engagement. Security and Trust in Digital Assets Despite their differences in market positioning and community culture, both Ripple and Little Pepe prioritize security—a crucial aspect in winning investor confidence. Ripple maintains its reputation through longstanding partnerships and financial tech innovations, whereas Little Pepe has recently achieved a high score from a CertiK audit , affirming its security measures early in its development. The Future Trajectory of Ripple and Little Pepe As the market continues to monitor Ripple's potential to breach the $3.20 resistance level, Little Pepe is rapidly approaching the end of its 13th funding stage, with the community eagerly anticipating its next phase. With distinct paths but a shared goal of growth and acceptance, both Ripple and Little Pepe reflect the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Whether you are drawn to the established prowess of Ripple or the spirited novelty of Little Pepe, each offers unique avenues for engagement and investment.

The move, seen as direct retaliation against President Donald Trump’s newly announced 100% tariffs on Chinese goods, has reignited fears of a full-scale trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Over 1.66 million crypto traders were liquidated as the market experienced a sharp downturn, wiping out $19.33 billion in positions. #Trump #Bitcoin https://t.co/7PNRagvFrx — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 11, 2025 Following the announcement, over 1.66 million traders were wiped out in 24 hours , resulting in $19.33 billion in liquidated positions. Bitcoin and Ethereum alone accounted for nearly $10 billion of those losses, making it one of the year’s most severe deleveraging events. Additionally, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index plunged from a “Greed” level of 64 on Friday to 27 (“Fear”) on Saturday, its lowest in six months. Rare Earth Exports Fall 31% as Beijing Tightens Controls The latest measures expand Beijing’s existing restrictions to five additional rare earth elements, including holmium and erbium, requiring export approval for any product containing more than 0.1% of Chinese-sourced rare earths. These materials are essential to industries ranging from electric vehicles and wind turbines to advanced defense systems. With China controlling more than 90% of global rare earth processing capacity, the new policy has raised concerns over potential supply chain disruptions and mounting production costs worldwide. Sources familiar with the matter said Chinese magnet manufacturers have been facing tighter scrutiny on export license applications since September. Approval processes have lengthened, with applications increasingly returned for additional documentation. Though still within the Commerce Ministry’s 45-day window, the review process now resembles that of April, when export delays caused magnet shortages and temporary shutdowns at several automotive plants. Data released Monday showed China’s rare earth exports plunged 31% in September, suggesting that the slowdown had already begun before the latest round of restrictions.

He also warned of possible U.S. export bans on critical software beginning November 1. The exchange rattled markets and cast doubt on a potential meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month. China fired back on Tuesday, vowing to “fight to the end” if the U.S. escalates. “The United States cannot simultaneously seek dialogue while threatening new restrictive measures,” China’s commerce ministry said in a statement.

The Bitcoin Hyper Fast-Track for Bitcoin’s Next Chapter,https://bitcoinist.com/hyper-next-crypto-to-1000x-the-bitcoin-hyper-fast-track/,"Quick Facts : 1️⃣ Bitcoin’s limited throughput, high fees, and lack of native DeFi restrict its use as a true digital currency. 2️⃣ Bitcoin Hyper introduces an SVM Layer 2, enabling instant, low-fee, and secure Bitcoin transactions. 3️⃣ Over $23.5M raised positions Bitcoin Hyper as a major Layer 2 contender. Bitcoin is king. It’s the most secure, battle-tested blockchain in history, and has proven its resilience again and again. When the latest crypto market instability resurfaced, wiping hundreds of billions off the total crypto market cap, Bitcoin wobbled, plunged – and then rebounded, weathering the storm just like it always has. Yet, for all its dominance, Bitcoin, as a blockchain, still struggles with growing pains: slow transfers , high fees during congestion, and a lack of a native environment for DeFi or complex smart contracts. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) emerges with a bold promise: unlock the dormant utility of $BTC beyond merely a store-of-value via a high-performance Layer 2 built on Solana’s architecture – all while preserving Bitcoin’s security. Could Hyper be the upgrade Bitcoin’s ecosystem needs? The Bottlenecks Bitcoin Hyper Aims to Solve At its core, Bitcoin is a rigid, ultra-secure ledger designed for trustless settlement. But that same rigidity creates bottlenecks: With an average TPS of only 6–7, Bitcoin can’t support mass usage. Congestion spikes, especially in the rush for the best meme coins or bull-market moments, push fees and delay confirmations. Confirmations often take 10 minutes or more – far too slow for everyday payments, micropayments, or interactive applications. High on-chain fees during peak demand make small-value transfers uneconomical. Bitcoin lacks native smart-contract support. Most DeFi, NFTs, or app logic must reside on sidechains or complementary chains, which limits cohesion within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Many scaling proposals compromise decentralization or security – an unacceptable trade for Bitcoin purists. These limitations constrain BTC’s trajectory, restricting it to a passive store of value rather than an active application platform or even its original vision as a digital payment . Hyper directly targets those limitations. The Hyper Approach: Solana-Speed Meets Bitcoin Security Bitcoin Hyper designs a bridge between Bitcoin’s impregnable base layer and a high-speed execution layer. Its blueprint features: Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) Execution Layer Hyper adapts Solana’s runtime environment to run smart contracts, parallel execution, and composable dApps – giving Bitcoin access to a high-throughput application layer. Canonical $BTC Bridge Users deposit $BTC into a trustless bridge . Wrapped $BTC is minted on Hyper, enabling users to use their $BTC in the faster L2. When they want to exit, the wrapped token is burned, and $BTC is released on L1, validated via proofs. A trustless bridge allows users to transfer assets (in this case, wrapped Bitcoin) between two blockchains without relying on a centralized third party.Zero-Knowledge Anchoring & Settlement Bitcoin Hyper batches L2 transactions, compresses them into succinct proofs ( zero-knowledge or ZK proofs ), and commits to Bitcoin’s base chain. That ensures correctness without congesting the base layer. On the utility side, the $HYPER token enables: Sub-second, ultra-low fee transfers Native smart contracts & dApps powered by bridged $BTC DeFi mechanisms: staking, lending, swaps, yield farming, NFTs Governance & community-driven evolution The native $HYPER token is central to the economy, serving as fuel for gas, staking incentives, governance, and developer rewards. Its fixed supply (21B) and deflationary burner options give it a built-in scarcity model. Presale: Hype Builds for $HYPER Bitcoin Hyper’s presale powers on, with tokens currently priced at $0.013115. The rate escalates periodically, rewarding early backers. To date, the presale has raised over $23M – a substantial war chest for launch, development, incentives, and marketing. Token allocation is designed to fuel growth but also reward stakeholders: 30% to Treasury 25% to Marketing 30% to Development / Ecosystem 10% for Listings/liquidity 5% for Rewards/staking Stakers can earn high APYs – currently 50% – in the early stages of the project. To reap the greatest rewards, learn how to buy and stake $HYPER during the presale. As network usage grows, demand for $HYPER to pay gas, stake, and vote increases. Since supply is fixed, the potential upside is already built in. Combined with Bitcoin’s own recovery, $HYPER could be a turbocharged, leveraged play on $BTC’s resurgence. Our price prediction forecasts $HYPER potentially reaching $0.32 by the end of the year as Bitcoin regains ground. Multiyear scenarios – especially if the ecosystem grows – show the chance that $HYPER could reach the heady territory of $1.50. Meanwhile, with Bitcoin down roughly 10% over the past week, the story $HYPER tells is a simple one: Bitcoin Hyper is your way to not just ride Bitcoin’s rebound but push the boundaries of what Bitcoin can do. $23.5M Blazes Path Ahead for $HYPER Execution is hard: building secure bridges, ZK proof systems, fallback dispute layers, and seamless UX won’t be easy. But the $23.5M presale (so far) is fueled in part by major whale buys, indicating a strong depth of support for the project and investors willing to bet on long-term success. Notable purchases include: The most recent whale buy – $32K The largest $HYPER whale buy – $379K There’s growing interest in a protocol that unlocks Bitcoin’s full utility for the ever-expanding crypto economy. In that sense, Bitcoin Hyper isn’t merely a speculative token – it presents itself as an essential upgrade for the Bitcoin ecosystem. Hyper could thrust $BTC into the future as not only digital gold, but also programmable money, capable of supporting real-time applications, DeFi flows, and a new generation of use cases. Bitcoin Hyper’s own utility is clear: investors can ride $BTC’s recovery while also betting on the migration of capital and utility into Bitcoin’s upgraded layer. If that feedback loop ignites, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) could become the next crypto to 1000x, propelling both $HYPER and $BTC to new heights. As always, do your own research; this isn’t financial advice.

As traders lost trust in altcoins, the market still reconsiders the possibility of renewed accumulation. Altcoins are now trading below their long-term trendline, sliding from their 200-day and 50-day moving averages. The liquidation event on October 10-11 undermined trust in altcoins, as it turned out that many assets relied on market makers and lacked organic liquidity. 90% of altcoins are trading below their long-term trendline after the recent market crash. The indicator has pointed to recoveries in the past, though altcoins can still spend months with depressed prices. | Source: Cryptoquant Following the recent market crash, altcoins on Binance returned to bear-market levels. Only around 10% of altcoins have retained their direction, with the rest falling below their general trend. There is no confidence that the assets may regain the trend, as the recent breakdown erased three years of growth on the crypto market. The recent expansion season is also over, as the altcoin season index sank to 36 points. While some tokens achieved rapid recoveries from their lows, the market is still reeling and enthusiasm for altcoins may take a long time to rebuild. Can altcoins recover? The recent market crash led to rapid loss of value, with some assets like ATOM going to zero due to Binance’s trading structure . The lack of liquidity led to a loss of trust, though some blue-chip assets survived. The altcoin market was still supported by ETH hovering close to $4,000, while BNB still made new all-time highs. However, the increased volatility undermined trust, as even the leading coins took a step back. The current market conditions are even putting pressure on BTC, as the leading coin sank toward the $110,000 level. The current indicators have served as a sign to buy altcoins in the past. However, despite the rock-bottom price, there has been little return in demand, and only short-term rallies. During past cycles, altcoins have recovered from deep crashes and continue to have record seasons of expansion. This time around, the market is yet to show a return of trust, mostly based on the risky trading mechanisms for altcoins. ETF approval delays hurt some of the altcoins Some of the altcoins in the ETF shortlist are losing their positions, as the US government shutdown has delayed the approval procedure indefinitely. A total of 16 altcoin ETFs are in limbo, with the most notable linked to SOL, XRP, and LTC. ADA and DOGE also awaited approvals, ahead of an eventual rally. The XRP ETF delay also led to accelerated whale selling, as long-term holders still wanted to realize gains at a more favorable price. October set the expectation for a flood of approvals, with over 70 ETFs in the queue. Approvals were expected between October 16 and October 26, with some of the funds given 90% odds of launching in the coming weeks. The ETFs are still expected to start trading in case the government shutdown ends. However, the altcoins will have to start at a lower range. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

The bank said worsening U.S.-China trade tensions triggered a sharp futures selloff on Friday that spilled into crypto, underscoring its volatility and correlation with equities. Both crypto and stock markets have since clawed back some losses, the report noted. The world's largest cryptocurrency was trading around $111,700 at publication time. A violent flash crash hit crypto markets on Friday and erased more than $500 billion in value and forced nearly $20 billion in liquidations across derivatives platforms. Bitcoin dropped as much as 13% in an hour, before bottoming near $102,000. Citi said exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows remained resilient, likely driven by newer, less levered investors, and it doesn’t expect the liquidations to derail demand. Bitcoin and ether remain near September levels, and the bank kept its 12-month targets of $181,000 for BTC and $5,400 for ETH, with year-end forecasts of $133,000 and $4,500. Citi said sustained ETF flows support the base case, while the bear case depends on equity market weakness.

In an interview with Sky News , Samson Mow, chief executive of JAN3 and one of the key figures behind El Salvador’s 2021 adoption of Bitcoin, argued that the cryptocurrency’s recent rise was “inevitable.” He compared it to “a ball pushed underwater for months,” pointing to ETF inflows and long-term accumulation as proof that supply has finally met overwhelming demand. Mow believes a single Bitcoin could eventually trade at $500,000, describing this as the start of a “massive supply shock.” Around 6.7% of total supply is now held by ETFs, while another 3% sits with Michael Saylor’s Strategy, a firm dedicated to accumulating BTC. For investors who see scarcity as the ultimate driver, the logic is compelling. But for anyone looking for predictable outcomes rather than open-ended projections, even a confident forecast remains only a forecast. Bitcoin Forecasts Rekindle Market Optimism The narrative of limited supply has always defined Bitcoin’s appeal. Mow’s argument is that once demand outpaces the tiny float available for trading, price discovery must move sharply upward. The theory depends entirely on market behavior — no fixed path, no guaranteed ratio, and no built-in floor or ceiling. That uncertainty is part of Bitcoin’s attraction but also its risk. Every move higher depends on investor conviction and external liquidity. In this environment, a project that states its financial parameters in advance — pricing, bonuses, and listing values — offers something increasingly rare: measurable predictability. XRP Tundra represents that counterpoint. Instead of relying on market speculation, it defines value through transparent math and verified mechanics. The project runs a dual-chain model that connects Solana and the XRP Ledger, assigning clear roles to each token and publishing every key number ahead of time. In the ongoing Phase 6, TUNDRA-S — the Solana-based utility and yield token — is priced at $0.1 and comes with a 14 % token bonus. Every participant also receives free TUNDRA-X, quoted at $0.05 at no cost. Listing prices are confirmed at $2.5 for S and $1.25 for X. The upside is fixed, not assumed, and participation terms are identical for everyone. While Bitcoin’s trajectory depends on ETF inflows and long-term holders, Tundra’s framework builds its own internal mechanics: reward ratios, liquidity depth, and governance logic that do not change with sentiment. How the Dual-Chain Model Locks the Math The system’s architecture separates utility from oversight. TUNDRA-S on Solana drives yield and future staking through the Cryo Vaults program, while TUNDRA-X on the XRP Ledger anchors governance and reserves. This division mirrors how regulated markets separate asset function from control — liquidity handled on one network, decision-making on another. Cryo Vaults will activate after the presale, allowing structured staking options with yields up to 30% APY. Buyers in current phases automatically secure access. The approach makes Tundra one of the few new projects where long-term rewards and token distribution are both predetermined. For investors studying the mechanics, Crypto League recently analyzed how dual-chain systems like Tundra’s are redefining DeFi architecture. Verified Architecture Builds Real Confidence The credibility behind those numbers comes from documentation, not promises. Tundra’s contracts have been independently audited by Cyberscope , Solidproof , and FreshCoins . Team identity and tokenomics are verified through Vital Block KYC . These reviews form a traceable record of the codebase and ownership, aligning the project with compliance expectations already shaping mainstream digital-asset markets. Where Bitcoin’s transparency comes from its open ledger and fixed supply, Tundra’s comes from verifiable audits and preset financial conditions. Both rely on trust — one in mathematics, the other in accountability. Phase 6 Data Signal a New DeFi Mood Participation figures show consistent momentum. The presale has raised over $1.2 million from 11,600+ contributors, with roughly $10,000 in Arctic Spinner instant rewards distributed. The defined pricing — $0.1 for TUNDRA-S and $0.05 reference for TUNDRA-X — establishes a transparent entry point ahead of their listings at $2.5 and $1.25. Bitcoin’s next move may depend on macro liquidity, ETF flows, and global demand. Tundra’s trajectory depends on whether investors now prefer certainty over conjecture.

Ethereum for National ID In the latest post on X, Aya Miyaguchi, President of the Ethereum Foundation, revealed that the integration has been completed, while all resident credentials are set to be migrated by the first quarter of 2026. The announcement was made at a high-profile event featuring Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay, and Crown Prince Jigme Namgyel Wangchuk. Blockchain-powered national ID systems are increasingly being recognized for their potential to enhance transparency and security, particularly with zero-knowledge (zk) proofs enabling privacy protection. Bhutan’s digital ID journey began on Hyperledger Indy before it moved to Polygon in August 2024. Now, by adopting Ethereum, the South Asian country aims to strengthen trust in its digital governance infrastructure. Other nations like Brazil and Vietnam have also experimented with similar blockchain-based identity initiatives. Miyaguchi stated that Bhutan’s National Digital Identity and GovTech departments were key in driving the Ethereum integration, supported by members of the country’s growing crypto community and technical contributors who helped in the transition. “This milestone marks not only a national achievement but a global step toward a more open and secure digital future for the long term. The moment felt even more meaningful as it happens during Ethereum’s 10th year. A reminder of how far we’ve come from ideas to real-world impact.” Royal Crypto Ambitions Beyond integrating blockchain into its digital economy, Bhutan has actively mined bitcoin in recent years to strengthen its crypto holdings. Currently, the kingdom owns 6,371 BTC, which makes it the sixth-largest government BTC holder in the world, following the US, China, the UK, Ukraine, and the UAE, according to data compiled by BitcoinTreasuries. Earlier this year, Bhutan partnered with Bitdeer Technologies to raise $500 million to expand its Bitcoin mining operations. The fund planned to support a 100-megawatt hydro-powered mining facility. Druk Holding & Investments, which happens to be the Bhutan government’s investment arm, will also invest and target institutional investors.

Reports say she has also become one of Latin America’s most public supporters of Bitcoin, calling the cryptocurrency a “lifeline” for Venezuelans coping with strict currency controls and runaway inflation. Award Highlights Bitcoin Role The Nobel Committee’s decision puts Machado at the center of both political and economic debates. According to the committee, her work has rallied many Venezuelans against repression. At the same time, Machado has described Bitcoin as a tool people used to protect savings, send remittances, and avoid state-controlled exchange rates. That claim was made during a 2024 interview with the Human Rights Foundation. For the first time in history, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to a Bitcoiner. Congratulations to Maria Corina Machado, and also to @HRF who continues to explain to the world what is so obvious to so many- Bitcoin IS human rights pic.twitter.com/92cHOieeEb — Jeff Park (@dgt10011) October 10, 2025 Venezuela’s Economic Collapse And Its Fallout Venezuela’s economy entered a deep crisis after 2016 and through the next several years, with hyperinflation and a sharp drop in output. Reports show years of runaway prices and a steep fall in the bolívar’s value, driving many families to seek foreign currency or alternative stores of value. Large numbers of people left the country and many more relied on informal markets and remittances from abroad. Cryptocurrency As A Practical Tool Based on reports and interviews, ordinary Venezuelans used Bitcoin not as a speculative asset but as a working solution to daily problems. It helped some to move money across borders when official channels were closed or unreliable. Machado and other activists have argued that peer-to-peer crypto markets can let people access funds without going through state-controlled systems. Politics, Allies, And Accusations Machado’s international profile has brought allies and critics. Reports note contacts between opposition figures and senior US officials, and observers say Machado has ties with US conservatives, including US President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Machado has denied that her movement is directed from abroad and she has framed outside support as solidarity with Venezuelan citizens facing repression. Market Turbulence And Recovery Bitcoin’s recent price swings have drawn fresh attention to its real-world use. According to market data , a sharp sell-off pushed the asset as low as $102,000 after open interest on derivatives fell by about $12 billion, sliding from $47 billion to $35 billion. Buyers later stepped in and prices climbed back toward about $115,110, an intraday rebound that left Bitcoin up more than 3% on the day in some reports.

While this unexpected crash caused Bitcoin and altcoin investors who held long positions to be liquidated, a whale turned the collapse into an opportunity. A Bitcoin OG whale who predicted the recent crash is back with a $392 million Bitcoin short, according to a post by Lookonchain. Accordingly, this giant whale opened short positions for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) before the crash and earned over $160 million. As the recovery from the crash continues, the giant whale has reopened a BTC short position with 10x leverage.

Yet, as history has shown, disbelief often precedes transformation. The digital asset market is entering another defining moment, one that could see XRP evolve from a misunderstood token to a cornerstone of global financial infrastructure . While skeptics debate its worth, institutional builders, banks, and blockchain developers continue to strengthen the rails that may underpin the next monetary revolution. XRP’s Market Position and Price Outlook As of report time, XRP trades around $2.44, according to CoinMarketCap . Despite volatility, the asset remains among the top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, supported by consistent global trading volumes and steady liquidity on major exchanges. The recent market structure suggests renewed accumulation phases rather than exhaustion, even as broader crypto markets experience cyclical corrections. If you missed the Bitcoin era, don’t miss the $XRP era. Most people laughed at Bitcoin at $10 Now they’re laughing at XRP at $2 $XRP doesn’t need your belief to hit $1,000. The infrastructure is already being built. Those who follow me already know what’s coming. Do you? — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) October 13, 2025 Market analysts emphasize that XRP’s long-term trajectory depends less on short-term speculation and more on the structural ecosystem being developed around it. This, according to many in the space, is what sets XRP apart from earlier market cycles — it now has a mature network, corporate partnerships, and a regulatory framework that clears much of the uncertainty clouding its value. The Ripple–SEC Case: A Defining Moment Ripple’s long-standing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially reached its conclusion in August after the appellate court approved their motions to end the litigation. This closure delivered long-awaited clarity to XRP, effectively removing the legal shadow that had constrained institutional adoption for years. The regulatory peace has opened doors for traditional finance entities and fintech companies to integrate Ripple’s payment technologies without fear of compliance backlash. It also reinforces the legal status of XRP as a non-security, establishing firmer ground for global adoption. The Infrastructure Driving XRP’s Future Beyond the courtroom, Ripple’s technological expansion continues at an impressive pace. The launch of RLUSD, Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin in December 2024, has become a crucial component of its broader liquidity ecosystem. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 RLUSD is now being integrated into cross-border payment solutions , decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and enterprise-grade settlement systems built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This development enhances XRP’s practical role as a liquidity bridge currency — the asset that connects fiat, stablecoins, and digital tokens seamlessly. The XRPL’s growing interoperability with EVM-compatible sidechains further strengthens its position as a hybrid infrastructure for real-world finance and Web3 innovation. The Pundit’s Perspective: Belief Isn’t the Catalyst In his post on X, X Finance Bull boldly asserted that “XRP doesn’t need your belief to hit $1,000. The infrastructure is already being built.” His statement underscores a fundamental market truth — belief doesn’t move prices, utility does. In the same way Bitcoin’s early network growth laid the foundation for its $70,000 peak, XRP’s expanding real-world infrastructure may be setting the stage for its next major revaluation. While a $1,000 price target may sound extreme , the underlying message is clear: XRP’s evolution is driven by utility, liquidity, and global adoption — not mere speculation. Final Thoughts Whether XRP achieves the monumental figures envisioned by some analysts remains uncertain, but one fact is clear — the “XRP era” is unfolding through tangible progress, not hype. With a clarified regulatory path, robust institutional partnerships, and active network development, XRP stands at the forefront of blockchain-driven financial transformation. As X Finance Bull aptly warns, those who laughed at Bitcoin once missed a generational opportunity — those laughing at XRP today might be repeating history.

With the October 15 deadline approaching, users will need to link their Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible wallets to access upcoming NFT drops and be eligible for the highly anticipated SEA token rewards. To ensure that users can fully benefit from OpenSea’s Treasure Chests program, they must act before October 15. Those who do not link an EVM wallet will not be able to participate in most of the important rewards, such as the upcoming $SEA token airdrop. The incentives are mostly linked to EVM chains, meaning that users without an EVM wallet are unlikely to have any incentive opportunities. OpenSea has been aggressively pushing its community, specifically users who log into the platform using Web2 or Solana wallets, to connect to an EVM wallet. “No EVM wallet? No EVM prizes,” the platform appears to be clear on who can receive prizes. The rewards, in particular, the SEA token and the NFTs, will be inaccessible to those who do not seize this opportunity, and the deadline will only increase in importance. We know degens don’t read. So here’s your reminder: connect an EVM wallet to your OpenSea rewards profile. Most rewards are on EVM chains. No EVM wallet? No EVM prizes. pic.twitter.com/YidLVTLLmy — OpenSea (@opensea) October 14, 2025 What’s OpenSea offering in its Treasure Chests program? The Treasure Chests program ends on the same day, creating a sense of urgency. The role of the chests, especially the Solar tier, will be the determinant of the amount of SEA tokens issued during the token generation event (TGE). These chests are high-risk; they might yield significant payoffs or disappointing outcomes. Solar chests in the upper category promise the greatest profits. Nonetheless, as a long-time NFT player, the Cape states that the high risk associated with these chests could either lead to a huge payoff or no payoff. This news comes as OpenSea has recently announced that it is raising its trading fee to 1% from 0.5%. OpenSea said it would also introduce a 1% trading fee on NFTs and a 0.85% fee on token swaps. To increase user engagement and create excitement about the SEA token launch, OpenSea will withdraw half of these new fees into a rewards pool that will support pre-token launch incentives. The already existing pool of $1 million of Optimism (OP) and Arbitrum (ARB) tokens will expand with more NFTs and tokens and allow their allocation via a treasure chest system, which is gamified.

In 2028, the DOT price is expected to range from a maximum of $15.81 to a minimum of $13.00. The price of Polkadot is predicted to reach a maximum value of $48.15 in 2031. Polkadot (DOT) has shown impressive growth and resilience in a volatile cryptocurrency market, supported by its strong multichain protocol architecture, which ensures network security—and investor confidence. A major contributor to this success is the Sinai Upgrade on the Acala Network, which enhances functionality and security. With over 32 million transactions validated in October 2024 by the Polkadot Relay Chain, the network demonstrates significant activity and utility, contributing to its substantial market capitalization. A notable increase in unique wallets further signals growing user adoption and engagement, strengthening Polkadot’s position as a leading blockchain platform. Will DOT reach new heights soon? Let’s get into the Polkadot price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Polkadot Token DOT Price $3.121 Market Cap $6.79B Trading Volume $274.48M Circulating Supply 1.62B DOT All-time High $55.00 Nov 4, 2021 All-time Low $2.69 Aug 19, 2020 24-hour High $3.44 24-hour Low $3.09 Polkadot price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 4.80% 50-Day SMA $ 4.04 14-Day RSI 50.02 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 71(Greed) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $ 4.13 Polkadot price analysis: DOT faces renewed selling pressure as market sentiment weakens Selling pressure prevails. The DOT remains under strong bearish control, with prices below the $3.44 resistance. Key support at $3.11, buyers are defending this critical level to prevent further decline. Muted recovery signs; price action remains range-bound, indicating weak buyer confidence. Polkadot, trading at $3.12 as of October 14, 2025, has seen a 6.97% decline over the past 24 hours, reflecting a weakening market sentiment. The cryptocurrency has faced persistent selling pressure after failing to sustain gains above the $3.44 resistance level, which has acted as a strong ceiling for price recovery. Meanwhile, support at $3.11 remains a critical threshold that traders are closely watching for potential rebound signals. DOT’s decline mirrors broader weakness across the altcoin market, with investors reacting to declining liquidity and cautious sentiment. Polkadot 1-day price chart: DOT sellers maintain control below key resistance The 1-day chart displays a clear bearish structure, with DOT struggling to break past the $3.44 resistance and retreating sharply toward its $3.11 support level. The repeated rejection at higher levels suggests strong seller dominance and a lack of bullish momentum to sustain an uptrend. The pattern of lower highs and lower lows confirms ongoing downward pressure. Technical readings indicate that the token remains below its 20-day moving average, reinforcing the short-term bearish bias. DOT/USDT Chart: TradingView Momentum indicators reveal continued weakness, as the RSI hovers near the lower range, showing limited buying strength. Volume analysis also highlights a decrease in activity, signaling indecision among traders as they await stronger catalysts to drive the market. If DOT breaks below $3.11, it may test the $3.00 psychological mark, which could serve as the next area of support for buyers. However, a rebound above $3.30 and a confirmed daily close beyond $3.44 could shift short-term momentum toward a recovery phase. Polkadot 4-hour price chart: DOT support under pressure amid weak rebound attempts The 4-hour chart reflects heightened volatility and sustained downside pressure as DOT continues to test the $3.11 support zone. The asset’s failure to hold gains near $3.44 triggered renewed selling, pushing the price back toward its intraday low. Candlestick patterns indicate attempts by buyers to defend support, but momentum remains weak, and rallies are being quickly capped by profit-taking. DOT/USDT Chart: TradingView Trading within this narrow range suggests consolidation before the next significant move. If buyers manage to stabilize the price above $3.15, it could open room for a minor relief rally. However, any sustained breakdown below $3.11 would confirm the continuation of the bearish trend toward the $3.00 level. Until DOT establishes a firm base or reclaims key resistance levels, market sentiment is expected to remain cautious, with traders monitoring the price reaction around these pivotal zones. Polkadot technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $4.03 SELL SMA 5 $4.16 SELL SMA 10 $4.23 SELL SMA 21 $4.12 SELL SMA 50 $4.07 SELL SMA 100 $4.00 SELL SMA 200 $4.11 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $4.11 SELL EMA 5 $4.06 SELL EMA 10 $4.00 SELL EMA 21 $3.96 BUY EMA 50 $3.94 BUY EMA 100 $4.00 SELL EMA 200 $4.30 SELL What can you expect next for Polkadot (DOT)? Polkadot’s immediate outlook remains bearish as the token hovers close to its critical $3.11 support. If sellers continue to dominate and the price breaks below this level, DOT could slide toward the $3.00 psychological mark, where some buying interest may emerge. However, if the support holds firm, short-term consolidation between $3.11 and $3.30 is likely before any decisive move develops. A recovery scenario would require strong buying momentum pushing DOT above the $3.44 resistance, signaling a potential shift toward a neutral or mildly bullish phase. Until such confirmation is received, traders should expect continued range-bound movement with a bearish bias. Market participants will closely watch price stability near support and any uptick in demand that could signal a gradual reversal in sentiment. Is Polkadot a good investment? In the short term, Polkadot exhibits a bearish outlook, with price action capped below $3.44 and weak momentum near the $3.11 support level. Volatility remains high, limiting near-term upside potential. In the long term, Polkadot maintains strong fundamentals through its interoperability network and ongoing development. Investors may consider cautious accumulation once stability returns above key support levels, making DOT more suitable for long-term holders than short-term traders. Why is Polkadot Down today? Polkadot is down due to broader market weakness and declining investor confidence in altcoins. Repeated rejection at the $3.44 resistance has triggered renewed selling, while low volume and weak demand keep DOT near its $3.11 support. Overall, cautious sentiment and a lack of strong market catalysts continue to pressure the price. Recent news on Polkadot Grayscale has updated its S-1 registration filings with the SEC for two proposed cryptocurrency ETFs—one for Cardano (ADA) to trade on NYSE Arca under the ticker GADA and another for Polkadot (DOT) to trade on Nasdaq under the ticker DOT. Both funds would hold the underlying assets directly, track CoinDesk pricing indices, and use Coinbase Custody, mirroring the firm’s existing Bitcoin and Ethereum products.

Market optimism has risen regarding the expected price for the Cardano ETF. Polymarket data show approval odds for the Cardano ETF climbing to 87%, supported by Grayscale’s renewed efforts, strong ADA performance, and recent regulatory clarity around staking that could accelerate approvals across the sector.

Will Polkadot reach $40? Yes, according to the long-term predictions, Polkadot is projected to reach up to $40 by 2031. Will Polkadot reach $100? Reaching $100 for Polkadot (DOT) is highly ambitious and unlikely in the near term. Does Polkadot have a promising long-term future? Based on Polkadot’s ongoing buying demand and positive community support, the DOT price is set to make new highs in the coming years.

Polkadot price history | Coinmarketcap Polkadot experienced rapid growth, with its price climbing from around $3 in January to an all-time high of approximately $57.50 in May 2021. After the peak, the price declined sharply, falling to around $10 by July before partially recovering to over $40 in November 2021. In 2022, Polkadot price steadily declined, starting the year around $30 and dropping below $10 by mid-year. By the end of 2022, the price stabilized near $5 as bearish market conditions dominated the cryptocurrency space. The price of DOT hovered between $5 and $7 for most of 2023, reflecting a period of consolidation and limited market excitement. In January 2024, Polkadot’s price remained relatively stable, trading around the $5–$6 range. By July 2024, Polkadot showed slight signs of recovery, with its price rising to around $7–$8. This modest uptick was likely driven by increasing market interest. In December 2024, Polkadot showed signs of recovery, with its price climbing to around $10.4. In January 2025, Polkadot peaked at $7.98 but lost momentum towards the end of the month, resulting in a trading range of $4.64 to $5.28 in February.

In April 2025, Polkadot (DOT) experienced a gradual downtrend, with its price hovering slightly below the $4 mark amid ongoing market volatility. In May, Polkadot (DOT) began trading at around $ 4.10 and exhibited moderate fluctuations.

The price slightly dipped during September 2025, hovering near $4.00 as market sentiment remained neutral.

At first glance, data retrieved by Finbold from Arkham seems to support the rumor. In the past 12 hours, IBIT-linked wallets processed a series of transfers totaling 9,376 BTC, worth more than $1.04 billion at current prices. But a closer look reveals a far more nuanced picture than the headline-grabbing “dump” suggests. Breaking down the BTC transfers According to Arkham’s entity tracking, IBIT wallets executed two sets of outflows. Roughly 8,673 BTC were sent 12 hours ago in 28 uniform 300-BTC tranches and one 272.78-BTC odd lot. These coins did not land on exchange deposit addresses but rather to a series of unlabeled bc1q addresses, wallets that analysts interpret as custodial storage or internal rotations. BlackRock Bitcoin outflows. Source: Arkham By contrast, the past two hours saw 703.7 BTC routed directly to Coinbase Prime Deposit addresses, equivalent to about $77.7 million. This subset is more likely tied to ETF redemptions or liquidity provisioning. BlackRock outflow to Coinbase prime. Source: Arkham Bitcoin ETF flow data tells a different story It’s worth remembering how ETF plumbing works. When IBIT sees investor redemptions, BTC moves out of the fund’s custodian to authorized participants (APs). Those coins may hit Coinbase Prime (IBIT’s custodian is Coinbase) for settlement or market-making, but an on-chain transfer is not proof of an immediate market sale. We’ve seen similar Coinbase Prime deposits from BlackRock before, for instance, 340 BTC and 49,608 ETH on September 29, that were framed as treasury moves or rebalancing, not dumps. So, did BlackRock “dump $1 billion” in a single shot? The math doesn’t line up with that claim, and the destination mix on-chain shows both exchange and non-exchange outputs. The most defensible reading is that IBIT processed sizable, mostly 300-BTC lots tied to creations/redemptions and internal reallocation. Some coins hit Coinbase Prime for settlement and liquidity, alongside large transfers to unlabeled wallets.

According to Arkham data, the US government wallet recently transferred 667,624 Bitcoin (worth $74.65 million) in two parts to another unknown address, and there has been no further movement since. According to Onchain Lense, the US government is transferring $74.8 million worth of BTC seized in the HashFlare case. Accordingly, a wallet believed to belong to the US government moved 667.62 BTC, worth approximately $74.8 million, to an external address for the first time in three years. The funds were reportedly seized in connection with the HashFlare cryptocurrency scam case, in which the government seized approximately $575 million in total. It is estimated that these addresses are most likely controlled by the US Government and are merely an internal transfer. According to Arkham data, the US government still holds 197,354,000 Bitcoins, worth $21.95 billion. Besides Bitcoin, the US government also holds various altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), WBTC, BNB, Tron (TRX), and Chainlink (LINK). *This is not investment advice.

Gas fees, on the other hand, have fallen to the lowest levels in years. According to Token Terminal data, Ethereum’s daily transactions have surpassed 2 million, while active addresses have maintained above 1 million in recent weeks. These record activity levels coincided with low gas fees, averaging near $10–20 million per day, compared to the over $200 million daily highs recorded during the 2021 bull market. Ethereum gas fees drop to record lows A surge in recent institutional investments and retail adoption has driven Ethereum’s growth in network usage. The token surpassed 50 million transactions in August alone, representing its highest monthly figure. During the same period, the decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume also hit an all-time high, exceeding $130 billion, according to DeFiLlama data . The network transaction value reached $320 billion, marking Ethereum’s third-largest month in transactional activities. Ethereum’s current market activity levels. Source: Token Terminal Meanwhile, Ethereum’s total value locked ( TVL ) has risen to about $86.04 billion, approaching the historic high of $108.8 billion reached in 2021. The increase in on-chain liquidity and activity reflects confidence in the ecosystem and wider usage of its Layer 2 scalability networks, such as Arbitrum , Optimism, and Base. Crptopolitan reported that Ether volumes expanded in August, showing robust on-chain activity. The result coincided with a new all-time high for ETH and further expectations of scaling the $5,000 hurdle for the first time. Ethereum activity has returned to levels not seen since 2021, indicating a combination of value growth and on-chain transfers. The recent ETH rally also demonstrated that the L1 was sufficient for large-scale DeFi, with no significant gas spikes or congestion. The rise in activity is seen as a sign of retail returning. In the past quarters, retail had almost abandoned ETH, while whales continued to accumulate. Now, Ethereum activity shows a shift in sentiment, with users returning to the most active apps. The Ethereum network carries simple ETH transfers based on gas usage, with USDT and USDC in the top 3 smart contracts. Overall, Ethereum smart contract creation expanded in 2025, returning to activity levels seen in 2021. This time around, the smart contracts were tied to DeFi, rather than NFTs or the launch of meme tokens. While on-chain volume activities have maintained higher highs, Ethereum’s average gas prices are now at their lowest annual mean in the network’s history. This drop is largely attributed to the adoption of Layer 2 rollups and protocol-level improvements, such as EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding), which drastically improve data availability and reduce mainnet congestion. Ethereum network scalability improvements fuel institutional adoption Ethereum’s daily active addresses recently exceeded 650,000, marking the highest level over two years. Historically, such periods of lower fees have been linked to surges in retail activity, as smaller investors and users re-engage with DeFi protocols, gaming platforms, and NFT marketplaces. Low gas fees have led to an uptick in transaction volumes for DeFi and NFT projects, ranging from 15% to 20%, indicating a potential return of smaller, price-sensitive users who were previously priced out during periods of network congestion. Data from Strategic Eth Reserve shows BitMine as the leading institution holding Ethereum tokens under its reserve strategy. BitMine’s current holdings stand at 3.03 million ETH, making it the largest corporate holder of Ether. SharpLink, another institutional investor, recently added 39,000 ETH to its holdings, pushing its total to 838.73K ETH. These accumulation trends suggest that large entities increasingly view Ethereum as a utility network and a long-term store of digital value. According to CoinMarketCap data, the current price of the Ether token is $3,974.41, representing a 2.77% drop at the time of publication. The token market cap has also dropped to $479.99 billion, with an average 24-hour volume of $57.56 billion, representing a 1.15% drop at the time of publication. Don’t just read crypto news.

TVL, or total value locked in crypto, is a metric of stored funds, usually on a decentralized project. The crypto TVL is a proxy for overall protocol activity, its reputation, and the presence of whales or other large-stage traders. TVL Definition and Meaning What TVL Represents in DeFi TVL is a metric in decentralized finance (DeFi), which represents the total value of all coins, tokens, stablecoins, wrapped tokens and even NFTs locked in a smart contracts of a specific protocol. Those assets are locked for different functions, meaning they cannot be moved unless certain financial conditions are filled. The TVL in DeFi serves for lending, staking, and liquidity pools. How TVL Became a Key Metric for Protocols TVL in crypto became a key metric after DeFi protocols more or less started unifying their business model. The TVL metric helps contrast and compare the varying DeFi protocols and their structure. TVL vs Market Cap – Key Differences TVL differs from a protocol’s market cap. The market cap reflects the notional value of a protocol’s token. By contrast, TVL measures the total value of assets deposited to the protocol, based on their current value. How Is TVL Calculated? TVL in crypto is calculated based on the market value of all assets locked in a protocol’s smart contracts. The asset value is usually supplied by oracle services, which may differ for each crypto DeFi app. TVL represents the total value of assets locked across all blockchains where the protocol has been deployed. Multi-chain protocols calculate the value of assets on each network. Locked Assets Across Protocols Protocols hold assets in DeFi smart contracts, for various tasks. Assets may be locked into liquidity vault contracts, lending contracts, decentralized trading pairs, liquid staking contracts, or other types of smart contracts. Protocols, also known as crypto dApps , then enact permissionless operations, such as trading, lending, granting passive yield or other rewards. Price Impact on TVL (Fluctuations with ETH/BTC Value) The TVL metric is one of the key gauges for investors to determine the strength of a protocol. The TVL in DeFi depends on the market value of assets. Since ETH and BTC are often fluctuating, TVL may rise rapidly during bull markets and shrink during bear markets. Stablecoins, when included in TVL calculations, make for a more reliable metric. TVL in USD vs Native Tokens TVL in DeFi apps measures the value of tokens, native chain assets like Ethereum and Solana , as well as stablecoins. The TVL is usually measured in US dollars, especially when the assets locked are stablecoins. Sometimes, the total value locked is measured in terms of the amount of native tokens locked, providing a glimpse of the percentage of the total supply deposited into the protocol. Unlike the dollar value, which naturally fluctuates, the amount of native tokens is a constant and can give a realistic metric of growth. TVL Across Chains (Ethereum, BSC, Solana, Avalanche, Arbitrum, etc.) The total value locked (TVL) across entire chains is the sum of the value locked in each DeFi app. The value across chains gives a glimpse on what share of the native coins or tokens are locked, staked or fueling other dApps. Why TVL Matters in DeFi Indicator of Protocol Adoption and Liquidity DeFi TVL is an indicator of the readiness of users to lock their assets. The metric is a proxy for protocol adoption, especially when data shows relatively small individual deposits, instead of institutional liquidity flowing in. TVL is also an important metric for the available liquidity in protocols. For instance, a decentralized exchange (DEX) with a higher TVL suggests deeper liquidity pools and lower risk for some trading pairs. Proxy for User Trust and Security A protocol or DeFi app with higher TVL is also a metric of security and trust. A trend of long-term inflows, no significant setbacks in liquidity, may signal a reliable dApp that has become key to DeFi earnings. Over time, TVL grows for the most successful protocols, both in dollar value, and in the number of tokens deposited. A higher TVL also means users are willing to lock their tokens and tap their value through lending, rather than sell on the open market. Role in Yield Farming and Lending Protocols Yield farming is one of the most common decentralized activities, which contains a dose of risk. In yield farming, users lock in their assets with a protocol, thus securing the main source of liquidity. In an exchange, they receive rewards in the form of a share of the fees, or another valuable token. TVL is one of the key metrics in yield farming, which offers a general glimpse of the protocol’s adoption, user trust, and growth potential. Lending protocols also reveal their locked value to attract more users. In lending, locked value includes the collateral posted on loans. Higher TVL also includes the usual requirement for over-collateralization, to counteract volatile crypto prices. Limitations of TVL as a Metric TVL is widely used, but remains an imperfect metric. The final figure often conceals how liquidity is structured, fails to show what portion of TVL comes from whales, and does not distinguish between organic and synthetic liquidity. We will discuss the limitations of TVL as a crypto metric below. TVL Doesn’t Equal Revenue or Profitability TVL is not connected to the protocol’s revenues or profitability. The metric does not automatically translate into economic liveliness. Additionally, some protocols with immense staking or locking requirements in fact have very limited economic activity. Vulnerable to Price Volatility TVL may reflect the price volatility of underlying assets. For instance, ETH value locked has lost up to 50% of its value, though the amount of tokens locked remained the same. The nominal locked value may fluctuate significantly in the short term. Possible TVL Manipulation Through Incentives or Wash Lending A protocol or DeFi app with high or growing TVL is not necessarily sustainable. There are many reasons for non-organic TVL growth. The simplest one is incentives, such as point farming. Apps or protocols will issue points for users that lock in and hold liquidity, later swapping the points into a token airdrop . The initial locked value may quickly dissipate once the incentive is gone. The other reason is wash lending, which uses the initial deposit to mint stablecoins , then buy more of the underlying asset and deposit that. In the case of a market downturn, the protocol may go through liquidations and lose value. Short-Term vs Long-Term Sustainability TVL in DeFi protocols can vary over time, depending on each protocol’s design. Some platforms discourage withdrawals, or place limits or long cooldown periods. Others allow users to freely lock or remove liquidity. For instance, during peak token trading-activity, liquidity on DEXs may increase, as there is more demand for swaps. The liquidity may be taken away if trading slows down, as some of the liquidity providers are large-scale entities, teams, or market makers. TVL in Popular DeFi Protocols (2025) MakerDAO Maker DAO, rebranded to Sky Protocol, uses self-reported TVL. As of October 2025, the value was over $16B. The total value locked in the protocol includes the value of USDS and SKY tokens locked for passive income. Aave Aave is the leading lending protocol, accepting multiple assets as collateral. The value locked in Aave is based on the aggregated price of all assets locked. As of October 2025, the protocol holds upward of $43B. The TVL on Aave is higher than the aggregate value of loans, since all lending is over-collateralized. The total value locked of Aave calculates the value in all vaults, on all chains where the protocol is represented. Uniswap Uniswap is also a multi-chain protocol, where the TVL is calculated based on the sum total of liquidity trading pairs. The total value locked of Uniswap takes into account the value of all assets in each pair. DEX TVL counts the number of tokens multiplied by the market price of the token, calculating for both assets in each liquidity pair. Uniswap carries $5.63B in total value locked as of October 2025. Curve Finance Curve Finance also operates as a DEX, so its TVL is calculated as the sum of the prices of all assets in trading pairs, similar to the calculation for Uniswap. Curve Finance carries $2.32B in liquidity, a lower level compared to its peak performance during the 2021 bull market. Lido (Staked ETH TVL Example) Lido is the leading liquid staking protocol on Ethereum . Its TVL is calculated based on the value of ETH in its smart contracts. Lido requires ETH staking, so its smart contracts have a function to always report the amount of staked ETH. For a more intuitive value, the locked ETH is represented in US dollars. Lido has $35.56B locked as of October 2025. Tools to Track TVL DeFiLlama DeFiLlama is one of the easily accessible free tools to track TVL. It counts most tokens locked in a smart contract as TVL. The protocol does not double-count the tokens, and does not include liquid staking tokens in TVL for chains. The metrics of DeFiLlama may differ from self-reported values. DeFiLlama does not measure native staking and excludes some liquid staking tokens from double-counting. DappRadar DappRadar tracks the activity and user count of apps, similarly tracking all assets from known smart contracts. It also uses the Adjusted Value Locked metric, freezing the price of tokens for a specific period. DappRadar often uses the value of tokens at the start of a 90-day period, and the value may differ significantly due to market price fluctuations. DefiPulse (historical influence) DeFi Pulse focuses on the Ethereum ecosystem, accounting for the amount of tokens and their market value. The platform uses open-source on-chain data for the Ethereum chain, and evaluates all prices in US dollars. The Future of TVL as a DeFi Metric Beyond TVL – Revenue, Active Users, Protocol Fees TVL has received criticism for disguising the real activity of protocols. To evaluate DeFi apps, mode metrics are needed in combination with TVL. Revenue is one measure reflecting real on-chain actions, incurring regular fees. The protocol fees for a period of time also give a glimpse on real demand and activity. The TVL must also be matched with active users, to make sure a protocol is not controlled by only a handful of whales. TVL in Real-World Assets (RWAs) Recently, the crypto space started tracking tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). At the end of September 2025, those assets broke above $30B in value locked. The total value locked of tokenized assets is based on the calculation of the token price. The sum of all tokens reflects the market value of underlying assets: treasuries, private credit, precious metals, stocks, or other assets. TVL Across Layer 2 and Multi-Chain Ecosystems With the expansion of decentralized apps (dApps), the calculation of TVL becomes more complex. Different methodologies track TVL to include or exclude bridges. However, the basic calculation remains similar for swapping, lending, or staking. Layer 2 (L2) chains pose a specific challenge in accounting for bridged or wrapped ETH. One mistake to be made is to double-count the tokens as part of the Ethereum ecosystem, although they are active on another chain. The challenge is to measure real liquidity that is accrued and used, instead of passive staking.",Learn Crypto: Beginner Guides|AAVE|avax|BSC|BTC|ETH|LDO|Sky|SOL|UNI,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|ETH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-14 13:45:06

Kwok revealed that he bought $10,000 worth of XRP on his way to the gym, attaching a screenshot showing a filled limit order of 4,098.36 XRP at $2.44 per token. The post followed one he made a day earlier, asking, “What’s everyone buying this weekend?” and these messages came at a moment of renewed anticipation in the digital asset market. The broader cryptocurrency sector has faced significant price pressure recently, with a notable collapse that cut across the market. XRP also fell from around $2.8 to just under $2 for the first time since June , and while some market participants were worried, many investors saw this price decline as a buying opportunity. Optimism surrounding potential spot XRP ETF approvals has also grown, with several key SEC decision deadlines expected in October. This backdrop has made Kwok’s purchase appear to some observers as a statement of confidence rather than a speculative move. just bought $10k $XRP myself on the way to the gym https://t.co/cqBfcYob1Z pic.twitter.com/lAzsMOPgUX — Dom | EasyA (@dom_kwok) October 11, 2025 Growing Optimism Around Regulatory Milestones The possibility of spot XRP ETFs has become one of the most discussed topics in digital asset circles this month. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reviewing multiple filings from asset managers seeking approval to list XRP-based products. Several of those applications face final decision dates in mid-to-late October, aligning with a period of heightened attention from investors who view regulatory acceptance as a potential catalyst for price recovery. Although the SEC has not provided any definitive decision, analysts believe the environment is shifting toward greater accommodation of digital asset ETFs following recent rule changes. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market participants argue that a spot XRP ETF could improve access to institutional liquidity and enhance overall market maturity. That expectation has fueled a modest wave of accumulation from traders and long-term holders looking to position ahead of possible announcements. Influence From a Market Expert While Kwok did not elaborate on his reasons for buying, his timing suggests confidence that current market levels present a major buying opportunity . His visibility as a technology entrepreneur adds weight to the decision, especially within a community that closely follows signals from public figures and early-stage investors. The convergence of falling prices, renewed investor engagement, and the potential for landmark regulatory approvals has placed XRP in a pivotal position, and if ETFs boost the asset’s price as many experts anticipate , Kwok’s purchase could bring significant profit.

The stablecoin ranking will now be available as on-chain data. S&P Global Ratings moved its Stablecoin Stability Assessments on-chain after a collaboration with Chainlink. The stablecoin assessments, first introduced in 2023, will now become a part of Chainlink’s data portfolio . We’re excited to announce that @SPGlobalRatings —the leading credit rating agency relied on by 95% of the top 20 global institutional investors—is collaborating with Chainlink to publish its Stablecoin Stability Assessments (SSAs) onchain for the first time via DataLink.… pic.twitter.com/aSAkAc4msp — Chainlink (@chainlink) October 14, 2025 The S&P Global Ratings will be published on DataLink, an institutional-grade on-chain data service. The data will be thus usable within DeFi protocols and smart contracts. The initiative arrives just days following crypto’s greatest liquidation event , which led to a series of de-peggings for algorithmic or asset-backed stablecoins. S&P Global Ratings distributes risk score through Chainlink The S&P Stablecoin Stability Assessment is not an official credit rating, but assigns a value of 1-5 based on the token’s ability to maintain its value relative to their respective fiat currencies. As adoption of stablecoin accelerates, the available data is now directly integrated with accessible on-chain infrastructure. “ The launch of SSAs on-chain through Chainlink underscores our commitment to meeting our clients where they are,” said Chuck Mounts, Chief DeFi Officer at S&P Global. “ By making our SSAs available on-chain through Chainlink’s proven oracle infrastructure, we’re enabling market participants to access our assessments seamlessly using their existing DeFi infrastructure, enhancing transparency and informed decision-making across the DeFi landscape,” said Mounts. The stablecoin assessment includes market value and custody risks, collateral requirements, and liquidation mechanisms where applicable. S&P Global Ratings also explores governance, regulatory requirements, redeemability and liquidity, as well as technology and third-party dependencies. The assessment points apply to both asset-backed and algorithmic stablecoins . Chainlink to launch stablecoin rankings on Base Sergey Nazarov, co-founder of Chainlink stated that it will be able to deliver the stablecoin rankings to some of the world’s biggest institutions. Following the news, LINK tokens traded within their usual range at around $18.30, following the recent market downturn from a local peak of over $21. Chainlink retains its leading position as a data provider for the on-chain economy, securing nearly $100B in DeFi value. Chainlink has also collaborated with other institutions in traditional finance, including Swift, Euroclear, J.P. Morgan, Fidelity, UBS, and Mastercard. The stablecoin assessments will be published on Base, the Ethereum L2 chain, with expansion to other networks based on market demand and client feedback. The published rankings arrive as the supply of stablecoins broke above $300B, with over 70 different alternatives. In 2025, USDT and USDC remain the leading assets, but USDC has spread its ecosystem to a larger number of chains to serve niche use cases and bring liquidity to DeFi communities. Initially, the stablecoin assessment prepared reports on eight major stablecoins. Over time, the types of tokens increased, making the choice of assets more difficult for DeFi protocols. Stablecoins remain key to trading and lending, with even more attention paid to their risk of de-pegging and causing liquidation cascades.

He warns that those who only chase quick profits or lack belief in their investments could face severe losses. He says people should only invest when they are ready to stay for a long time. Coach JV Warns XRP Investors To Build Conviction Or Stay Out Coach JV posted a clear warning on X to all XRP investors. He said, “If you’re not willing to hold for 10 years or haven’t built conviction in what you’re investing in, don’t get in. You’ll get wrecked.” His words mean that people who only want fast money or do not believe in what they are buying could lose a lot. Related Reading: What The Weekend Liquidation Event Meant For The Dogecoin Price, And What Could Happen Next He said that many traders lose because they act on emotion instead of reason. When prices drop, they panic and sell. When prices rise, they chase profits too fast. According to Coach JV, this kind of behavior always ends badly. He believes that only investors who truly trust what they invest in can survive the ups and downs of crypto. The XRP market has experienced many price swings, causing some investors to feel nervous. He tells XRP investors to stop reacting to short-term price changes and to build firm conviction in their choices. Coach JV’s message reminds crypto investors that being patient is not about waiting but about having a fundamental belief in patience. His simple advice to the XRP community is to stay calm, believe, and plan for the future. Long-Term Strategy: XRP, Bitcoin, And Solana As Core Plays In the same message, Coach JV shared more details about his personal investment approach. He said that XRP, Bitcoin, and Solana are his long-term plays. He says that Bitcoin is like his “supercharged savings account” and that he will never sell it. He has held Bitcoin for years while managing profits from smaller altcoins during major market rallies. Related Reading: Why The Dogecoin Price Could Surge 3,690% To $9.8 This Bull Cycle He explained that when smaller altcoins rise sharply, he takes profits to strengthen what he calls his “cash and protection ecosystem.” Coach JV said that last Friday’s market activity was a perfect example of why patience and strategy are essential. It showed how being prepared can protect XRP investors when the crypto markets change quickly. Coach JV closed his message by repeating that discipline, patience, and conviction always beat emotion. His reminder to XRP investors and the broader crypto community is that they believe in their investments, think long-term, and not let short-term emotions ruin their plans. In a market full of uncertainty, Coach JV’s message could stand as a steady call for focus, conviction, and confidence in what XRP investors choose to hold.

53133713,605483,1760450454,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53133713.jpeg,Wall Street Cracks: JPMorgan Moves To Offer Crypto Trading,https://bitcoinist.com/wall-street-cracks-jpmorgan-moves-to-offer-crypto-trading/,"Wall Street hasn’t always been friendly toward crypto. For years, big lenders treated it like a passing fad or a risky playground for retail traders. But that attitude is shifting fast. JPMorgan’s plan to let clients trade digital assets marks a turning point — a signal that the most traditional corners of finance are finally warming up to crypto. What was once dismissed as speculation is now being folded into mainstream banking strategy. JPMorgan Chase is building services that would let its clients trade cryptocurrencies directly through the bank, senior executives told journalists this week. According to comments made on CNBC, the bank’s global head of markets and digital assets, Scott Lucas, said trading is being developed while custody — holding crypto directly for clients — is “not on the horizon near-term.” JPMorgan’s Public Push Into Tokens And Trading The bank has moved quietly but clearly. It ran a pilot of a deposit token called JPMD on Coinbase’s Base blockchain in June, a step that aims to make bank deposits usable on public chains for institutional clients. At the same time, JPMorgan has widened cooperation with Coinbase so Chase customers can link bank accounts to Coinbase wallets, a link between big banking rails and consumer crypto platforms. Those moves were mentioned by bank executives as part of an “and” approach — keeping traditional services while adding digital options. Risk Appetite Will Shape The Rollout Executives say risk rules and regulatory checks will shape how far the bank goes. Lucas said the firm is looking at what “the right custodians” would look like rather than taking custody itself for now. That suggests JPMorgan would rely on third parties if and when it offers custody services, keeping its balance sheet and compliance teams at arm’s length from the security and legal complexities of holding private keys. JPMorgan Also Considering Loans Backed By Crypto Beyond trading, there are signs JPMorgan is exploring other services tied to crypto. Reports say the bank is weighing offering loans backed by cryptocurrency holdings — a move that could arrive as early as next year if approved internally and cleared by regulators. That would mark a notable shift for a bank whose CEO long warned about crypto risks but has recently allowed client access to Bitcoin trading in statements to investors. Timelines And Custody Partners For customers and market watchers, the key questions remain: which clients will get access first, which coins will be tradable, and who will custody assets if custody is outsourced. The bank’s statements point to a careful, staged approach — trading first, custody later — and regulators in the US will likely follow closely. Expect more detail from JPMorgan as pilot programs like JPMD and partnerships with exchanges produce results and as the bank outlines compliance safeguards.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-the-next-wave-is-closer-than-you-think-heres-why/,"The crypto market often moves in silence before erupting with force. For XRP holders, that silence may be ending soon. Behind the scenes, liquidity is shifting, stablecoins are being minted in massive sums, and analysts are sounding the alarm — or, more accurately, the trumpet — for what could be XRP’s next major wave. Institutional Liquidity Floods In On October 11, 2025, on-chain data revealed a $250 million USDC mint on Solana, verified by multiple blockchain monitoring platforms. While to the untrained eye that may seem like a routine issuance, to seasoned market watchers it signals a powerful undercurrent — capital waiting to enter the market. Ripple Bull Winkle, a respected XRP analyst and advocate on X, was quick to decode the move. He emphasized that this was not just another stablecoin mint but a strategic signal of incoming institutional liquidity. “Just seen $250 million in USDC got minted. That’s not random,” Bull Winkle stated in his video post. “That is institutional liquidity entering the arena. Perfect timing, don’t you think?” JUST DROPPED: $XRP Holders The Next Wave Is Closer Than You Think. They tried to hide this from you. pic.twitter.com/0jUmKhVQvx — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) October 13, 2025 His point is clear: this capital isn’t retail speculation — it’s fuel for the next stage of blockchain adoption, potentially directed toward rails that directly interact with XRP. Why It Matters for XRP Bull Winkle’s argument centers on liquidity flows — how and where freshly minted stablecoins move once created. “This isn’t whale stacking. This is infrastructure fueling,” he explained. According to him, such institutional injections of stablecoins often precede major realignments in digital asset markets. He noted that this “quarter billion in stablecoins is capital that is ready to deploy, and when that hits the market, it flows through two rails. That’s going to move real liquidity. XRP sitting right there — a natural conduit.” In essence, the analyst believes XRP is positioned as one of the most efficient settlement rails for these funds. Its low-cost, high-speed network makes it a natural bridge for liquidity movement — especially as institutional systems increasingly integrate blockchain-based settlement solutions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Convergence of Narratives Beyond liquidity, Bull Winkle believes timing is everything. He described the current setup as a unique intersection of forces: “This is the Reset narrative and Liquidity all converging together.” This “reset,” as he terms it, points to a larger macroeconomic and institutional realignment — where digital assets, led by compliant and utility-driven tokens like XRP, take a more central role in cross-border finance. He concluded with conviction: “You have a setup right here that screams momentum. It also screams perfect timing.” The Bigger Picture It’s not just about one stablecoin mint or one analyst’s conviction. The broader picture involves the strengthening bridge between traditional finance and blockchain infrastructure . Ripple continues to expand its enterprise footprint, with XRP operating as the underlying liquidity token in Ripple Payments and various institutional corridors. As USDC and other stablecoins increase their presence on high-performance blockchains like Solana and the XRP Ledger, the probability of capital flowing through XRP-based rails grows — a dynamic that could redefine liquidity distribution in the post-reset financial landscape Bull Winkle references. Ripple Bull Winkle’s commentary underscores a growing belief that XRP’s next surge isn’t speculative — it’s structural. The $250 million USDC mint, he argues, represents “infrastructure fueling” rather than isolated whale accumulation. With institutional liquidity positioning itself, market narratives converging, and XRP’s rails ready, the stage appears set. The only question left, as Bull Winkle hinted, is timing — and for XRP holders, that timing may be far closer than many think.

While the Fed is expected to cut interest rates one or two more times by the end of 2025, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will deliver a highly anticipated speech on “Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy” at the National Association of Business Economics in Philadelphia. This speech will be the first major speech since the last Fed policy meeting in September. At this point, global and crypto markets are eagerly awaiting Fed Chair Powell's statement. Investors, in particular, will be listening intently to Powell's speech. Because the government is still closed in the USA, the FED Chairman's statements are of great importance. What Time Will Fed Chair Jerome Powell Speak? FED Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to make a statement today at around 19:20 Turkish time. Powell had previously said in his speech that the central bank must carefully balance the risks of high inflation and a weakening labor market in future interest rate decisions. Describing the FED's situation as challenging, Powell stated that inflation risks remain high and employment risks are becoming increasingly visible. At this point, markets are now focusing on whether Powell will signal monetary easing or maintain his cautious stance amid economic uncertainty. As Powell's remarks were awaited, Philadelphia Fed President Anna Paulson said yesterday that rising employment risks made a stronger case for further interest rate cuts in the U.S. According to Paulson, the tariffs are unlikely to raise inflation as much as once feared. Now we have the October interest rate decision ahead of us and it is wondered how the US government shutdown will affect the Fed's decision. Markets are pricing in a 97.8% chance of another 25 basis point cut at the October meeting, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. JP Morgan economists, on the other hand, said they expect the Fed to make two more interest rate cuts in 2025 and one in 2026. How Are Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies Affected? The crypto market has been falling in the last 24 hours ahead of Powell's speech. Bitcoin fell 3.7% to $110,000 and Ethereum fell 5.2% to $3,930. While altcoins in general are experiencing significant declines, experts predict that Powell’s clear signal of monetary policy easing could trigger a general crypto rally led by BTC and ETH. On the other hand, experts say that if Powell emphasizes inflation risks or denies the possibility of a rate cut in the near term, BTC could fall below $110,000 and a decline could occur. *This is not investment advice.

The bank executive believes the U.S. will need to up its consideration of renewable energy sources like wind and solar to meet the energy demands for AI innovation. In an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Tom Mackenzie, Chuka Umunna, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s global head of sustainable solutions, said it is “difficult to conceive of a situation” in which the U.S. will meet its power needs without utilizing renewable sources. JPMorgan warns the U.S. cannot meet energy needs The demand for electricity within the U.S. continues to surge, driven by the rise of artificial intelligence, data centers, and the switch to electric transport and manufacturing. The expansion of these energy-intensive sectors has raised concerns over how the U.S. will sustain its economic ambitions. “The scale of the tech industry’s growth makes renewables an essential part of the answer,” Umunna said. The Biden administration previously proposed the adoption of renewables through tax incentives and the Inflation Reduction Act, but under President Donald Trump, renewable energy has been dismissed as a “joke” and wind turbines viewed as “pathetic.” Trump described climate change as “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.” The Trump administration is now pushing to expand fossil fuel production while regarding nuclear and geothermal energy as preferred low-carbon alternatives. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), renewable sources accounted for roughly 23% of the country’s electricity generation in 2024, while fossil fuels made up more than 60%. Meeting the high power demand from AI data centers and electric vehicles will likely push that percentage higher. Umunna cautioned that nuclear power projects take years to develop and bring online, and a delay in the development would cause serious problems given the pace of energy demand growth. “The concern with nuclear is that it takes years to come on stream,” he said. “So renewables are an essential part of the answer.” New investment wave pours into the US Despite the Trump administration’s dismissal, investor sentiment toward renewable energy has rebounded this year. “The nature of the debate has really changed,” Umunna said . “It’s not just about climate and the environment anymore, but about how you become self-sufficient.” JPMorgan has committed to supporting industries that enhance energy resilience and long-term competitiveness. The bank announced plans on Monday to direct $1.5 trillion over the next decade into sectors that strengthen U.S. economic security and sustainability. “Sustainability is interwoven with these issues of competitiveness and geopolitics,” Umunna explained. “The debate around what’s sustainable is no longer a binary one.” Without significant investment in renewables, the U.S. risks facing both power shortages and higher energy costs, especially with the continued development of data centers, AI infrastructure, and electric vehicle charging networks. Wind and solar are increasingly being considered valuable energy sources that are cost-efficient and can lead to energy independence. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The launch marks the first physically-backed Stellar Lumens ETP. WisdomTree manages over $2 billion across a curated range of 11 physically backed, institutional-grade crypto ETPs. They provide a simple, secure, and low-cost way to gain exposure to single coins, such as Bitcoin, Ether, and now Lumens, through diversified crypto baskets. Alexis Marinof, CEO, Europe, WisdomTree, said, “In 2024, we led the European market in crypto ETP inflows, and this momentum has continued in 2025 as we support clients with innovative, differentiated solutions underpinned by the security, transparency and product structuring they expect from WisdomTree.” Stellar Lumens ETP now listed on 3 exchanges According to the available market data, the ETP charges a management fee of 0.50%. WisdomTree asserts that the 0.50% fee is the lowest-cost physically backed lumens ETP in Europe. The product is now listed on the Swiss SIX Exchange, as well as the Paris and Amsterdam Euronext exchanges, and is set to launch on Germany’s Xetra on October 15. WisdomTree claims this product is the most cost-effective XLM physical ETP in Europe, designed to provide institutions with a compliant investment channel for native Stellar network assets. Known for its efficient cross-border payments and tokenized asset issuance, the Stellar network has partnered with over 69 regulated financial institutions across more than 170 countries for fiat–to–crypto bridging. Dovile Silenskyte, director of digital assets research at WisdomTree, said, “Stellar is one of the most established blockchains in the world, with a clear focus on solving real-world problems in cross-border payments and finance. Lumens serve as the lifeblood of the Stellar network, facilitating efficient cross-currency transactions and, with a fixed total supply of 50 billion and no inflationary issuance, it benefits from scarcity and monetary integrity.” Meanwhile, WisdomTree just announced that its European ETF and ETP range has surpassed $50 billion in assets under management. Globally, WisdomTree manages over $140 billion across asset classes on behalf of investors. WisdomTree’s European growth has been underpinned by more than $6 billion of net inflows year-to-date. This reflects broad investor engagement across its expanding suite of ETPs. Momentum has been driven by strong demand for the WisdomTree Europe Defence UCITS ETF, which now has over $4 billion in assets and is one of the most successful European ETF launches of 2025. Additionally, WisdomTree has experienced consistent asset growth across its UCITS platform, now totaling $12 billion in assets. The firm also holds gold and commodity ETPs, with a range now exceeding $30 billion in assets. WisdomTree was also the first established asset manager to launch physically backed crypto ETPs, leveraging its heritage in physically backed gold exposures. XLM price resembles the pattern observed back in 2017 A crypto analyst noted that the current 2025 XLM price closely resembles the pattern observed in 2017. The 2017 and 2025 $XLM structures are strikingly similar. In 2017, a breakout occurred following a prolonged descending wedge formation, which then began a parabolic run after a brief accumulation phase above the demand zone.

The market tends to go through cycles, and the re-emergence of old technical patterns may be a sign that XLM is entering another significant phase in its long-term trend. The analyst explained, “Same structure, different cycle. The market changes with time, but the psychology and price behavior often repeat.” The comparison lends credence to the notion that old classical set-ups continue to influence new market action, and Stellar is reverting to its old beat once again. However, the price of XLM has been in a downturn for as long as 30 days, with a decline of 17.52%. Meanwhile, XLM is down 6% in the last 24 hours and 20.3% in the last 7 days. It is trading at around $0.3239.

Banking titan Citigroup is preparing to launch its crypto custody service next year. After about three years of development, Citigroup clients will soon be able to directly hold and manage crypto through the bank’s digital asset platform platform. Given that Citigroup serves over 200M customer accounts across 160+ countries, this is fantastic news for crypto adoption. It’s bound to bring in a new wave of mainstream investors, making now an opportune time to explore the best crypto presales to watch. TradFi Joins DeFi as US Regulations Turn Pro-Crypto Citigroup’s crypto initiative comes on the heels of a much more friendly crypto climate in the US. It follows the passage of new regulations, such as the GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act . They each provide clearer rules for stablecoins, exchange operations, and digital asset classification. By encouraging institutional participation while ensuring customer compliance and protection, they set the stage for banks like Citigroup to confidently enter the crypto market without hurdles. In turn, Citi isn’t the only TradFi firm noticing DeFi’s perks. JPMorgan, for instance, plans to enable clients to trade $BTC among other cryptos in the future. In other news, Mastercard is reportedly vying against Coinbase to acquire the stablecoin company BNBK , for a head-turning $1.5B–$2.5B. All of this bodes well for crypto, particularly presales like Snorter Token ($SNORT) , Pudgy Pandas ($PANDA) , and Best Wallet Token ($BEST) . The reason is not only their innovation but also their prices, which are at their current lowest post-exchange listings. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Nearly Raises $5M Before Presale Ends & Bot Launches Snorter Token ($SNORT) is making waves early on, as evidenced by its nearly $5M raise before its presale ends next week on October 20, 2025. It’s gaining significant traction as the launchpad for Snorter Bot, a Telegram trading bot set to launch on Solana this quarter. It’ll leverage Solana’s ultra-fast speeds (the chain can facilitate 97.94% more transactions per second than Ethereum) and promises fees at just 0.85%. Nevertheless, after its Solana debut, it’ll expand to multi-chain support across Ethereum and other EVM-compliant chains. This way, you’re not limited to investing in the best Solana meme coins . Regardless of your go-to network, the bot will be extremely helpful in sniping new tokens immediately, copying top trading wallets to boost your gains, and trading directly within the #4 messaging app worldwide (Telegram). Buying $SNORT also opens additional perks, spanning lower trading fees, exclusive premium bot tools, and 108% APY staking rewards. $SNORT is available on presale for just $0.1079. However, our Snorter Token price prediction foresees it breaking $0.94 this year, making now a great time to join with a 771% discount. Invest in $SNORT now for a possible 771% ROI. 2. Pudgy Pandas ($PANDA) – Turns Token Profits Into Real-World Panda Conservation Efforts Despite looking like yet another animal-inspired meme coin at first glance, there’s much more to Pudgy Pandas ($PANDA) than initially meets the eye. $PANDA is a crypto conservation movement that strives to help protect and repopulate the global panda population. And such an initiative is increasingly important. As of September data, only around 1.9K pandas exist in the wild worldwide . The Pudgy Panda project aims to help Pandas by locking 10% of its total token supply into panda charities, plus burning tokens every time a new cub is born. Reducing the overall token supply of $PANDA creates a deflationary effect, making the token scarcer and potentially more valuable over time. Already, $PANDA has raised over $5.4K on presale. One coin currently costs just $0.06055, highlighting that it’s attracting the attention of bear lovers early on. Want to know more? Read the Pudgy Panda whitepaper. 3. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Cheap Gas Fees & 80% APY Staking Rewards in Crypto Wallet Best Wallet Token ($BEST) has rapidly raised over $ 16.5M in presales, serving as the foundation of the Best Wallet app . Simply put, Best Wallet is a mobile-first non-custodial crypto wallet that makes Web3 access easier for everyday users. It achieves this through various features, including cross-chain token swaps, portfolio tracking, and direct dApp integration. It’s a great way to expand your crypto portfolio hassle-free, thanks to its support of 1K+ digital assets, soon across 60 blockchains. And the network support isn’t all it has up its sleeve. Best Wallet has much more to look forward to, including the debut of its own crypto debit card (Best Card), an NFT gallery, and market intelligence analytics. And it’ll achieve all this without exposing you to unnecessary risks. As a non-custodial wallet with two-factor authentication (2FA) and advanced encryption protocols, it makes it tricky for anyone but you to access your digital riches. You can also boost your Best Wallet experience by purchasing $BEST on presale . It’s currently available for just $0.025785 and is anticipated to reach $0.72 this year (check out our Best Wallet Token price prediction for more information). $BEST holders are granted several benefits, including governance rights, lower transaction fees, exclusive access to top presales, and staking rewards currently at an 80% APY. Buy $BEST for less than a cent, reap the perks. Disclaimer: This isn’t investment advice. Crypto can be highly volatile, so always do your own research and don’t invest more than you can afford to lose.

The mass panic, fear, uncertainty, and doubt among retail investors in response to political or macro news causes corrections and sharp pullbacks – but within a short time, FUD soon gives way to FOMO. Analysts are beginning to treat it as a potential contrarian indicator: when the crowd is at its most fearful, it may be a signal to buy – and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is ready to take advantage. Trump’s Tariffs: Catalyst for Panic and Rebound A recent flashpoint occurred when U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 100% tariff on China. The announcement triggered a sharp sell-off across crypto markets as retail investors rushed to exit. But as soon as the markets cooled and officials clarified that the tariffs weren’t set in stone, many of those ‘feared’ positions were covered and prices rebounded. According to Santiment analyst Brian Q , retail traders often act on emotion, moving opposite to where more experienced investors position themselves. In events like these, when panic peaks, institutional or savvy traders see opportunities to scoop up value. A Recurring Pattern in 2025 This event is not unique. Throughout 2025, several political and macro developments have prompted similar cycles of FUD-driven sell-offs and subsequent recoveries. Among them: In April , the first wave of global tariff threats unsettled markets. In June , geopolitical tensions in the Middle East heightened fears. In August , uncertainty over whether the U.S. Federal Reserve would cut rates triggered renewed volatility. Each of these moments saw elevated fear, followed by buyers stepping in once the panic cooled. Survey data underscores this phenomenon. A December 2024 survey of over 1,200 crypto users by Kraken found: 81% of respondents admitted that FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) influenced their investing decisions 63% conceded that emotional decisions harmed their portfolios Meanwhile, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a sentiment gauge ranging from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed), has recently lingered in the fear zone (around 38 or lower). That tracks with the market volatility. Analysts’ Take: Risk and Reward Analysts like Brian Q propose that peaks in crowd FUD can be signals to accumulate, on the logic that panic-driven sell-offs often overshoot fundamentals. The cycle tends to be: News or political shock triggers panic Retail exits en masse Institutional or value-focused investors buy in Fear subsides and prices recover Retail returns, often chasing momentum The timing and depth of rebounds can vary, and what appears to be panic could be rooted in genuine macroeconomic headwinds or regulatory changes. Still, viewing FUD as an opportunity rather than a headwind could be a major step forward, highlighting why downturns are precisely the right time to explore the best new crypto projects. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) could be uniquely positioned to double down on the next FUD-fueled $BTC surge. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Fastest, Cheaper Bitcoin Payments for Next-Gen Crypto Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) takes all of Bitcoin’s weaknesses and turns them into strengths: Lack of scalability ? Bitcoin deposited on an SVM-powered canonical bridge becomes wrapped Bitcoin on the Bitcoin Hyper Layer 2. Slow transaction speeds ? Bitcoin Hyper allows transactions at Solana’s several thousand TPS, not Bitcoin’s 7 TPS. Low throughput? The SVM boasts high throughput and minimal fees, making microtransactions a practical option. All of those improvements don’t come at the expense of Bitcoin’s natural advantages; you’ll still get the security and stability of Bitcoin with all Hyper transactions finally resolving on the original layer 1. It’s more than just an idea; Bitcoin Hyper’s potential – and the chance to supercharge Bitcoin’s next run – is drawing investors to the presale in droves. Major whale buys include a massive $379K $HYPER purchase, while another investor added their own $32K purchase in the last 24 hours. Learn how to buy Bitcoin Hyper with our guide and see why the $23.5M presale could just be the beginning of $HYPER’s story. Tokens currently cost $0.013115, but that price won’t last. Our price prediction indicates that the token may reach $0.02595 by the end of the year. Be sure to visit the Bitcoin Hyper presale page for the latest information. If crowd sentiment is becoming a driver of crypto market flow, then political events, tariff policy shifts, central bank decisions, and regulatory noise will likely continue to be focal points. Monitoring measures such as the Fear & Greed Index, social media sentiment, and institutional inflows can help anticipate when FUD is peaking – and when it’s time to invest in the best altcoins to buy .

Das neue System soll sicher, stabil und an echte Währungen gebunden sein. Damit beginnt für viele Banken der Einstieg in die Welt der Blockchain. Die Finanzwelt steht vor einem großen Wandel. Einige der größten Banken der Welt arbeiten an einer neuen Art von digitalem Geld. Ziel ist es, Zahlungen schneller, sicherer und günstiger zu machen – und das alles mit moderner Blockchain-Technologie. Große Banken ziehen an einem Strang Mehrere bekannte Banken wie Banco Santander, Citi, Bank of America und Deutsche Bank haben angekündigt, gemeinsam an einer neuen digitalen Währung zu arbeiten. Auch Institute wie Barclays, BNP Paribas, Goldman Sachs, MUFG, TD Bank und UBS sind dabei. Laut einer Mitteilung von BNP Paribas soll das digitale Geld durch echte Reserven abgesichert sein und im Verhältnis 1:1 an die Währungen der G7-Staaten gekoppelt werden.Zu den G7 gehören die USA, Kanada, Frankreich, Deutschland, Italien, Japan und das Vereinigte Königreich . Die Idee dahinter: Ein stabiles digitales Geld, das genauso viel wert ist wie die Währung, auf der es basiert. Das schafft Vertrauen – vor allem bei Kunden, die Blockchain-Technologie bisher skeptisch sehen. Hier kommst du zu unserer detaillierten Prognose für Bitcoin. Was das neue Geld besonders macht Das geplante System basiert auf einer öffentlichen Blockchain, also einer offenen, digitalen Datenbank. Dort sollen Zahlungen sicher und transparent ablaufen. Im Unterschied zu normalen Kryptowährungen wie Bitcoin soll der Wert des neuen Tokens stabil bleiben. Jede digitale Einheit wäre durch echtes Geld auf einem Bankkonto gedeckt. So könnten die Vorteile der Digitalisierung – Schnelligkeit, niedrige Kosten und internationale Reichweite – mit der Sicherheit klassischer Banken kombiniert werden. Für viele Experten ist das ein logischer Schritt: Banken behalten die Kontrolle, während Kunden von der neuen Technik profitieren. Stablecoins: Von der Krypto-Welt in den Alltag Lange Zeit nutzten nur Krypto-Händler sogenannte Stablecoins, um schnell zwischen digitalen Währungen zu wechseln. Doch das hat sich geändert. Heute sehen auch große Unternehmen wie Meta und Amazon die Vorteile von digitalen, stabilen Zahlungsmitteln. Selbst Banken erkennen, dass sie ohne eigene Lösungen den Anschluss verlieren könnten. The ETH thesis for @fundstrat is simple. He's frontrunning ETH accumulation by the banks. ""Ethereum is also the architecture that future banks will have.

Das stärkt das Vertrauen und zeigt: Digitale Währungen sind längst keine Randerscheinung mehr. Warum das Projekt wichtig ist Die beteiligten Banken wollen herausfinden, ob ein gemeinsames digitales Geldsystem den Markt verbessern kann. Es soll Wettbewerb fördern, Abläufe vereinfachen und Kosten senken. Gleichzeitig wollen die Banken sicherstellen, dass alle gesetzlichen Vorgaben erfüllt werden.Natürlich gibt es auch Risiken. Manche Experten warnen, dass solche Projekte die Macht großer Banken weiter vergrößern könnten. Andere sehen vor allem Vorteile: Stabelcoins würden schnellere Zahlungen rund um die Uhr, mehr Transparenz und weniger Abhängigkeit von Mittlern ermöglichen. Wenn das Projekt gelingt, könnte es ein Vorbild für viele weitere Länder und Banken werden. Ein Schritt in die Zukunft des Geldes Laut einer Analyse von Standard Chartered könnten Stablecoins in den nächsten Jahren bis zu eine Billion US-Dollar an Einlagen aus Entwicklungsländern abziehen. Das zeigt, wie groß das Potenzial dieser Technologie ist. The endgame is clear: Bitcoin becomes the global reserve currency—and it's heading to $13 million. pic.twitter.com/ZCX3tSxjjC — Dear Bitcoiner (@DearBitcoiner) April 6, 2025 Für die beteiligten Banken ist das eine große Chance. Sie können zeigen, dass sie Innovationen selbst gestalten – und nicht nur darauf reagieren. Wenn Banken und Blockchain zusammenfinden, entsteht eine neue Art von Geld: digital, sicher und weltweit nutzbar. Das Projekt könnte also mehr sein als ein Test – vielleicht ist es der Beginn einer neuen Ära im Finanzsystem. Die Zukunft des Geldes – hier also einmal ganz im Stile der eingesessnen Großbanken – und wie sieht es aus mit dem neuen smarten Geld? Geld, was in Memes und Social Media Hypes stattfindet?

Ostium Foresees Explosive Move To $133,000",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-reset-complete-ostium-133000/,"Ostium Labs’ Market Outlook #55 argues that Bitcoin’s higher-timeframe bull structure survived last week’s volatility and now points “back to the highs,” provided spot holds above $107,000. “Whilst we trade above $107k, I think the next move is back to the highs, with $112k likely to act as local support,” the note states, adding that the firm still expects price to trade into “that confluence of overhead resistance at $133k by month-end.” The team frames last week’s deleveraging as the “great reset,” contending that the largest liquidation event in crypto history removed excess leverage without breaking weekly structure. On the weekly chart, no major support was lost and the wick down to roughly $107,000 was reclaimed into a $115,000 close, which Ostium reads as confirmation that momentum remains bullish on higher timeframes. Invalidation is precise: “A weekly close below last week’s low is now the obvious invalidation… close through $107k… and we have a more pressing concern, where we undoubtedly then trade into $99k.” On the daily, Ostium notes a classic sweep-and-reversal sequence. Price twice tagged the prior range high near $126.3k, failed to hold above $123.8k, and then “collapsed,” ultimately wicking into the 200-day moving average—an area the desk had flagged as a likely terminal level for any early-October capitulation. The view from here is unambiguous: “Anyone expecting sub-$100k will remain sidelined for a long time—if you didn’t get it on the largest liquidation event in crypto history, I don’t think you’re getting it until we enter a bear market.” Tactical invalidation on this timeframe is a daily close below the 200-DMA, which would put the 360-DMA near $100,000 in play and constitute Ostium’s “line in the sand for a full-blown flip into bear market territory.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly Preview: Trump’s Tariff Playbook Is Back — Here’s How To Trade It Path dependency matters for the upside call. Ostium expects prior highs around $112,000 to act as support and form a higher low, with “acceptance back above ~$116k” setting a rotation to the top of the range at $123.8k and then “price discovery beyond that.” The desk’s near-term timing is surprisingly punchy: “Gun to my head I think we trade $125k by early next week and $133k by month-end.” For traders, the preferred long setup is early-week weakness into $110k–$112k to establish a higher low, using a daily close below $107k (hard stop $105k) as risk, and targeting at least $121k with scope for much higher. A counter-trend short, by contrast, would require a grind up into the $121k confluence, a rejection and daily close back below $118k, and then a fade into the $110k–$112k zone—only if the higher-low hasn’t already formed. Positioning evidence, in Ostium’s view, buttresses the reset-then-extend thesis. The firm highlights obliterated open interest, Binance Net Longs back to “Liberation Day” lows, compressed three-month annualized basis, and fresh liquidation maps for one-week and one-month horizons—all consistent with a cleaner tape for trend continuation. The calendar this week is dense but navigable: a speech-heavy week (Powell, Bailey, Lagarde), the NY Empire State Manufacturing print, the Philadelphia Fed survey, and US Industrial Production. Ostium’s framework treats these events as potential catalysts rather than trend definers; so long as $107,000 holds and $112,000 functions as a springboard, the structural bias remains higher toward $133,000. At the core of the thesis is a binary investor psychology after the purge. “These sorts of events mark turning points: either you are now cemented in your belief that… the bear market has begun… or you are cemented in your belief that the leverage washout gives us the runway for higher for longer prices into Q1 next year,” Ostium writes. The desk is firmly in the latter camp, reiterating that Bitcoin “looks more bullish today than it did at the beginning of last week.” Briefly beyond Bitcoin, Ostium’s cross-asset read tilts supportive for the crypto beta complex if near-term conditions align. For Ethereum, weekly structure “looks nothing like a top,” with a decisive close above trendline resistance and $4,400 expected to trigger an all-time-high breakout; the team believes “ETH trades through $4,950 within 10 days… toward $5,750 in November,” and sees the Q4 low as likely in. Related Reading: Bitcoin Direction Still Unclear: Analyst Says Watch These Key Charts On ETH/BTC, the desk calls last week’s flush into 0.0319 a higher-low and anticipates ETH outperformance into year-end, contingent on reclaiming 0.0375 and eventually breaking the trendline—a dynamic that, if realized, could cap BTC dominance without undermining Bitcoin’s own trend. The DXY rally is viewed as late-stage: resistance near 100 and a looming rollover would reduce macro headwinds for risk assets. For US equities, Ostium still expects “higher for longer,” eyeing fresh SPX highs by month-end and a strong November as buyback blackouts end and earnings season progresses; improving equity breadth tends to coincide with constructive crypto flows. Finally, in “OTHERS,” the altcoin index printed a historic wick to the 360-week MA before reclaiming support; with derivatives positioning “utterly decimated,” Ostium now expects a higher local low, a November reclaim of the yearly open near $335bn, and, if confirmed, a push toward cycle and ATH resistance—conditions that usually track with a healthier, less fragile Bitcoin uptrend. Taken together, the desk’s message is consistent across timeframes and assets: the reset did its job, the invalidation is clear at $107,000, $112,000 should be the pivot, and the upside waypoint is $133,000, with the macro calendar more likely to modulate the path than to derail the destination. As Ostium summarizes, “Whilst we trade above $107k… the next move is back to the highs.” At press time, BTC traded at $111,509.

The acquisition, executed during one of the most turbulent market phases in crypto history, reflects growing confidence in Solana’s long-term potential. Solmate and Solana Forge a Strategic Alliance According to the press release , the strategic purchase was conducted under the Solana Foundation’s “Solana By Design” program and came with a 15% discount from the prevailing market price. Solmate will deploy the acquired SOL to power its bare-metal infrastructure projects in the UAE, ensuring seamless blockchain integration across various government and enterprise initiatives. The collaboration also grants the Solana Foundation the right to nominate two directors to Solmate’s board, solidifying the alignment between both organizations. Marco Santori, CEO of Solmate Infrastructure, emphasized that the firm’s infrastructure-first model ensures it remains at the forefront of blockchain innovation. He noted that Solmate’s positioning within the UAE often called the “Capital of capital” gives it a unique geographic advantage in bridging global finance and decentralized technology. Ark Invest Expands Stake to 11.5% In a parallel development, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest disclosed an 11.5% ownership stake in Solmate Infrastructure, marking one of its most significant blockchain-related investments to date. Ark initially participated in Solmate’s oversubscribed PIPE financing round, acquiring over 6.5 million shares. The investment marked the first time a regulated American ETF joined a crypto infrastructure private placement. Recently, Ark increased its holdings with an additional 779,619 shares, signaling continued conviction in Solana’s growth and Solmate’s strategy. Analysts view Ark’s move as a reflection of institutional confidence in Solana’s utility-driven ecosystem. The investment also underscores a broader shift in institutional strategies favoring direct exposure to blockchain infrastructure rather than speculative trading. Solana Price Recovery and Market Liquidations According to SolanaFloor data, the Solana network saw over $116 million in liquidations during the recent market downturn, making it one of the hardest-hit ecosystems. On-chain derivatives platforms accounted for about $75 million of those liquidations, while centralized exchanges contributed $41 million. Despite the volatility, Solana has since stabilized, trading around $196.98 , marking a 1.21% daily increase after a 13.56% weekly decline. Trader Tardigrade, a market analyst, observed that Solana rebounded sharply from its $172 support level, gaining over 22% on the hourly chart. Source: X The rally pushed prices past $210, where renewed buying pressure confirmed strong market interest. If the uptrend holds, resistance near $268 could be the next key test, potentially paving the way toward $280.

The eligible wallets are linked to several high-profile crypto communities. The Monad airdrop for MON tokens may enjoy increased interest, as the project just opened its claims page. The MON token airdrop will precede the chain’s main net launch. The airdrop will allocate MON tokens to 5,500 members of the Monad community, as well as nearly 225K eligible members of the wider crypto community. Monad will use Trusta AI to sift out Sybill addresses and allocate MON to its core power users. Monad to reward multiple crypto communities The focus of the Monad airdrop will be on power users from other platforms. The airdrop will also reward high-volume traders on Hyperliquid, Phantom Wallet, as well as Pump.fun trenches traders, Virtuals Protocol users, and other memecoin holders. Monad will be the airdrop for ‘trenches’ traders that have so far received limited recognition and rewards. The snapshot for all communities was taken as of September 30. For some criteria, activity was tracked over a multi-month period. As with other airdrops, Monad has been attacked with malicious links for fake token claim pages. Other MON recipients include the users of Aave, Euler, Morpho, Pendle, Lighter, Curve, PancakeSwap, and Uniswap. Ethereum users with major DAO activity and DeFi protocol usage will also be rewarded. Users of the Backpack perpetual futures DEX will also receive MON tokens. A MON allocation will go to the owners of NFT collections, including CryptoPunks, Milady Maker, Moonbirds, Pudgy Penguins, and others. The long-term activity suggests Monad was wary of point farming and non-organic activity. The Monad Cards initiative, which relied on social media identities, pointed out another group of MON recipients based on their real on-chain engagement. Monad will also reward specific crypto contributors, including ZachXBT, members of SEAL 911, Cantina auditors with significant findings, and members of the Protocol Guild. Monad has additional VC backers, with $244M raised from OKX Ventures and other funds back in 2024. MON signals at prices above $1 MON tokens are currently in pre-market trading on MEXC. The tokens are hovering around $0.94, with short-term spikes as high as $39. MON may start with trading anomalies, including potential liquidations for aggressive short positions.

Some tokens advance on fresh participation while others offer quieter signs that shape positioning. Reading the tape means weighing price against depth, flow, and the kinds of trades that show up when liquidity rotates. Today’s mix captures that split. MYX is firm and trending higher. Bittensor adds a small gain that still matters for the AI set. Solana barely moves in price, yet volume climbs by about 12%, a sign that larger transactions are being executed without forcing the print. MYX Finance (MYX): Bid Returns With Active Two-Way Flow MYX is currently trading near $3.35 , up by 15% in 24 hours. Data shows higher turnover across major pairs and steady interest in perpetuals. That combination usually supports the kind of stair-step action visible this week. Analysts point to two immediate drivers. First, the ongoing debate around recent airdrop allocations has kept MYX on screens. Scrutiny invites trading on both sides, which deepens books and invites mean reversion setups around headlines. Second, listings and fresh pairs have widened access, making it easier for momentum and liquidity seekers to participate. The structure of the move matters. Orderly pullbacks rather than disorderly gaps have followed breaks through recent intraday highs. Funding has stayed close to neutral during most sessions, a sign that spot demand is participating rather than only leveraging. Traders will watch whether open interest can rise alongside spot volume without pushing funding out of balance. If that holds, MYX can keep its place in rotation. Bittensor (TAO): Steady Gain With Useful Readings For The AI Basket Bittensor is now trading around $441, up 8% in the last 24 hours. Reports describe mixed action across AI and compute tokens, which matches TAO’s restrained day. Even so, TAO continues to hold levels reclaimed last week, preserving the option for another attempt if category flow improves. Bittensor Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) Desk analysis focuses on two markers. One is whether open interest can build while funding stays contained, which would suggest cash buyers are returning rather than a one-sided chase. The other is the supply calendar that traders have monitored through recent sessions. When markets price those dates efficiently, smaller daily gains can still indicate constructive positioning. For now, the signal is patience, not urgency. Solana (SOL): Flat Price With Rising Turnover Solana shows little price change, yet the 24-hour volume is up by about 9%. That split often appears when participants rebalance across majors and mid-caps without seeking a breakout. Execution is happening, only not at levels that shift the close. Analysis points to several plausible sources. Dealers hedge exposure as funding normalizes. Programmatic strategies rotate between spot and perpetuals as spreads invite basis trades. Liquidity providers adjust inventories as memecoins and DeFi pools on Solana stay active. Any one of these can pull volume higher while price stays anchored. For traders tracking altcoin season, this still matters. A flat tape with growing activity can precede a move once flows skew in one direction. It also suggests that depth is healthy, which is a prerequisite for sustained rallies when risk appetite improves. Altcoin Season Read MYX carries the day with a cleaner advance built on active two-way flow and expanding access. Bittensor contributes a small gain that keeps the AI set engaged and offers a read on positioning rather than euphoria. Solana’s higher volume without price expansion points to steady participation and resilient books. The near-term checklist is straightforward. For MYX, watch open interest, funding, and whether spot volume keeps pace. For TAO, track the hold above recent support and the behavior of the AI basket as a whole. For SOL, monitor spreads, depth, and whether the next burst of activity tilts net long or net short. If these markers hold, this rotation of altcoin season can persist even when only one of the three is green.

53137538,https://invezz.com/?p=2924771,1760456286,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,S&P Global taps Chainlink to launch Stablecoin Assessments for institutions,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/14/sp-global-taps-chainlink-to-launch-stablecoin-assessments-for-institutions/,"Chainlink has become the official blockchain-based oracle provider for S&P Global Ratings via a new partnership that will allow financial institutions on-chain access to S&P’s new stablecoin stability assessments. The partnership was announced on Oct. 14, and Chainlink will serve as the delivery layer for S&P’s Stablecoin Stability Assessments (SSAs), making them directly available on blockchain networks through its DataLink service. In layman’s terms, SSAs evaluate how well stablecoins are able to maintain their peg with fiat currencies. Unlike formal credit ratings, they are independent evaluations of risk, incorporating factors such as collateral composition, governance structure, liquidity support, and technological soundness. Through the integration, DeFi protocols and institutional participants will be able to access S&P’s risk evaluations in real time and embed them into smart contracts and automated financial systems. Commenting on the development, Chainlink’s CEO Sergey Nazarov said this marks the first time S&P’s analysis has been made directly accessible on-chain, adding that it “unlocks a critical framework for institutions adopting stablecoins at scale.” Why did S&P Global Ratings integrate Chainlink’s oracle? Oracles serve as the connective tissue between real-world data and blockchain-based systems. Smart contracts, by design, are unable to access off-chain information on their own, but Oracles solve this limitation by feeding verified external data, such as market prices, economic indicators, or credit assessments, into smart contracts. As such, Smart contracts can respond to real-world events in a secure and trust-minimised way. Chainlink’s infrastructure will enable the secure and reliable delivery of this data via its decentralized oracle network, allowing financial applications to consume the information without needing to develop their own data pipelines. For defi protocols, this plug-and-play capability is especially critical as they navigate an increasingly complex regulatory and technological environment. “By making our SSAs available on-chain through Chainlink’s proven oracle infrastructure, we’re enabling market participants to access our assessments seamlessly using their existing DeFi infrastructure, enhancing transparency and informed decision-making across the DeFi landscape,” S&P Global’s Chief DeFi Officer Chuck Mounts added. Chainlink leads blockchain-based oracle adoption Chainlink’s decentralized network of node operators, coupled with cryptographic guarantees and a reputation-based incentive model, offers a level of reliability that many other oracle solutions have struggled to match. As such, Chainlink has become the preferred oracle provider for systems that demand high data integrity, particularly when financial value or regulatory compliance is at stake. This reliability has not gone unnoticed by major players. In addition to S&P Global Ratings, Chainlink has onboarded a string of influential partners in recent months. For instance, the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) recently joined forces with Chainlink to create on-chain identity verification mechanisms for digital assets. Financial institutions can use this to meet Know Your Customer and anti-money laundering standards without sacrificing user privacy.

According to Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone, the improving performance of long-term Treasuries, represented by the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT), could be a direct beneficiary of gold’s strength, he said in an X post on October 14. To this end, Bloomberg Intelligence data shows TLT steadily appreciating through 2025, while the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) has struggled to sustain gains. U.S. TLT price chart. Source: Bloomberg Intelligence The S&P 500’s 90-day volatility index, after remaining unusually low for most of the year, has begun to rise, suggesting that calm conditions in the equity market may be giving way to renewed turbulence. “Rising Gold May Buoy Bonds vs. Stocks Gradually, then suddenly may describe the improving performance of US Treasury bonds vs. a potentially waning stock market in 2025,” McGlone said. McGlone’s analysis frames this as part of a broader shift where gold’s ascent aligns with bond market resilience. Stock market stretched As equity valuations appear stretched and economic growth moderates, investors have increasingly turned to Treasuries as a defensive asset. This trend is reinforced by the normalization of market volatility, which historically favors bonds over risk assets. Notably, while TLT’s total return index has advanced throughout the year, the S&P 500’s returns have flattened, and volatility has started to climb, conditions that often precede multi-year cycles where bonds outperform stocks. Meanwhile, gold continues to trade at new record highs, reaching the $4,100 mark and gaining over 50% year to date.

When X user @zerohedge quipped about the “hundreds of new nuclear power plants” the United States would need by 2028 to sustain the ballooning power demands of artificial intelligence in the early hours of Tuesday, October 14, it was meant as sardonic commentary on the AI investment boom. But it quickly grew into a discussion about energy, monetary systems, and the limits of digital expansion, one that drew in Elon Musk himself. “The money is not the problem: AI is the new global arms race, and capex will eventually be funded by governments (US and China),” Zerohedge wrote in a follow-up post . “If you want to know why gold, silver, and bitcoin are soaring, it’s the ‘debasement’ to fund the AI arms race. But you can’t print energy.” Musk replied simply: “True. That is why Bitcoin is based on energy: you can issue fake fiat currency, and every government in history has done so, but it is impossible to fake energy.” The AI power race The International Energy Agency projects that global electricity consumption by data centers, AI, and cryptocurrency could more than double by 2030. In the United States alone, research by RAND suggests AI data centers could demand an additional 10 gigawatts of capacity by 2025 and up to 68 GW by 2027, roughly equivalent to the output of 60 large nuclear reactors Tech giants are already seeking long-term solutions, especially those active in the AI race who understand the power needs of their enterprise. Late last year, Google agreed to buy power from Kairos Power, a company developing small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), to sustain its AI workloads. Microsoft and Meta have signed separate 20-year deals with Constellation Energy to utilize its nuclear power plants to get uninterrupted power. A report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies warned that electricity supply is the binding constraint on U.S. AI scaling, with grid delays and permitting issues threatening to slow innovation. Experts project that AI data center power demands could grow exponentially to 123 gigawatts by 2035 . Given all these developments and the global AI-dominance race, Zerohedge’s question comes up again, “how many hundreds of new nuclear plants will the U.S. need?” Musk’s energy-backed money thesis Musk’s assertion that “Bitcoin is based on energy” taps into an idea long cherished among crypto proponents, which is that Bitcoin’s proof-of-work system and some cryptocurrencies, such as the Musk-supported Dogecoin, require significant electrical expenditure to mint new coins, tying issuance to a tangible, finite resource. The logic contrasts with fiat currencies, which governments can expand at will through monetary policy. In the context of surging government spending to support AI infrastructure and industrial policy, Musk’s comment suggests a parallel, and that is, energy may be the ultimate store of value in an era of fiscal excess. Bitcoin’s energy consumption, while measurable, does not necessarily equate to intrinsic worth. Mining activity often clusters in regions with cheap or surplus electricity, meaning its supposed energy “backing” fluctuates with market incentives rather than physical scarcity. However, miners are also now sourcing power from stranded natural gas, hydroelectric dams, and renewable grids . Both the AI buildout and Bitcoin mining highlight the same foundational constraint, which is real energy. Zerohedge’s observation that “you can’t print energy” is a reality that policymakers have to contend with as they balance digital expansion with physical infrastructure limits.

Fink’s remarks on tokenization and how it could prove majorly constructive for BLK shares come on the heels of a strong third-quarter earnings release on Tuesday. The multinational saw its revenue come in at $6.51 billion, up 25% year-over-year, while adjusted earnings printed at a better-than-expected $11.55 in its Q3. BlackRock stock is currently up more than 40% versus its year-to-date low in early April. Why tokenization is constructive for BlackRock stock According to Larry Fink, tokenization of all assets could prove “the next wave of opportunity” for BLK stock – and his stance on digital finance isn’t just philosophical; it’s strategic. With more than $4.1 trillion sitting in digital wallets globally, much of it outside the US, he sees tokenized exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a gateway to traditional investing. “If we could tokenize an ETF…we could get [crypto-native investors] into more traditional long-term retirement products,” he said in a post-earnings interview with CNBC today . BlackRock’s own tokenized money market fund, BUIDD, and its Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, which now boasts over $100 billion in assets, exemplify this shift. As digital ecosystems expand, BlackRock is positioning itself as the bridge between decentralized finance and institutional-grade products, potentially unlocking new revenue streams and investor segments. BLK shares remain attractive despite YTD rally Beyond tokenization, BlackRock shares look attractive also because the company’s fundamentals remain robust. It reported $205 billion in net inflows for Q3, with iShares ETFs leading the charge. Additionally, assets under management (AUM) hit a record $13.46 trillion – up 17% on a year-over-year basis. BlackRock’s acquisition of HPS Investment Partners added $165 billion in client assets, bolstering its private markets footprint as well. Meanwhile, organic basic fee growth hit $10% annualised – driven by systematic active equity, outsourcing, and digital assets. BLK diversified revenue mix: from equities and fixed income to private credit and infrastructure, offers resilience across market cycles. With a 1.77% dividend yield and consistent buybacks, BLK shares offer both growth and income, which makes them a compelling long-term investment. Should you invest in BlackRock today? Larry Fink’s vision for tokenization isn’t just a tech pivot – it’s a strategic evolution for the world’s largest asset manager. “We look at that as the next wave of opportunity for BlackRock over the next tens of years,” he told CNBC. As traditional finance converges with blockchain innovation, BlackRock’s scale, credibility, and product breadth position it to lead. Whether through ETFs, private markets, or tokenized offerings, the firm is building a unified platform for the digital age. All in all, for investors, BlackRock stock offers exposure to both legacy strength and future-forward innovation. That’s why Wall Street continues to rate it at “buy” heading into 2026.

While most projects compete for attention through aggressive marketing, ZKP is proving itself through mathematics and engineering. It doesn’t ask investors to believe; it allows them to verify. The whitelist for this new ecosystem is opening soon, and it has already captured the attention of serious investors. Many are calling it the top crypto presale of the year because it does what so few have managed , it balances privacy, scalability, and compliance without compromise. ZKP isn’t trying to become the loudest project in crypto. It’s positioning itself as the one people trust when the noise fades. The Core Idea Behind Zero-Knowledge Proof At its heart, zero knowledge proof crypto technology is simple to understand yet extremely powerful. It allows a person or system to prove that something is true without revealing the underlying information. In practice, this means verifying transactions, ownership, or identity while keeping personal data private. This technology turns blockchain into what it was always meant to be, a secure, verifiable, and user-controlled system. ZKP bridges the gap between privacy and transparency, creating an environment where both can exist at once. This design doesn’t just protect individuals; it also enables businesses, governments, and institutions to participate in blockchain safely. That balance of privacy and verification is what makes this project different. It’s not about secrecy; it’s about confidence. The Whitelist Everyone’s Quietly Waiting For The mood around the Zero Knowledge Proof whitelist feels different from the usual presale hype. There’s no rush of empty promises or sudden viral campaigns. Instead, the anticipation is patient and calculated. Analysts and investors are preparing quietly, recognizing that this might be one of those rare windows that only come once every few cycles. The appeal is clear. Unlike typical token launches that rely on speculation, ZKP has fundamental use cases ready to scale. Developers are already testing applications that use the system for financial proofs, secure data verification, and cross-chain communication. These are not experimental ideas. They are working tools that could soon be powering the next wave of Web3 platforms. That is why the whitelist is attracting both retail investors and institutional watchers. Everyone senses that this could be the beginning of something with real longevity. A Quiet Revolution in Trust ZKP is more than a coin or a presale. It represents a philosophical shift for blockchain as a whole. The industry has spent a decade chasing speed and liquidity, often at the cost of security and privacy. Now the pendulum is swinging back toward credibility and proof. Zero Knowledge Proof provides exactly that. It allows decentralized systems to remain private, verifiable, and scalable at the same time. It also creates the foundation for what analysts are calling the “proof economy,” where users and companies can interact without exposing unnecessary data. This concept is already influencing how regulators, developers, and even AI researchers think about digital verification. The most interesting part is that ZKP doesn’t need to promise a revolution. It’s quietly building one. Every successful test, every integration, every proof generated adds to a growing realization that blockchain’s next evolution is already underway. For investors, this moment is the calm before recognition, the rare stage before the market starts to catch on. ZKP is not selling noise; it’s offering credibility.

The 54-second clip, shared by crypto influencer Amelie, is not just a simple fan edit; it’s a thought-provoking montage that merges Hollywood flair with crypto mystique, sparking fresh conversations about hidden messages, predictive programming, and XRP’s growing cultural imprint. A Viral Clip That’s Stirring Conversation Amelie’s post on X features a striking, fast-paced compilation built from scenes of the upcoming 2025 film F1 starring Brad Pitt. The fan-edited video overlays cinematic racing sequences with text annotations and subtle visual cues that hint at deeper meanings tied to XRP, the cryptocurrency associated with Ripple Labs. Since its upload, the clip has drawn thousands of reactions from XRP supporters who see it as another example of “synchronicity” — the idea that mainstream media may be subconsciously echoing or predicting the rise of certain technologies. WOW! Another mind-blowing video about #XRP pic.twitter.com/4TVENU8Sxc — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) October 13, 2025 What makes this short video remarkable is its precision and symbolism: each frame seems meticulously chosen to feed into a narrative that XRP is on the brink of something monumental. Gematria, Predictive Programming, and the XRP Connection The edit dives into esoteric territory by employing Gematria — a form of numerology that assigns numerical values to words and letters — to argue that certain numbers and dates shown in the F1 footage correspond to XRP-related milestones. Other overlays suggest themes of predictive programming, implying that cultural products like Hollywood films may contain hidden forecasts of future events or technologies. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While there is no verifiable link between F1 or its producers and Ripple, the video has nevertheless ignited debate among fans. Many within the XRP community have interpreted these connections as symbolic validation of XRP’s long-term relevance in global finance, especially as Ripple’s cross-border payment ecosystem continues to expand worldwide. Symbolism, Community, and the Power of Narrative What makes Amelie’s post stand out is not just its content, but its timing. The XRP community has recently been buzzing with renewed optimism following market recoveries and institutional adoption milestones. Against this backdrop, a creatively edited clip like Amelie’s serves as both entertainment and inspiration — reinforcing collective belief in XRP’s potential through visual storytelling. Such videos have become cultural artifacts in the crypto space. They demonstrate how visual narratives and community-driven symbolism can amplify sentiment far beyond technical charts or news headlines. For some, the F1-XRP connection is a mere coincidence; for others, it’s a coded reminder that XRP’s story runs deeper than price action. Separating Symbolism from Reality While Amelie’s clip continues to trend, experts caution against interpreting such edits as literal proof of corporate endorsement or insider knowledge. The F1 film remains a standalone Hollywood project with no confirmed association to Ripple or XRP. The power of the video lies in its creativity — a reflection of how decentralized communities like XRP’s use symbolism and storytelling to express conviction and unity. Ultimately, Amelie’s viral post highlights a fascinating cultural phenomenon: the fusion of entertainment, numerology, and digital finance into a shared mythology that keeps the XRP conversation alive. Whether viewed as art, analysis, or pure coincidence, one thing is clear — this mind-blowing video has once again proven the incredible narrative power of the XRP community.

But what if the next 1000x project is already roaring, and traders are still on the sidelines? The search for the next new crypto to buy never ends. Every week, investors hunt through charts, Telegram groups, and presales for that one gem ready to explode. Yet, by the time most spot it, it’s already halfway to orbit. As the meme goes, “You can’t time conviction, you can only join it.” While Bitcoin Cash and Toncoin deliver solid progress, one name is stealing the spotlight: BullZilla ($BZIL), a cinematic, deflationary presale rewriting how meme-fueled ecosystems build value. BullZilla: The Story-Driven Powerhouse and the Top New Crypto to Buy BullZilla ($BZIL) thrives on storytelling and innovation, making it a standout big new crypto to buy . Across its 24 lore chapters, every milestone, burn, and price climb becomes part of its legend. This creative branding keeps holders engaged and loyal, not just investors, but believers. Narrative power breeds staying power, and BullZilla’s design ensures both. Its deflationary mechanics bring that story to life, further strengthening BullZilla’s position as the best crypto to buy. Every “Roar Burn” permanently destroys tokens, shrinking supply and amplifying scarcity. With automatic price jumps every $100K raised or every 48 hours, momentum never stalls. It’s tokenomics with purpose, a blend of hype, math, and motion that turns early conviction into exponential growth. Stage 6C: BullZilla’s $900K Presale Is Roaring BullZilla’s presale has hit full throttle in Stage 6C, Going Full Send, with over $900,000 raised, 31 billion tokens sold, and more than 2,900 holders already in. The current price of $0.0001524 is gearing up for a 4.37% increase to $0.00015907 in Stage 6D. Early investors eye about 3,358.93% ROI at the projected listing price of $0.00527, while the earliest entrants still sit near 2,550% ROI. Even a $2,000 buy-in secures roughly 13.12 million $BZIL tokens, a stack that could grow dramatically as supply keeps tightening through on-chain burns. Price momentum never stops; every $100 K raised or 48 hours passed triggers the next increase. A 10% bonus on $50+ purchases and a 10% referral reward on shared codes keep expansion constant, with rewards unlocking two weeks post-presale. Built for motion and scarcity, the system converts early conviction into long-term potential. As the community puts it, “Catch BullZilla before the claws close.” Bitcoin Cash ($BCH): Institutional Interest Grows Amid Price Uptick Bitcoin Cash (BCH) climbed 1.43 % to $548.53 in the last 24 hours as institutional appetite returned. Recent Bitcoin Cash news highlights expanding merchant partnerships that reinforce BCH’s role as a fast, low-fee payments asset. Analysts cite technical stability and renewed on-chain activity as reasons why Bitcoin Cash price prediction models trend bullish. A sustained break above $550 could open room toward $600. The Bitcoin Cash crypto narrative remains clear: practical, decentralized payments on a proven blockchain. Toncoin ($TON): Ecosystem Expansion Boosts Market Confidence Toncoin (TON) jumped 3.21 % to $2.35 after new Toncoin news confirmed multiple DeFi partnerships across its ecosystem. Integrations with decentralized exchanges and yield platforms strengthen accessibility for traders and investors alike. These updates are shaping a more optimistic Toncoin price prediction, with some analysts targeting $2.60 short term. The Toncoin crypto network’s deep link with Telegram gives it unmatched exposure, while its scalable infrastructure positions it as a gateway for mainstream adoption in 2025. Conclusion Bitcoin Cash and Toncoin represent stability and proven technology. But BullZilla brings the thunder, scarcity, storytelling, and smart tokenomics engineered for acceleration. While BCH focuses on utility and TON expands DeFi, BullZilla builds a movement that rewards conviction. For anyone seeking the next new crypto to buy , this isn’t noise; it’s evolution. BullZilla’s presale is live now. Momentum is climbing, numbers are rising, and each chapter burns more supply. If conviction had a ticker, it would read $BZIL. For More Information: BZIL Official Website Join BZIL Telegram Channel Follow BZIL on X (Formerly Twitter) Frequently Asked Questions For New Crypto to Buy Why is BullZilla considered the top new crypto to buy? By fusing storytelling, automatic burns, and progressive pricing, it creates a structure that rewards loyalty instead of speculation. How does the deflationary model work? Each chapter triggers a Roar Burn that reduces token supply, driving scarcity and long-term value. Can small investors join the presale? Yes. Even $50 entries qualify for bonuses, making it accessible to newcomers and whales alike. What about Bitcoin Cash and Toncoin? Bitcoin Cash focuses on fast transactions and real-world payments; Toncoin leads in DeFi and Telegram integration. What is BullZilla’s ROI potential? Stage 6C projects roughly 3,358 % ROI to listing, though all crypto investments carry risk. Glossary Roar Burn: An on-chain event that destroys tokens to reduce supply. Presale Stage: The Phase where the token price increases automatically with funding. Referral Bonus: 10 % extra tokens for buyers and referrers. Deflationary Model: Tokenomics that decrease supply over time. Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction: Forecast models for BCH performance. Toncoin Price Prediction: Analyst outlook for TON growth. Liquidity Lock: Ensures post-launch stability. ROI: Return on investment. Listing Price: Initial exchange value. APY: Annual percentage yield for staking. Summary This piece highlights BullZilla ($BZIL) as the standout next crypto to buy, alongside updates on Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Toncoin (TON). Bitcoin Cash gains momentum through merchant adoption and network strength, while Toncoin advances via DeFi integrations and Telegram-driven exposure. But BullZilla dominates the conversation with its Stage 6C presale, over $900K raised, 31B tokens sold, and a 3,358% ROI potential. Its Roar Burn mechanics and price engine create a deflationary cycle that rewards early holders and builds scarcity. The conclusion is clear: BCH and TON show stability, but BullZilla offers the raw momentum and mythic energy that define crypto’s next big success.

After this impressive rally, a critical indicator related to the yellow metal has reached peak levels. In the following lines, we will analyze how this might trigger a rally for Bitcoin (BTC). Rotating Capital? Gold remains the world’s biggest asset in terms of market cap, recently widening its lead over major tech giants. Its capitalization has climbed to almost $29 trillion, while NVIDIA (the runner-up) is far behind with approximately $4.5 trillion. The increased dominance follows the impressive rise of the precious metal’s price, which has soared by roughly 56% in the past year and recently hit a new all-time high of almost $4,200. Gold Price, Source: Yahoo Finance And while some proponents of the yellow metal, such as Peter Schiff, celebrate the fresh peak and envision a further rally in the short term, others predict it might be time for a pullback. One of those is the popular X user Crypto Rover, who warned that gold’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has exploded to 91.8, or the highest level since the early 80s. The technical analysis tool measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes to help traders spot potential reversal points. It varies from 0 to 100, and anything above 70 indicates that gold’s valuation has spiked too quickly in a short period of time, meaning it could be due for a short-term correction, or, as Crypto Rover suggested: “This means it’s insanely overbought, making a cooldown likely.” The analyst assumed that such a development could prompt investors to start reallocating funds back into Bitcoin (BTC), thus possibly setting the stage for its next big move. BTC’s Bull Mode Remains Intact? There are many other analysts on crypto X who believe BTC’s bull run is far from being over despite the recent market crash. The analyst, who uses the moniker BitBull, for instance, claimed the leading digital asset continues to trade in a “giant bullish channel” and as long as the $100,000 – $103,000 holds, the bears can’t prevail. For his part, Carl Moon noted that a red October is something highly unusual for BTC. That said, he urged investors to “buy the dip” while they still have the chance.

By bringing IP on-chain, the project aims to make it a more accessible and liquid asset class, supported by tools for IP verification, financing, and scalable growth. In traditional capital markets, companies such as Apple and Tesla have demonstrated how access to early-stage capital and financial infrastructure can contribute to long-term growth into trillion-dollar enterprises. In contrast, IP—despite being one of the world’s most valuable assets—has historically been limited to royalties, licensing agreements, and fragmented ownership structures. Disney, with a market capitalization in the $200–300 billion range, exemplifies the scale of value that IP can generate when paired with capital infrastructure. City Protocol seeks to address this imbalance by introducing an on-chain IP capital market. The protocol is designed to enable creators to tokenize their IP from the earliest stages, with infrastructure that facilitates participation from communities and access to capital through decentralized mechanisms. Supported by a group of Web3-focused investors, City Protocol is building a full-stack ecosystem that includes IP verification, financing tools, launchpads, and infrastructure for scaling IP-based projects on-chain. What is City Protocol City Protocol is a decentralized IP protocol with a mission to liberate cultural and narrative assets from closed ecosystems and bring them into the on-chain capital market making them liquid, scalable, and globally accessible. In traditional models, IP growth depends on centralized platforms or publishers. Creators are bound by their rules, capital requirements, and distribution bottlenecks, which often bury early-stage creativity and hand disproportionate value to intermediaries. City Protocol disrupts this by introducing the logic of the on-chain capital market: Disintermediated issuance: Ideas can be tokenized from Day 1, immediately entering liquidity markets for pricing and funding. Community co-creation: Supporters become more than consumers—they are co-owners of the IP, growing alongside it and sharing in the upside. Cultural assetization: Creativity evolves into a financialized cultural asset, capable of being traded, combined, and expanded. Through this infrastructure, City Protocol supports the full lifecycle of IP: Birth: Decentralized issuance and capital backing solve the cold-start problem. Growth: Community-driven content creation and distribution enable sustained storytelling and narrative expansion. Maturity: On-chain financial instruments and index products capture and invest in the long-term value of IP. Ultimately, City Protocol builds an IP Capital Market where IPs are no longer dependent on single platforms or publishers, but instead co-shaped by communities and markets—unlocking sustainable cycles of growth and value creation. Team and Backing The City Protocol core team brings both crypto-native expertise and traditional entertainment and finance resources. They have been deeply involved in leading Web3 projects like Animoca, The Sandbox, Dapper Labs, and Memeland, while also holding experience at institutions such as HSBC, MediaAsia, and LVMH. This cross-industry background allows City Protocol to uniquely bridge on-chain innovation with real-world networks. On the funding side, City Protocol is backed by top-tier investors including Jump Trading, Dragonfly, and CMT Digital, providing strong capital market support for building its IP ecosystem. Core Product Ecosystem City Protocol’s product architecture covers the entire IP assetization flow, forming a closed-loop ecosystem built around four core components: IP Verification Layer – Ensures authenticity and copyright ownership on-chain, establishing trust for creators, communities, and investors. IP RWA (IP Strategy) – Enables financing and liquidity for small, early-stage and established IPs, ensuring that creators and communities can share growth value from the very beginning. AI + Growth Scaling Engine – Powered by tools such as City ID, Viral City, and The Totem Toy City, this module amplifies IP impact, drives viral distribution, and extends virtual IPs into real-world brands. Launchpad – A fair, transparent issuance and trading platform tailored for IP projects, protecting creator rights and ensuring open access to capital. Together, these four modules create a full-stack on-chain ecosystem that covers incubation, growth, distribution, and governance—allowing creators, communities, and investors to jointly participate in and benefit from the growth of cultural assets. Future Outlook: Unlocking Infinite Potential for the IP Market If DeFi brought the capital markets on-chain, City Protocol’s vision is to bring culture and storytelling on-chain. For creators, this represents unprecedented empowerment. They are no longer bound by centralized platforms or intermediaries. Instead, they can directly engage communities to launch, fund, and grow their IPs—lowering barriers and turning ideas into tradable, scalable assets. For supporters, it’s the first time they can participate as true stakeholders in cultural assets, rather than passive consumers. Communities can capture both early and long-term IP value, becoming true co-builders of cultural ecosystems. For the industry at large, City Protocol marks the shift from closed to open, opaque to programmable, and isolated value to composable capital markets. IPs evolve from being mere content or entertainment products into financialized cultural assets with investment potential. City Protocol positions itself as more than just a protocol—it represents a structural transformation in the IP capital market. By significantly reducing the friction traditionally associated with IP trading, the project aims to make the exchange of cultural and narrative assets as seamless as financial and physical assets on-chain. City Protocol provides the answer: by building end-to-end on-chain infrastructure for IPs, it allows creators, supporters, and investors to co-create and co-capture value in a single ecosystem. Every idea can become a capitalized cultural asset. Every community member can be a value co-creator. Every investor can join the early growth of IP markets. This is not just an upgrade to the traditional IP industry—it is the starting point for the on-chain cultural capital market. About City Protocol City Protocol is a decentralized protocol powering IP Capital Markets; designed for creators to launch, scale, and sustain IP. We bring IP assets, DATs and RWA onchain, powering IP as a global asset class. For the first time, creativity gains liquidity and scalability like companies unlocked through IPOs — now powered by decentralized markets.

By bringing IP on-chain, the project aims to make it a more accessible and liquid asset class, supported by tools for IP verification, financing, and scalable growth. In traditional capital markets, companies such as Apple and Tesla have demonstrated how access to early-stage capital and financial infrastructure can contribute to long-term growth into trillion-dollar enterprises. In contrast, IP—despite being one of the world’s most valuable assets—has historically been limited to royalties, licensing agreements, and fragmented ownership structures. Disney, with a market capitalization in the $200–300 billion range, exemplifies the scale of value that IP can generate when paired with capital infrastructure. City Protocol seeks to address this imbalance by introducing an on-chain IP capital market. The protocol is designed to enable creators to tokenize their IP from the earliest stages, with infrastructure that facilitates participation from communities and access to capital through decentralized mechanisms. Supported by a group of Web3-focused investors, City Protocol is building a full-stack ecosystem that includes IP verification, financing tools, launchpads, and infrastructure for scaling IP-based projects on-chain. What is City Protocol City Protocol is a decentralized IP protocol with a mission to liberate cultural and narrative assets from closed ecosystems and bring them into the on-chain capital market making them liquid, scalable, and globally accessible. In traditional models, IP growth depends on centralized platforms or publishers. Creators are bound by their rules, capital requirements, and distribution bottlenecks, which often bury early-stage creativity and hand disproportionate value to intermediaries. City Protocol disrupts this by introducing the logic of the on-chain capital market: Disintermediated issuance: Ideas can be tokenized from Day 1, immediately entering liquidity markets for pricing and funding. Community co-creation: Supporters become more than consumers—they are co-owners of the IP, growing alongside it and sharing in the upside. Cultural assetization: Creativity evolves into a financialized cultural asset, capable of being traded, combined, and expanded. Through this infrastructure, City Protocol supports the full lifecycle of IP: Birth: Decentralized issuance and capital backing solve the cold-start problem. Growth: Community-driven content creation and distribution enable sustained storytelling and narrative expansion. Maturity: On-chain financial instruments and index products capture and invest in the long-term value of IP. Ultimately, City Protocol builds an IP Capital Market where IPs are no longer dependent on single platforms or publishers, but instead co-shaped by communities and markets—unlocking sustainable cycles of growth and value creation. Team and Backing The City Protocol core team brings both crypto-native expertise and traditional entertainment and finance resources. They have been deeply involved in leading Web3 projects like Animoca, The Sandbox, Dapper Labs, and Memeland, while also holding experience at institutions such as HSBC, MediaAsia, and LVMH. This cross-industry background allows City Protocol to uniquely bridge on-chain innovation with real-world networks. On the funding side, City Protocol is backed by top-tier investors including Jump Trading, Dragonfly, and CMT Digital, providing strong capital market support for building its IP ecosystem. Core Product Ecosystem City Protocol’s product architecture covers the entire IP assetization flow, forming a closed-loop ecosystem built around four core components: IP Verification Layer – Ensures authenticity and copyright ownership on-chain, establishing trust for creators, communities, and investors. IP RWA (IP Strategy) – Enables financing and liquidity for small, early-stage and established IPs, ensuring that creators and communities can share growth value from the very beginning. AI + Growth Scaling Engine – Powered by tools such as City ID, Viral City, and The Totem Toy City, this module amplifies IP impact, drives viral distribution, and extends virtual IPs into real-world brands. Launchpad – A fair, transparent issuance and trading platform tailored for IP projects, protecting creator rights and ensuring open access to capital. Together, these four modules create a full-stack on-chain ecosystem that covers incubation, growth, distribution, and governance—allowing creators, communities, and investors to jointly participate in and benefit from the growth of cultural assets. Future Outlook: Unlocking Infinite Potential for the IP Market If DeFi brought the capital markets on-chain, City Protocol’s vision is to bring culture and storytelling on-chain. For creators, this represents unprecedented empowerment. They are no longer bound by centralized platforms or intermediaries. Instead, they can directly engage communities to launch, fund, and grow their IPs—lowering barriers and turning ideas into tradable, scalable assets.

Its infinite inflation, lack of meaningful technological upgrades, and dependence on hype rather than actual use cases are now being viewed as serious drawbacks. As more traders prioritize functional tokens with real DeFi use, attention is shifting. Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , already in Phase 6 of its presale, with it being more than 65% sold out, priced at $0.035 this phase and poised for the next price jump to $0.04. Having raised over $17.3 million and drawn in over 17,000 token holders, MUTM’s structure, peer-to-contract & peer-to-peer lending, strong tokenomics, transparency, audits, positions it as a serious coin. For investors tired of meme-driven volatility and empty promises, Mutuum Finance looks like the kind of utility-driven project that could be the smarter long-term bet. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Chart Analysis: Technical Strength, But Fading Pop In spite of the chaos across the entirety of the crypto market, Dogecoin (DOGE) has shown technical health, snapping back recently off the lower aspect of its 10-year long vertical ascending channel, a key configuration that suggests its long-term path is robust. Also indicating that analysis still view this point as crucial is yesterday’s rebound, pointing the way to a bounce higher up to the top ceiling long-term on the channel top. Even with this healthy configuration, DOGE’ price activity is nonetheless based on speculation more than usability or increasing ecosystem growth. As investors become ever more selective, many are just beginning to zero in on utility-driven assets that yield immediate usability and long-term potential, a direction that recently put Mutuum Finance (MUTM) directly in the crosshairs. Mutuum Finance Presale Hype Never Ends Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the latest DeFi sensation whose investors’ interest in the presale just appears to build momentum day after day. Current stage of the presale is Phase 6 with a price value of $0.035 per token of MUTM and has succeeded in reaching a value of more than $17.3 million due to financing courtesy of more than 17,000 investors. With over 65% sales during Phase 6, there is quite small time for the investors to put their monies into, reflecting the skyrocketing global confidence for the future prospect for the project as well as the decentralized finance potential. The pioneer investors will have tremendous potential profit when MUTM is launched into the open market. It will also provide an Ethereum blockchain-secured stable coin that will be pegged to the United States Dollar. This is not an algorithm token that depreciates during the course of the bear market, but non-algorithmic and over-collateralised so that during the days of a volatile market, the token will also be stable and credible too. Lending and Borrow Protocol MUTM will unveil its next-gen lending and borrowing protocol , a major release for its DeFi platform. Version 1 will be launched on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will have liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, as well as a liquidator bot. The first cryptocurrencies that will be able to be eligible for borrowing/lending, with collataralization will be ETH and USDT and will provide users with a secure, user-friendly, as well as multi-asset DeFi experience. Mutuum Finance Is Smart Investors’ New Favorite After Meme Mania As Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to rely on speculation and celebrity-driven attention, investors are pivoting toward projects with real-world value and sustainable design. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has quickly captured that spotlight, backed by over $17.3 million raised, 17,000+ investors, and more than 65% of its Phase 6 presale already sold out. Its blend of peer-to-peer and peer-to-contract lending, robust tokenomics, and upcoming Ethereum-backed stablecoin reflect a strong foundation focused on stability and innovation. As borrowing and lending protocol is scheduled to be launched on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, Mutuum Finance will open the gate to future potential for DeFi.

The new body will target unlicensed coin payments and cross-border transfers, the regulator said, noting it continues to support the legal crypto market. Belarus sets out to curb unauthorized crypto transactions The National Bank of the Republic of Belarus (NBRB), the main financial regulator in the former Soviet state, is forming a task force to combat illegal cryptocurrency transactions. The decision comes after a meeting with representatives of Belarusian banks and government-approved crypto companies, chaired by Deputy Governor Alexander Egorov. Preventing unauthorized payment transactions and transfers of illicit funds abroad through crypto platforms licensed to operate in Belarus was the main topic of their discussions. The participants came to the conclusion that comprehensive solutions are needed to effectively combat existing schemes in the shadow economy, RBC reported on Tuesday. Quoted by the Russian business news outlet, the deputy chairman of the NBRB Board emphasized: “The crypto market is growing, and the National Bank supports its further development, so approaches to solving the problem with fraud must be developed through joint efforts.” During the meeting, which took place on Monday, the Belarusian bankers and fintech experts identified ways to deal with illegal crypto circulation. The establishment of a dedicated working group was one of the agreed measures, the monetary authority said in a statement. Crackdown comes amid efforts to update regulations Belarus was among the first nations in Eastern Europe to regulate crypto operations. It did that with a presidential decree “On the Development of the Digital Economy,” signed by the country’s long-time head of state, Alexander Lukashenko, in 2017. The document legalized mining and trading. Under Lukashenko’s order, which came into force the following year, companies working with “digital tokens” were required to register at the Belarus Hi-Tech Park ( HTP ) hub. Its special legal regime provides various benefits and tax exemptions to businesses from various sectors of the IT industry. In September 2024, the financial authorities in Minsk prohibited private individuals as well as individual entrepreneurs registered as residents of the HTP from buying and selling cryptocurrencies on non-Belarusian exchanges. The ban, imposed amid concerns over capital flight from the country, was allegedly going to also prevent the export of “funds stolen from citizens’ bank accounts” via their exchange for cryptocurrency on foreign crypto trading platforms. Cryptocurrencies have enjoyed growing popularity with Belarusian citizens and businesses whose access to traditional financial channels, especially in foreign trade, has been severely limited by sanctions similar to those imposed on Russia, of which their nation is a close ally. In September of this year, Lukashenko himself announced that cross-border Belarusian crypto payments amounted to a record $1.7 billion in the first seven months of 2025, while also quoting estimates suggesting their volume may reach $3 billion by the end of December. He also admitted: “Today, cryptocurrency-based transactions are more active than ever, and their role in facilitating payments is growing.” As if to prove his words, one of the largest online retailers in the region, Russia’s e-commerce giant Wildberries, launched crypto payments in Belarus last month, using the services of Whitebird, an HTP-registered local exchange. Days before making that statement, the president had ordered government officials to speed up the update of the country’s crypto rules as reported by Cryptopolitan, highlighting that the industry was developing faster than the legislative framework. In August, Governor of the NBRB Roman Golovchenko unveiled the regulator had already drafted amendments that will allow Belarus to secure “breakthrough results in the usage of cryptocurrencies.” The central bank’s chief executive indicated that the authorities in Minsk are aiming at expanding the regulated domestic crypto market, describing the matter as “very important.” While more reluctant than Belarus to allow cryptocurrencies to circulate in its economy, neighboring Russia has been quite actively employing coins to circumvent sanctions in international settlements.

The Fund forecasts that Britain’s economy will rise in price by 3.4% this year and 2.5% in 2026. The IMF maintained that the higher inflation will likely be temporary and should fall to 2% before 2027. Britain’s expansion in H1 2025 leads to an upward revision of its GDP IMF Growth Projections for 2025 🇺🇸 US: 2.0% 🇩🇪 Germany: 0.2% 🇫🇷 France: 0.7% 🇪🇸 Spain: 2.9% 🇬🇧 UK: 1.3% 🇨🇳 China: 4.8% 🇯🇵 Japan: 1.1% 🇮🇳 India: 6.6% 🇷🇺 Russia: 0.6% 🇧🇷 Brazil: 2.4% 🇸🇦 Saudi Arabia: 4.0% 🇳🇬 Nigeria: 3.9% https://t.co/bbUb7LaE1v pic.twitter.com/pmeQ51geOW — IMF (@IMFNews) October 14, 2025 Britain’s economic growth stands at 1.3% for this year and the next, amid the heightened global trade tensions this year from President Donald Trump’s new tariffs. The IMF will be holding its annual meetings in the U.S. this week, where British Finance Minister Rachel Reeves and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey will be attending and discussing how the world is adjusting to the changes in global trade. The UK’s growth rate is expected to be the third-fastest in the Group of Seven advanced economies for 2026, behind the U.S. and Canada. The IMF attributed the upward revision to Britain’s 2025 growth to strong expansion in the first half of the year. “This is the second consecutive upgrade to this year’s growth forecast from the IMF. But I know this is just the start. For too many people, our economy feels stuck.” -Rachel Reeves, Minister of Finance of the UK. The IMF also updated its global forecast, which overall showed slightly less of an impact on the G7 economies than was highly anticipated due to the ongoing tariffs from the U.S. Global GDP is expected to rise to 3.2% from 3% predicted at the last update in July, while next year’s global growth rate forecast remains unchanged at 3.1%. The IMF mentioned that, to date, protectionist trade measures have had a limited impact on economic activity and prices. It stated that Trump’s levies were less extreme than expected and that their impact was mitigated by companies and households front-loading their consumption to avoid the impact. The Fund pointed to Brexit’s slowdown in economic growth as evidence that the impact of the change in global trade policies may take time to be reflected in investment decisions. According to the report, the UK’s economic growth continued to surge in the period immediately after its exit from the European Union. It only began falling steadily at the beginning of 2018. Immigration crackdown threatens global economic growth outlook The IMF believes that the U.S. and the UK’s immigration crackdown could disrupt the global outlook. It argued that the crackdown has stretched valuations in stock markets, as the impact of the tariffs is only now beginning to be felt in the economy. The Trump administration has intensified its stance on immigration in the U.S., which the IMF forecasts could result in a decline of around 0.3% to 0.7% in U.S. economic growth. The Fund also expects an increase in inflation in the worst-affected industries in the U.S., especially certain sectors where immigrants form a large portion of the labour force, such as construction, hospitality, personal services, and farm work. The IMF maintained that the resilience from trade-related disruptions in some economic data causes the outlook for the global economy to continue pointing to dim prospects. It also highlights more stringent immigration policies in several countries as a cause for concern regarding future GDP growth. The WEO report also echoed a speech by Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the IMF, warning of the risks of a correction in share prices and a downturn in investment if the market overestimates the likely gains from generative AI. The IMF stated that the stretched valuations in the stock market have surprisingly not deterred investors amid the recent policy turmoil.

The company plans to list its native $TRUE token in Q4 2025 on top-tier centralized and decentralized exchanges. From Game Studio to Web3 Ecosystem Founded in 2019, TRUE LABS has built a reputation for provably fair games and transparent mechanics. With 60+ titles integrated across 1,700 partner platforms, it’s one of the few gaming companies entering Web3 from a position of real market traction rather than speculation. Its next phase, TRUE WORLD, connects every TRUE LABS game under one system of shared progress and rewards. Achievements, levels, and collectibles carry across games, forming a unified player identity powered by $TRUE. “Play Like a Legend. Live Like a Legend. Be TRUE,” said CEO Dan Andrianov , teasing the project’s core philosophy. $TRUE Token Listing: Web3 Rewards Built on Real Demand Play-to-earn tokens have come and gone, often collapsing once incentives dried up. TRUE LABS’ approach is different: $TRUE is tied to existing demand from millions of active players who already spend within the ecosystem. The token fuels everything inside TRUE WORLD — from in-game upgrades and crafting to tournaments, events, and cross-platform loyalty rewards. Its design is also deflationary. Each time players craft or upgrade assets, part of the token supply is burned. In addition, TRUE LABS plans to buy back $TRUE on the open market, using a portion of its real-world revenue — and then burn it again. That makes the token’s scarcity directly tied to the company’s business performance, not market hype. TRUE LABS Telegram Mini-App and TRUE Wallet TRUE LABS already runs its own Web3 infrastructure. The TRUE Wallet, embedded in Telegram, mobile apps, and in-game systems, lets users hold and spend crypto without ever touching seed phrases or MetaMask. Over 500,000 wallets have been created so far — not as an experiment, but as part of live products. The wallet supports Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, and Solana, with TON integration coming next, and includes KYC and GDPR compliance for reward redemptions. That means when $TRUE launches, there’s already a functioning economy and a verified user base ready to transact. Scale and Credibility Rare in Web3 Gaming Most blockchain game projects start with a white paper. TRUE LABS starts with players, revenue, and a license. Its existing partnerships give it reach that most GameFi startups can only aim for, and its move on-chain adds the missing layer of transparency — every transaction, upgrade, and reward can be verified on the blockchain. This combination of scale, trust, and transparency gives TRUE LABS an edge in a sector still struggling to bridge Web2 audiences with Web3 mechanics. Why the $TRUE Listing Matters The upcoming $TRUE listing could be one of the most significant Web3 gaming launches of the year. For the gaming community, it’s a step toward real interoperability and digital ownership. For crypto investors, it’s a signal that blockchain gaming is moving beyond speculation into sustainable, revenue-backed models. The Bottom Line TRUE LABS is extending a working business onto the blockchain. With millions of players, hundreds of partners, and a live wallet ecosystem, the $TRUE token launch in late October 2025 marks a rare case where Web3 meets proven product-market fit.

The meme coin has slumped to multi-month lows as market participants sold the news on US-China trade war escalations. For smart money, the sell-off appears to have been a prehemptive move. According to Nansen data , large PEPE holders offloaded 1.5 trillion coins in the two weeks leading up to the crash. Top 100 PEPE whale holdings over the past week. Source: Nanasen. This de-risking has only persisted despite a rebound this week, with whale holdings still trending lower, suggesting expectations of further downside and a better buy-the-dip opportunity ahead. PEPE Coin Price Prediction: How Much Further Could Pepe Fall? While it’s unlikely whales acted early on the news, two bearish chart patterns likely informed their move to reduced exposure. The most recent, a 6-month descending triangle, marked the start of last week’s sell-off after breaking below its lower support at $0.000009. PEPE / USDT 1-day chart, descending triangle feeds a head-and-shoulders breakdown. Source: TradingView. This breakdown feeds into the second, broader head-and-shoulders pattern spanning the past year and a half. Fully realized, the setup targets a 40% decline toward the late-2024 market bottom at $0.0000046. A credible scenario, as momentum indicators suggest the Pepe coin price downtrend still has strength. The RSI has faltered in a push back towards the neutral line, while the MACD histogram keeps a wide gap below the signal line, suggesting sellers still control the wider trend. Much like in 2024, however, late-year U.S. interest rate cuts have the potential to stimulate demand for risk assets running into 2026. This could be a bear trap for the wider PEPE bull run. Still, much like in 2024, late-year U.S. interest rate cuts could stimulate risk appetite heading into 2026. If so, this downturn may yet prove a bear trap in the wider PEPE price bull run. This could be the play Smart money is positioning for. PepeNode: The Next Pepe Iteration is Gaining Traction? Much like Dogecoin’s success sparked a wave of inspired-by coins, this cycle has seen Pepe take center stage as one of crypto’s biggest cultural moments. Feeding off that social momentum, its new offshoot PepeNode ($PEPENODE) is adding something the original never had: real passive income. It’s happened before; Shiba Inu gave Doge staking, but PepeNode goes a step further with a fresh mine-to-earn model, bringing things in line with the current market. All the complexity usually tied to mining is stripped away. Just log in, acquire nodes, stack rigs, and start earning rewards across proven meme coins. The stats look solid too. The presale has already exceeded $1.8 million, while early stakers are still earning up to 706% APY. And with 70% of all $PEPENODE spent on nodes and rigs burned, scarcity is built directly into the system, helping support long-term value growth. The timing couldn’t be better. Visit the Official Website Here The macro narrative is driving capital back into risk assets like meme coins—making PepeNode’s rewards and model even stronger as momentum builds across the sector.

In 2027, SUI will range between $10.47 and $12.10, with an average price of $10.83. In 2030, it will range between $33.01 and $40.39, with an average price of $34.20. Is SUI a good investment? Will it go up? Where will it be in five years? Our SUI price prediction answers these questions and more.

Its trading volume dropped by 14.78% to $2.21B in 24 hours, showing less trader conviction. Data from DefiLlama revealed that SUI’s Total Value Locked ( TVL ) in decentralized applications rose by 4.62% to $2.138 billion in 24 hours. SUI 1-day chart analysis SUIUSD chart by TradingView SUI has remained bearish since mid-August, having faced resistance at $4. Last weekend, it dipped below $0.60 following a tariff announcement by US President Donald Trump. It quickly corrected to its current levels at $2.70. The coin now trades below major moving averages. SUI 4-hour chart analysis SUIUSD chart by TradingView SUI has turned neutral on this timeframe, as shown by the MACD histogram (0.027). Its RSI value at 44.20 shows neutral sentiment. It is oversold when the value drops below 30. The William Alligator trendlines are converging, a telling sign for falling volatility.

According to the technical indicators, SUI has recorded 16 bullish days in the last thirty, but the general market sentiment remained bearish. The charts also show that it has support at $3.22. Its volatility and momentum are dropping. Why is SUI down? SUI’s dip stems from crypto-wide risk aversion, technical breakdowns, and post-liquidation fragility – though strong token locks and institutional deals (e.g., Mill City Ventures’ $450M allocation) provide long-term ballast. Recent news Sui will unlock 43,960,000 SUI tokens on November 1st, constituting approximately 1.21% of the currently circulating supply. Will SUI reach $10? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, SUI will reach $10 in 2027, with an average of $10.83 for the year. Will SUI reach $100? It remains unlikely that SUI will rise to $100 before 2031. Will SUI reach $1,000? It remains unlikely that SUI will rise to $1,000 before 2031. How high can Sui go? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, SUI will rise as high as $8 before the end of 2025. Is SUI crypto a good investment? Should the market sentiment change, SUI will rise to its previous highs. SUI’s price predictions for 2031 are optimistic as the global adoption of decentralized applications rises.

Tips & Strategy for Football Crypto Betting in 2025 Manage bankroll and hedge — Don’t overleverage on favorites; use props or live markets to balance risk. Compare crypto vs fiat odds — Sometimes crypto users get slightly better lines or reduced margin. Watch the promotion fine print — Some bonuses have high rollover or require specific cryptocurrencies. Stay updated on coin volatility — Large price swings in crypto can affect your net gains/losses. Use sites with fast payouts — A key advantage of crypto betting is speed; pick sportsbooks that honor that. Check market depth for smaller leagues — If you bet on lower divisions, not all platforms support deep prop markets there.

In 2025, Web3 platforms are setting a new standard for fairness, flexibility, and transparency.

President Donald Trump’s shift in tone on trade with China — from confrontation to conciliation — stunned analysts and traders alike, sparking a sharp rally across equities and cryptocurrencies. Among the biggest movers was XRP, whose rapid rebound became a focal point for retail traders and commentators. A Sudden Policy Pivot The spark came when President Trump, after announcing 100% tariffs on Chinese imports earlier in October, appeared to temper his rhetoric. Speaking on Friday, he signaled a willingness to “work things out” with Beijing — a dramatic change from the previous escalation language. By Monday’s open, U.S. markets had reversed course: the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged more than 430 points in early trading, while the Nasdaq climbed over 400. President Trump Shocks Crypto! Shocks XRP Holders! He Is Changing Direction! Wow! pic.twitter.com/mkBXeDGpQv — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) October 13, 2025 According to financial outlets including Reuters and Bloomberg, the rebound reflected traders’ relief that a full-blown trade war might be avoided. The broader crypto market responded in kind, with the total market capitalization rising nearly 4% to about $3.9 trillion. Austin Hilton’s Take on the Market Reaction Popular crypto commentator Austin Hilton captured the moment in a video shared on X, describing it as “a significant change of events.” Hilton highlighted XRP’s sharp intraday movement, noting that the token was up nearly 9% as of his recording. “Trump changes direction — quite frankly shocks everybody,” he remarked, tying the rally directly to the president’s softened tone on China. Hilton’s clip quickly spread across social media, encapsulating what many traders were feeling: a mix of surprise, relief, and renewed confidence in crypto markets’ resilience to macro turbulence. His commentary also emphasized how quickly XRP rebounded after dipping, a move he described as a “buy-the-dip opportunity” amid the market’s rapid turnaround. Verifying the Price Action While Hilton’s on-screen chart showed XRP wicking briefly to around $1.25 before bouncing back, verified exchange data presents a slightly different picture. Market aggregates from CoinMarketCap and Binance recorded XRP’s lowest prints near $1.69, with a swift recovery to between $2.3 and $2.8 during the same session. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 That level of intraday volatility is still notable but not as extreme as initially portrayed in some retail feeds. This discrepancy underscores an important lesson: in fast-moving markets, individual trading dashboards can display temporary price spikes or feed errors that differ from official aggregated data. Cross-checking multiple exchange sources remains the best way to separate signal from noise. Why This Matters for XRP Holders The episode reinforces how tightly crypto markets are linked to global macro narratives. From Federal Reserve decisions to trade policy shifts, digital assets like XRP react swiftly to changes in investor sentiment. Trump’s more measured stance reduced immediate risk aversion, encouraging capital to flow back into speculative sectors — crypto included. For XRP holders, the takeaway is clear: politics can move markets, but disciplined analysis should guide trading decisions. Austin Hilton’s coverage captured the raw emotion of the moment, while verified market data paints the full picture of measured yet meaningful price action. Trump’s shift didn’t just steady Wall Street — it reignited optimism across the digital asset landscape, reminding traders that even one presidential statement can send shockwaves through the crypto economy.

Various key metrics have increased by 400% in the past two years. Token Terminal shared some of the metrics on X. USDT achieved a monthly transfer volume of $580.9 billion on the Ethererun chain. The total transfer count is 12.5 million. Or in other words, traders have exchanged USD on Ethereum 12.5 million times. Ethereum proved once again that it’s the master chain for DeFi activities. As the biggest stablecoin in the crypto market, USDT powers DeFi transactions and caters to whales and institutions. USDT dominates stablecoins on Ethereum USDT has a market cap of $180.64 billion based on data from DeFiLlama. The total amount of USDT coins circulating at the moment is $180.122 billion, while the unreleased amount of coins is $6.825 billion. Ethereum has 44.46% o f to tal USDT coins circulating in all blockchains. This amounts to 80.081 billion USDT coins available on-chain right now. Tron ranks second with 77.322 billion USDT. Binance Smart Chain (BSC) follows in third place with 8.982 billion USDT, far behind the top two networks. Plasma (XPL) ranks fourth with 5.02 billion, and Solana takes fifth place with 2.335 billion USDT in circulation. Tether has minted $1 billion USDT coins on Ethereum, less than 24 hours ago. Injecting fresh liquidity of stablecoins in the crypto market usually indicates preparation for upcoming demand, which simply means more buying orders. USDT usage on Ethereum is at an all-time high, with key metrics up ~400% from Sep '23 lows. Monthly transfer volume in September was $580.9 billion & transfer count 12.5 million. At a ~$500 billion valuation, @Tether_to is the most valuable business building on @ethereum . pic.twitter.com/Z83e68NO8C — Token Terminal 📊 (@tokenterminal) October 13, 2025 Tether survives the last market crash Tether stayed resilient during Friday’s market crash. Unlike other coins that lost their peg, Tether’s USDT remained stable and ready to serve traders on both DEXs and CEXs, absorbing massive market liquidations. Cryptopolitan reported earlier that Ethena’s synthetic dollar, USDe, had depegged on Binance, falling to $0.66. Paolo Ardoino , fo under of Tether, took to X and wrote about the recent market crash. He said, “USDT is the best collateral for derivatives and margin trading.” Ardoino also took a jab at poor liquidity, saying, “If you use as collateral low liquidity tokens, some bananas, a horse, 3 olives and a chewed bubblegum, then brace yourself when market moves.” Tether’s USDT is backed by US dollars, US treasury notes, and other reserve assets such as Bitcoin, gold, and secured loans. The versatility in its backing gives USDT an advantage over other stablecoins. Ardoino revealed earlier that Tether uses part of its revenue to purchase Bitcoin and gold. This strategy strengthens Tether’s reserves and diversifies its balance sheet. Though users can transfer USDT without paying any fees, Tether still earns money in other ways. It collects fees for minting and redeeming USDT coins, receives payments from exchange partners, and charges small fees for using USDT on some blockchains, such as Tron. Tether’s revenue comes from investing in reserves that back its stablecoin USDT. Last year, the company reported a profit of $13 billion. Tether profited $5.7 billion in the first half of this year.

The decentralized compute startup quietly closed Q3 2025 with record traction: $4.34 million in cumulative revenue, more than 83K nodes under management , and over 18 Petabytes of bandwidth processed , all achieved with a lean team and outside the silo of crypto hype cycles. Built at the intersection of AI and Web3 , NodeOps has become the silent backbone behind the rise of autonomous infrastructure. Its Q3 Report details the launch of GPU orchestration, the Template Marketplace , and AI-powered deployment engine Autogen , which drew over 300 developer sign-ups in its first 24 hours . “We don’t out-market; we out-build,” said Naman Kabra, CEO of NodeOps. “Our strength is execution. Every number in this report is on-chain, verifiable, and earned.” The company’s first Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) feature introduced enterprise-grade data durability to decentralized compute, while the NodeOps Portal unified staking, governance, and liquidity management for $NODE holders. Partnerships deepened across both technical and institutional fronts— Gaianet , HyperSpace , and Gensyn on AI and compute collaboration; Blockchain Builders Fund , Bankless Ventures , and Coinlist on market expansion. Reliability remained unmatched: NodeOps ’ oldest validator has run over 400,000 consecutive blocks without a single miss, a two-year streak few networks can claim. “The ecosystem has louder names and bigger valuations,” added Pratik Balar, CTO. “But we’re quietly powering them. The underdog advantage is focus—no noise, just throughput.” With its upcoming AI Cloud stack , NodeOps aims to make decentralized infrastructure as intuitive as modern DevOps and as autonomous as AI agents. The mission is clear: build the layer that lets builders run smarter, faster, and freer. Major Q3 Milestones GPU Offering & Template Marketplace — Introduced a one-click GPU deployment system with 437 active templates , 2,263 deployments , and contributions from 20 developers , making decentralized compute accessible for AI and high-performance workloads. Autogen Launch — Rolled out an AI-powered deployment engine enabling developers to deploy directly from GitHub or Docker. Over 300 developers signed up within 24 hours of launch, signaling strong demand for intelligent infrastructure automation. Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) — Implemented enterprise-grade data persistence, ensuring user data remains intact even if templates are deleted or redeployed. Business Development — Expanded partnerships with Babylon , Gaianet , HyperSpace , and Gensyn on the technical front, alongside institutional alliances with Blockchain Builders Fund , Bankless Ventures , and Coinlist — reinforcing NodeOps’ position as the infrastructure bridge between AI and decentralized compute. Network Performance — NodeOps processed over 18 petabytes of bandwidth in Q3, executed 17,000 code commits , maintained 58,000 CI minutes , and achieved a zero-block miss record over 407,000 consecutive blocks on its oldest validator.

The project introduces a clear, rules-based mechanism that reduces and burns portions of the token supply on a periodic basis when the price of gold rises—aiming to set itself apart in a crowded meme-coin landscape through transparency, repeatable token mechanics, and community governance. “Meme culture thrives on creativity and shared experiences,” said the founder of FIATXGOLD “Our community asked for a project that’s fun, open, and structured. We’ve responded with a simple framework: when gold’s reference price increases over defined intervals, we execute a pre-disclosed burn of a portion of the token supply. That’s it. No financial promises—just a transparent, community-oriented experiment.” How the Mechanism Works Reference Benchmark: The project uses a publicly available gold price benchmark (daily appreciation of active Gold Futures contract) to assess directional movement over predefined periods. Periodic Review: At scheduled checkpoints, if the benchmark reflects an increase versus the prior checkpoint, the developer initiates a manual token burn from the eligible supply pool, pursuant to parameters detailed in the whitepaper. Transparent Rules: All parameters—burn percentages, frequency, thresholds, and data sources—are published on the community X page for public review before activation and are subject to community input via governance. Community Oversight: Proposal and voting mechanics enable community members to suggest adjustments to operational parameters. Any changes are disclosed prior to implementation. What This Project Is—and Is Not Entertainment & Community: FIATXGOLD is a community entertainment project inspired by internet culture. The value proposition is participation, creativity, and transparent mechanics, not financial returns. No Investment Product: FIATXGOLD is not an investment product. It does not offer, solicit, or market securities or any form of investment contract. No Promises or Expectations of Profit: The team does not promise profits, yields, or appreciation. Token price is market-driven and outside the team’s control. Open Information: Documentation, smart-contract addresses, and governance processes are published so participants can independently evaluate how the system works. Commitment to Responsible Participation The team encourages anyone engaging with the project to do so for entertainment purposes only. Participation should be discretionary and based on personal interest in the meme culture and technical experiment. Users are urged to review the documentation, understand the inherent volatility of digital tokens, and comply with applicable laws in their jurisdiction. “FIATXGOLD is intentionally simple,” added the community Developer. “The supply-burn rule is transparent and tied to an external reference, but it is not designed to engineer returns. Our job is to publish clear rules, open our process to community feedback, and let the experiment speak for itself.” Roadmap & Transparency Public Docs: A plain-language overview and a technical specification detail the supply-burn process, the gold price reference methodology, and governance procedures. See website. Audits & Reviews: The team intends to pursue independent reviews or audits of smart contracts where applicable and publish results to maximize community trust. Follow us on X.

No Offering of Securities: Tokens associated with FIATXGOLD are not intended to be, and should not be construed as, securities or any other regulated financial instrument.

About FIATXGOLD FIATXGOLD is a community-driven meme coin experiment focused on transparent, rules-based token mechanics and participatory governance. By linking a periodic supply-burn rule to movements in a publicly referenced gold price, the project seeks to offer a novel, entertainment-focused experience in the meme-coin space without promising financial outcomes.
