Cryptos like Solana (SOL), continuing to churn out top performance based on the powerhouse speed of its architecture and the ever-growing ranks of its developer community, are continuously beset by levels of market volatility within their core support regions. Such market dynamics have proven effective in encouraging market participants to seek out the high-asymmetric opportunity of burgeoning new crypto beyond the core market leaders. It’s within such a market context that the extraordinarily rapid momentum of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) must now be noted. At $0.035 per token, now in the 6th presale phase already sold out in excess of 95%, the token has been adopted by over 18,250 individual market participants who together have collectively raised in excess of $19.02 million. Mutuum Finance is quickly emerging as the top crypto to buy for investors seeking early exposure to high-upside DeFi projects. Solana Builds Bullish Momentum in the Form of a Falling Wedge At the moment, the Solana (SOL) market is respecting its falling wedge pattern in remarkable fashion, as buyers continue to make their presences felt along the lower line of the wedge. This particular indicator of reversal in the market appears to suggest that the market may very well be building steam in secret. Once a breakout past the top line of the wedge is achieved, it might very well mark the beginning of the end for the current bear market. However, pending the validation of the larger breakout by further follow-through on higher levels, it also naturally widens its focus on the likes of Mutuum Finance performing equally vigorously in the market, solidifying its status as a top crypto to buy. MUTM Presale Sees Strong Demand Before Phase 7 Mutuum Finance appears to be the new crypto that investors are closely watching for 2025. The presale event that is still ongoing has recorded over 18,250 participants who collectively raised more than $19.02 million. Phase 6 is over 90% complete, offering tokens at $0.035 compared to the initial $0.01 in Phase 1. When the presale enters Phase 7, the token price will increase by 20%, approaching the expected price on the exchange for listing at $0.06 per token. Noting the increasing use of the platform along with the rising token prices, MUTM appears to represent an attractive new crypto opportunity for early adopters targeting double-digit profits in the proliferating DeFi market. Strategic Project Positioning and Platform Fundamentals One of the major milestones in the roadmap of the Mutuum Finance project is the creation of an over-collateralized stablecoin. This is expected to ensure constant liquidity in the system along with stable loan and borrow transactions. Additionally, the implementation of the layer 2 network will make the process of trading quicker and more economical. The dual-lending system of Mutuum Finance brings together lenders, borrowers, and liquidators in one platform through its flexible DeFi credit market. Additionally, the system allows its users to either lend through variable rates of interest or fixed rates of interest in instances where the market is experiencing market volatility. MUTM is recognized for its high utility DeFi token. With the current fundraising of $19.02 million from 18,250+ contributors and selling over 95% of Phase 6 at $0.035 per token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is soon going to be one of the top crypto to buy in the market. Its V1 launch soon in the market along with its dual-lending DeFi model puts it ahead in the competition against the top layer-1 blockchains such as Solana. Take part in the presale of the official Mutuum Finance now, as this new crypto is shaping up to be a pivotal investment for 2025.

According to company statements and law enforcement sources, about 44.5 billion Korean won — roughly $32 million — vanished in the incident that surfaced late November 2025. Upbit paused deposits and withdrawals and said it would repay affected users from its own reserves. Suspected North Korean Ties Based on reports from investigators and industry watchers, authorities are examining links to the Lazarus Group, a cyber unit long tied to North Korea. Security teams point to methods similar to earlier attacks attributed to the same group, including a major breach in 2019 that took 342,000 ETH from the exchange. Officials say the pattern of rapid withdrawals, quick cross-chain transfers, and spreading funds across many wallets matches tactics used in past nation-linked operations. today south korea blamed north korea for the upbit hacknice headlinebut that part came later so what actually happened? an unknown attacker drained a few of upbit’s hot walletswaited a bitthen started moving funds across chains at some point the hacker bridged usdc from… pic.twitter.com/swq8yjIOLR — trix (@trixwtb) November 28, 2025 How The Funds Were Moved Reports have disclosed that the stolen tokens were moved off Solana, converted through several bridges, and routed through multiple chains to make tracking harder. Transfers happened fast and in many small transactions, which complicates tracing attempts on the blockchain. Blockchain analysts are combing transaction histories, but the bridge conversions and mixing steps slow down any straightforward recovery efforts. On-Site Checks And Ongoing Forensics Authorities have launched inspections at Upbit’s systems and are reviewing logs, admin access records, and wallet backups. According to sources close to the probe, investigators suspect an admin credential compromise or impersonation rather than a simple software flaw in Upbit’s servers. While evidence is still being gathered, forensic teams are looking for the entry point used to sign the withdrawal transactions and any indicators of outside control. Investigation And Market Impact The timing of the theft drew attention because it coincided with corporate news: Upbit’s parent, Dunamu, had public talk of a merger with Naver valued at about $10.3 billion. Market players noted the coincidence, and some suggested the attack could aim to distract or unsettle stakeholders. For investors, exchanges, and regulators, the incident renews calls for stricter custody controls, better separation of hot and cold wallets, and clearer rules for large crypto platforms. Yonhap News reports that South Korea’s largest crypto exchange, Upbit, suffered a hack worth about 44.5 billion KRW ($32 million). Authorities are investigating whether North Korea’s Lazarus Group was behind the attack. The group was also linked to Upbit’s 2019 theft of 58… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 28, 2025 Upbit has pledged full reimbursement to users hit by the theft and says it will share findings when the probe allows. Based on reports, tracing and recovery work is ongoing but will be slow because of how the assets were fragmented and moved across chains. Watchers say confirmation of Lazarus involvement would mark another example of how state-linked actors continue to target major crypto firms. Authorities have not yet publicly released a definitive attribution. The next steps to watch include any formal statements from prosecutors, whether any of the moved funds are frozen or returned, and how regulators will respond to reduce the chance of similar losses.

From tokenized bonds and money market funds to institutional liquidity rails, the world’s capital is beginning to migrate to an ecosystem where transactions are programmable, auditable, and borderless. Why Is Ethereum Chosen As The Default Choice For Global Rails The global capital markets are moving on-chain to Ethereum because it is credibly neutral. ETH has never experienced downtime, and it possesses the economic security necessary to support the world’s financial system. Investor and founder of GM42NFT, Captain GM, has stated that ETH is not fast enough to support trading because it wasn’t built for it. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Falls 25% But On-Chain Data and Institutional Staking Signal Q4 Recovery Potential However, the attempts to build a genuinely fast on-chain trading environment have consistently led teams to centralize significant parts of the trading system. This move creates security, reliability, and neutrality concerns for a system designed to be global. These compromises are in direct conflict with the very benefits that ETH provides, and make it the chosen blockchain for global finance. This is where Raya Network steps in to solve these issues at the core. Raya is delivering a decentralized exchange (DEX) with institutional-grade execution speed and Ethereum-level security. It’s a platform that is as fast as TradFi and remains simultaneously secure, reliable, and credibly neutral as exactly DeFi should be. “Fast is easy, decentralized is hard, and it’s only Reya that does both,” Captain GM noted. Analyst Alucard mentioned that the Raya network has become one of the few projects that genuinely solves the speed and security problem. The sub-millisecond execution speeds, trades are fully verified on ETH, and there’s no dependence on a single sequencer. This is an engineered combination designed for real progress in the space. However, over 45% of the token supply is allocated to the community. Reya, combined with the ETH buyback mechanism, creates an ecosystem that’s aligned both technically and economically. They’re building something fast and secure, and because of that, Reya sits in a different category. Why Reya’s Design Feels More Like A New Standard Than Another DEX A trader and ambassador of Somnia, Onur, has also explained that his experience with Reya feels like a full redesign of on-chain execution rather than a small improvement. It offers sub-millisecond fills, unified margin, Ethereum security with ZK settlement, and smooth flow through EigenDA. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Attempts Fresh Recovery as Bullish Pressure Builds According to Onur, the peer-to-pool model keeps trades consistent, efficient, and free from bottlenecks or hidden edges. As a result of this approach, Reya isn’t just another venue anymore, and it’s actively becoming the new execution standard for DeFi.

While bulls have regained some ground, selling pressure is still dominating sentiment, and speculation about the start of a new bear market continues to grow. Many analysts warn that the recent bounce may not be enough to shift the broader trend unless stronger demand returns. Related Reading: XRP Reserves On Binance Collapse To Record Lows: Investors Move Toward Long-Term Holding According to fresh data from Darkfost, short-term stress among investors has eased slightly. The amount of BTC sent to exchanges at a loss has dropped sharply, now sitting around 11,600 BTC—significantly lower than the extreme 67,000 BTC capitulation spike recorded on November 22nd. This decline suggests that panic-driven selling may be cooling off, giving the market a temporary moment of stabilization. However, despite this improvement, Bitcoin still faces strong headwinds. Investors remain cautious, liquidity conditions are tight, and macro uncertainty continues to weigh on risk assets. For now, BTC must hold above the $90K region and show sustained strength to avoid renewed downside pressure. The coming sessions may determine whether this rebound marks the start of recovery—or just a pause before another leg lower. Short-Term Holders Face a Critical Decision Point Darkfost adds that the amount of BTC in profit being sent to exchanges by short-term holders remains relatively low at around 9,500 BTC. However, a slight increase has appeared as Bitcoin climbed back above $90K, showing that some STHs have begun testing the market to secure small gains or reduce their exposure. This subtle shift highlights a growing tension among recent buyers, who must choose between waiting for a full return to break even or selling now to minimize further losses. This situation creates a delicate environment. Even though selling pressure has eased, STHs remain highly sensitive to small price movements, and their behavior often dictates short-term market direction. The past few days have been unusually calm compared to the violent capitulation seen earlier in the month, and that calmness is actually constructive. It suggests that panic has temporarily subsided and the market is trying to find balance. What becomes critical now is monitoring how STHs react as Bitcoin approaches their realized price. If they hold and confidence increases, BTC could gain enough stability to push higher. If they sell aggressively, renewed downside pressure could quickly return. The next move from this cohort will likely set the tone for the coming weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Still Negative: US Institutions Keep Selling Despite Easing Pressure Bitcoin Attempts Recovery But Faces Heavy Overhead Resistance Bitcoin’s daily chart shows the asset attempting a recovery after reaching a capitulation low near $80K, but the structure remains fragile. Price has reclaimed the $90K area, yet momentum is limited as BTC trades below the 50-day and 100-day moving averages—both of which continue sloping downward, signaling sustained bearish pressure. The 200-day moving average sits higher, reinforcing the broader downtrend that has formed since early October’s $126K peak. Recent candles reflect a hesitant rebound: upward wicks show sellers defending every push toward $92K–$94K, while the tight body ranges highlight indecision. Volume has cooled significantly compared with the panic-driven sell-off earlier in November, suggesting that forced selling has eased but strong buy-side conviction is still missing. Related Reading: Major Bitcoin LTH Sell-Off Signals Cycle Exhaustion as Supply Drops to 13.6M BTC Structurally, BTC remains below key resistance clusters formed during its previous consolidation. Reclaiming these zones will be essential for invalidating the bearish trend. Until then, every bounce risks becoming a lower high within a broader corrective structure. On the downside, the $85K–$87K region remains the most important support. A breakdown below it could reopen the path toward deeper corrective targets. For now, Bitcoin is attempting to stabilize, but bulls must reclaim higher levels soon to shift market sentiment and avoid renewed downside pressure.

CME confirmed that trading stopped because of a cooling system malfunction at the CyrusOne-operated facility in Aurora, a site that has served as the backbone of CME’s Globex electronic markets for nearly two decades. Due to a cooling issue at CyrusOne data centers, our markets are currently halted. Support is working to resolve the issue in the near term and will advise clients of Pre-Open details as soon as they are available. — CME Group (@CMEGroup) November 28, 2025 The exchange restored full functionality at 1:30 p.m. UTC on Friday, but the interruption had already rippled through Asia and Europe, where participants were dealing with thin post-Thanksgiving liquidity. CME Outage on Thin Thanksgiving Liquidity Sparks Questions From Traders During the outage, traders across asset classes—equities, currencies, commodities, energy, and crypto—reported being unable to close or adjust positions, a scenario that several described as a “nightmare.” One stock trader, Timothy Bozman, publicly accused CME of allowing a “simple issue” to cripple the entire futures complex, questioning how all major markets could be taken offline by a single point of failure. Manipulation at it's best. How in the actual $&#@ could the entire Index Futures, FX Futures, Metals futures, Energy Futures, Agriculture Futures markets and options be halted because of a server overheating. A simple issue could take down @CMEGroup entire futures platform? pic.twitter.com/ZwvDJ4WImy — Timothy Bozman (@MrAmazingBoz) November 28, 2025 Others went further, suggesting that the timing was “too convenient,” given that the halt arrived during the low-volume Asia session on Thanksgiving, when sudden price moves can unfold with limited resistance. Some traders pointed out that silver futures were approaching a record high near $54 just minutes before prices froze, adding fuel to the speculation and frustration. The outage was widespread because the Globex platform handles the majority of CME’s volume. An earlier cryptonews report stated that crude and palm oil markets stopped moving during the halt, while crypto traders saw Bitcoin and Ethereum futures go offline entirely. The timing added complexity for firms preparing month-end rolls, particularly those needing to adjust Treasury futures or SOFR-linked positions Several traders later noted that even after markets reopened, delays continued in Treasury futures and certain rate products. Trading activity had already been muted due to the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, but the outage further slowed an already quiet session. Official communication from CME Group on their website has been posted. It’s officially ruled as a technical halt. Carry on. I’d expect your prop firm to cancel losses for any stuck trades but we’ll see. $NQ $GC $ES pic.twitter.com/kknVpFj7Hj — KD (@KingDipsX) November 28, 2025 One user on X publicly urged CME to cancel losses for trades affected during the freeze, reflecting the broader anxiety of traders locked into moving markets with no ability to act. CME Suffers Major Outage as It Prepares Shift to 24/7 Crypto Trading in 2026 CyrusOne, which operates more than 55 data centers globally and is backed by KKR and BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners, confirmed the cooling malfunction. The Aurora facility is well-known among high-frequency trading firms that place servers as physically close as possible to CME’s matching engines to shave off microseconds. The exchange acknowledged that CME Direct, a platform used for some markets, remained unavailable even after Globex reopened, showing the extent of the disruption. The incident lasted far longer than a similar 2019 CME outage, and it was the latest reminder of how centralized infrastructure can pose systemic risk in electronic markets. CME has faced technical issues in the past, including a 2014 outage triggered by a software malfunction affecting agricultural contracts. Despite the friction, markets resumed and continued adjusting to broader price movements. Bitcoin futures, which closed on Wednesday at $90,355 before the holiday, reopened at $90,940 on Friday and pushed above $93,000 later in the session as BTC rebounded from its recent low of around $80,522. Source: Cryptonews Analysts noted that Bitcoin faces resistance near $95,000, but reclaiming that level could reopen the path toward six-figure territory. The blackout also comes at a moment when CME is expanding its role in the digital asset sector. In October, the exchange said it plans to move its cryptocurrency futures and options into a full 24/7 trading cycle starting in early 2026, subject to regulatory approval. The firm cited rapidly rising demand for continuous risk management in crypto markets, which never close. CME said trading will run nonstop on Globex, aside from a brief weekly maintenance window, and weekend transactions will be assigned to the next business day for clearing and settlement.

The setup formed with an initial peak in August, a higher high in September, and a lower high in November, signaling a possible trend reversal. After breaking below the neckline, the price has returned to this level. Current trading activity suggests that this area is acting as resistance. A failure to reclaim it may keep the downward trend in place. Chart projections show possible support levels near $30, $27, and $25. Analyst Ali Martinez stated , “Hyperliquid $HYPE is retesting the breakdown zone before a potential move toward $25.” At the same time, HYPE has bounced from the lower Bollinger Band near $30 and is moving toward the 20-day moving average at $37. This level remains an important test. A break above it may open the way toward $43, while a rejection could send the price back toward $31. Source: TradingView The MACD shows early signs of momentum turning. The MACD line has moved slightly above the signal line, and the histogram is shifting positive. However, both lines are still below zero, showing that the overall trend is not yet strong. For now, this points to short-term recovery potential but not a confirmed trend reversal. Bullish Scenario: A Recovery Path to $50? Analyst Make Sense shared a more optimistic view, noting that HYPE has shown early strength after a long period of weakness. They wrote, “$HYPE just formed its first solid rebound after a month of pressure.” According to their breakdown, reclaiming the $37–$38 area could trigger further upside. The next target zone sits at $41–$42, followed by a momentum shift around $44. If HYPE moves past that level, the next upside range is between $48 and $50, areas described as holding untested liquidity. Price action near the $36–$38 zone remains key. A strong move above could support further recovery, while a rejection may keep $25 in focus.

According to the model, all three altcoins could face an unusually turbulent December, with macroeconomic shifts and crypto-specific triggers determining whether prices soar or tumble. The broader crypto market has spent the past month in a sharp downturn following a heavy wave of Bitcoin selling, which dragged most major tokens lower. Bitcoin briefly touched a seven-month low near $82,000 last Friday. Despite the recent slump, long-term sentiment across the industry remains largely positive. Development activity on leading blockchains continues to accelerate, and high-resilience assets like XRP, Solana, and Cardano are still viewed as strong contenders for the next cycle. If market conditions calm, each could regain upward momentum. Below is KIMI AI’s breakdown of potential bullish and bearish scenarios for December. XRP (XRP): KIMI AI Expects a Possible Move Toward Either $10 or $2 Depending on December Sentiment KIMI AI’s bearish projection puts Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) at roughly $2.05 by Christmas, should broader market sentiment weaken, a decline of about 6% from its current price of around $2.18. Source: KIMI It would be an anticlimax to XRP’s impressive rally earlier this year, which sent the token to its first new all-time high in seven years, hitting $3.65 in July following Ripple’s major legal victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. XRP has spent several months consolidating inside multiple bullish flag patterns that didn’t result in a breakout. Its relative strength index (RSI) hovers near 50, and the token gained around 15% over the past seven days. If conditions turn favorable, KIMI’s bullish target for XRP stretches to $10. The SEC’s recent approval of nine spot XRP ETFs may catalyze institutional demand, mirroring earlier responses to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF launches. Additional ETF rollouts are likely to follow. Ongoing regulatory clarification or new high-profile partnerships may set the stage for XRP to approach double-digit valuations by 2026. Solana (SOL): KIMI’s Bear Case Targets $30, While a Bull Run Could Push SOL up 450% Solana ($SOL) remains one of 2025’s most heavily used blockchains, currently securing nearly $9 billion in total value locked and maintaining a market cap of roughly $76.6 billion. Both developer activity and network utilization continue to grow rapidly. New Solana ETFs from Bitwise and Grayscale generated early enthusiasm, with traders hoping for demand similar to earlier Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF rollouts. However, this momentum hasn’t prevented recent weakness. SOL slipped 4% in the last 24 hours to trade around $137, and if this trend persists, KIMI estimates a potential drop toward $30 under a deep market downturn. On the bullish side, KIMI AI projects Solana could surge to $750 within the next month, 450% up from current levels and around 2.5x its ATH of $293, set in January. SOL previously rallied to $250 in January before sliding to near $100 in April. While today’s price remains far below previous highs, technical indicators suggest SOL may be nearing a breakout from a bullish flag pattern. Growing interest in real-world asset tokenization, driven by major firms like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton experimenting with Solana, could lend weight to KIMI’s optimistic projection. Cardano (ADA): KIMI Forecasts a Potential 2,300% December Surge Cardano ($ADA) continues to hold a reputation as one of the most academically rigorous and research-driven projects in crypto. Founded by Ethereum co-creator Charles Hoskinson, Cardano emphasizes peer-reviewed development, security, scalability, and sustainability. With a market cap near $15 billion and $190 million in TVL on the network, Cardano remains a major player in the upper tier of layer-1 blockchains, supported by steady developer engagement and a growing ecosystem of decentralized applications. KIMI AI estimates ADA could rise to around $10 by early 2026, an astonishing 2,281% jump from its current price near $0.42 and more than triple its 2021 all-time high of $3.09. Analysts argue that Cardano’s strong fundamentals and consistent upgrades position it as a potential leader in the next DeFi-driven market cycle. However, KIMI’s bearish scenario warns ADA could fall to $0.18 if market conditions worsen, representing a drop of just over 50% for today’s holders. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A Fast-Growing Meme Coin Outside KIMI AI’s Forecast Models While KIMI anticipates that major altcoins may continue to struggle in the short term, presale tokens are still drawing substantial investor attention. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is one of the most talked-about new meme coins, raising nearly $4.2 million in its presale. Positioned as a degen descendant of Dogecoin, MAXI blends tongue-in-cheek humor with active community involvement. According to his lore, Maxi Doge spent years watching his distant cousin Dogecoin dominate the spotlight while grinding out trades in his mother’s basement, pumping weights, and biding his time as he prepared to take the crown. MAXI builds a competitive community culture through trading challenges, meme contests, and highly active social channels. As an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI benefits from strong scalability options, a mature ecosystem, and lower environmental impact, advantages not offered by Dogecoin’s legacy proof-of-work design. Staking rewards currently offer up to 73% APY, though yields will naturally decline as participation increases. The presale price is set at $0.0002705, with automatic increments scheduled through later funding rounds. Buyers can join using MetaMask or Best Wallet . Dogecoin stands no chance!

The asset eventually touched a seven-month low near $82,000 last Friday, a level many traders hope will mark the cycle’s floor. With BTC now holding above $90,000, traders are hoping for an optimistic Christmas month. Veteran crypto investors remain diamond-handed. Long-term optimists view Bitcoin’s pullback as a necessary breather after consecutive months of new all-time highs, a reset phase meant to flush out excess leverage, cool speculation, and lay the groundwork for Bitcoin’s next upward move. As Bitcoin’s dominance loosens and narrative control shifts across the sector, many analysts believe the next major bull surge will lean heavily on altcoins. For that reason, with prices still relatively low, now could be the best time to load up on XRP, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu. XRP (XRP): A Leading Contender for the Future of Global Money Movement Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) continues to anchor the digital payments landscape, boasting near-instant settlement speeds and minimal transaction costs. Its underlying network, the XRP Ledger, is frequently cited as a streamlined and modern alternative to legacy systems such as SWIFT. Ripple’s technology has been pointed out in reports from both the UN Capital Development Fund and the White House, while its growing roster of banking and fintech partners has helped XRP maintain a market capitalization of more than $132 billion. The debut of Ripple’s USD-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD, further showcases the company’s ambitions. Each RLUSD transaction burns a fraction of XRP, subtly tightening supply and linking XRP’s value to the expanding use of Ripple’s products. XRP has climbed 50% over the past year, ending six years of inertia and notching a fresh all-time high of $3.65 in July, while Bitcoin slipped 4% in the same period. With its Relative Strength Index hovering around 50 and the current price of $2.18 sitting just above the 30-day moving average, demand is strengthening thanks to the recent launch of nine XRP ETFs. More funds are expected, and increased institutional access could accelerate inflows. If U.S. lawmakers finally introduce comprehensive crypto regulations before the end of the year, then XRP has a realistic shot at reaching $10 or beyond by 2026. Dogecoin (DOGE): The World’s Favourite Meme Coin Is No Longer a Laughing Matter Dogecoin ($DOGE) , created in 2013, remains the original meme token and is still powered by its energetic “Doge Army.” The coin continues to hold a market cap of around $23 billion, showcasing its remarkable staying power. DOGE’s explosive 2021 rally, boosted by pop culture icons like Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, and Gene Simmons, cemented it as a household crypto name. While it began life as a joke, Dogecoin’s substantial market cap gives it notable price resilience, often mirroring broader movements in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. The token briefly ran up to $0.30 in mid-September before cooling to roughly $0.15 today. The Doge Army’s “Dogecoin to $1” slogan remains a rallying cry, though reaching that milestone in 2025 seems unlikely without any real breakthrough in US crypto policy. A supportive bull market could, however, help DOGE finally break through stubborn resistance around $0.33. Mainstream adoption continues to expand: Tesla accepts DOGE for merchandise purchases, and payment giants such as PayPal and Revolut have integrated DOGE transactions. Dogecoin’s 2021 peak of $0.7316 remains a distant target, one that may only be reachable well into next year. At current levels, DOGE trades nearly 80% below its ATH. Shiba Inu (SHIB): From Meme Coin to Utility Ecosystem Shiba Inu ($SHIB) , launched in August 2020, has evolved into the world’s second-largest meme cryptocurrency, holding a market valuation above $5.1 billion. Thanks to its broad ecosystem and entrenched user base, SHIB now behaves more like a mid-tier blue-chip asset than a high-risk meme token. It currently trades near $0.0000087. A breakout above $0.000022 could open the door for a climb toward $0.00003 by late November, and potentially $0.00005–$0.0001 if market conditions turn highly favorable. Unlike many meme-based projects, Shiba Inu continues to grow real utility through Shibarium, its Ethereum Layer 2 network built to deliver lower fees and faster execution. Upcoming privacy tools and ecosystem upgrades further solidify SHIB’s shift from novelty token to functional crypto platform. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): Meme Culture Meets High-Speed Bitcoin Layer-2 Innovation A rising project to watch heading into 2026 is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a Bitcoin Layer-2 scaling network cosplaying as a meme coin. Beneath its playful branding, the protocol aims to unlock fast transactions, near-zero fees, and full smart-contract support for Bitcoin. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper incorporates decentralized governance along with a Canonical Bridge that enables smooth BTC transfers between chains. The HYPER presale has already exceeded $28.6 million in commitments, and well-known analyst Borch Crypto has floated projections of potential 100× gains. A recent Coinsult audit reported no smart-contract issues, bolstering confidence in the project. The HYPER token drives network operations, governance, and staking, with early presale participants earning up to 40% APY. With momentum rapidly building, 2026 will be the year Bitcoin goes $HYPER.

The firm submitted a formal request to withdraw its S-1 filing, ending a process that began months earlier and left the company outside the group of issuers that launched in November. The move arrives during a period of rapid growth for Solana-based products, rising ETF interest, and a volatile altcoin market that continues to reshuffle issuer strategies. CoinShares Adjusts Its ETF Roadmap The asset manager last updated its Solana staking ETF application on September 26. However, it ultimately chose not to advance the product, leaving seven SOL ETFs currently active in the US market. Besides, CoinShares still has several filings at different stages, though the withdrawn product never entered trading and required structural reconsideration. The decision may point to a redesigned approach to Solana exposure, particularly as staking ETFs must select reliable validators to secure predictable yields. CoinShares continues to offer a Solana-based staking ETP on the Frankfurt exchange. Additionally, the firm manages more than $10 billion in assets and holds about 34% of Europe’s crypto ETP market. Hence, the pullback does not reflect declining interest in Solana. Instead, it may signal a broader shift toward aligning new products with evolving regulatory and market expectations. Altcoin ETF Plans Trimmed Amid Market Weakness The company also withdrew its efforts to introduce ETFs for XRP and Litecoin. Market conditions worsened in recent weeks, creating uncertainty around demand for altcoin products. Moreover, CoinShares is preparing for a merger with Vine Hill Capital, prompting a reassessment of priorities before the upcoming US listing. The removal of the XRP ETF leaves five issuers still competing to launch the next product, with 21Shares expected to begin trading on November 29. Solana Price Holds Strength Despite ETF Reversal Solana traded at $137.83 after a 3.11% daily decline, though weekly gains reached 8.32%. The circulating supply stands at 560 million SOL, placing its market cap near $77.1 billion. Despite the ETF withdrawal, analysts see improving momentum. Marzell noted an 80% potential upside supported by rising transactions, strong user activity, growing futures interest, and $613 million in spot SOL ETF inflows. Source: X Exy observed that SOL broke above its major trendline with a strong bullish candle following an RSI bullish divergence. Consequently, resistance remains firm at $152 and $170.

Could this set the stage for a bullish Shiba Inu price prediction as momentum builds? The second-largest meme coin has now climbed 16% in the past week, riding a broader market rebound that kicked off after a stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report. With sentiment turning and supply shrinking, SHIB may be gearing up for something bigger. HOURLY SHIB UPDATE $SHIB Price: $0.00000864 (1hr 0.17% ▲ | 24hr -0.04% ▼ ) Market Cap: $5,091,883,962 (0.00% ▲) Total Supply: 589,246,218,190,454 TOKENS BURNT Past 24Hrs: 61,833,188 (676.38% ▲) Past 7 Days: 114,424,622 (155.66% ▲) — Shibburn (@shibburn) November 27, 2025 Data from Shibburn, a service that tracks how many SHIB are burned periodically, reported a 676% spike consisting of 61.8 million tokens burned in the past 24 hours alone. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: RSI Sends Early Buy Signal After Winning Streak The daily chart shows SHIB approaching the upper boundary of its descending price channel, a key level that could define its next move. If the price breaks above $0.0000090, momentum may shift quickly, increasing the chances of a run toward $0.00001050. This zone will likely test whether bulls have the conviction to reverse the current trend. Adding strength to the setup, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved above its 14-day moving average, often seen as an early sign of a potential breakout. On the flip side, if SHIB fails to break through this resistance and gets rejected, a retest of recent lows becomes more likely in the near term. While SHIB gears up for a decisive move, early-stage investors are already rotating into fresh opportunities. One of the hottest presales gaining momentum right now is Pepenode ($PEPENODE) , a virtual mining project that turns crypto mining into a reward-driven game. No hardware needed. Players launch and upgrade digital rigs to earn rewards, while every upgrade burns a portion of $PEPENODE forever. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Introduces a Fun Way to Mine Meme Coins Pepenode ($PEPENODE) eliminates the need to make expensive hardware investments to mine meme coins and gamifies the whole process. Players kick things off by building a virtual server and launching as many mining rigs as they want, turning their setup into a competitive income engine. The goal is simple: climb the leaderboard and earn surprise airdrops of top meme coins like Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) and Bonk ($BONK) along the way. To boost their earning power, miners can reinvest using $PEPENODE to upgrade their rigs and scale their output. Up to 70% of the tokens used for upgrades are burned permanently, cutting supply and steadily increasing scarcity. With a staking APY of 584% and interest in the game growing fast, demand for $PEPENODE is on track to surge alongside its player base.

55067952,636184,1764370830,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55067952.jpeg,"Elon Musk’s SpaceX Moves $105 Million In Bitcoin, Is It Time For Selling?",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-is-it-time-for-selling/,"Elon Musk’s SpaceX quietly shifted 1,163 BTC, worth about $105.23 million, into new wallets this week, leading to questions over whether the aerospace giant is preparing for a sale or simply reorganizing its reserves. Blockchain tracker Arkham Intelligence first spotted the transaction on November 27, noting that the bitcoins were moved from a long-dormant treasury wallet into a new address. The move happened just as Bitcoin reclaimed $91,000, and the size of the transaction could be an early signal of selling pressure. SpaceX’s Bitcoin Transfer: Is This Selling Pressure? Data from Arkham Intelligence shows that SpaceX executed the $105.23 million transfer in a single large movement. Although the transfer was substantial, a quick look at SpaceX’s treasury behavior in recent months shows that the activity points to internal restructuring rather than liquidation. Still, the scale of the transaction has left investors asking whether this could be an early signal of selling pressure. Intelligence data shows that the funds were pushed into a new wallet with no immediate ties to exchanges. This difference is important because transfers to exchanges often come with selling activity. Instead, the pattern follows an earlier transaction in late October , when SpaceX moved 281 BTC into a newly created address without any subsequent liquidation. Interestingly, this 281 BTC transfer was preceded by a similar transfer of 1,215 BTC worth $133.68 million in October. The consistency of these movements suggests a gradual upgrade or redistribution of cold-storage arrangements, something that major corporations tend to do periodically to maintain custody security. According to Lookonchain, the recent transfer of 1,163 BTC to the new address “bc1q4p” was possibly made to Coinbase Prime for custody. SpaceX’s balance is substantial even after the recent movement, with roughly 6,095 BTC still under its control, an amount currently valued at $555.637 million and large enough to place the company among the biggest private corporate holders of Bitcoin. Tesla, Musk’s other major enterprise, sits even higher on the leaderboard with 11,509 BTC valued at $1.05 billion, ranking it as the 17th largest publicly traded Bitcoin-holding company in the world. Could SpaceX’s Movements Still Impact Market Sentiment? Despite the absence of clear evidence of selling intent, large transfers tied to high-profile companies like SpaceX inevitably influence sentiment. Bitcoin had just regained the $91,000 region at the time of the transfer, and traders immediately questioned whether Musk’s company might be preparing to offload part of its holdings, especially given the company’s sell-off history during the 2022 bear market. Bitcoin is still stabilizing after a price crash encouraged in part by Owen Gunden, one of the earliest high-profile holders, who unloaded hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of BTC and helped drag the price below $90,000 on November 20. However, the evidence behind SpaceX’s current transfer is still pointing to consolidation rather than liquidation.",Bitcoin News|Arkham Intelligence|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Coinbase Prime|Elon Musk|Lookonchain|Owen Gunden|SpaceX|Tesla,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|ARKM|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-28 23:00:30

November Close May Hold The Key,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/will-bitcoin-btc-end-2025-in-green-november-close-may-hold-the-key/,"While the crypto market bounces from last week’s correction, Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to reclaim a crucial area as support to continue its recovery rally. As the flagship crypto faces some resistance, some market watchers have suggested that this week’s close may be key for its end-of-year performance. Related Reading: Solana Reclaims Crucial Resistance Despite First SOL ETF Outflows – 25% Rally Ahead? Bitcoin Faces Rejection Ahead Of November Close Bitcoin has retested a crucial resistance level for the first time in a week, hitting a one-week high of $93,092 on Friday morning before retracing. The flagship crypto has failed to hold crucial support levels throughout the November corrections, trading below $100,000 for nearly two weeks. A week ago, BTC plunged below $90,000 during the latest market correction, reaching a seven-month low of $80,600. However, the cryptocurrency led this week’s broader recovery, reclaiming key levels over the past few days. Amid its recent performance, some market observers have noted that Bitcoin is currently retesting a crucial re-accumulation region, between $82,000 and $93,000, where the price consolidated after previous pullbacks, including the Q1 market correction. Analyst Rekt Capital highlighted that BTC rebounded more than 7% from the local bottom and has revisited the range high resistance during Friday’s recovery. Now, Bitcoin is attempting to hold the high zone of its local range, retesting the $90,000-$91,000 area as support after being rejected from the key resistance. Previously, he pointed out that last week’s weekly close aligned with the flagship crypto’s monthly range, setting the stage for a potential floor around the $86,000 area, which would develop a new range between this level and the $93,000 resistance. To the analyst, Bitcoin must close the week, which also coincides with November’s monthly close, above $93,5000 and turn this level into support if it wants to further build on its newfound momentum and potentially revisit its two-month downtrend line, which currently sits near the $96,000 mark. “The ~$93500 level happens to be a Four-Year Cycle level. History suggests price should be able to find a way to 12-month close above ~$93500 to finish 2025 green,” Rekt Capital added on X. $98,000 Rally or $88,000 Drop Next? Market watcher Ted Pillows discussed BTC’s short-term future as it faces some resistance around the $92,000-$93,000 levels. To the analysts, reclaiming this area could propel the price towards the $98,000-$100,000 barrier in the coming weeks. On the contrary, he suggested that failing to reclaim this level will send Bitcoin’s price below the $88,000 mark. Earlier this week, Ted warned that this was one of the most important levels to reclaim and hold as support in the short term, as a rejection from this area could trigger a significant drop below the recent lows. Similarly, Daan Crypto Trades noted that the constant sell-off of the past few weeks has created “a ton of marginally lower highs, creating such a big liquidity pocket” between the $97,000-$98,000 zone. This region also aligns with key horizontal price levels in bigger timeframes, making it a “good area to watch,” as BTC continues to consolidate in a relatively tight range.

Analysts Eye 50% December Jump The trader considers that if BTC’s price breaks down, the $88,000 mark could be a good place for a higher low. However, if the price holds above the $91,800 level, it may trigger another retest of the $93,000 resistance. Ultimately, He warned that the market could likely see a “Choppy environment in the short-term surrounding Thanksgiving, which always sees pretty low volume & liquidity.” As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $90,500, a 1.1% decline in the daily timeframe.

This remarkable achievement signals growing institutional confidence in XRP and sets a new benchmark for digital asset investment products. What Makes XRP Spot ETFs So Attractive to Investors? XRP spot ETFs provide investors with direct exposure to XRP without the complexities of managing private keys or navigating cryptocurrency exchanges. These investment vehicles offer several compelling advantages: Regulatory oversight and investor protection Traditional brokerage account accessibility Professional fund management Liquidity and trading convenience Breaking Down the Impressive XRP ETF Numbers The $640 million net inflow represents more than just impressive numbers – it demonstrates real market demand. These XRP spot ETFs now hold $670 million in total net assets, accounting for 0.50% of XRP’s total market capitalization. This substantial allocation shows that institutional investors are taking XRP seriously as a viable asset class. Why Are XRP Spot ETFs Gaining Traction Now? Several factors contribute to the successful launch of these XRP spot ETFs. Regulatory clarity has improved significantly, providing more confidence to both issuers and investors. Moreover, the growing acceptance of digital assets in traditional finance creates perfect conditions for these products to thrive. The timing aligns with increasing institutional interest in cryptocurrency diversification. What Challenges Do XRP Spot ETFs Face? Despite the strong start, XRP spot ETFs must navigate ongoing regulatory developments and market volatility. However, the initial success suggests that these challenges are being effectively managed. The funds’ performance during their first month indicates robust risk management strategies and investor confidence in the underlying asset. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors For investors considering XRP spot ETFs, here are key considerations: Research each fund’s expense ratios and management fees Understand the tax implications in your jurisdiction Diversify across multiple cryptocurrency products Monitor regulatory developments affecting XRP The Future Outlook for XRP Spot ETFs The spectacular debut of these XRP spot ETFs suggests a bright future for cryptocurrency-based investment products.

This achievement demonstrates that institutional investors are embracing cryptocurrency exposure through regulated channels, potentially signaling a new era of mainstream adoption. Frequently Asked Questions What are XRP spot ETFs? XRP spot ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual XRP tokens, providing investors with direct exposure to XRP price movements through traditional brokerage accounts. How do XRP spot ETFs differ from Bitcoin ETFs? While both are cryptocurrency ETFs, XRP spot ETFs specifically track XRP’s price, whereas Bitcoin ETFs track Bitcoin. Each has different regulatory considerations and market dynamics. Are XRP spot ETFs available to all investors? Yes, these XRP spot ETFs are available to any investor with access to traditional brokerage accounts, making XRP investment more accessible than ever. What risks do XRP spot ETFs carry? Like any investment, XRP spot ETFs carry market risk, regulatory risk, and the volatility inherent in cryptocurrency markets, though they offer more protection than direct crypto ownership. Can I trade XRP spot ETFs like regular stocks? Absolutely. XRP spot ETFs trade on major exchanges during market hours, allowing investors to buy and sell shares just like traditional stocks. How do the fees compare to direct XRP ownership? XRP spot ETFs typically charge management fees, but these may be offset by the convenience, security, and regulatory protections they provide compared to direct ownership.

Bitcoin remains at $91,800, Ethereum is at $3,060, while XRP has risen slightly to $2.22, as investors await the next FOMC meeting on December 9 and 10. While the expectation had been that the Fed wouldn’t touch rates, positivity has increased, with JPMorgan changing its opinion this week and suggesting that the central bank will cut its federal funds rate by 0.25%. This is likely to boost the market, so now may actually be an ideal time to get buying again, while tokens remain at a discount. And investors should also consider diversifying into new tokens, with this article looking more closely at PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), the next crypto to turn $100 into $10,000. Next Crypto to Turn $100 into $10,000 – 28 November To understand why PEPENODE is the next crypto to turn $100 into $10,000, it’s worth explaining its unique and innovative mining platform. Mapping your next move in Pepenode isn’t flavor. It’s core gameplay that determines how fast you climb upgrade those Nodes! https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/vY69IDm3C1 — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) November 27, 2025 Rather than require users to invest in expensive mining hardware (as you’d have to do with Bitcoin), PEPENODE enables anyone to mine tokens, all from the comfort of their homes. It gives users the opportunity to build and operate their own virtual mining rigs, which they can grow by spending PEPENODE tokens on virtual mining nodes. By buying more nodes, participants will receive greater mining rewards, a dynamic that should motivate considerable demand for the new coin. PEPENODE will pay out rewards in external coins such as Pepe and Fartcoin, meaning that the incentive to buy more nodes could be very strong (especially if these coins are rallying). On top of this, users can sell on their nodes if they want to scale down or halt their mining operations, providing an additional source of income. In fact, the potential for profit doesn’t stop there, since PEPENODE is also open to staking, and in fact currently offers a very attractive yield of 584%. How to Buy PEPENODE Before It Lists All of these features make PEPENODE one of the most exciting new coins to have emerged in recent weeks, and they’re why we think it’s the next crypto to turn $100 into $10,000. It has the fundamentals and community to be a success, with investors able to join its presale by going to its official website. Its presale has raised just over $2.2 million so far, and this total is likely to continue rising as the sale enters its end stage. By connecting a compatible wallet (e.g., Best Wallet), users can choose how much of the token they want to buy, and then buy it using either ETH, USDT, BNB, or fiat. The token is currently selling at a price of $0.0011685, but this price will rise repeatedly until the sale ends. As such, traders should act quickly, since PEPENODE has the potential to rally strongly once it launches in the next few weeks. This will especially be the case if the Fed does cut rates and the mood turns more bullish, which is looking increasingly likely.

This monumental transaction, valued at approximately $239 million, represents one of the largest single SOL transfers we’ve witnessed this year. But what does this massive movement really mean for Solana investors and the broader crypto ecosystem? What This Massive SOL Transfer Reveals About Market Sentiment When we see a SOL transfer of this magnitude, it immediately raises important questions about market dynamics. Institutional players typically move large sums for specific strategic purposes. This particular SOL transfer could signal several possibilities: Institutional accumulation for long-term holding Preparation for upcoming trading activities Portfolio rebalancing by a major investor Potential preparation for staking or DeFi activities The timing of this SOL transfer is particularly interesting given current market conditions. Large movements often precede significant price action, making this a crucial development to watch. Why Are Institutional SOL Transfers So Important? Institutional SOL transfers like this one carry more weight than typical retail transactions. When $239 million worth of SOL moves to a major exchange like Coinbase Institutional, it suggests sophisticated players are making calculated moves. This SOL transfer demonstrates several key market realities: First, institutional confidence in Solana remains strong despite recent market volatility. Second, the sheer size of this SOL transfer indicates that major investors see current price levels as attractive for entry or repositioning. Moreover, such movements often create ripple effects throughout the entire Solana ecosystem. How This SOL Transfer Could Impact Solana’s Price Action The immediate question on every trader’s mind is how this SOL transfer will affect Solana’s market price. Historically, large transfers to exchanges can signal potential selling pressure. However, the institutional nature of this SOL transfer suggests a more nuanced story. Consider these potential outcomes: Short-term volatility as markets digest the news Increased liquidity on Coinbase Institutional Potential price support if the transfer represents accumulation Market confidence boost from institutional participation This SOL transfer comes at a time when Solana has shown remarkable resilience in the face of broader market challenges. The network’s growing adoption and technological improvements continue to attract serious capital. Understanding Whale Movements in Cryptocurrency Markets Whale transactions like this SOL transfer provide valuable insights into market sentiment. Large holders typically have better market information and longer-term perspectives than retail investors. When we analyze patterns in SOL transfer activity, we can identify several consistent behaviors: Whales often accumulate during price dips and distribute during rallies. Their movements frequently precede major price trends. Institutional SOL transfers tend to be more strategic than emotional, reflecting careful planning and analysis. Key Takeaways From This Monumental SOL Transfer This massive SOL transfer teaches us several crucial lessons about today’s cryptocurrency landscape. The continued institutional interest in Solana validates the network’s fundamental strength. The scale of this movement demonstrates that serious capital remains committed to blockchain innovation. Most importantly, this SOL transfer reminds us that cryptocurrency markets are maturing rapidly. We’re witnessing the transition from speculative trading to strategic institutional participation. This evolution brings both stability and sophistication to the space. Frequently Asked Questions What does a large SOL transfer to an exchange usually mean? Large SOL transfers to exchanges can indicate preparation for selling, but institutional transfers often have more complex strategic purposes including staking, lending, or portfolio management. How does this SOL transfer affect ordinary investors? While direct impact may be limited, such movements can influence market sentiment, liquidity, and price volatility, potentially creating both risks and opportunities for retail investors. Why use Coinbase Institutional for such a large transfer? Coinbase Institutional offers enhanced security, better liquidity access, and specialized services tailored to large-scale investors that aren’t available on retail platforms. Should I be concerned about price drops after this SOL transfer? Not necessarily. Institutional transfers don’t always lead to immediate selling. Often, they represent long-term strategic positioning rather than short-term trading intentions. How common are SOL transfers of this size? While significant, multi-million dollar SOL transfers occur regularly as institutional participation in cryptocurrency markets continues to grow and mature. Can I track future SOL transfers myself? Yes, platforms like Whale Alert and various blockchain explorers allow anyone to monitor large cryptocurrency transactions in real-time across multiple networks.

The altcoin is gaining momentum as a hedge against future quantum vulnerabilities, a theme expected to underpin 2026 due to both technological urgency and investor sentiment. Quantum-resistant tokens have reached a combined market cap of $8.75 billion, with daily trading volume consistently above $1 billion — a sign of strong activity and liquidity. Speaking at the Devconnect conference in 2025, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin warned that quantum breakthroughs could threaten blockchain cryptography as soon as 2028. His push for quantum-resistant protocols has accelerated research and shifted capital toward future-proof projects, with Zcash emerging as the current market leader. Vitalik said quantum computers could crack Bitcoin’s keys by 2028. Some called it FUD but the threat is real.

This duality of leading narratives between privacy coins and quantum resistance could position ZEC for significant inflows. Zcash Price Prediction: Massive Run Incoming? While ZEC has seen a significant unwind over November, it could amount to a brief consolidation in a wider uptrend with the formation of a bullish pennant pattern. The pattern currently faces a key test as its lower boundary is retested alongside supportive momentum indicators. ZEC / USDT 1-day chart, bullish pennant pattern. Source: TradingView . The RSI teeters on a cross above the 50 neutral line with several retests while the MACD closes in on a golden cross. Both show brewing buy pressure and the potential for a fresh uptrend. The key threshold for a confirmed breakout is all-time highs around $760. Flipping this level to support would confirm the push into new price discovery. Fully realised, the pennant pattern eyes a measured 265% move to $1,750. However, as the bull market matures and the privacy coin and quantum resistance narrative grow in relevance, a 950% push to the $5,000 milestone could in focus.

The decision comes after failed negotiations with local authorities over electricity rates, forcing the crypto giant to abandon what was once a promising $500 million investment. This dramatic exit highlights the critical challenges facing cryptocurrency mining operations worldwide. Why Did Tether Uruguay Mining Operations Face Such Rapid Collapse? The core issue revolves around electricity costs, which have become increasingly problematic for cryptocurrency mining operations globally. Tether had initially planned substantial investments in Uruguay, attracted by the country’s renewable energy potential. However, negotiations with local authorities reached an impasse over power pricing, making the operations economically unviable. According to reports, the company is now laying off most of its local staff and completely withdrawing from the country. This represents a significant setback for both Tether’s expansion plans and Uruguay’s ambitions to become a cryptocurrency mining hub. What Challenges Do Crypto Mining Operations Face? Cryptocurrency mining operations confront several critical challenges that can make or break their success: Electricity costs – The single largest operational expense Regulatory uncertainty – Changing government policies Infrastructure requirements – Reliable power and cooling systems Community relations – Local acceptance and support The Tether Uruguay mining situation perfectly illustrates how these factors can combine to derail even well-funded projects. When electricity costs become prohibitive, the entire business model collapses. How Does This Impact the Broader Cryptocurrency Industry? Tether’s withdrawal from Uruguay sends a clear message to the cryptocurrency sector. Mining operations must carefully evaluate their energy dependencies and regulatory environments. The failed Tether Uruguay mining venture demonstrates that even countries with attractive renewable energy resources can present unexpected challenges. Moreover, this development may cause other cryptocurrency companies to reconsider their expansion plans in similar markets. The incident underscores the importance of stable regulatory frameworks and predictable energy pricing for sustainable cryptocurrency mining operations. What Can We Learn From Tether’s Experience? The collapse of the Tether Uruguay mining project offers valuable lessons for the entire industry. First, comprehensive due diligence is essential before committing to large-scale investments. Second, long-term energy contracts with predictable pricing are crucial for operational stability. Finally, maintaining positive relationships with local authorities and communities can prevent sudden operational disruptions. These insights are particularly relevant as the cryptocurrency mining industry continues to evolve and seek sustainable operating models in an increasingly competitive landscape. Conclusion: The Future of Cryptocurrency Mining Tether’s abrupt exit from Uruguay serves as a cautionary tale for cryptocurrency mining operations worldwide. While the promise of renewable energy and favorable conditions initially attracted significant investment, the reality of operational costs and regulatory challenges proved overwhelming. The Tether Uruguay mining shutdown reminds us that sustainable cryptocurrency operations require more than just technical capability – they demand stable economic partnerships and predictable regulatory environments. As the industry matures, we can expect more careful evaluation of potential mining locations and greater emphasis on long-term sustainability rather than short-term opportunities. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Tether choose Uruguay for mining operations initially? Tether selected Uruguay due to its abundant renewable energy resources and initially favorable regulatory environment, making it attractive for energy-intensive cryptocurrency mining. How many jobs were affected by the shutdown? While exact numbers aren’t specified, reports indicate Tether is laying off “most of its local staff” in Uruguay as part of the complete operational withdrawal. Could Tether return to Uruguay if conditions improve? While theoretically possible, the complete withdrawal of operations and staff suggests Tether has moved on to other opportunities, making a return unlikely in the near future. How does this affect Tether’s other business operations? The Uruguay mining shutdown primarily impacts Tether’s mining expansion plans but doesn’t directly affect their stablecoin operations, which remain their core business. Are other cryptocurrency mining companies facing similar challenges? Yes, many mining operations globally are grappling with rising energy costs and regulatory uncertainties, though the specific challenges vary by region. What alternatives does Tether have for mining operations? Tether can explore other countries with stable energy pricing, favorable regulations, and reliable infrastructure for future mining ventures.

XRP Price Prediction: XRP Invalidates Bearish Structure After Climbing Above $2.18 XRP jumped from a key level of resistance at $1.90 in the past few days and has now fully invalidated the bearish structure after pushing past the previous daily low. Source: TradingView Momentum is starting to shift in favor of XRP, with fresh technical signals suggesting a potential reversal. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has just moved above the 14-day moving average, often seen as a classic buy signal that hints at growing strength.

Circle, the issuer of USDC, also made notable progress with nearly a 10% jump in early trading. Strategy, backed by Michael Saylor, alongside Coinbase, logged more modest increases but still participated in the broader market move. Bitcoin itself added around 7% over the past week after briefly dipping to roughly $82,000 on Nov. 21. Interest-Rate Commentary Drives Market Volatility The rapid swings in prediction-market pricing throughout November have largely been tied to comments from Federal Reserve officials. On Oct. 29, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that a December rate cut was “not a foregone conclusion,” which investors interpreted as a hawkish signal. That single remark led to prediction-market odds collapsing from 89% the previous day to around 22% by Nov. 20. The sentiment reversal began on Nov. 17 after Fed Governor Christopher Waller indicated the central bank should actively consider a rate cut next month. He argued that “the labor market is still weak and near stall speed” and that inflation appeared “relatively close” to the Fed’s 2% target. The remarks immediately reshaped expectations and helped drive the latest price rally in crypto-linked assets. Prediction Markets Gain Influence Across Industries Prediction markets have expanded significantly this year as more companies and investors embrace the model. Platforms such as Polymarket and Kalshi have attracted users by allowing wagers on political developments, financial outcomes and major global events. Polymarket recently secured a multi-year partnership to act as the official prediction-market platform for both the UFC and Zuffa Boxing. The company has also grown through other strategic partnerships that broaden the use of prediction contracts across entertainment and sports. Meanwhile, Kalshi has continued its own expansion after attracting major investment rounds that substantially increased its valuation. Both platforms have reported surging user activity as traders increasingly use prediction markets to anticipate economic decisions, including those from the Federal Reserve. Trading Apps Join the Prediction-Market Trend The rapid rise of prediction markets has also caught the attention of larger trading platforms. Robinhood recently confirmed that prediction markets have become one of its fastest-growing revenue categories. The platform said that more than one million users have already traded billions of contracts since the feature launched earlier this year. Rumors have also circulated that Coinbase is developing a prediction-market platform of its own, following the appearance of early interface images. The acceleration of these platforms underscores a broader trend: traders across traditional and crypto markets are relying more heavily on probabilistic pricing tools to interpret and react to policy shifts. As expectations for a December rate cut climb, crypto-linked stocks appear positioned to remain sensitive to any new signals from the Federal Reserve.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-11-28 23:48:14

While most companies would jump at million-dollar contracts, this open source database platform built something far more valuable – a movement. How did Supabase achieve this remarkable valuation? The Supabase valuation journey is nothing short of extraordinary. From $2 billion to $5 billion in just months, the platform’s growth defies conventional startup wisdom. Their secret? Building an open source database ecosystem that developers genuinely love, rather than chasing immediate revenue. The power of open source database strategy Supabase understood something fundamental about modern software development. By focusing on creating the best possible open source database experience, they attracted a massive community of developers who became their biggest advocates. Community-driven development approach Transparent product roadmap Developer-first design philosophy Consistent product improvements Startup growth through strategic rejection Most startups would consider turning down million-dollar contracts as financial suicide. For Supabase, it was strategic genius. They prioritized long-term startup growth over short-term gains, understanding that not all revenue is created equal. Contract Type Short-term Benefit Long-term Cost Enterprise Customization Immediate revenue Product complexity Exclusive Partnerships Guaranteed income Limited market access Custom Features Client retention Development distraction Building backend infrastructure that developers trust The backend infrastructure market is crowded, but Supabase found their niche by focusing on what developers actually need. Their approach to creating reliable, scalable backend infrastructure won them the trust of the developer community. Venture capital funding with a vision The recent $100 million venture capital funding round at a $5 billion valuation wasn’t just about the money. It was validation of their unique approach to building a sustainable business around open source technology. FAQs About Supabase’s Growth Strategy What makes Supabase different from other database platforms? Supabase combines the power of PostgreSQL with real-time capabilities and an intuitive interface, creating a unique open source database experience. How did venture capital funding contribute to their growth? The venture capital funding allowed Supabase to scale their team, improve their infrastructure, and accelerate product development without compromising their open source principles. What challenges did Supabase face in their startup growth journey? Balancing community needs with enterprise requirements, maintaining open source values while building a sustainable business, and competing against well-funded competitors were significant challenges. Why is backend infrastructure becoming so valuable? As more applications move to the cloud and require real-time capabilities, reliable backend infrastructure becomes critical for business success and scalability. How can other startups learn from Supabase’s valuation strategy? Focus on building genuine value for your community, prioritize long-term vision over short-term revenue, and don’t be afraid to say no to opportunities that don’t align with your core mission. Supabase’s journey to a $5 billion valuation teaches us that sometimes the most powerful business strategy involves strategic rejection. By saying no to million-dollar contracts that didn’t align with their vision, they built something far more valuable – a platform that developers genuinely love and trust. Their success proves that in the world of technology, community and vision can be worth more than immediate revenue.

Dogecoin Price Prediction: Can DOGE Still Flip Bullish? With markets treating spot DOGE ETFs as a one-day headline, not a turning point, the bullish setup of a year-long descending triangle pattern remains on the fence. While the past week has seen a bounce from its lower support at $0.13, it has yet to be confirmed as a launchpad level with mixed momentum indicators. DOGE / USD 1-day chart, descending triangle. Source: TradingView . While a golden cross formed on the MACD points to a potential fresh uptrend, an RSI below the neutral 50 line suggests sellers still dominate shorter-term price action. TradFi did not deliver the momentum to flip the balance. While easing pressures favour progress to retest the $0.20 resistance , the failed catalyst keeps lower lows at $0.08 in the cards. If a higher and stronger footing is found above $0.20, a breakout push could be in play. A clean triangle breakout sets up a measured move of roughly 220% to past highs around $0.50, and a fully realised target of $1 for a potoentail 530% gain. Though this target likely hinges on greater TradFi market participation and potential inclusion on mainstream balance sheets. Pepe Node: Don’t Worry About Buying The Dip Hesitancy among TradFi markets makes one thing clear: under current market conditions, entering at a good position can be a challenge, especially for more volatile tokens like DOGE. PepeNode ($PEPENODE) helps with a low-risk way to capitalise on upside without needing to time the market, the pitfall of most meme coin investors. It’s a simple mine-to-earn (M2E) game. No hardware needed. Just log in, acquire virtual nodes, stack rigs, and configure your setup to start earning passive rewards that diversify across top-performing meme coins. The method is already gaining traction. The presale has already passed $2.2 million, while early stakers can still earn up to 583% APY. And thanks to a built-in deflationary model, where 70% of all $PEPENODE spent on nodes and rigs is burned, scarcity supports long-term token value. PepeNode stands out as a smarter way to capture some of the market’s strongest upside—without worrying about timing the perfect entry.

The analysis, released on November 27, highlights a repeatable pattern framework—historically signaling the transition from quiet consolidation to aggressive price expansion. With multiple indicators aligning, XRP is once again approaching a potential breakout window that traders remember well. XRP Price Structure Echoes The 2024 Breakout Setup The analysis shared by “guyonearth” on X argues that XRP is rebuilding the same technical foundation that preceded its major 2024 breakout. In that earlier cycle, the asset spent months tightening within a defined structure before unleashing a vertical rally. The analyst notes that the current configuration follows the same blueprint, with the cryptocurrency once again entering a compressed phase that often precedes high-momentum expansion. The latest chart shows XRP trading inside a descending channel and recently rebounding from the lower boundary—an early signal that momentum may be shifting. The next critical objective is the channel’s upper boundary near $2.40, identified as the confirmation level for renewed upside. A move into this zone would indicate strengthening buyer control and open the door for broader trend acceleration. Central to this setup is the $1.90–$2.00 support corridor, which continues to operate as XRP’s structural floor. The asset has repeatedly reversed from this band, reinforcing it as the market’s preferred pivot. Maintaining this range is essential for preserving the bullish setup , as losing it would disrupt the pattern and undermine continuation prospects. Momentum indicators align with the broader narrative. The RSI is forming higher lows beneath a descending resistance line, suggesting that accumulation is quietly rebuilding. Viewed together, these elements form a unified narrative: XRP is recreating the combination of support integrity, structural tightening, and momentum rebuilding that historically led to a dramatic upward move. The analyst’s standpoint is that, if these components continue to hold, the altcoin may once again be positioning itself for a breakout that mirrors its 2024 trajectory. Bitcoin Dominance Unlocks A Favorable Window Broader market conditions add a supportive backdrop for XRP’s projected rally. The analyst notes that Bitcoin Dominance remains high and stable, as long as it stays above 57.5%. A drop below that level typically triggers stronger capital rotation into altcoins. He expects dominance to eventually fall toward 43%, a shift that would mark a major redistribution of market share. That projected decline forms the window in which the altcoin could gain momentum, provided it continues to hold the $1.90–$2.00 support zone. If Bitcoin dominance rolls over while XRP maintains structural strength, liquidity could tilt sharply toward altcoins. With a clear technical pattern and a short-term target near $2.40, the analyst positions XRP as well-placed to benefit from that rotation.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-29 00:00:07

Bitcoin Has Faced Loss Selling From The Newbie Whales In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the latest trend in the profit/loss realization behavior of the Bitcoin whales. “Whales” broadly refer to the BTC investors that hold at least 1,000 tokens in their balance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Puell Multiple Plunges, But Not Inside Bottom Zone Yet At the current exchange rate, the cutoff for the cohort is equivalent to $91.6 million, which is quite significant. As such, this group represents the big-money hands of the market, who can carry some degree of influence. Whales can be divided into two subgroups based on holding time. Investors of this size who purchased their coins within the past 155 days are known as the short-term holder (STH) or New Whales. Similarly, whales with a longer holding time are called the long-term holder (LTH) or Old Whales. Now, here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the net amount of profit/loss that these Bitcoin whale groups have been realizing through their selling over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin New Whales have shown some loss realization spikes recently. This underwater selling from the cohort has come as the cryptocurrency’s price has gone through a decline. The New Whales include the inexperienced hands of the market who tend to easily panic in the face of volatility. It would appear that this quality of the group has held through the latest crash as well. The Old Whales, on the other hand, are considered to represent the resolute side of the network. From the chart, it’s visible that there has been some loss selling from these large dormant entities recently, but its scale has been small compared to the New Whale capitulation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Be At Risk Of A Deeper Bear If This Ratio Compresses, Says Glassnode The fact that the presence of the Old Whales has been relatively muted through the bearish shift, as well as the rebound that has followed, could be a signal worth keeping an eye on. Speaking of the recovery, the Bitcoin rally has meant that its price has climbed back above a major on-chain cost basis level. As analyst Ali Martinez has shared in an X post, the Bitcoin UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) suggests a strong amount of buying last occurred at $84,500. In on-chain analysis, strong demand zones below the spot price are considered points of potential support for Bitcoin. Similarly, levels above are assumed to be sources of resistance instead. One such major level is present at $112,300. BTC Price Bitcoin’s recovery has furthered during the past day as its price has returned to $92,300.

55070240,https://timestabloid.com/?p=90913,1764374449,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Reveals Only Way To Slow Down XRP ETF,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-reveals-only-way-to-slow-down-xrp-etf/,"A prominent member of the XRP community has outlined why he expects newly launched XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to source their tokens directly from the open market rather than from Ripple’s escrow supply. His view is rooted in the belief that these funds will need to buy significant volumes of XRP to meet demand, which could increase market pressure and eventually drive prices higher. Strong Debut For XRP ETFs The arrival of XRP-based ETFs has already generated substantial interest. The first product, Canary Capital’s XRPC, was launched on Nov. 13 and recorded approximately $245 million in initial inflows. Additional ETFs from Bitwise, Grayscale , and Franklin Templeton have since entered the market. Data from Sosovalue indicates that the four active XRP ETFs have accumulated a combined net inflow of about $643.92 million over the last two weeks. The most recent daily figure, recorded on Nov. 26, showed another $21.81 million entering the products. Despite this activity, XRP’s market performance has not risen as sharply as some investors anticipated. Following a 13% intraday increase between Nov. 23 and 24, the asset has faced resistance around the $2.2 range and has remained in a narrow band for several days. At $2.25, XRP is still down 13% for the month. Even so, some analysts believe that sustained ETF demand could eventually influence price direction. In the first year, the XRP ETF funds will be relentlessly aggressive. There is only ONE way to slow them down… The price HAS to go up. There is no plan B. — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) November 27, 2025 Analyst Predicts Aggressive Accumulation Among the most vocal supporters of this outlook is Chad Steingraber, a game developer and long-time XRP commentator. He has repeatedly maintained that the ETFs will attempt to acquire large quantities of XRP during their initial year of operation. Steingraber argues that the scale of demand these funds are likely to face will require fast and consistent purchasing activity. He estimates that if XRP remains near $2.2, every additional $1 billion flowing into ETFs could represent more than 450 million tokens purchased from the open market. If the price were to climb to $6, the same inflow would secure far fewer tokens, roughly 166 million. In his view, the market can only accommodate this level of accumulation if XRP rises considerably. He has stated that there is no alternative scenario in which the ETFs can meet demand without upward price movement. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He compares this potential trajectory to the behavior of Bitcoin ETFs in 2024, which saw inflows in ten out of twelve months and accumulated over $35 billion worth of BTC during that period, contributing to price appreciation. Why Steingraber Rejects Escrow Purchases Some observers suggest that ETFs could choose to purchase XRP directly from Ripple’s escrow instead of the open market, which would reduce the immediate impact on price. Steingraber disagrees. He notes that authorized participants (APs) responsible for acquiring tokens for ETF creation are required to secure the underlying assets shortly after receiving new inflows. This process typically occurs within two days, giving APs limited flexibility. Because XRP from Ripple’s escrow is released on a predetermined monthly schedule, APs would not reliably have access to additional supply at the exact time it is needed. Steingraber further argues that for ETFs to depend on escrow , Ripple would need to make its entire monthly 1 billion XRP allotment available through Ripple Prime, even if the tokens were not immediately required. He maintains that it would not be in Ripple’s economic interest to release large volumes at a relatively low price, as doing so would reduce the potential value of its holdings in the future.

This crucial indicator provides valuable insights into investor psychology and market direction. Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index helps traders navigate volatile conditions and make informed decisions. What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Shift Mean for Investors? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has moved from ‘Extreme Fear’ to ‘Fear’ category, climbing three points to reach 28. This measurement scale ranges from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed), offering a snapshot of market emotions. The index’s movement suggests changing investor sentiment that could influence trading patterns and price action across major cryptocurrencies. According to data provider Alternative.me, this marks the first time the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has entered the Fear zone since mid-November. This transition indicates that while market anxiety persists, extreme panic has subsided. Investors should monitor these sentiment shifts closely as they often precede significant price movements. How Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index uses multiple data sources to create a comprehensive market sentiment picture. The calculation methodology includes: Volatility (25%) – Measures price fluctuations and market stability Market Volume (25%) – Tracks trading activity and investor participation Social Media (15%) – Analyzes cryptocurrency discussions and sentiment online Surveys (15%) – Gathers direct investor opinions and expectations Bitcoin Dominance (10%) – Monitors Bitcoin’s market share relative to altcoins Search Trends (10%) – Measures public interest through Google search volume This multi-factor approach ensures the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reflects genuine market conditions rather than temporary fluctuations. Each component contributes to a balanced assessment of investor psychology. Why Should You Care About Market Sentiment Indicators? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a valuable contrarian indicator for savvy investors. Historically, extreme fear levels often present buying opportunities, while extreme greed may signal potential market tops. The current reading of 28 suggests cautious optimism might be warranted, though careful risk management remains essential. Many successful traders use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to time their entry and exit points. When fear dominates the market, prices often drop below fundamental values. Conversely, excessive greed can lead to overvaluation and subsequent corrections. Understanding these patterns helps investors avoid emotional decision-making. What Actionable Insights Can You Derive From This Shift? The movement in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index from Extreme Fear to Fear suggests several potential strategies: Dollar-cost averaging – Consider gradual position building during fear periods Portfolio rebalancing – Adjust allocations based on changing risk appetite Risk assessment – Evaluate your tolerance for potential volatility Market research – Use sentiment data to complement technical and fundamental analysis Remember that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index represents one tool among many. Combine it with other analysis methods for comprehensive market understanding. The index’s current reading indicates markets are transitioning from panic to cautious assessment. Final Thoughts: Navigating Market Sentiment Shifts The Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides crucial insights into market psychology that technical analysis alone cannot capture. The shift to Fear territory marks an important transition that investors should monitor closely. While sentiment indicators don’t guarantee future performance, they offer valuable context for decision-making. Successful cryptocurrency investing requires balancing multiple data sources. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as your emotional compass in turbulent markets. Use it to maintain perspective when others succumb to fear or greed extremes. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index measures market sentiment on a scale from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed) using multiple data sources including volatility, volume, and social media sentiment. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index updates daily, providing current market sentiment readings that help investors gauge prevailing market psychology. What does a Fear reading indicate? A Fear reading suggests investors are cautious and potentially pessimistic about short-term price movements, which sometimes presents buying opportunities for long-term investors. Can the Crypto Fear & Greed Index predict price movements? While not a perfect predictor, extreme readings often coincide with market reversals, making it a valuable contrarian indicator when used with other analysis tools. How reliable is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index provides reliable sentiment data when understood as one component of comprehensive market analysis rather than a standalone trading signal.

Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $4.05 Market Cap $2.18B Trading Volume $100.16M Circulating Supply 541.08M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.86 (Sep 2023) 24-h High $4.13 24-h Low $3.99 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 28.67% (Extremely High) 14-Day RSI 42.79 (Neutral) 50-Day SMA $4.40 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 25 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 13/30 (43 %) 200-Day SMA $5.14 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP is consolidating tightly above $4.00, with indicators showing bearish momentum slowly losing strength. Buyers remain most active between $3.85 and $4.00. A break above the $4.08 – $4.20 range could finally trigger a bullish shift. ICP 1-day price analysis On the 1-day chart for November 28, ICP sits at $4.043, holding a shallow consolidation after days of decline. The Bollinger Bands are flattening, showing reduced volatility and signaling that the downtrend may be losing momentum. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The RSI at 42 suggests the market is still weak but no longer oversold, while the MACD histogram is slowly easing from deep negative levels, hinting at early stabilization. The key level is $4.00, which has been defended several times. A move above $4.20 would be the first sign of strength, while losing $4.00 could drag ICP back toward $3.70. ICP 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour timeframe, ICP is drifting sideways around $4.043. The Alligator lines are still slightly bearish but are flattening, which often happens before a trend shift. The MACD is near neutral but still negative, confirming the lack of clear direction. ICP continues to trade between the $4.00 and $4.05 range. A break above $4.08 opens room toward $4.12–$4.15, while slipping under $4.00 could result in a price drop to $3.88.

The next decisive move should come once the price breaks either above $4.20 or below $4.00, with the former signaling the first real bullish reversal attempt. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects. Its technology aims to decentralize the internet and bring smart contract functionality to the web, which could have wide-ranging implications for the future of web speed.

The rumor had no real support, but it caused enough chatter that Hollander felt the need to respond multiple times on X, formerly Twitter. Hollander responds to the rumors According to Adam Holander, the purported leak of OpenSea’s $150 million public sale on Coinbase is “fake.” His response targeted a news post from a media source on X that alleged that Coinbase had shared a post about the upcoming ICO and deleted it, as well as a post from what he called a parody account. Hollander commented on the post, calling it “fake” then in a separate post, he wrote : “There is no merit whatsoever to the fake Coinbase screenshot making the rounds on X this morning. Far as I can tell, it was posted by a parody account. You should only rely on official OpenSea or OpenSea Foundation channels.” The rumor he had to debunk had no supporting evidence from primary data sources or trusted leadership statements that confirmed it, but it was gathering enough steam that Hollander had to intervene. The CMO emphasized the importance of companies remaining proactive in addressing misinformation. SEA token to go live in 2026 OpenSea’s native SEA token is expected to launch in the first quarter of 2026, and it will reportedly play a big role in the marketplace’s ecosystem, covering aspects like governance, staking, and rewards. OpenSea’s CEO has revealed that a significant portion of the total token supply has been set aside for community distribution, including allocations for historical users and those who have been participating in the ongoing rewards programs. As part of its launch strategy, OpenSea will dedicate half of its platform revenue to creating a buyback program for SEA tokens. The initiative aims to boost the token’s value while fostering community investment, thereby setting it up as a central feature of the OpenSea setup. Over the past couple of months, OpenSea has been interacting directly with the crypto community to get feedback. Meanwhile, it has stayed as transparent as possible about its future plans in hopes of cultivating trust and encouraging broader participation in its token campaign and evolving ecosystem. The platform is under a lot of pressure to do right by all parties, from the historical users, some of whom paid to activate their OpenSea accounts in those early days, to the farmers who have been burning money trying to gain higher ranks in hopes of getting a better drop from the token launch. While the rumor of the OpenSea ICO may be false, the SEA token initiative has been confirmed as the real deal.

The latest data reveals the Altcoin Season Index remains firmly at 21, signaling continued Bitcoin dominance in the cryptocurrency markets. This crucial metric gives investors valuable insights into market cycles and potential opportunities. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index serves as a vital thermometer for cryptocurrency market sentiment. This important indicator measures whether 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days.

Understanding this Altcoin Season Index reading helps investors make informed decisions about their portfolio allocations. Why Does the Current Altcoin Season Index Matter?

Increased institutional adoption, technological breakthroughs, or Bitcoin consolidation phases often precede rises in the Altcoin Season Index. The current reading provides a baseline from which to measure future market movements. Remember that the Altcoin Season Index represents a 90-day performance window, making it a reliable medium-term indicator rather than a short-term trading signal.

The discussion is about whether or not Apple will use Intel to build its lowest-end M-series chips. On Friday, Intel shares saw a 10.3% increase and closed at about $40.56, their strongest finish in over a year despite the stock trading at just $20.22 in January. In 2024, Intel shares fell approximately 60%. Intel stock price. Source: Google Finance Sudden surge in Intel’s stock Intel regained a bit of its momentum in March 2025 after appointing a new CEO , Lip Bu Tan. Since then, the company put efforts into restructuring and has reduced its workforce by 13% quarter over quarter to 88,400 employees by the end of the third quarter. Intel also returned to profitability in Q3 2025 and reported a net income of $4.1 billion despite recording a $16.6 billion loss one year prior. The current surge in stock value is due to renewed attention around whether or not Apple will become a major client of Intel again to manufacture its M-series chips. The buzz began when Ming-Chi Kuo, a well-known analyst with deep ties to Apple’s supply-chain ecosystem, made a public note saying his latest industry surveys show that the “visibility on Intel becoming an advanced-node supplier to Apple has recently improved significantly.” According to Kuo, Apple currently holds a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with Intel and has already received Intel’s “18AP PDK 0.9.1GA.” Intel is expected to deliver the next version of the kit (PDK 1.0/1.1) in early 2026. If all goes well, Intel could begin supplying Apple’s lowest-end M-series chips by mid- to late-2027. It is believed that these chips will work with devices like the MacBook Air and iPad Pro, whose total sales currently sit at approximately 20 million units for 2025, with expectations of 15 to 20 million units in both 2026 and 2027. A successful deal with Apple would revive Intel’s foundry business, now called Intel Foundry Services (IFS), and would also be a step forward in its efforts to regain relevance in advanced manufacturing. Intel’s market revival Earlier this year, Intel reportedly approached Apple about a possible direct investment. Partnering with Intel would be Apple’s way of demonstrating support for the Trump administration’s emphasis on domestic manufacturing and “Made in USA” products. It would also diversify Apple’s supply chain beyond its dependence on TSMC, reducing geopolitical risk associated with Taiwan’s complex relationship with China. The partnership would also lend credibility to Intel’s foundry services, which have faced skepticism from the market about its ability to compete against a tech giant like TSMC. Intel also recently secured major backing from other partners like Nvidia, which invested $5 billion in Intel separately from its foundry business. SoftBank invested around $2 billion targeted at Intel’s data center and foundry operations. The U.S. government reportedly converted approximately $8.9 billion of CHIPS Act support into a 10% ownership stake in the company to boost domestic chip manufacturing. Institutional investors like Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, Norges Bank Investment Management, initiated a new Intel position worth roughly $1.58 billion, representing more than 70 million shares. Polish pension manager PZU increased its Intel stake to make it the third-largest position in its portfolio. Approximately 64.5% of Intel shares are now held by institutional investors and hedge funds. Despite these investments, a large portion of Wall Street does not believe that Intel’s foundry services can catch up with TSMC, which continues to lead the industry in scale, production capacity, and advanced-node technology.

Among those leading the charge on the back of its burgeoning ecosystem, increased developments, and restoration of market confidence due to stability levels being held firmly in place is Cardano (ADA). However, the token that is stealing the thunder isn’t the same old selection of traditional alternatives. Among the new entrants vying for market attention in Q4 is none other than the quickly rising DeFi platform named Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , one of the hottest top crypto assets on the market today. Currently in its presale in Phase 6 at an incredibly high rate of over 95% sold out, the speed at which its presale sale is progressing indicates that its platform in Q4 is going to come out on top. Cardano Signals Its Strongest Macro Breakout in Years Cardano (ADA) is now flashing one of its most exciting breakout setups since its historic breakout in 2020–2021, completing the multi-year falling wedge that marked the top of its long-term bear market by finally breaking out to the upside. While the wedge’s reformation is already in the process of being tested at the top, the area now holds solid support levels instead. Meanwhile, its momentum indicator is in line too by having weekly chart’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) having now finally broke out from its bearish trendline for the first time since 2021. Additionally, the current breakout in Cardano also brings significant buy volume for the first time in over two years. Thus, considering all aspects of its current strength in terms of its breakout range’s strength in terms of market structure, momentum, and finally enough market volumes to not ignore its significance. Hence ADA looks poised for its potential breakout phase if its $0.38–$0.40 level continues supporting. Otherwise, the breakout enthusiasts are projecting targets ranging from $0.85–$1.05 levels for the near term to $1.60–$1.90 levels for the mid-term levels. Hence some few analysts are also projecting its breakout levels to reach $3.50–$5+ levels in the future considering the whole market turns out to be in favor for the whole altcoin season. However, its market enthusiasts having witnessed the whole 2020s bear market in its previous life cycle are now eagerly waiting for its breakout in the whole market considering its previous market performance. Hence for the same reason, market players are now increasingly attracted to some top crypto options like MUTM. Mutuum Finance Presale Sees Widespread Interest Mutuum Finance (MUTM) remains one of the projects in the DeFi niche being closely followed in 2025. Currently, the presale event has exceeded 18,250 participants, managing to raise more than $19.02 million. At the moment, the price for Phase 6 tokens stands at $0.035. Once the presale enters Phase 7, the token price will go higher by 20% to $0.04. This is the last presale phase during which one can buy the tokens at the reduced price. That being said, the aspect that differentiates Mutuum Finance from the other altcoins is its emphasis on adoption. Since it has a road map in place along with developers working on its project, MUTM is now considered the best crypto to invest in for the upcoming market cycle. Open Presale System Fosters Community Development The presale event for the Mutuum Finance token is made in a transparent, fair, and sustainable fashion. 1.82 billion out of the 4 billion token supply of MUTM is allocated for the presale. Currently, in excess of 795 million tokens have been sold. Notably, the presale indicates that there is considerable interest in the sale from both individual and institutional buyers. By giving the initial contributors access to the market of the MUTM platform directly, the presale event is crucial in the process of community engagement and fosters the sustainable growth of the platform. Cardano (ADA) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) appear to be some of the top crypto investments for Q4 2025. At the current rate, the presale of Phase 6 for the MUTM cryptocurrency is already over 95% sold out, having raised $19.02 million from 18,250+ contributors.

55072251,636022,1764378023,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55072251.jpeg,"Bitmine Resumes Ethereum Accumulation: 14,618 ETH Bought in Latest Move",https://bitcoinist.com/bitmine-resumes-ethereum-accumulation-14618-bought/,"Ethereum has reclaimed the $3,000 level after weeks of heavy selling pressure, yet the recovery remains fragile as momentum continues to fade. The market is still dominated by fear, and confidence among retail traders has weakened significantly. Analysts warn that bulls are losing control of the trend, and some are beginning to call for the early stages of a potential bear market. With Ethereum trading nearly 40% below its August all-time high, every move upward is being met with hesitation, and the broader market environment has yet to stabilize. Despite this uncertainty, large players continue to accumulate ETH, offering a contrasting signal to the prevailing bearish sentiment. According to new data from Lookonchain, Bitmine has been consistently buying Ethereum during this downturn, showing no signs of slowing its accumulation strategy. This persistent interest from large holders suggests that institutional and high-net-worth buyers may still see long-term value at current levels, even as short-term traders remain cautious. Bitmine Deepens Accumulation as Ethereum Struggles for Momentum Lookonchain reports that Bitmine has continued its aggressive accumulation strategy, purchasing another 14,618 ETH—worth roughly $44.34 million—a few hours ago. This new acquisition further strengthens Bitmine’s already massive Ethereum position, which now totals 3.436 million ETH. At current prices, their holdings are valued at approximately $10.39 billion, underscoring their long-term conviction despite the ongoing market turbulence. This level of accumulation from a major player stands in sharp contrast to the broader sentiment across the market, where uncertainty and fear persist. Retail investors remain cautious, and many analysts argue that Ethereum’s failure to reclaim momentum above $3,000 signals a weakening trend. However, Bitmine’s continued purchases suggest a fundamentally different outlook—one rooted in long-term valuation rather than short-term volatility. Large, disciplined buyers often accumulate in periods of market weakness, viewing discounted prices as strategic entry points. Bitmine’s behavior mirrors this pattern and could indicate expectations of higher prices in the months ahead. Still, for Ethereum to benefit from this institutional confidence, it must stabilize and build a stronger support base. The coming weeks will reveal whether this sustained whale demand will outweigh broader selling pressure and help ETH break out of its current downtrend. ETH Attempts Recovery but Faces Strong Resistance Ethereum is attempting to recover after weeks of sustained selling pressure, reclaiming the $3,000 level but still struggling to build meaningful momentum. The chart shows ETH bouncing from the recent low near the mid-$2,600s, where a cluster of demand emerged and halted the sharp decline. However, despite this rebound, Ethereum remains below all three major moving averages—the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day—which now act as layered resistance zones. The 50-day SMA is trending downward and has already crossed below the 100-day SMA, signaling a weakening market structure. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA sits slightly above current prices, reinforcing the idea that ETH is still in a vulnerable position. Price action remains choppy, with lower highs forming consistently since the peak in early October, reflecting persistent bearish control. Volume patterns also confirm this cautionary picture. While the recent bounce came with a modest increase in buying activity, it is still far weaker than the selling volume observed during the November capitulation. For a meaningful trend reversal, ETH must break above the $3,300–$3,400 region, reclaim its moving averages, and establish a higher low.

Despite this rebound, fear and uncertainty continue to dominate sentiment, especially following what analysts describe as the largest short-term holder capitulation in Bitcoin’s history. Related Reading: XRP Reserves On Binance Collapse To Record Lows: Investors Move Toward Long-Term Holding This wave of realized losses—fast, aggressive, and record-breaking—has left many investors questioning whether the recent recovery is sustainable or simply a temporary bounce in a broader downtrend. According to new data from Glassnode, the path ahead remains challenging. Analysts explain that Bitcoin must break above the major supply clusters created by top buyers earlier in the cycle if it is to regain meaningful upward momentum. These clusters represent areas where a large number of investors previously bought at higher prices and may now look to exit at breakeven, increasing the likelihood of heavy sell-side pressure as BTC climbs. Bitcoin Faces Critical Supply Barriers Glassnode reports that Bitcoin is now approaching two major supply clusters that will play a decisive role in determining whether the recent rebound can evolve into a sustained recovery. The first cluster sits between $93,000 and $96,000, while the second—much larger and more structurally important—spans $100,000 to $108,000. These zones were formed by heavy buying activity earlier in the cycle and represent areas where many investors are currently underwater or sitting near breakeven. Because of this, Glassnode notes that these ranges typically act as strong resistance, as recent buyers who endured the latest drawdown may choose to sell once the price returns to their entry levels. This dynamic can create temporary supply walls, slowing down momentum even in moments of aggressive recovery. Bitcoin’s ability to break through these clusters will determine whether it can re-establish a path toward a new all-time high or remain trapped under heavy distribution pressure. The market is now entering a critical phase, with traders closely watching how BTC behaves as it approaches these levels. A clean breakout would signal renewed confidence, while rejection could signal that the broader corrective structure is not yet over. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Still Negative: US Institutions Keep Selling Despite Easing Pressure Testing Support After a Sharp Multi-Week Selloff Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows a market attempting to stabilize after one of the most aggressive drawdowns of the cycle. BTC has rebounded to the $91,500 area following a deep wick to the $80K region last week, signaling that buyers are finally stepping in at key support. This rebound coincides with a strong weekly candle showing a long lower shadow, a classic sign of demand absorption during heavy selloffs. However, despite this bounce, the broader structure remains fragile. The price is trading below the 50-week moving average, a level that previously acted as reliable support throughout the bull phase. Losing this dynamic support earlier in the month was a significant technical break, and BTC is now attempting to reclaim it from below—typically a challenging move that often acts as resistance. Related Reading: Ethereum ICO Whale Sells 20,000 ETH ($58M), Raising Questions Over Market Timing The 100-week moving average around the mid-$80K region has proven critical, halting the decline and serving as the primary area where buyers defended the trend. As long as BTC holds above this zone, the broader market avoids confirming a deeper macro reversal. Volume remains elevated, reflecting capitulation-level activity, and the market is now in a decisive phase. A sustained close above $92K–$94K would strengthen recovery prospects, while rejection would risk another retest of the $80K support.

Thi s fo llows the company’s gathering of more than $280 million in total value locked (TVL) ahead of its upcoming launch at the end of this year, according to DefiLlama . The pre-deposit phase spanned three capped vaults holding 225 million USDe, 10,000 ether, and 100 bitcoin. Data from DeFiLlama shows the vaults have reached full capacity. Terminal Finance explained in its X post that “launching just to launch a project goes against our principles,” and that advancing a project in suboptimal conditions would compromise the project’s integrity and sustainability. Some X users applauded the firm for making the bold move. One user said, “Respect for this part, such an approach is not often seen today. Preserving integrity is paramount. Wishing the whole Terminal team all the best.” Others expressed disappointment. One user said, “That’s terrible, definitely Ethena fault that made this converge chain the center of its proposition (which I think was a great idea).” Converge delay blocks Terminal’s ambitious DeFi launch Terminal Finance was designed to serve as the liquidity hub for Converge, which Ethena Labs envisioned as a bridge between traditional finance and decentralized finance through the integration of transaction processing mechanisms. Converge was built to house permissionless DeFi applications and permissioned institutional products, with fast blocktimes, staked validator networks, and yield-bearing stablecoins such as USDe and sUSDe. Terminal’s architecture hybridized an order-book for limit orders with automated market maker (AMM) pools to assure liquidity and facilitate immediate execution. It was also designed to trade key crypto assets alongside tokenized real-world assets. Even before its launch, Terminal Finance had hosted over $280 million in pre-launch deposits across various vaults, demonstrating that investors had faith, with large USDe, WETH, and WBTC deposits, and over 10,000 wallets participating in the pre-launch phase. For the DEX, the official launch was expected to take place in the first quarter of 2025 alongside a token generation incentive event. But the Converge blockchain did not launch as planned, and as a result, the protocol was left without the ecosystem it was established to build around. The team considered several possible pivots, such as switching to a new chain or revising the protocol; however, all had material barriers in the way, including limited support, low asset onboarding potential, and poor long-term prospects. Users secured as Terminal Finance plans open-source exit Terminal Finance informed users that all principal deposits are fully backed (1:1) and can be withdrawn at any time. Prior Pendle positions are still eligible for rewards, including Ethena Sats, sUSDe yields, and Etherfi points. The company also plans to open-source its fully audited codebase, which might allow developers or community projects to reuse or adapt Terminal’s technology. It also illustrates the risk associated with ambitious DeFi projects built on blockchain infrastructure that hasn’t yet been fully rolled out. Terminal Finance says the decision was not easy for them, but it was called for. The company has expressed its disappointment to liquidity providers, ambassadors, and the broader community, but also acknowledged that honesty is key. The team hopes its open-source protocol will enable it to remain credible within the ecosystem while paving the way for future innovations. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

This decision marks a significant change in the UK’s crypto reporting rules as it implies an expansion of the Cryptoasset Reporting Framework (CARF). Sources close to the situation noted that with this new regulation in place, His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the UK’s tax, payments, and customs authority, will acquire automatic access to both local and international crypto information for the first time. The authorities made clear that they adopted this decision to enhance tax compliance ahead of CARF’s first global information exchange, scheduled to take place in 2027. The UK adapts new regulations to enhance the reporting process in the crypto ecosystem The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) established CARF in June 2022, and the official CARF documentation was released to the public in June 2023. This initiative was launched to develop a system that enables the automatic exchange of crypto transaction information between tax authorities worldwide. The rules set forth by CARF require crypto service providers to conduct background checks, verify the identities of each user, and submit a report with detailed transaction information annually . Notably, the OECD initiative was designed to focus primarily on transactions carried out across borders. Hence, sources pointed out that any crypto transactions taking place entirely within the UK will not be classified among these automatic reporting requirements. This information was cited from a policy paper published by HMRC. Initially, the government intended to halt crypto from being viewed as an “off-CRS” asset class. This motive prompted it to include domestic users in this framework with the hope that it will finally achieve this goal. According to reports, this move indicates that the government aims to ensure that crypto transactions are not overlooked, like traditional financial accounts under the Common Reporting Standard. Regarding the new crypto reporting regulations, UK officials expressed their belief that this combined approach will streamline the reporting processes for crypto firms, while presenting a more comprehensive set of data to tax authorities, which is useful in identifying noncompliance and evaluating taxpayer responsibilities. Additionally, the country introduced a new tax plan called “no gain, no loss” earlier this week. Reports noted that this plan will delay capital gains taxes for decentralized finance (DeFi) users until they decide to sell their tokens. When it was made available for feedback, the new tax plan reportedly received positive comments from the local industry. Governments globally embrace updates in their tax regulations The UK’s move comes at a time when governments globally are making efforts to update their tax regulations to improve the tracking process of digital asset activities as cryptocurrency becomes more popular in finance. For instance, reports indicate that South Korea strengthened its tax regulations in October. At this time, the National Tax Service announced that it would seize cryptocurrencies stored in cold wallets and conduct home searches for hardware wallets. This would only apply if they suspect that taxpayers were hiding digital assets to escape tax payments. Another example is Spain. Recent reports stated that the country’s parliamentary group submitted a proposal aimed at raising the top tax rate on crypto profits to 47%, according to information from a local news outlet. With this adjustment in place, crypto earnings would be classified under the general income tax bracket, and corporate investors would face a flat 30% tax rate. On the other hand, Switzerland announced on Thursday, November 27, that it has postponed the start of automatic information sharing on cryptocurrencies with foreign tax authorities until 2027, while deciding which countries it will share data with. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that CARF r ules will still be incorporated into Swiss law on January 1. However, their implementation has been postponed, as transitional measures are being prepared to assist local crypto companies in complying. In the US, Representative Warren Davidson submitted a bill in November that would allow Americans to pay their federal taxes with Bitcoin, transferring the payment into a national BTC reserve. The proposed plan, known as the Bitcoin for America Act, would exempt such payments from capital gains taxes by treating the transferred Bitcoin as neither a gain nor a loss for the taxpayer.

While fear continues to dominate sentiment, new data suggests that market participation has remained surprisingly strong throughout the year. According to a CryptoQuant report by Arab Chain, Ethereum’s real-time trading volume across all major platforms highlights a pivotal period in its 2025 trajectory. Throughout the year, ETH’s monthly trading activity fluctuated widely. Volume initially dipped into the $280–$380 billion range during the market’s early-year slowdown. However, a major resurgence followed mid-year, driven by heightened volatility, renewed institutional activity, and broader macro shifts. This surge pushed Ethereum’s total monthly trading volume to a cycle peak of over $599 billion in August—one of the strongest liquidity expansions in recent years. Although activity cooled afterward, the market remained far from inactive. By the end of November, total trading volume still hovered around $375 billion, underscoring persistent engagement from both retail and institutional participants despite bearish price action. Institutional Activity and Exchange Liquidity Strengthen Ethereum’s Market Structure Arab Chain explains that the sharp rise in Ethereum’s trading volume reflects significantly improved market liquidity and strong trader engagement amid rapid price swings throughout 2025. Volatility has been a defining feature of the year, and macroeconomic developments—from shifting futures positioning to broader risk sentiment—have amplified trading behavior. Large traders, in particular, have played an increasingly influential role, responding to futures market dynamics and macro shifts with high-volume transactions that fueled liquidity spikes. Within this environment, Binance has remained the central hub for Ethereum trading. Data shows that ETH spot volume on Binance alone reached around $198 billion in November, underscoring the exchange’s unmatched influence over real-time liquidity flows and short-term price discovery. Both institutional and retail traders continue to rely heavily on Binance’s depth, efficiency, and tight spreads, reinforcing its role as the dominant marketplace for major crypto assets. Meanwhile, Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have provided a parallel channel for institutional involvement. ETF trading volume climbed to nearly $35 billion in November, demonstrating substantial interest from traditional investors seeking regulated exposure to ETH. This structured liquidity has added a stabilizing layer to the ecosystem, further strengthening Ethereum’s overall market profile during a period of heightened uncertainty. Testing Support After a Deep Multi-Week Correction Ethereum is attempting to stabilize above the $3,000 level after a sharp multi-week decline that pushed the asset to its lowest point since early 2025. The weekly chart shows that ETH has bounced from a key confluence zone near the 200-week moving average, a historically important region where long-term investors often step in. This rebound suggests that buyers are defending structural support, but momentum remains fragile. The chart reveals a clear breakdown from the mid-2025 uptrend, with price slipping below the 50-week and 100-week moving averages. These moving averages have now turned into overhead resistance, reflecting a shift in market sentiment. For ETH to regain bullish traction, reclaiming these moving averages will be crucial. Despite the current bounce, the broader structure shows lower highs forming since the September peak, keeping Ethereum in a vulnerable position. Bulls must protect the $3,000 region and push toward a higher low to avoid a deeper retracement. The coming weeks will determine whether this is a temporary relief rally or the beginning of a larger recovery trend.

This isn’t just wishful thinking – EthHub co-founder Anthony Sassano recently revealed that the Ethereum gas limit could triple next year, potentially revolutionizing how we interact with the world’s second-largest blockchain. What Does the Ethereum Gas Limit Increase Mean for You? The Ethereum gas limit represents the maximum computational work each block can handle. Currently sitting at 60 million units after a recent increase from 45 million, developers are now discussing pushing this boundary even further. Anthony Sassano explained on the Bankless podcast that some advocates want a fivefold expansion, with Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin supporting this ambitious vision. How Will This Transform Ethereum Transactions? The proposed changes focus on repricing network activities to optimize efficiency. For example, a native ETH transfer currently costs 21,000 gas units. Developers suggest reducing this to just 6,000 gas. This specific adjustment alone could slash transaction costs by over 70%. When applied across various operations, it creates room for a substantial Ethereum gas limit increase without compromising network security. Consider these immediate benefits: Dramatically lower transaction fees for all users Increased network capacity for dApps and DeFi protocols Enhanced scalability without layer-2 dependency Improved user experience for newcomers Why Is This Ethereum Gas Limit Discussion Happening Now? The timing couldn’t be more crucial. Ethereum continues to face scalability challenges as adoption grows. Recent network upgrades have laid the foundation for more significant changes. The successful increase from 45 million to 60 million gas units demonstrated that controlled expansion is possible.

While increasing the Ethereum gas limit offers clear benefits, it also presents challenges that developers must address: Network security considerations during transition Validator hardware requirements and capabilities Potential impact on node operators Long-term sustainability of increased throughput However, the Ethereum community has consistently overcome technical hurdles throughout its history. The same innovative spirit that brought us proof-of-stake transition now drives this Ethereum gas limit optimization effort. How Could This Impact the Broader Crypto Ecosystem? A higher Ethereum gas limit doesn’t just benefit ETH holders. The entire cryptocurrency space stands to gain from a more efficient Ethereum network. As the foundation for countless DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and dApps, Ethereum’s performance affects millions of users worldwide. This proposed Ethereum gas limit expansion could accelerate mainstream adoption by making blockchain technology more accessible and affordable. What’s the Timeline for These Changes? While Anthony Sassano mentioned next year as a potential timeframe, exact implementation dates depend on community consensus and thorough testing. The Ethereum development process prioritizes security over speed, ensuring any Ethereum gas limit changes undergo rigorous evaluation. However, the strong support from key figures like Vitalik Buterin suggests this proposal has serious momentum. Conclusion: A New Era for Ethereum Accessibility The potential tripling of the Ethereum gas limit represents more than just a technical upgrade – it signals a commitment to making blockchain technology truly accessible. By significantly reducing costs and increasing capacity, Ethereum could welcome millions of new users who previously found transaction fees prohibitive. This evolution demonstrates the Ethereum community’s relentless drive toward creating a more inclusive digital economy. Frequently Asked Questions What is the current Ethereum gas limit? The Ethereum mainnet recently increased its block gas limit from 45 million to 60 million units, representing the current capacity for computational work per block. How much could transaction costs decrease? Specific operations like native ETH transfers could see cost reductions of over 70%, dropping from 21,000 to 6,000 gas units according to proposed changes. When might these changes happen? EthHub co-founder Anthony Sassano suggested these Ethereum gas limit increases could occur next year, though exact timing depends on community consensus and testing. Will this affect network security? Developers prioritize security in all upgrades. Any Ethereum gas limit changes will undergo rigorous testing to ensure network integrity remains uncompromised. Who supports these proposed changes? Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin and numerous core developers support increasing the Ethereum gas limit, with some advocating for even more ambitious fivefold expansions.

Amundi Launches Tokenized Fund On Ethereum As per an announcement on the official website, Amundi has launched the first tokenized share of one of its money market funds. Headquartered in France, Amundi is an asset manager that serves more than 100 million users worldwide and manages over $2.3 trillion in assets. It’s the largest traditional asset manager in Europe and among the top 10 globally. The latest news suggests that the asset manager is now moving into blockchain-based tokenization. A “tokenized” asset refers to the digital representation of a real-world asset, like a stock or metal. “The tokenization of assets is a transformation set to accelerate in the coming years around the world,” said Amundi’s Jean-Jacques Barbéris. The fund that Amundi has tokenized is its AMUNDI FUNDS CASH EUR money market fund. According to the website description, this fund seeks to deliver a return in line with the European Central Bank rate. The first transaction of the tokenized fund occurred on November 4th. The product is now distributed in a hybrid manner, meaning that users can access it via both the traditional and tokenized share routes. Amundi is leveraging the Ethereum blockchain for transactions of its tokenized fund. Ethereum , whose native token ETH is the second largest digital asset by market cap, hosts a vibrant ecosystem of DeFi and tokenized projects, thanks to its smart contracts system. Amundi’s tokenization move comes in collaboration with CACEIS, a major asset servicing firm in Europe. “CACEIS provides the technology and infrastructure for tokenizing fund units, digital portfolios for investors, and the digital order platform for subscriptions and redemptions,” said the announcement. Unlike traditional transaction systems, blockchains like Ethereum offer 24/7 availability year round, with transfers that tend to be fast and cheap. Amundi noted that the tokenization move will bring these benefits to investors and fund unit operators. Jean-Pierre Michalowski, CACEIS CEO, said: This is a decisive step towards achieving our goal of offering 24/7 subscription and redemption services for investment fund units payable in stable coins (EMT) or central bank digital currency when it becomes available. This new move isn’t the only digital-asset-related initiative by Amundi. As reported by The Big Whale co-founder Grégory Raymond in an X post in October, the European asset manager is preparing to launch its first Bitcoin exchange-traded notes (ETNs) in early 2026. ETNs are investment vehicles that track the price of an underlying asset and allow investors to gain indirect exposure to its movements. “For Europe, Amundi’s entry is a game-changer,” noted Raymond. “It could propel the crypto ETP market to another level, and above all, bring the institutional legitimacy that Bitcoin still lacked in the Old Continent.” ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $3,000, up more than 11% over the last week.",Ethereum|Amundi|blockchain|blockchain fund|crypto|ETH|ETHUSDT|tokenized fund,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-29 03:00:29

He was referring to March 2020, when global pandemic fears caused Bitcoin’s price to tumble from around $8,000 to below $5,000. Current Setup Mirrors Extreme Past Conditions Dragosch highlighted that Bitcoin’s current conditions mirror the extreme risk-reward scenario seen during the early COVID period. He noted that the cryptocurrency is “pricing in the most bearish global growth outlook since 2022,” pointing to aggressive quantitative tightening from the US Federal Reserve and the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. “Bitcoin is essentially pricing in a recessionary growth environment,” Dragosch said, adding that the asset has already accounted for “a lot of the bad news.” US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reassured citizens on Sunday that the United States is not at risk of entering a recession in 2026. Bitcoin Struggles Despite Market Hopes Bitcoin’s price has underperformed relative to market expectations over the past month. After hitting all-time highs of $125,100 on October 5, the cryptocurrency entered a downtrend following a $19 billion liquidation event on October 10. This sell-off occurred shortly after US President Donald Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese goods, further impacting market sentiment. Bitcoin fell below the psychological $100,000 level on November 13 and has yet to reclaim it. The price briefly dipped under $90,000 on November 20, though it quickly rebounded above this level a few days later. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin has declined 17.33% over the past 30 days. Continued Adoption Despite the pullback, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are continuing to be adopted in the real world. For example, cryptocurrencies are continuing to be used for secure withdrawals in crypto casinos – and this adoption is unlikely to slow down even in the face of a bear market. Even countries such as the UAE, where gambling has long been banned, are starting embrace online casinos and blockchain-based gambling platforms. For instance, the GCGRA recently authorized Play 971 as the first online casino in the UAE . Optimism from Macro Drivers Dragosch believes global growth is likely to recover, supported by the effects of preceding monetary stimulus. He compared the current environment to the post-COVID period, suggesting similar macro forces could support growth well into 2026. “I genuinely think we’re staring at a similar macro setup right now,” Dragosch said. Market Participants Eye a Rebound Not all crypto investors are convinced that a prolonged bear market has begun. Crypto trader Alessio Rastani told Cointelegraph that the recent price drop may not indicate the start of a long-term downturn.

The Financial Services Agency (FSA) is deliberating on a legal amendment that could reclassify crypto from a payment tool to a “financial product” in order to boost investor protection amid crypto accounts quadrupling over five years. On November 26, the FSA working group reviewing crypto regulation convened for the sixth time to discuss persistent consumer complaints, a rise in overseas fraud schemes, and the growing threat of sophisticated cyber attacks. According to discussions, there are approximately 350 crypto-related consumer complaints on average each month. The shift from the Payment Services Act (PSA) to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA) would trigger rigorous disclosure rules, insider trading protections, and criminal penalties for crypto businesses. Crypto tax relief The working group also suggests introducing a flat 20% tax on crypto gains, bringing them in line with stock trading. Crypto profits are currently treated as miscellaneous income and taxed at 15% to 55%, depending on a taxpayer’s income bracket. Tatsuo Oku from the Blockchain Promotion Association (BCCC) said that with the number of crypto accounts growing to 13 million in Japan, he anticipates demand to expand further if tax rules were aligned with financial products. Rintaro Kawai, CEO of ANAP Holdings, which operates a bitcoin trading desk in Japan, warned that Japan is falling “significantly behind” global Bitcoin adoption and said the country “has no future” without bold tax reforms. Crypto identity crisis Emeritus Professor Yoshikazu Yamaoki from Shinshu University said the current overhaul reflects growing recognition that the crypto market increasingly resembles a securities ecosystem rather than a payments niche. “The prices of crypto assets like Ethereum or Bitcoin fluctuate far too much. So they don’t really function as payment instruments,” he explained. “The people who buy these are aiming for capital gains – basically to buy low and sell high. And when you aim for capital gains, that essentially makes them the same as securities.” Oku from BCCC said that while a shift into the FIEA regime would strengthen market trust through stricter disclosures, it could also impose severe securities-level compliance burdens and spur mergers among weaker exchanges. Regulators are also considering a model that classifies tokens based on whether they have an identifiable issuer, such as a company or foundation. Kawai believes the key problem in Japan’s reclassification debate is the failure to distinguish Bitcoin from all other tokens. Globally, Bitcoin is treated separately because it has no issuer and operates more like a decentralized asset class, while tokens such as Ethereum or XRP have identifiable development entities. “If Japan does not adopt this distinction, he said, the regulatory framework will tilt toward traditional financial institutions, banks, and brokerages that can absorb heavier compliance demands, rather than supporting the broader crypto ecosystem.” Japan’s patchwork legal approach The PSA has undergone four major amendments since it came into effect in 2010. The first revision in 2016 created a legal category for virtual currencies following the rise of Bitcoin, while a 2019 overhaul renamed them “crypto assets” and brought investment-type token offerings under securities rules. A subsequent 2020 amendment reorganized fund transfer services and strengthened user protection, and a 2022 reform established one of the world’s first regulatory frameworks for stablecoins, introducing the concept of “electronic payment instruments.” Japan can’t keep up with crypto development The FSA’s working group all agree that the crypto market’s rapid expansion has outpaced existing safeguards and is no longer capable of preventing fraud or ensuring market integrity. Yamaoki said the rules governing crypto have become too fragmented and resemble a “patchwork” of amendments since the collapse of Japan-based Mt. Gox in 2014. He said whitepapers, the documents that outline how tokens work, are not required to meet any accuracy standards in Japan, which has allowed issuers to make broad claims without legal liability. He said current technical disclosures remain inadequate compared to traditional financial products despite the presence of self-regulation by industry groups such as the Japan Virtual and Crypto Assets Exchange Association (JVCEA). It’s another reason why the government now wants to bring crypto under the country’s securities law. Crypto self-regulation falls short Japan’s crypto industry, which is still in its infancy, is struggling to build the same kind of regulatory discipline that governs traditional finance. Yamaoki argues the sector’s main self-regulatory body, JVCEA, which launched in 2018 with 32 staff, is no match for the 373 people who run the Japan Securities Dealers Association (JSDA), which has shaped the industry for five decades. “Japan’s crypto industry is too young to regulate itself, but policymakers want to model it after the country’s powerful securities watchdog.” He hopes reclassifying crypto assets from a payment instrument to a security could also designate JVCEA as a self-regulatory body under the more powerful FIEA, which would give it broader disciplinary and investor protection powers. “We do need to consider the impact on small providers, but it’s also important to ensure transparency and investor protection,” Yamaoki said. “Of course, it will cost small providers a lot, but I think market development is more important.” Sharpen your strategy with mentorship + daily ideas - 30 days free access to our trading program",Regulation|Bitcoin|Crypto|Ethereum|FSA|Japan|tax,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-29 03:09:28

The token is issued on Tron and fully audited by ConsenSys Diligence, with future expansion slated to include Ethereum support. The issuer, OJSC Virtual Asset Issuer, is a state-owned entity under the Ministry of Finance, operating within the legal framework established by the 2022 Law on Virtual Assets of the Kyrgyz Republic. The initiative represents a first-of-its-kind model in Central Asia, merging sovereign oversight with blockchain transparency. The launch ceremony was attended by Sadyr Japarov, President of the Kyrgyz Republic, Almaz Baketaev, Minister of Finance, and Biibolot Mamytov, CEO of Gold Dollar, the project’s operator. During the event, the dignitaries pressed a symbolic “Launch Issuance” button, officially initiating the circulation of USDKG tokens. The issuance of USDKG is carried out by a company with 100% state participation, ensuring a high level of investor trust and institutional reliability. A total of 50,000,000 USDKG tokens have been issued, each fully backed by physical gold reserves. Operational control — including gold management — is delegated to a private company registered in the Kyrgyz Republic, under a contractual agreement with the USDKG issuer. This separation of responsibilities ensures independent operational oversight and positions USDKG outside the classification of a Central Bank Digital Currency ( CBDCs ). The company responsible for managing USDKG’s gold reserves, has outlined plans to expand the backing to $500 million in the next phase, with a long-term target of $2 billion. The stablecoin is fully compliant with FATF KYC/AML standards, and redemptions require standard identity verification. It is designed to facilitate financial inclusion. Kyrgyzstan is among the first nations in the region to establish a comprehensive digital-asset regulatory framework , setting a precedent for state-supervised virtual currencies. Government representatives emphasized that such initiatives aim to enhance economic transparency and trade efficiency, rather than serve any geopolitical agenda. Officials also noted that USDKG complements, rather than competes with, the national monetary system. The project reframes traditional narratives around state-issued and commodity-backed digital assets. Its gold collateral serves as a verifiable, inflation-resistant foundation, aligning with a growing market preference for transparent, real-asset-backed stablecoins. By combining physical reserves with on-chain verification, USDKG introduces a model of measurable stability uncommon in the current stablecoin landscape. The state-backed structure provides a clear regulatory framework built on accountability and public oversight. The Kyrgyz initiative underscores a broader trend toward responsible digital-asset innovation in emerging markets. The government’s focus on regulatory discipline, transparency, and tangible reserves signals a pragmatic approach to blockchain-based modernization. With USDKG, Kyrgyzstan positions itself as a regional first-mover in regulated asset-backed digital currencies — both bridging traditional finance and blockchain infrastructure and maintaining full sovereign oversight.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-11-29 03:19:31

This massive stablecoin creation represents one of the largest single mints we’ve seen recently, and it’s sending ripples across the entire digital asset ecosystem. But what does this enormous USDC minted event really mean for investors and the broader market? Why Does 250 Million USDC Minted Matter? When we see such a substantial amount of USDC minted, it typically signals significant market activity ahead. Stablecoins like USDC serve as the lifeblood of cryptocurrency trading, providing liquidity and stability in an otherwise volatile market. The fact that 250 million USDC was minted suggests that major players are preparing for substantial moves. This isn’t just ordinary market activity – we’re talking about serious capital deployment. The USDC minted today could represent: Institutional investors positioning for major trades DeFi protocols expanding their liquidity pools Market makers preparing for increased trading volume Potential large-scale token purchases or sales How Does USDC Minting Actually Work? Understanding the process behind how USDC gets minted helps explain why this event is so significant. When someone wants to create new USDC, they deposit equivalent US dollars into reserved bank accounts. Then, the USDC Treasury mints the corresponding amount of digital tokens. This ensures each USDC remains pegged 1:1 with the US dollar. The recent 250 million USDC minted follows this exact process, meaning $250 million in real dollars now backs these new tokens. This massive injection of stablecoin liquidity can dramatically impact trading pairs across exchanges and DeFi platforms. What Market Impact Can We Expect from This USDC Minted Event? Historical patterns suggest that large-scale stablecoin minting often precedes significant price movements. When we see substantial amounts of USDC minted, it usually indicates that whales or institutions are preparing to: Enter new positions in major cryptocurrencies Provide liquidity for upcoming token launches Hedge against existing portfolio positions Capitalize on arbitrage opportunities The timing of this USDC minted event could be particularly telling. Market participants should watch for increased trading volume and potential price volatility in major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum as this new capital enters the ecosystem. Should Retail Investors Adjust Their Strategies? While institutional moves involving large amounts of USDC minted might seem distant from retail trading, they actually create important signals for all market participants. The 250 million USDC minted today suggests that sophisticated players see opportunities in the current market environment. However, it’s crucial to remember that correlation doesn’t equal causation. Just because we see substantial USDC minted doesn’t guarantee specific price movements. Smart investors use these signals as one piece of their overall market analysis rather than making decisions based solely on minting activity. Conclusion: Reading Between the Lines of Stablecoin Minting The revelation that 250 million USDC was minted provides a fascinating glimpse into the sophisticated machinery of cryptocurrency markets. This substantial USDC minted event demonstrates the growing maturity of digital assets and the increasing role of stablecoins in market dynamics. As the crypto ecosystem continues evolving, understanding these signals becomes increasingly valuable for informed decision-making. Frequently Asked Questions What does it mean when USDC is minted? When USDC is minted, it means new tokens are created by depositing equivalent US dollars into reserved accounts, expanding the total supply of the stablecoin. Why would someone mint 250 million USDC? Such large amounts are typically minted by institutions, exchanges, or large investors preparing for significant trading activity, liquidity provision, or capital deployment. Does USDC minting affect cryptocurrency prices? While not directly causing price changes, large USDC minting can indicate upcoming market moves and provide additional liquidity that may influence trading patterns. How is USDC different from other stablecoins when minted? USDC maintains full dollar reserves and undergoes regular audits, providing transparency about the backing of newly minted tokens. Can retail investors participate in USDC minting? While individuals can mint smaller amounts through authorized platforms, large-scale minting like 250 million USDC is typically done by institutional partners. Is large USDC minting a bullish or bearish signal? It’s generally seen as neutral to slightly bullish, indicating capital preparing to enter crypto markets, though context and market conditions determine the actual impact.

Christine Lagarde , who leads the ECB, told a Slovak television channel JOJ24 on Friday that officials made good choices at their latest gatherings. “The interest rates we settled on at the last meetings are, in my view, set correctly,” she said during the broadcast. She added that the bank finds itself in a strong spot considering how inflation has been brought back down. ECB’s Lagarde in a television broadcast. Source: JOJ24 Lagarde did point out some worries on the horizon. Price pressures could start climbing again if the United States decides to raise tariffs or if problems pop up with supply chains around the world. Still, she noted that possible threats to stable prices have gotten smaller. The comments show how satisfied ECB leaders feel about where things stand now. Inflation numbers are hanging around the 2% mark that the bank aims for, while the economy has held up better than many thought it would against American tariff policies. When officials gather in December, most don’t expect they’ll need to change rates. New predictions coming out every three months might spark some conversation if they show inflation falling short of what the bank wants. Notes from the October meeting revealed that some official s wo rried about this happening, though they felt their current approach could handle unexpected problems. Luis de Guindos, who serves as vice president of the ECB, said this wee k he only sees a “limited” chance that price growth ends up too weak. He called the current rate level of 2% “the correct one.” Philip Lane, the chief economist, mentioned that wages aren’t growing as fast anymore, which should help slow down costs outside of energy that are still rising faster than preferred. Growth expectations exceed predictions – Lagarde When talking about the broader economy, Lagarde sai d th e eurozone has shown more strength than anyone anticipated, despite big changes happening worldwide. “The situation has exceeded our expectations,” she explained. Looking ahead, she sai d th e bank expects growth of 0.9% at the start of 2025, jumping to 1.2% by September. She wouldn’t be shocked if the actual growth rate turns out even higher before the year ends. Germany has been going through rough times, and France has been dealing with budget fights in its government. But Lagarde stayed upbeat about it all. “I’m unequivocally optimistic — that’s just my nature,” she said. “In a world undergoing transformation, it’s necessary to act quickly, stay perceptive, but also remain optimistic. So, I always see the glass as half full rather than half empty.” Mixed pictur e ac ross member nations New information release d Fr iday backed up the idea that both growth and inflation in the eurozone are moving along a stable path. This supports what many economists think – that the ECB won’t be cutting rates anytime soon. Growth has surprised people by holding strong despite uncertainty over trade policies, helped partly by a job market where companies are still hiring. Inflation has stayed close to 2% throughout the year, matching what forecasters said would happen months ago. Different countries show wildly different results. Spain’s economy is booming while Germany can’t seem to shake off years of barely moving forward. But when you put all the numbers together, they point to steady inflation and continued growth, even if it’s not particularly exciting. Inflation stayed flat at 0.8% in France, picked up speed to 2.6% in Germany, eased down slightly to 3.1% in Spain, and dropped to 1.1% from 1.3% in Italy.

55078192,636610,1764388835,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55078192.jpeg,House Democrats Allege Trump Administration Is ‘World’s Most Corrupt Crypto Startup Operation’ – Report,https://bitcoinist.com/house-democrats-trump-most-corrupt-crypto-operation/,"Democratic lawmakers from the US House of Representatives have accused President Donald Trump and his administration of using the White House to enrich the presidential family through their crypto businesses, calling on Congress to fight corruption. House Democrats Call Out ‘New Age of Corruption’ In a recent report from the House Judiciary Committee, Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin claimed that President Trump had allegedly “exploited” the presidency and transformed the White House into “a personal money-making operation” that has added billions of dollars to his net worth through his crypto ventures. The 27-page document, named “Trump, Crypto, and a New Age of Corruption,” compiled multiple news media outlet reports affirming that the US President has seen his family’s crypto holdings surge to $11.6 billion since he stepped into office in January, making over $800 million from the sale of digital assets in the first half of 2025. As reported by Bitcoinist, a Financial Times investigation released in October claimed that the Trump family’s crypto fortune has surged to over $1 billion from his multiple digital asset ventures since his return to the White House. The investigation explained that Trump’s digital asset businesses have significantly boosted the US President’s net worth on paper by billions of dollars, but only calculated the potential income from the realized profits of World Liberty Financial’s WLFI token and USD1 stablecoin, and the official TRUMP and MELANIA memecoins. According to FT calculations, the TRUMP and MELANIA memecoins made around $362 million and $65 million, respectively, for a total of $427 million in sales and trading fees. Moreover, the WLFI token had generated approximately $550 million by the time of the investigation, while the USD1 stablecoin, which recorded $2.71 billion in total sales, potentially $42 million. “Donald Trump has turned the Oval Office into the world’s most corrupt crypto startup operation, minting staggering personal fortunes for him and his family in less than a year.” Representative Raskin affirmed in a Press Release. “We don’t know where all the money is coming from yet, but America has never seen corruption on this scale take place inside the White House. This Report shows how Trump’s so-called ‘pro-crypto agenda’ is just one more Trump family self-enrichment plan, built on pay-to-play deals and corrupt foreign interests seeking secret channels of access and influence,” he continued. Trump’s Crypto Ventures Expose ‘Weaknesses’ Of US System Raskin also stated that the Trump administration has “dismantled” federal oversight and safeguards that were set to protect Americans from fraud, scams, and financial exploitation. “Trump has been pardoning criminals who commit fraud through crypto and dismantling the regulations that protect legitimate American investors.” The report presented a list of actions that advanced “Trump and his family’s personal financial interests at the expense of the law, ethics, and national security.” The evidence exposed in the document included claims that the President’s crypto ventures have “attracted substantial investments from foreign nationals and state-linked entities seeking to curry favor with the Administration.” Last week, Democratic Senators expressed concerns about potential national security risks related to World Liberty Financial over token sales allegedly linked to illicit actors. In a letter, the lawmakers requested that Attorney General Pam Bondi and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent investigate allegations that the Trump-backed company had sold tokens to sanctioned entities or individuals with ties to illicit actors in Russia and North Korea. They also argued that World Liberty Financial and its token “lacks adequate safeguards to prevent bad actors from moving funds or gaining influence over its governance,” which raises concerns over a potential conflict of interest. The Committee’s report highlighted that the Trump Administration has paused or ended most investigations and enforcement actions involving major crypto companies and disbanded multiple federal-level crypto enforcement units. In addition, it expressed concern about the controversial pardons issue to key industry players, like Binance’s co-founder, Changpeng Zhao. Ultimately, the document warned that Trump’s crypto moves seemingly expose “severe weaknesses” in the US’s campaign finance, conflict-of-interest, and anti-bribery laws. “Congress must expose this dangerous grift, and defend the rule of law against the profiteers and criminals who would destroy it,” Raskin concluded.",Crypto News|Crypto Holdings|House Democrats|Melania|President Donald Trump|Trump|Trump Family|US Congress|USD1|WLFI|WLFI price|WLFIUSDT|World Liberty Financial,EN,0,0,ASIA|REGULATION|SPONSORED|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-29 04:00:35

It’s down by 3% but this is quite insignificant compared to other digital assets, such as BTC, ETH, BNB, and SOL, all of which have plunged by more than 15% in the same timeframe. On a weekly scale, PI has even climbed by 13%, which has positioned it as the 59th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap as of press time. Consequently, we decided to ask ChatGPT about what could lie ahead in the next week for the token. What’s Next, PI? Perhaps a significant portion of PI’s latest gains could be attributed to some of the updates announced by the team in the past few weeks. The first involved the Pi App Studio and aims to allow newbies as well as more advanced developers to enhance the editing procedures for their applications. Another one outlined earlier this week came in the form of a partnership between Pi Network and CiDi Games, which targets the gaming audience. Aside from these fundamental upgrades within the ecosystem itself, which are likely to impact the underlying asset, ChatGPT also highlighted the technical aspects of PI. It said that the token holds firmly above the first short-term support at $0.23, as buyers have “repeatedly stepped in during dips.” However, the key resistance remains around $0.26-$0.27, which was tested in October but didn’t give in for long. If it falls, ChatGPT said PI will head into a prolonged bull phase, with targets of up to $0.33 in the next week or so. Another rejection, though, could lead to a new drop to $0.20, especially if the $0.23 support cracks. Gradual Upside OpenAI’s solution believes PI is among the few altcoins that target “gradual upside” rather than explosive but short-term rallies, which have happened in the past but each resulted in a subsequent and violent correction. It described it as “one of the most resilient tokens in the market, and technicals suggest it may continue outperforming other altcoins.” The most likely scenario for the following week would be a sideways trading phase between $0.24 and $0.28. The bull case envisions a surge to the $0.33 target mentioned above, while the worst-case scenario, unless there’s a black swan event, would be a dip to $0.23. For now, though, ChatGPT remains optimistic about PI’s future price moves, saying, “as long as it holds above $0.23, the path toward $0.28-$0.20 remains open.” The post Pi Network (PI) Price Predictions for the Week Ahead appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Pi Network (PI),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-11-29 04:55:50

The broader market has struggled to support momentum, and PEPE coin price today reflects that shift with heightened volatility and weaker sentiment. Despite brief intraday recoveries, the overall trend continues to lean downward, and many holders are questioning how long this phase may last. As this plays out, analysts tracking early-stage opportunities are beginning to highlight Noomez ($NNZ), a project gaining steady demand as its presale advances through key stages. Pepe Price Today – What the Latest Market Data Signals Pepe is currently trading around $0.0004731, moving within a 24-hour range of $0.0004598 to $0.0004843. Market cap sits near $1.998 billion, supported by high liquidity and a significant 24-hour volume of $322.94 million. The wider picture shows more pressure than progress. The sentiment rating is bearish, the Fear & Greed Index sits at 25 (Extreme Fear), and volatility remains very high at 15.46%. Price outlook ranges used by many traders: Short-term: $0.00050–$0.00054 Mid-term: $0.00057–$0.00060 if sentiment improves Long-term: A move back toward cycle highs only if volatility resets and risk conditions stabilize While the PEPE crypto price today attracts strong volume, the broader data points toward an asset still fighting against sustained sell-side pressure. Why PEPE’s Correction Is Deepening PEPE continues to show the same pattern that has shaped the past several weeks, sharp upside spikes followed by slower but heavier pullbacks that drive the price back into familiar ranges. Traders watching these cycles often describe them as rallies without conviction, and the data supports that view. The asset has underperformed against both Bitcoin and Ethereum over the past month, sliding -9.47% against ETH and -15.81% against BTC. Liquidity remains strong, but the lack of follow-through has created hesitation among traders expecting a more decisive recovery. Meme-driven assets also tend to amplify broader market fear, and with sentiment sitting in “Extreme Fear,” capital naturally searches for alternatives with clearer momentum. Until a major catalyst appears or the overall market stabilizes, PEPE may continue drifting through this corrective phase. Pro Tip: Watch PEPE’s support zones, but track each Noomez stage, early entries in rising-stage curves often capture the strongest upside. Why Traders Are Rotating Toward $NNZ During PEPE Weakness While PEPE consolidates under pressure, attention is shifting toward Noomez ($NNZ), a structured early-stage project currently progressing through Stage 5 of its presale at $0.0000230. The presale has already attracted 213 holders and raised $46,462.50, with Stage 5 set to expire in just over a day. Each stage lasts seven days or until its allocation sells out, and any unsold tokens are burned instantly, tightening the supply as the presale advances. With all 28 stages clearly mapped out and a final price of $0.0028, Noomez gives traders a transparent view of how pricing evolves. The Noom Gauge tracks real-time progress through each stage, and many buyers monitor it closely to position before higher rounds unlock. Noomez: Structured Stages, Vault Rewards, and Early Momentum Noomez is gaining traction because its model creates a steady flow of activity. Each completed stage lights up the Gauge, pushing the presale closer to major milestones like Stage 14 and Stage 28, where Vault events distribute large token rewards to one wallet through a transparent draw system. The Stage X Million Airdrop adds another incentive, awarding one buyer per stage a token amount equal to the stage number in millions. Early participants can also stake for up to 66% APY, while the 10% referral bonus rewards both the buyer and the referrer. Multi-chain purchase options, including ETH, BTC, BSC, SOL, make the presale accessible to a wide range of traders. As the transition to Stage 6 approaches, Noomez stands out as a rare early-stage project showing consistent forward momentum, something Pepe has struggled to match during its latest correction.

The concept compels digital asset providers, including exchanges, to provide precise financial information about UK taxpayers. Major Shift In Crypto Trading Oversight According to the Financial Times, cryptocurrency holders have been cautioned that, starting January 1, 2026, major cryptocurrency exchanges will be mandated to collect extensive transaction records from their UK customers. This includes crucial details such as purchase prices, selling amounts, and profits accrued from these transactions, as part of a broader initiative to combat tax avoidance. His Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (HMRC) will gain further visibility into the financial activities of cryptocurrency holders as these exchanges are tasked with recording and eventually sharing this information directly with the tax authority. By 2027, HMRC will receive these detailed reports. Experts have issued a warning to individuals trading in digital currencies—from Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to lesser-known tokens—to ensure they are accurately reporting their profits in their self-assessment tax returns. Seb Maley, CEO of tax insurance provider Qdos, emphasized that this development represents a fundamental shift in how digital asset trading is monitored from a tax perspective. “HMRC will soon know exactly who is making gains—and how much,” he stated. Maley noted that anyone involved in cryptocurrency must ensure that they are documenting their gains on their tax returns, as the new regulations will enable HMRC to cross-check this information against the records received from platforms. Turkmenistan’s New Law on Digital Assets In Asia, Turkmenistan has officially moved towards embracing digital assets by enacting a new law that legalizes and regulates cryptocurrencies, including provisions for licensing digital asset exchanges and mining entities. This significant development was reported by the state media on Friday, following the signing of the law by President Serdar Berdymukhamedov. The legislation is set to take effect on January 1, 2026. One of the alleged reasons behind this move is Turkmenistan’s desire to diversify its economy, which has long relied heavily on exporting natural gas, primarily to China. A government spokesperson told Reuters on Friday that the newly implemented law aims to attract investment and foster digitalization within the country, aligning with global trends in the digital economy . The legislation outlines regulations governing the creation, storage, placement, utilization, and circulation of virtual assets in Turkmenistan. It also clarifies the legal and economic status of these assets, marking a significant step toward establishing a structured framework for the digital asset industry.

The unexpected rise was attributed to increased exports of crude oil and government spending, which reportedly acted as a catalyst for overall economic activity. However, despite this increase, reports from reliable sources noted that business investments and household spending did not meet expectations. These sources cited economic data published on Friday, November 28. Canada’s recent economic growth takes many by surprise Regarding Canada’s recent economic growth , analysts have pointed out that this growth is significant to the country’s progress, as the rise could help it avoid what could have resulted in a technical recession. These remarks were made following a revised decrease of 1.8% encountered in the previous quarter. Notably, the quarterly GDP is calculated by including income and spending. For the monthly GDP, it is determined based on industrial output. While analysts were making their predictions about the country’s economic growth for the third quarter, StatsCan noted that the figure for the third quarter might face a larger-than-usual revision in February. This finding ignited heated discussions among individuals. To address this controversy, the agency explained that the reason for this is that some parts of GDP by expenditure rely on trade data that was unavailable due to the US government shutdown. Following their prediction, a reliable source mentioned that several analysts expected Canada to record an annual growth rate of just 0.5% for the third quarter. They also predicted a 0.2% monthly increase in GDP for September. Interestingly, the country’s economy met analysts’ expectations on a month-to-month basis following a slight rise of 0.1% in the previous month. This escalation primarily resulted from a 1.6% increase in manufacturing output, according to reports from Statistics Canada. For the fourth quarter, an early estimate suggests that the GDP might decline by 0.3% in October, indicating a rough start for this timeframe. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies on key industries have greatly impacted Canadian exports. This situation has led to job losses, reduced hiring opportunities, and a decline in both business and consumer confidence, indicating a possible recession. Trump’s tariff policies raise tension regarding Canada’s economic growth Sources familiar with the situation highlighted a 6.7% increase in crude oil and bitumen exports and a 2.9% surge in government capital investments, which significantly counteracted some of the negative impacts in the third quarter. Data from Statistics Canada indicated that the rise in crude oil exports also led to an increase in corporate income at the time. According to the statistical agency, factors that led to an increase in government investments included substantial spending on weapons systems and non-residential buildings such as hospitals. Other elements that contributed to the GDP growth in the third quarter included a rise in home resale activity and renovations. Analysts say the strong Q3 performance should alleviate concerns about a full-blown recession and enhance the near-term growth outlook. Some economists see this as giving the Bank of Canada (BoC) reason to hold off on further interest rate cuts, at least for now. However, even with this increase, analysts still raise concerns about the effects of Trump’s tariff policies on the economy. They argue that these impacts are significantly affecting how businesses and consumers feel. To support this claim, reports revealed that business investment remained steady for the third quarter, while household spending decreased by 0.1%. StatsCan also reported a 0.8% reduction in new residential construction for the third quarter.

Coinbase's transaction revenue and monetization were excellent, though Bitcoin price volatility continues to weigh on near-term sentiment and the Q4 outlook. Subscription and Services revenue grew 34%, with stablecoin momentum solid, but Q4 guidance suggests some deceleration and mixed expense management. The recent valuation pullback is seen as a buying opportunity, and I reiterate my buy rating on Coinbase, confident in its long-term positioning. During the middle of the year, I reiterated my buy rating for Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN ). Despite continuing to rally for some time after my update, fortunes for the stock have reversed. Recently, the stock has experienced significant weakness, but that really isn't too surprising with Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) prices under major pressure. The company reported earnings at the end of October, and today, we'll be conducting an analysis to see whether current levels represent a buying opportunity. In the discussion below, it is shown that Q3 was a strong quarter. While crypto prices may weigh on Q4 transaction revenues, with strong internals and robust monetization, I expect this business to rebound quickly as headwinds dissipate. For their subscription and services business, Q3 was also strong as stablecoin momentum is solid. Despite Q4 guidance hinting at a slowdown in growth for this segment, long-term government policy should provide continued tailwinds. Therefore, I view the recent valuation contraction as a buying opportunity and thus reiterate my buy rating on the stock. Seeking Alpha Financial Overview Coinbase Q3 Shareholder Letter Revenues Before diving deeper into their segment results, let's take a broad view of their Q3 earnings results. For the quarter, Coinbase reported net revenues of $1.793 billion, and you can calculate from the above figures that the YoY growth rate is a very respectable 58.81%. In the previous quarter, growth was reported to be just 2.90% for net revenues, and so it is quite obvious that their business saw great activity in the quarter. In GAAP terms, total revenue was $1.8687 billion, and that includes corporate interest and other income. This was able to beat analyst expectations by $60.37 million to show a good degree of outperformance. You can also see above that their Subscription and Services revenue surpassed their own guidance. As a whole, prior to the November crypto selloff, Coinbase's business was booming, and therefore, the recent weakness in the stock is likely driven by exogenous factors. With the company so strong before the crypto weakness, they should be well positioned to bounce back from any Q4 weakness when the crypto market stabilizes and rebounds. Expense Management In terms of key operating expenses, you can also see above that they were well within their previously provided ranges. Transaction expenses as a percentage of revenues were 14%, and that represents an improvement from Q2's 17% and from the prior year period's 15%, demonstrating solid efficiency. For Sales and Marketing, expenses increased 57.95%, and for General and Administrative, there was an increase of just 26.63%. Both of these increases were less than the net revenue growth rate, and so as a whole, corporate efficiency was also robust. As for Technology and Development, they spent just 14.10% more than they did in the year ago quarter. While that's quite beneficial for near-term profitability, this may indicate they are underspending for long-term growth. Profits Rocket Coinbase's net income and EPS are quite erratic at times, and so a likely better measure of their core profitability is adjusted EBITDA. As shown above, they reported $801 million in Q3, and that represents a 78.40% increase YoY. With topline growth being strong and expense management being overall impressive, this shouldn't be a major surprise. Back in the previous quarter, adjusted EBITDA actually declined by 14.09%, and so Q3 was a very promising quarter on many measures. Now, let's take a look at their two core segments. Segment Results Transaction Revenue Coinbase Q3 Shareholder Letter Transactions are still the company's largest source of revenue currently, and so it is understandable why investors are spooked by the crypto selloff. Total trading volumes were up 59.46% YoY but revenues for the segment increased by a whopping 82.76%, and so it seems that their monetization of the volume boom was excellent. As shown above, Bitcoin is still dominant in both volume and revenues and so with this cryptocurrency making headlines for continued weakness, again investors are unsurprisingly unnerved. That said, this strong monetization shows that the internals of the business are robust and positions them well for the long run when the crypto market recovers. Subscription and Services Revenue Coinbase Q3 Shareholder Letter Coinbase's Subscription and Services segment is a core part of the business, with stablecoins gaining much momentum. Overall, revenues were up 34.27% to $746.7 million, and while this growth rate trails Transactions' revenue increase, it still indicates solid activity. Firstly, the company stated that they ""believe Coinbase continues to be the best place to use stablecoins."" As you can see above, they earn a lot more revenue per unit of market cap for USDC in Coinbase products than they do for off-platform USDC. Therefore, it would make great sense for them to create a great environment to attract users and retain them on their platform. At the end of the year-ago quarter , they had a total of $36 billion in USDC market cap, with $8.1 billion being on-platform. Therefore, total market cap has grown by 88.89%, while on-platform balance has grown by 85.19%. This could be slightly disappointing, as it shows growth in off-platform USDC is outperforming, which in turn indicates that the company can likely still do better in making Coinbase an attractive platform to use stablecoins. Guidance A Bit Shaky Coinbase Q3 Shareholder Letter The company provided guidance for Q4 for select metrics. Note how they exclude the outlook for transaction revenue, as there is volatility in the results due to crypto price fluctuations. For their Subscription and Services revenues, the midpoint of the above range implies a growth rate of 17% YoY. That would be quite a deceleration from the Q3 figure that we just discussed, and so perhaps the momentum of stablecoins is expected to plateau somewhat. For transaction expenses, they expect it to remain in the mid-teens as a percentage of net revenues, and so there won't be any major changes from Q3. As for technology & development + general & administrative expenses, they are projecting a 30% increase. While an increase in development spending isn't a bad thing at all, this quite outsized increase may be from G&A, and if that's the case, profitability is implied to be under a bit of pressure, especially if transaction revenues come in soft. For sales and marketing expenses, the midpoint of the above range represents a 17% increase, far less than in Q3, and so expense management is likely to be mixed as a whole in the near term. Overall, guidance is a bit shaky, and while an outlook for transactions isn't given, it can be inferred that there will be weakness given what we saw in crypto markets in November. Valuation Pullback Is An Opportunity Data by YCharts Coinbase's forward P/E ratio has seen quite a steep contraction recently, and that could be a buying opportunity even if the company faces some headwinds and challenges. Firstly, the elephant in the room is the crypto selloff. It was stated earlier that the company still relies a lot on transactions and on Bitcoin in particular. Crypto prices obviously have a direct impact on their revenues, but I would say there is too much correlation between Coinbase stock and these prices. The internals of their business remain unchanged, and monetization of trade volumes was shown to be strong. Once crypto rebounds, the business will follow in a strong manner, and so I would say investors in Coinbase are overly reactive to volatility in crypto prices. Secondly, while guidance above suggests some plateauing of stablecoin momentum, I would say the long term remains bright for this space given trends in Government policy. Therefore, I view the recent valuation contraction in Coinbase as a buying opportunity. Final Thoughts Q3 was a strong quarter for Coinbase and while a sudden souring of the environment may cause weaker than desired Q4 results, the company clearly remains well positioned for the future of crypto and the future of stablecoins. Good monetization and platform attractiveness are internal strengths that crypto price headwinds can't really shake, and so I view the recent selloff in the stock as a prime opportunity to pick up this leader.

This marks the third consecutive day of positive momentum for these innovative investment vehicles, signaling growing investor confidence in cryptocurrency exposure through traditional financial channels. What’s Driving the Bitcoin ETFs Momentum? The consistent positive flows in Bitcoin ETFs reveal a fascinating story about market sentiment. Despite one major player experiencing outflows, the overall ecosystem continues to attract significant capital. This pattern suggests that investors are becoming more sophisticated in their approach to cryptocurrency investments, carefully selecting their preferred Bitcoin ETF providers based on performance and strategy. Data from TraderT shows that the market is maturing rapidly. Investors are no longer treating all Bitcoin ETFs as identical products but are making deliberate choices about where to allocate their funds. This selective approach indicates a healthy, evolving market that rewards differentiation and performance. Which Bitcoin ETFs Are Leading the Charge? The distribution of inflows tells a compelling story about investor preferences. Several funds stood out with impressive performances: Fidelity’s FBTC attracted $77.45 million in new investments Ark Invest’s ARKB led the pack with $88.04 million inflows Grayscale’s GBTC added $10.71 million to its holdings Grayscale Mini BTC brought in $8.88 million These numbers demonstrate that multiple Bitcoin ETFs are successfully capturing investor interest, creating a competitive landscape that benefits consumers through better products and services. Why Did BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Experience Outflows? In contrast to the overall positive trend, BlackRock’s IBIT was the sole fund to experience net outflows, with $113.77 million withdrawn. This development raises important questions about investor behavior and fund selection criteria. Several factors could explain this anomaly. Investors might be rebalancing their portfolios, taking profits, or shifting to other Bitcoin ETFs that better align with their investment strategies. It’s crucial to remember that single-day outflows don’t necessarily indicate long-term trends, and BlackRock remains one of the largest players in the Bitcoin ETF space. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin ETF Investors? The continued positive flows into Bitcoin ETFs provide valuable insights for current and potential investors. The market is showing clear signs of maturation and differentiation among providers. This means investors have more choices and can select Bitcoin ETFs that match their specific investment goals and risk tolerance. Moreover, the consistent inflows suggest that institutional and retail investors alike are increasingly comfortable with Bitcoin exposure through regulated exchange-traded funds. This trend could pave the way for further innovation and product development in the cryptocurrency investment space. How Can You Navigate the Bitcoin ETF Landscape? For investors considering Bitcoin ETFs, the current market dynamics offer both opportunities and challenges. Here are key considerations: Diversification matters – Don’t put all your eggs in one basket Monitor performance regularly – Stay informed about fund flows and management changes Understand fee structures – Different Bitcoin ETFs have varying expense ratios Consider your investment horizon – Align your choices with your long-term goals The ongoing success of multiple Bitcoin ETFs indicates that there’s room for various approaches and strategies in this emerging investment category. Frequently Asked Questions What are Bitcoin ETFs? Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that track the price of Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrency without directly owning or storing digital assets. Why are Bitcoin ETFs important? They provide a regulated, accessible way for traditional investors to participate in cryptocurrency markets through familiar brokerage accounts. How do I choose between different Bitcoin ETFs? Consider factors like management fees, fund size, tracking accuracy, and the reputation of the provider when selecting Bitcoin ETFs.

Are Bitcoin ETFs safe investments? Like all investments, Bitcoin ETFs carry risks, but they offer regulatory oversight and institutional custody that direct cryptocurrency ownership may lack. How often should I monitor my Bitcoin ETF investments? Regular monitoring is wise, but avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term flow data alone. Found this analysis helpful?

For the fifth consecutive day, these investment vehicles have recorded impressive net inflows, signaling growing confidence in Ethereum’s potential among institutional and retail investors alike. What’s Driving the Spot Ethereum ETFs Momentum? Recent data reveals that U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs recorded total net inflows of $77.1 million on November 28 alone. This marks the fifth straight day of positive flows, demonstrating sustained investor interest in Ethereum-based investment products. The consistent performance of spot Ethereum ETFs suggests that investors are increasingly viewing Ethereum as a valuable addition to their portfolios. Several factors contribute to this positive trend: Growing institutional adoption of Ethereum Increased regulatory clarity around cryptocurrency ETFs Ethereum’s expanding utility in decentralized applications Positive market sentiment toward alternative investments Which Spot Ethereum ETFs Are Leading the Charge? BlackRock’s ETHA emerged as the clear leader in this recent surge, capturing $68.82 million in net inflows. This substantial amount represents the majority of the day’s total activity and highlights BlackRock’s dominant position in the spot Ethereum ETFs market. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s ETHE contributed $8.28 million in net inflows, showing that multiple players are benefiting from the current trend. The remaining spot Ethereum ETFs maintained stable positions without recording significant net flows. This distribution pattern indicates that investors are becoming more selective, choosing established providers with proven track records in the spot Ethereum ETFs space. Why Should Investors Care About Spot Ethereum ETFs? Spot Ethereum ETFs offer several advantages that make them attractive to both new and experienced investors. Unlike futures-based products, spot Ethereum ETFs directly track the price of Ethereum, providing more accurate exposure to the underlying asset.

Key benefits include: Accessibility: Investors can gain Ethereum exposure through traditional brokerage accounts Regulatory oversight: These products operate within established financial frameworks Liquidity: Spot Ethereum ETFs trade on major exchanges during market hours Transparency: Regular reporting requirements provide clear insight into fund performance What Does the Future Hold for Spot Ethereum ETFs? The consecutive days of positive flows for spot Ethereum ETFs suggest this trend may continue in the near term. However, investors should remain aware of potential challenges, including regulatory developments and market volatility. The performance of spot Ethereum ETFs often reflects broader market sentiment toward cryptocurrencies, making them a valuable indicator for the entire sector. As more investors recognize the potential of spot Ethereum ETFs, we may see increased competition among providers and potentially lower fees. This could make spot Ethereum ETFs even more accessible to a wider range of investors, further driving adoption and potentially increasing trading volumes. Conclusion: The Growing Significance of Spot Ethereum ETFs The fifth consecutive day of net inflows for spot Ethereum ETFs represents more than just a temporary market fluctuation. It signals growing mainstream acceptance of Ethereum as a legitimate investment asset. As institutional players like BlackRock and Grayscale continue to attract significant capital into their spot Ethereum ETFs products, the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem benefits from increased legitimacy and liquidity. Frequently Asked Questions What are spot Ethereum ETFs? Spot Ethereum ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold Ethereum and track its price, allowing investors to gain exposure to Ethereum through traditional stock exchanges. How do spot Ethereum ETFs differ from futures-based ETFs? Spot Ethereum ETFs hold the actual cryptocurrency, while futures-based ETFs hold contracts that speculate on future prices. Spot ETFs provide direct price exposure. Which companies offer spot Ethereum ETFs? Major providers include BlackRock (ETHA), Grayscale (ETHE), and several other financial institutions that have received regulatory approval. Are spot Ethereum ETFs safe investments? While they operate within regulatory frameworks, spot Ethereum ETFs still carry cryptocurrency market risks, including volatility and regulatory changes.

Seven users brought the case to a New York court on Wednesday. They say the company tricks customers by calling itself a provider of “legal sports betting” even though it does not hold gambling licenses in any state. The lawsuit also targets Kalshi Trading, which the customers say works as a market-maker that creates betting odds that work against regular users. “When consumers place bets on Kalshi, they face off against money provided by a sophisticated market maker on the other side of the ledger,” the users bringing the lawsuit said. “Market makers make it possible for consumers to place illegal, unregulated wagers against the House.” The legal firm Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein filed the proposed class action. This adds to Kalshi’s growing legal troubles, as state gambling officials and Native American tribal groups have already sued the company for allegedly running illegal sports betting operations. Kalshi maintains it operates a derivatives market that falls under federal oversight from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, not state gambling laws. Kalshi defends its business model Luana Lopes Lara, who co-founded Kalshi, responded to the lawsuit on social media Friday. She said the claims were “false and reveal a fundamental” misunderstanding of how the company’s markets operate. “Like any financial exchange, we have market makers that compete openly against each other and help bootstrap liquidity,” Lopes Lara explained. She added that working with connected trading desks to create liquidity and bring in more trading was a “common and regulated practice” in prediction markets, and these partners got “no preferential treatment” on the platform. Courts weigh in on prediction market regulation The company recently lost an important court battle when a federal judge in Nevada decided that state regulators could oversee Kalshi’s operations. The company has asked for an emergency order to stop that ruling from taking effect. The new class action states: “By operating unlicensed sports betting, Kalshi has violated gambling laws, engaged in illegal deceptive activity, and unjustly enriched itself at the expense of tens of thousands of consumers.” The lawsuit does not say whether the seven people who filed it lost money on sports bets, only that they did not know the company allegedly ran an unlicensed sportsbook. Under CFTC rules, event contracts count as a type of swap where traders bet money on yes-or-no outcomes. Winners typically earn one dollar per contract, while losers get nothing. Traders can risk thousands of dollars on these bets, which could lead to big profits or total losses. However, critics like US District Judge Andrew Gordon say Kalshi is pushing the definition too far. “Event contracts that turn on the outcomes of sporting events are not swaps and thus do not fall within the CFTC’s exclusive jurisdiction,” Gordon wrote in his order placing the company under Nevada regulation. “Kalshi relies on a strained reading of the already convoluted Commodities Exchange Act (CEA) in an attempt to evade state regulation.” At least five other courts nationwide are currently handling similar disputes over prediction markets and state gambling rules.

Stellar XLM Price Prediction 2028-2030: The $1 Question The million-dollar question remains: Can Stellar XLM reach $1 by 2030? Achieving this milestone would require a combination of factors: Mass adoption by financial institutions for cross-border settlements Successful implementation of Stellar’s roadmap and protocol upgrades Favorable global regulatory environment for digital assets Significant growth in the overall cryptocurrency market capitalization Our long-term analysis suggests that while challenging, the $1 target is mathematically possible if Stellar captures even a small percentage of the global remittance market and continues to innovate in blockchain technology . Factors That Could Accelerate XLM Growth Several catalysts could propel Stellar XLM beyond current expectations. Partnerships with major financial institutions, technological breakthroughs in the Stellar protocol, and increased demand for efficient cross-border payment solutions could all contribute to accelerated growth. As more businesses recognize the value of blockchain technology for financial operations, Stellar’s positioned to benefit significantly. Risks and Challenges for Stellar XLM Investors Like any cryptocurrency investment , Stellar XLM carries inherent risks. Regulatory uncertainty, competition from other blockchain platforms, technological challenges, and market volatility could all impact price performance. Investors should carefully consider these factors and conduct thorough research before allocating capital to digital assets like XLM. FAQs About Stellar XLM Price Prediction What is the Stellar Development Foundation? The Stellar Development Foundation is a non-profit organization that supports the development and growth of the Stellar network. Who created Stellar? Stellar was created by Jed McCaleb , who also co-founded Ripple and founded Mt. Gox. How does Stellar compare to Ripple?

Companies like IBM have implemented Stellar for cross-border payment solutions, demonstrating real-world utility. Is Stellar a good long-term investment? As with any cryptocurrency, Stellar XLM carries risk, but its focus on practical financial applications and strong development team make it an interesting cryptocurrency investment for those believing in blockchain’s potential to transform global finance. Conclusion: The Future of Stellar XLM Stellar XLM represents more than just another cryptocurrency—it’s a practical implementation of blockchain technology aimed at solving real-world financial challenges. While the path to $1 involves navigating complex market dynamics and achieving widespread adoption, the fundamental value proposition remains strong. As the world increasingly embraces digital assets for financial transactions, Stellar’s efficient, low-cost platform could position XLM for significant growth through 2030.

Here’s the Timeline,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-10-xrp-price-is-coming-act-now-heres-the-timeline/,"Digital asset enthusiasts often revisit key moments in a market cycle. A recent post from XRP enthusiast Skipper has done exactly that by presenting a renewed focus on XRP’s price potential heading into early 2025. His message emphasizes the idea that opportunities previously missed may now be returning. He reinforces this with a specific price target and date. The tweet captioned a short video, which illustrates a projected rise in XRP’s price and marks February 22 as a significant point on the chart. You've been warned before, and now opportunity is knocking again. Act now before it's too late. $10 incoming! #XRP pic.twitter.com/KeuQzHFs4W — Skipper | XRPL (@skipper_xrp) November 26, 2025 Skipper’s projection and the video visuals The video displays a hand-drawn price path for XRP, noting earlier highs around the $3.40 and $3.65 regions and a marked low near $1.60 identified with the date December 21, 2025. The visual emphasizes the current price area around $2.13, drawing attention to $10 target with the date February 22 written next to it. His accompanying statement reinforces that investors have been notified in the past and that he believes the window for action is opening once again. The core message is straightforward: Skipper expects XRP to reach $10, and he ties this expectation to the late-February date showcased in the video. Community questions about the basis for the $10 target Among the responses, an X user named tommotom73 asked for clarification on what specific developments Skipper believes could support a move to $10 by February 22. The user mentioned several possible factors, including a supply shock, the Clarity Act, or ETF trading volume achieving a threshold significant enough to generate a strong upward price movement. The question also raised the possibility that a combination of these elements might align around that time to produce the outcome highlighted in Skipper’s projection. ETF progress and additional commentary from the community Another community member, Jake Smith, provided a detailed update on the regulatory progression of the 21Shares Core XRP ETF, listed under the ticker TOXR. He stated that as of November 26, 2025, the ETF had received full regulatory clearance through its effective S-1 registration and Form 8-A filing with the SEC.

He noted a roughly 2% price increase for XRP in the last 24 hours, bringing it to approximately $2.15, and stated that trading volume rose by 35% as anticipation grew around the ETF launch. He added that amendments on November 7 and the Form 8-A on November 20 achieved automatic effectiveness without objection from the SEC. Skipper’s post, supported by the illustrated price path in the video, presents a direct projection that XRP could reach $10 by February 22. The community responses explore what developments could justify that move, while others highlight real-time regulatory progress surrounding the TOXR ETF. Together, these elements set the context for the renewed attention surrounding XRP as investors look forward to the coming months.

Bitcoin is trading at $90,451, up almost 10% in the last five days, according to Coin Metrics data. However, it's still down 20% in the past month due to a combination of macroeconomic developments and crypto-specific pressures. Some investors are reducing their risk appetite and turning to safe havens like gold due to growing concerns about the overvaluation of AI stocks. Furthermore, mixed signals from recent US federal economic data are fueling market caution. Some long-term Bitcoin investors are turning to profit-taking due to the widespread belief that the BTC price is moving in line with the blockchain's quadrennial programmatic updates (halving cycle). Despite this selling pressure, BTIG believes Bitcoin will recoup some of its losses by the end of the year. Related News: Major Altcoin Whales Are Very Active: Here Are Their Transactions and Purchases BTIG analysts also argued that crypto mining companies Cipher Mining and Terawulf have delivered “impressive performance” even during the recent downturn. Cipher Mining is up 35% since the beginning of the week, while Terawulf is up 31% during the same period. Analysts noted that an index of crypto miners is also forming strong support, with potential for an additional 15% upside before reaching tougher resistance. Ethereum, the second-largest crypto asset by market capitalization, is also poised to recover towards the $3,400 level despite losing 24% of its value last month. *This is not investment advice.

The answer just became crystal clear – a massive $25 billion crypto investment surge that’s reshaping the entire financial landscape. This staggering amount flowing into digital asset companies signals a fundamental shift in how major institutions view the future of money. Why Is Crypto Investment Exploding Now? The crypto investment landscape has transformed dramatically this year. Traditional financial heavyweights who once viewed digital assets with skepticism are now leading the charge. This massive influx of capital demonstrates growing confidence in blockchain technology’s long-term potential. Major players driving this crypto investment boom include: Paradigm – Known for bold tech bets Sequoia Capital – Silicon Valley’s legendary investor BlackRock – The world’s largest asset manager JPMorgan – Banking giant embracing innovation Goldman Sachs – Wall Street’s sophisticated player Where Is All This Crypto Investment Going? The distribution of this massive crypto investment reveals clear industry preferences. Centralized exchanges captured the lion’s share with $4.4 billion, showing continued faith in trading platforms. However, the real surprises came from emerging sectors. Prediction markets attracted $3.2 billion in crypto investment, indicating strong belief in decentralized forecasting tools. Meanwhile, DeFi platforms secured $2.9 billion, proving that decentralized finance remains a crucial growth area. This strategic allocation shows investors are betting on multiple crypto verticals simultaneously. What Does This Mean for Crypto’s Future? This unprecedented level of crypto investment creates powerful momentum for the entire ecosystem. When institutions commit this much capital, they’re not just making short-term bets – they’re building infrastructure for the future. The involvement of traditional finance giants brings credibility and stability to the space. Moreover, this crypto investment wave signals that digital assets are becoming mainstream financial instruments. The barriers between traditional and crypto finance are crumbling faster than anyone predicted. This convergence creates new opportunities for investors and developers alike. How Can You Benefit from This Crypto Investment Trend? Understanding where smart money flows can help you make better investment decisions. The sectors attracting the most crypto investment often represent the most promising opportunities. However, always remember that institutional participation doesn’t guarantee individual success. Key takeaways from this crypto investment surge: Diversification matters – Institutions are spreading risk across multiple crypto sectors Infrastructure is key – Trading platforms remain fundamental to ecosystem growth Innovation pays – New applications like prediction markets attract significant capital Conclusion: The New Era of Crypto Investment Has Arrived The $25 billion crypto investment milestone marks a turning point for digital assets. This isn’t just about money flowing in – it’s about validation from the world’s most sophisticated investors. The crypto winter has clearly given way to a spring of institutional adoption and strategic positioning. As traditional finance and cryptocurrency continue merging, we can expect even more significant crypto investment flows in the coming years. The foundations being laid today will shape the financial landscape for decades to come. Frequently Asked Questions Which crypto sectors received the most investment? Centralized exchanges led with $4.4 billion, followed by prediction markets at $3.2 billion, and DeFi platforms with $2.9 billion. Why are traditional banks investing in crypto now? Major financial institutions recognize crypto’s long-term potential and don’t want to miss out on the next technological revolution in finance. Is this investment mainly from venture capital firms? While VC firms like Paradigm and Sequoia are involved, traditional asset managers and banks like BlackRock and JPMorgan are equally active. What does this mean for cryptocurrency prices? While institutional investment can provide stability and growth potential, it doesn’t guarantee price increases and markets remain volatile. How does this compare to previous years’ crypto investment? This represents one of the largest annual investment totals in crypto history, signaling strong renewed confidence after the 2022 downturn. Are these investments focused only on Bitcoin and Ethereum? No, the funding spreads across various crypto sectors including exchanges, DeFi, prediction markets, and infrastructure projects.

DEFT's business model spans five synergistic segments, generating both stable recurring revenues and market-driven, non-recurring income, with strong correlation to Bitcoin cycles. Technical analysis suggests entries on confirmed V-reversals or post-correction accumulation, emphasizing tight risk controls and short- to medium-term profit-taking. Recommend tactical entries on DEFT during corrections, aligning with favorable macro and crypto narratives, while maintaining disciplined position sizing and risk management. DeFi Technologies ( DEFT ) looks interesting as a candidate for tactical trades with tight risk control, using only a small slice of a speculative portfolio. In this article, we review its price action and discuss some simple quantitative frameworks to support our trading and entry decisions. DeFi Technologies is a Canadian company based in Toronto listed under the ticker DEFT on the NASDAQ. Its goal is to bridge the gap between traditional investment and the crypto ecosystem. This Canadian company has built a base of business models that have synergies with each other: Valour Asset Management: It issues cryptocurrency ETPs that can also be “baskets” and takes care of the purchase and custody of the underlying assets. It also uses these underlying assets in on-chain staking/lending protocols to generate returns. Earnings: collecting annual management fees that are prorated daily and are part of your recurring revenue. It also generates income from the rewards it receives for staking/lending the underlying assets. A higher AUM improves its margin by making its operations cheaper relative to the volume of profits it generates. DeFi Alpha: It is the trading leg of the group that mainly executes arbitrage strategies between CEXs and DEXs, both in derivatives and spot markets, taking advantage of price inefficiencies and temporary mismatches. To do this, it uses both group balance sheets and collateral (in crypto). Earnings: arbitrage spreads and basis. Stillman Digital: This leg is primarily a liquidity provider and OTC desk for institutional clients. Spreads in OTC transactions and fees in liquidity-providing transactions. DeFi Ventures: Invests in Web3 DeFi projects via traditional equity or tokens. Earnings: monetised when capital gains are realised on equity or tokens. Reflexivity Research: Finally, this business line provides crypto reporting and analysis for a diverse group of investors. Earnings: subscription model and ad-hoc research Technical Overview Since the uptrend began in 2023, DEFT has been one of the stocks that have benefited most from the crypto sector cycle, leaving spectacular returns for those who bought near the bottom and also for those who joined the trend.. However, whenever we look at ETFs, ETPs, or stocks that have a relationship with the crypto/blockchain sector, we must always bear in mind that they are cyclical assets, sensitive to narratives, liquidity, etc. But above all, you need to keep a close eye on Bitcoin, as it is the main proxy for the sector. DEFT Price Weekly (Trading View) In the image above, we have the weekly chart of DEFT, and we have highlighted the divergent signals that the asset would have given us with respect to the RSI. It's not a magic bullet, but it's worth monitoring these signals, seeing whether they line up with other indicators and with subsequent price action. Throughout the upswing, there were two significant downward divergences. In addition, within the first, an upward divergence is observed that resulted in a month with a revaluation of more than 130%. DEFT Price Weekly (Trading View) In the graph below, we highlight 3 relevant areas, in descending order: The upper area represents the resistance zone to be broken during bullish phases. The intermediate area represents the general battle zone, which has been both resistance and support. Finally, the lower area is a strategic point that has been resistance in the bear market and a zone of consolidation and accumulation in this last rally. In the current week, the upswing has defended the psychological price of $1. Taking into account only the price action as input, we consider two scenarios for potential entry points: V-reversal that exceeds the intermediate area (possible rejection at the upper resistance area) and retest this area for support. If confirmed, execute a buy order. Continue with the downward trend, down to the $0.50–0.60 area, where the next psychological level would likely be defended. In this case, it would be prudent to review macro narratives, liquidity, etc. If we are facing a positive environment, execute purchase action. Q3 Financial Statements Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements (DeFi Technologies) DeFi Technologies seems to be keeping up the pace, and even though results were below last year’s $28.2M , it generated solid Q3 revenues of $22.5M. However, the core part improves with an increase in recurring revenue (excluding market gains/losses) of $4.6 M ($12.8 M vs. $8.2 M). Mainly, the staking and lending parts are improved with $7.4 M vs 6.5 M$ and $2.9 M vs $1.5 M, respectively. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (DeFi Technologies) This increase in the recurrent share makes sense given that the (average) AUM of $950.7 million in the quarter exceeded that of the past Q2 772.8 million. Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements (DeFi Technologies) Operating profit remains solid at $9.0 M, although down from $14.4 M in Q3 last year, and net profit after tax falls substantially to $3.9 M compared to $15.4 M as a result of lower trading earnings and a one-off financial expense of $4.7 M that comes from the costs of issuing warrants in the $100 M equity offering, as reported in the “Other Income (expenses)” section of its Management’s Discussion and Analysis report: MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (DeFi Technologies) These issuance costs, because they are linked to a liability (warrants), are recognized as an expense in profit or loss rather than against equity, and therefore cloud the quarterly earnings, even though the underlying operations were solid. Quant PoV Matrix Correlation & Normalize Price Performance (Node Analytica) Since DEFT's business model is linked to the crypto ecosystem, we seek to apply a way to quantify it and to see how much it depends on Bitcoin’s cycles as the main proxy. In the graph above, we have used daily price data for the DEFT, BTC, and ETH tickers from yfinance, on which we have applied a price normalization. After normalizing, we have created the correlation matrix and the graph with the series as a visual support. If we observe the series, DEFT behaves like a crypto-beta asset, and the trends are almost identical, and the correlation matrix confirms this strong co-movement, with a correlation of 0.85 between DEFT and BTC. Similarly, we have added ETH as a proxy for the rest of the “altcoins” assets, and although its core works more with these assets, the correlation is lower but still high. When working with a basket of cryptocurrencies, in bullish phases the AUM of the Valour segment increases, improving the commissions and the yields of the staking/lending part. On the contrary, when the scenario is bearish, the “hits” to the AUM are more painful because in this market Bitcoin commands, and when it corrects, the rest of cryptocurrencies do it in greater magnitude and then take longer to recover, if at all. Quant Stats (Node Anlaytica) Additionally, with the data of daily prices of BTC and DEFT, we have calculated the daily returns and, from there, the Sharpe ratio, max drawdowns, annualised volatility, etc. Over the period analysed (2021-01-22 to 2025-11-27), the Sharpe ratio is favorable for DEFT, but at the cost of very high annualised volatility of 136% and an extreme drawdown of -98.1%. From a quantitative point of view, DEFT is still linked to industry-specific cycles and volatility and has similar numbers to an altcoin or token. Operationally, entries should be tactical, taking positions when the asset pulls back and offers buying opportunities, but only as long as it is aligned with favorable macro- and crypto expectations. Likewise, it would make sense to allocate only a small slice of the portfolio’s speculative sleeve to this name and look for returns in the short and medium term. Conclusion DeFi Technologies is building, through its five business lines, a solid foundation with core business models that generate stable, recurring income and others that provide substantial but occasional, non-recurring revenues tied to trading performance and market momentum. This is important because, given its reliance on and correlation with crypto cycles, the company should still maintain a revenue stream in bear markets. From a technical point of view, the operational idea is to confirm this V-reversal or wait for the capitulation to be completed and an accumulation structure to be formed to enter. Quantitatively, the asset has offered great return opportunities but with very high volatility and steeper falls than Bitcoin, more typical of an altcoin. As we mentioned earlier, small position sizes aim to take profits in the short to medium term from a speculative point of view. Finally, the recent rise in expectations of interest rate cuts in December, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the treasury announcing the increase in issuance of T-Bills , the end of QT, etc. These are narratives that, from our point of view, are favorable to provide another boost to the upside of the markets, in the coming quarters. In short, our recommendation is to take advantage of the opportunities offered by this correction, waiting for confirmations and making tactical entries.",DEFT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-29 06:57:18

The breach impacted over 20 different tokens and has prompted Upbit to freeze assets on its platform while an investigation unfolds. Lazarus Group Tied To Upbit Hack Authorities are now investigating the possibility of North Korean involvement in the cyber attack. Reports suggest that a group affiliated with North Korea’s intelligence agency, the notorious Lazarus Group, may have orchestrated the hack, which Upbit has described as an “abnormal withdrawal.” This group has been consistently linked to several high-profile crypto heists in recent years, and the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has identified North Korean cyber operations as one of the most sophisticated and persistent threats. Related Reading: Hyperliquid (HYPE) Ready For A Significant Surge To $50: Key Levels Identified The recent attack coincidentally occurred just days before the sixth anniversary of a previous major breach, in which Upbit lost 342,000 Ethereum (ETH) to North Korean hackers. According to an unnamed government official, this latest hack bears similarities to a 2019 incident in which approximately 58 billion won in cryptocurrencies was stolen, also attributed to the Lazarus Group. In response to the attack, the South Korean National Police Agency has launched an investigation into the matter, although officials have not provided further comments on the case. Upbit’s operator, Dunamu, confirmed that an in-depth investigation into the cause and extent of the asset outflow is currently underway. Crypto Exchange Moves Funds To Cold Storage The cryptocurrency exchange’s CEO Oh Kyung-seok stated that as soon as abnormal withdrawal activity was detected, Upbit promptly suspended all deposit and withdrawal services. “We are conducting a comprehensive inspection, prioritizing the protection of member assets,” he said in a notice to users. Following the discovery of the unauthorized transactions, Upbit has taken steps to freeze the affected funds wherever possible. To prevent any further unauthorized transfers, the exchange has shifted all remaining assets to cold storage, ensuring “a secure environment for funds.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To Recover $100,000: BTIG Cites Key Reasons For Optimism Upbit is also said to be working with relevant project teams to freeze assets on-chain, having already blocked a portion of the stolen funds related to the cryptocurrency Solayer (LAYER). The exchange has indicated that deposits and withdrawals will only resume once full security checks are completed. Dunamu has vowed to reimburse customers for any losses with business funds as part of its commitment to its users. It remains to be seen what additional information the country’s authorities will release in the coming days, as well as potential refund deadlines for affected individuals.

The analyst presented a detailed wave-based projection supported by an extensive chart that outlines previous accumulation phases, current trading behavior, and a potential final advance. The update attracted additional remarks from community members seeking clarification on the near-term direction and longer-term valuation expectations. $XRP : One final major push up to complete the 5th wave structure whilst sitting on prior cycle highs from 2021, please, and thank you pic.twitter.com/gv7VQGnDkl — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) November 27, 2025 Wave Structure And Current Market Position ChartNerd’s chart emphasizes XRP’s progression through multiple phases that align with a five-wave technical framework. The image shows the asset completing a prolonged accumulation period leading into a strong vertical movement, followed by a structured consolidation range. According to the shared chart, XRP is positioned between established support and resistance within what the analyst labels a vertical accumulation region. The setup suggests that the asset remains within its defined range, and the analyst indicates that a final upward movement would complete the projected wave structure. A significant element of the chart is XRP’s interaction with prior cycle highs from 2021 . The analyst highlights that the current support level aligns closely with those historical highs, a point that forms the foundation for the ongoing consolidation. The graphic further illustrates resistance around the upper boundary of the range and shows a potential breakout path extending toward a substantially higher valuation. Clarifications On Market Direction One user responding to the post expressed uncertainty about whether XRP is expected to move up or down. ChartNerd replied that direction does not need to be determined prematurely because the asset remains inside the identified trading range. The analyst reiterated that confirmation is required before anticipating a decisive move and emphasized that neither support nor resistance has been broken. This reinforced the importance of observing the range boundaries rather than attempting to predict a breakout timing without technical confirmation.

This perspective aligns with the long-horizon view held by many within the community who interpret the wave structure and multi-year accumulation zones as indicators of broader cyclical potential. ChartNerd’s analysis presents a structured view of XRP’s current technical position, emphasizing its multi-phase development and ongoing consolidation above key historical levels. The chart outlines a clear support and resistance framework, suggesting that confirmation remains essential before the next major move can be identified. The discussion surrounding the chart reflects both the need for patience within defined ranges and the persistent long-term expectations held by portions of the XRP community.

At the same time, the demand for both large-cap altcoins on Wall Street has been rather impressive, with the cumulative total inflows surpassing $600 million for each. CoinShares Pulls Out The battle for spot crypto ETFs in the United States has been gathering steam in the past several weeks, as numerous issuers filed a new way to bypass the SEC’s stringent approval process by removing the “delaying amendment” part, which essentially guarantees successful launches if all other criteria are met. Although several such financial vehicles have hit the US markets in November, CoinShares, which had applied for at least three, decided to drop out. It filed on Friday to withdraw its applications for XRP, LTC, and SOL staking ETFs. It’s also winding down its bitcoin futures leveraged ETF (BTFX.O). The firm’s CEO, Jean-Marie Mognetti, argued that differentiation opportunities and sustainable margins are limited as long as the US market consolidates around large players in single-asset crypto ETPs. Instead, the company said it would focus on higher-margin opportunities ahead of its US listing. Recall that it announced plans to be listed on the Nasdaq in September through a $1.2 billion merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) called Vine Hill Capital Investment Corp. XRP, SOL ETFs on Fire The spot Solana ETF issued by Bitwise set the record earlier this year for the biggest opening day with a trading volume of $57 million. However, that record fell when Canary Capital’s XRPC hit the US markets in mid-November, as it notched close to $60 million. The subsequent releases of other spot crypto ETFs, such as more XRP-tracking funds, as well as Grayscale’s DOGE ETF, couldn’t surpass these numbers. Nevertheless, the overall inflow figures for the XRP and SOL products are quite impressive. Data from SoSoValue shows that the XRP ETFs have attracted more than $660 million since the first one debuted just over two weeks ago. The total inflows into the SOL ETFs are slightly lower at around $620 million. DOGE, though, has disappointed so far, with a total net inflow of just $2.16 million as of Friday.

Here’s What’s Happening,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-disappearing-on-binance-heres-whats-happening/,"Crypto commentator KINGVALEX highlighted a notable reduction in XRP held on Binance during October, reporting an approximate 300 million XRP decline in exchange reserves. The accompanying on-chain chart shows exchange-held balances peaking near three billion XRP at the end of September and then descending to roughly 2.7 billion XRP by late November. This movement has gotten attention because it reduces the visible, tradable supply on one of the largest exchanges, prompting renewed scrutiny of market depth and liquidity conditions. $XRP RESERVES in BINANCE FELL BY 300M XRP IN OCTOBER. WHALES ARE LIKE… “Yea we gave you crumb grabbers enough time to accumulate for years now we are wiping you THE FUCK OUT“ pic.twitter.com/5JKst4J9ta — KINGVALEX (@VALELORDX) November 27, 2025 Meaning: Decline in Binance’s XRP Reserves Analysts generally view a decline of this scale in Binance’s XRP reserves as an indication that liquidity is being withdrawn from the open market. Movements of this size are typically associated with large holders shifting assets into custody, private wallets, or institutional acquisition rather than smaller retail activity. When this type of reduction occurs alongside ongoing accumulation trends, it often signals that a smaller pool of tradable tokens remains available on exchanges. If withdrawals maintain the same pace, the accessible supply on major trading platforms can tighten quickly, making the market more sensitive to periods of concentrated buying. ETF inflows amplify the narrative of tightening liquidity A media analysis summarized how new U.S. ETFs and institutional products have intensified focus on exchange liquidity. Early ETF trading reportedly generated heavy interest in XRP, with issuers acquiring significant amounts from the open market during their first week. The report cited a one-day absorption of approximately 79 million XRP by ETF vehicles, with a major portion attributed to Franklin Templeton. Those purchases are presented as concrete inflows that remove tradable tokens from exchange order books, strengthening the supply-squeeze thesis. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why a supply shock matters for price dynamics Analysts described a supply shock as a condition in which demand growth outpaces the available tradable supply, forcing buyers to compete at higher price levels. When institutional purchases occur off-exchange or via large block buys, depth on centralized exchanges can thin quickly, reducing the capacity for immediate market absorption. Market participants expect sellers to re-enter when prices become more attractive, which can produce sustained upward pressure on prices if demand remains strong. Forward-looking view Based on current observable flows and early ETF activity , there is a possibility that continued institutional inflows would further compress visible exchange liquidity and increase the potential for pronounced price moves. Market participants will likely monitor exchange reserve metrics and ETF flows to assess whether the recent decline in reserve is a temporary reallocation or the beginning of a more persistent supply constraint.

Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‘s performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price up today? TIA’s price is attempting to hold above $0.64 as sellers lost confidence, resulting in a push above Fib channels. Will the TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA’s price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will the TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers’ interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns.

Celestia Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Celestia Price Prediction November 2025 $0.7 $0.9 $1.3 Celestia price prediction 2025 Historically, the full impact of a Bitcoin Halving isn’t felt until about a year to a year and a half afterward. This suggests that new all-time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might occur around 2025. Considering this, along with the ongoing development of the Celestia network and the growing adoption of modular blockchain technology, the outlook appears positive for the year ahead. Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $1, a potential maximum of $1.5, and an average trading price of $1.3 in 2025.

Meanwhile, Dogecoin appears to stagnate while institutional funds flow quickly into highly utilitarian projects that promise considerable upside. So much attention is now being given to one such project named Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , described by some experts as the ‘best cryptocurrency to buy now’ for people who want to earn profits in the same fashion that Dogecoin achieved in 2021. Dogecoin’s Historic 2021 Run: A Lesson in Timing To assess the opportunity the whales are seeking in today’s market, it’s important to remember the remarkable performance of Dogecoin in 2021. At the beginning of 2021, DOGE was selling for $0.005. Within five months, its price shot to an all-time high of $0.74 in May 2021. This resulted in an astonishing 14,000%+ percent ROI. However, the current Dogecoin technical infrastructure throws a different insight. Martinez’s analysis suggests the $0.14 level, previously a region of strong demand, is weakening in strength. This opens the door for the bears to test the structural levels of support at $0.12 and $0.10. Moving forward in time, the explosive growth levels previously experienced in the meme cryptocurrency market are now being fueled by utility-based DeFi coins such as Mutuum. MUTM Presale Shows Enormous Demand Mutuum Finance is one of the beneficiaries of the market rotation. Its presale is gaining immense popularity. It has already raised $19,020,000, and its Phase 6 is 95% sold out. People are eagerly waiting to acquire the token at the current rate of $0.035 because in Phase 7, the price will increase to $0.04. Once the presale succeeds, the initial buyers will gain more than 400% profits during the initial launch at the fixed price of $0.06. However, the urgency should not go unnoticed since the cumulative number of holders exceeds 18,250. This goes to show the level of confidence in the system because it is one of the top cryptos to follow. Unlike most new cryptos that are used for speculation, the usability of the system is very essential. Leaderboard Incentives Drive Engagement Not to mention the financial capabilities, Mutuum also has a very active community through its gamification. Just recently, the 24-Hour Leaderboard was introduced. This leaderboard looks back on the contributions made per day. Every 24 hours resets for the leaderboard at 00:00 UTC, obtaining the top-rated person on the leaderboard an automated $500 MUTM reward. At the same time, the project is also running a massive $100,000 giveaway campaign, where ten lucky people shall take home $10,000 in the form of the project’s token. Independent Audit & Security Security is one of the core aspects that investors who want to know the best cryptocurrency to invest in must prioritize. To deal with the issue of security for its clients considering the best cryptocurrency to invest in, Mutuum Finance is undergoing an independent audit by the reputable Halborn Security. Alongside the soon-to-be-launched V1 protocol in the Sepolia testnet during Q4 2025, the stress on being transparent is what distinguishes the Mutuum project from the rest. The fact that the project combines proven security measures along with developed products being backed by attractive presale rewards makes the project very attractive for those who want to allocate their assets to something other than the ‘diminishing giants’ like Dogecoin.

The investor known as 1011short, recognized for long-term Bitcoin holdings, has dramatically shifted strategy with a $15 million short position on ETH. This bold Bitcoin OG short position represents one of the most significant bearish moves we’ve seen from a veteran crypto investor this year. Why Would a Bitcoin OG Bet Against Ethereum?

When experienced investors make moves this substantial, the market pays attention. This Bitcoin OG short position serves as a powerful signal about potential market direction. Veteran traders like 1011short typically base decisions on comprehensive analysis rather than emotional reactions. Their willingness to take such a large leveraged position suggests they see clear fundamental or technical reasons for Ethereum’s potential decline. However, it’s crucial to remember that even seasoned investors can be wrong. The cryptocurrency markets remain highly volatile and unpredictable. While this Bitcoin OG short position carries weight due to the investor’s track record, it represents just one perspective in a diverse market. How Should Crypto Investors Respond? Seeing a respected Bitcoin OG take such a strong stance naturally raises questions for other market participants. Should you follow this lead or view it as a contrary indicator? The answer depends on your investment strategy and risk tolerance. Consider these factors before making any decisions: Do your own research – Never blindly follow any trader, no matter how experienced Assess your risk profile – Leveraged positions carry significant danger Consider time horizon – Short-term moves may not align with long-term strategies Diversify appropriately – Avoid overconcentration in any single position The Bigger Picture: What This Means for Crypto Markets This Bitcoin OG short position reflects broader tensions within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The relationship between Bitcoin maximalists and Ethereum supporters has always been complex. Moves like this highlight the ongoing debate about which blockchain technologies will dominate long-term. While some see Ethereum as Bitcoin’s natural successor in functionality, others remain skeptical about its scalability and regulatory position.

While Chinese reports indicate that Qian acquired a total of 194,951 Bitcoins over the years, British authorities seized only 61,000. This bolsters claims that more than 120,000 Bitcoins are still missing. Detective Joe Lane of London's Metropolitan Police said Qian allegedly “lost” the password to a wallet containing 20,000 BTC. The current value of these assets is approximately $1.75 billion. Qian is accused of funneling proceeds from an illegal fundraising operation in China called Lantian Gree into cryptocurrencies. Sentenced to 11 years and 8 months in prison at a November trial in the UK, Qian's sentencing process is now complete, and the focus is now on the return of the assets. UK courts determined that the 61,000 seized Bitcoins were linked to funds obtained from fraudulent activities in China. However, a hearing to return the Bitcoins to China has been postponed until January 2026. Due to the rise in Bitcoin prices, the market value of the assets in question has approached approximately $7 billion at times. International legal experts say the case is no longer just a money laundering case, but a test case for digital asset ownership and cross-border jurisdiction. Related News: Major Altcoin Whales Are Very Active: Here Are Their Transactions and Purchases According to victim testimonies reported in international media, the Lantian Gree investment program has left thousands of people saddled with heavy debt. Some say they haven't received their salaries for years, their families have been disrupted, and they still struggle with massive debts. Judge Sally-Ann Hales, in her ruling in the UK, said the victims had suffered serious harm not only financially but also socially and psychologically. According to court records in the UK, Qian: Since 2014, investors have opened accounts on exchanges such as Huobi and converted their money into BTC, When he came to the UK in 2017, he had around 70,000 BTC with him, During the 2018 raid, police found traces of an additional transfer of 18,800 BTC, As a result, a total of 61,000 BTC were confiscated. However, audits in China revealed that Qian had actually purchased 194,951 BTC. Therefore, the whereabouts of the more than 120,000 Bitcoins remain a major question mark. Experts say Qian's guilty plea in the UK demonstrates the effectiveness of evidence from China, with both countries working together to trace the funds and compensate the victims. According to information received from Chinese authorities, two partial payments were made to victims in the past: the first 5% and the second 8%. However, these rates are reportedly insufficient to cover the losses. *This is not investment advice.

The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) recently convened with government enforcement departments to address what they describe as a worrying revival of illegal crypto activities. Why is cryptocurrency speculation back on China’s radar? The PBOC meeting revealed that authorities have detected renewed interest in cryptocurrency trading and related financial activities. Despite China’s comprehensive ban on crypto transactions since 2021, officials noted that some participants continue to engage in cryptocurrency speculation through underground channels and offshore platforms. During the enforcement meeting, the central bank reaffirmed several critical positions: Virtual currencies lack legal tender status Cryptocurrencies cannot circulate as payment methods All financial activities involving digital assets remain illegal How do stablecoins threaten China’s financial security? The PBOC specifically highlighted stablecoins as a significant concern in their assessment of cryptocurrency speculation risks. Authorities stated that these digital assets fail to meet basic financial security standards, particularly regarding: Anti-money laundering (AML) requirements Know-your-customer (KYC) protocols Transaction monitoring capabilities This regulatory gap creates substantial vulnerabilities that criminals can exploit for illegal activities such as money laundering, fraud, and unauthorized fund transfers. The central bank emphasized that the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency speculation makes it particularly attractive to bad actors seeking to bypass traditional financial controls. What enforcement actions will China take against crypto activities? The PBOC has committed to intensifying its crackdown on all forms of cryptocurrency speculation and related financial services. Authorities plan to implement stricter monitoring and enforcement measures targeting: Underground trading platforms Cross-border crypto transactions Social media promotion of crypto investments Payment processing for digital assets Moreover, the central bank warned that both individuals and businesses involved in cryptocurrency speculation face severe legal consequences. The renewed enforcement focus suggests China remains committed to maintaining strict control over its financial system and preventing capital outflows through digital assets. What does this mean for global cryptocurrency markets? China’s strengthened stance against cryptocurrency speculation could have significant implications for international crypto markets. Historically, Chinese regulatory announcements have caused substantial price volatility in major digital assets. The PBOC’s warning serves as a reminder that despite decentralization claims, government policies continue to heavily influence cryptocurrency valuation and adoption. Investors and market participants should monitor how China’s enforcement actions evolve, as increased regulatory pressure could impact: Trading volumes on global exchanges Development of crypto-related technologies Institutional adoption timelines Regulatory approaches in other jurisdictions Final thoughts on China’s crypto crackdown The PBOC’s latest warning represents more than just routine enforcement—it signals China’s unwavering commitment to controlling financial innovation within its borders. As cryptocurrency speculation attempts to resurge, authorities have made clear they will not tolerate challenges to their monetary sovereignty. This development underscores the ongoing tension between decentralized digital assets and national regulatory frameworks worldwide. Frequently Asked Questions What specific activities does China consider illegal cryptocurrency speculation? China prohibits all financial activities involving virtual currencies, including trading, mining, fundraising through token sales, and providing exchange services between crypto and fiat currencies. How does China enforce its cryptocurrency ban? Authorities use multiple approaches including internet monitoring, banking system surveillance, investigation of suspicious transactions, and cooperation with technology companies to block access to trading platforms. Can Chinese citizens still access cryptocurrency markets? While the ban makes domestic access illegal, some users employ virtual private networks (VPNs) and offshore exchanges, though authorities continue to close these loopholes through enhanced enforcement. Why does China consider stablecoins particularly risky? Stablecoins pose unique challenges because their peg to traditional currencies could potentially undermine monetary policy, while their digital nature creates AML and KYC compliance gaps that facilitate illicit finance. What penalties do violators of China’s crypto ban face? Penalties range from financial fines and asset seizure to criminal charges for serious offenses, with businesses facing license revocation and individuals potentially receiving prison sentences. Has China’s position on cryptocurrency changed over time? China’s stance has consistently tightened since 2013, evolving from warnings to comprehensive bans on ICOs, domestic exchanges, mining operations, and finally all cryptocurrency transactions.

His post highlighted remarks from financial analyst Jake Claver, whose recent video detailed the pace at which over-the-counter and dark pool reserves of XRP may be diminishing. The discussion has led many readers to examine the implications of institutional demand, particularly as more exchange-traded products enter the market . If institutions can’t buy $XRP through OTC anymore… who’s left to sell? @RippleXrpie just posted a warning from Jake Claver, when the supply vanishes, the price doesn’t climb, it rockets The floodgates aren’t opening. They’re snapping off the hinges Repost if you are bullish https://t.co/O8GmYiip1s — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) November 27, 2025 OTC Availability Shrinking Rapidly In the video shared by X Finance Bull, Claver explains that institutional access to XRP has shifted notably since the introduction of spot ETFs . He states that these products are consuming large portions of the available supply through OTC desks and dark pool channels. According to his estimates, the total accessible amount in these private markets ranged from one to two billion XRP before the current surge in activity. Claver reports that approximately 800 million XRP were absorbed within the first week of ETF demand alone. He notes that this figure represents either half or nearly all of what he believed remained available through OTC and dark pool sources. Claver stresses that once these reserves are exhausted, institutional buyers will be forced to source XRP from public exchanges, which he argues could have a significant impact on price. Expectations for Additional XRP ETFs A key point in Claver’s video is his expectation that several of the largest asset managers may soon enter the XRP ETF market. He specifically names BlackRock , Vanguard, and Fidelity as firms he believes could introduce their own spot products. Claver suggests that if these firms join, the number of XRP ETFs would surpass the total of Bitcoin ETF offerings, a development he believes would place further strain on the limited supply. He emphasizes that the current wave of purchases does not yet include these major institutions, implying that demand could increase substantially once they participate. Claver argues that the assumption that institutions will indefinitely rely on OTC channels for accumulation is misplaced because the available pool is already approaching depletion. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Early Price Signals and Exchange Activity Claver references recent movements on public exchanges as an indication of what he believes may come next. He notes that XRP briefly recorded a high of $91 on Kraken in the prior week, and he highlights that this instance was registered on the platform. He contrasts this with past occurrences on other exchanges where extreme price spikes circulated through user-shared videos but did not appear in official trading records. Claver interprets the Kraken event as an early example of how rapidly prices may react when institutional buyers must turn to open markets. He predicts that once OTC and dark pool supply is exhausted, increased ETF inflows will translate into sharp market adjustments. He reiterates that he expects the developments he has been forecasting for the past 18 months to materialize soon, driven primarily by the structural shift in how institutions access XRP.

While discussions around blockchain technology often focus on market movements or short-term performance, this commentary redirected attention toward the technical foundations that differentiate leading networks. By outlining how Cardano’s design compares with other major chains, the commentator presented a structured assessment of where the project may stand in the cryptocurrency space. Comparison With Leading Blockchains In the video attached to the post , David X Crypto began by reviewing the current composition of the top cryptocurrency rankings. He noted that Bitcoin holds the largest position by market capitalization, followed by assets such as USDT and USDC, which are pegged to the U.S. dollar and therefore not treated as traditional investments. He then shifted focus to the architecture of popular smart contract platforms, highlighting that Ethereum , BNB Chain, and Solana rely on account-based models. This framework differs significantly from the unspent transaction output model, or UTXO, which is used by Bitcoin. The commentator emphasized that Cardano’s distinctive position comes from combining a fixed supply structure with a UTXO-based design. By doing so, Cardano adopts characteristics associated with Bitcoin’s predictability and transaction reliability while still operating as a smart contract platform. According to the analysis, these factors separate Cardano from other networks that depend on alternative accounting models. Cardano's design advantage is bigger than people think pic.twitter.com/0FRSpCsV2S — David X Crypto (@DaveXCrypto) November 26, 2025 Security and Transaction Predictability David X Crypto explained that Cardano’s reliance on UTXO contributes to a clear and deterministic approach to transaction processing. This structure is often viewed as beneficial for security because each transaction output is handled independently, reducing ambiguity in network state. He stated that this model supports stronger guarantees regarding how transactions behave on-chain, a point he contrasted with account-based systems that manage balances differently. This predictability, combined with a fixed supply of ADA, forms a central theme in the commentator’s explanation of Cardano’s long-term design strengths. He noted that scarcity is an important factor in understanding the asset’s potential future role, especially when evaluated alongside its security framework. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Role in Connecting Bitcoin to DeFi One of the key points in the video was the suggestion that Cardano could function as a bridge for Bitcoin within decentralized finance. David X Crypto argued that Cardano’s technical structure makes it suitable for enabling Bitcoin holders to interact with smart contracts without compromising the security properties they expect from the Bitcoin ecosystem. This capability, he said, could position Cardano as a useful intermediary for expanding Bitcoin’s utility. Focused Development and Future Outlook The commentator concluded by acknowledging that every blockchain presents its own set of advantages and trade-offs. However, he noted that Cardano’s blend of UTXO security, controlled supply mechanics, and research-driven upgrades distinguishes it within the sector. In his view, this combination supports the argument that Cardano is a strong contender for long-term relevance as the industry advances.

55088068,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=870049,1764404613,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55088068.jpeg,Arthur Hayes sticks with $250K Bitcoin target as year’s end nears,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/hayes-doubles-down-on-250k-btc-call/,"Arthur Hayes, a seasoned market analyst and former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, remains steadfast in his $250,000 Bitcoin (BTC) price projection, highlighting the catalysts that could drive the potential rally. During his appearance on the Milk Road Show, he refused to back down on the potential of BTC even as the year comes to a close. With just 33 days left in the year, Hayes continues to insist on a 170% surge to a new all-time high. His forecast generated discussion among crypto investors. At this time, reporters reached out to the Bitcoin supporter for comment on the situation. When they asked him to weigh in on the set target record, Hayes noted: “I’m going to stick with it,” he said, adding that Bitcoin either gets to the price or not. Hayes says Bitcoin has bottomed and is now ready to rise Supporting his bullish outlook, Hayes believes Bitcoin has already hit its bottom. Specifically, he earlier called the plunge to $80,600 last week as the bottom for BTC, a prediction that appears to be going in the right direction at least for now. Since then, Bitcoin has rebounded almost 12% from that low to its current price of $90,864. Last week, Bitcoin plummeted below $90,000, reaching a seven-month low, just one day after erasing all of its 2025 gains. According to Hayes, the leading cryptocurrency, which hit the low $90,000s, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 stock indexes are near all-time highs, was a clear indication that a “credit event is brewing.” According to Hayes, Bitcoin now has support from the US dollar liquidity, which he believes has also attained its bottom. He continues to say that the Oct. 10 leverage washout, which wiped out billions of dollars from the crypto market, has stirred a reset. Interestingly, Hayes argues that much of the inflow into BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) was tied to a “basis trade” strategy. In this setup, major institutions such as Goldman Sachs buy shares of the Bitcoin ETF and then use those holdings as collateral to borrow funds and open short positions on the CME against the underlying asset. As funding rates fall, these players unwind the trade by selling the ETF and buying back the futures at a profit. According to Hayes, this leveraged institutional strategy has likely now played out. “We are bottom here and can go higher,” Hayes concluded Hayes eyes Fed rate cuts and end of QT to fuel Bitcoin’s next surge For the moment, he argues that the now-bottomed US dollar liquidity, along with the end of quantitative tightening (QT), will drive the next leg up for Bitcoin. Notably, the Federal Reserve System (Fed) slashed interest rates by 25 basis points in October, suggesting that the days of tightening the money supply are almost over. Polymarket data suggests an 87% probability that the Fed will cut interest rates by December 10. Such high confidence in prediction markets indicates that traders are heavily betting on a shift in monetary policy. These odds have climbed sharply from previous weeks, reflecting a growing consensus on the Fed’s next move. Analysts also expect the Fed to conclude quantitative tightening as early as December 1, ahead of the anticipated rate cut. Hayes is confident that these events will propel the leading crypto to its current all-time high of $126,220 to $250,000 by the end of the year. However, Hayes notes he may be wrong, but he was not bothered about that. “I’m long, right? I’m still happy either way,” Hayes stated. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

According to new federal records, the man was ensnared by an attractive stranger after receiving a text to help her walk her dog while she was out of town. The man, whose identity Florida authorities are still keeping a secret and was only identified as victim 1 in federal court records, mentioned that he replied to the stranger’s text. He told the attractive lady that she had the wrong number , but noted that the chatty stranger kept the conversation going. The stranger introduced herself as Astrid Orlov, telling the man that she lived at Lake Nona, a busy Orlando neighborhood, with her uncle. Florida authorities report $317,000 fake investment scam The Florida native claimed that things soon started becoming serious, and they started to talk frequently. He claimed that they soon moved their conversation to WhatsApp, then to video chat, although the man claimed that he could not see her during their calls. Orlov claimed that the reason he couldn’t see her face was due to the poor internet connection in the location that she traveled to, a reason he believed because he had no reason to doubt her. According to court records, filings didn’t indicate if the tone of their conversations was platonic or romantic, but their talks eventually moved from everyday conversations and check-ups to money. The pair spent an extended period talking about investments, specifically gold and digital assets. Orlov claimed that she successfully traded gold online and credited most of her success to her uncle, who watches algorithms to determine what was going to happen with its price. Court records filed in the US District Court’s Middle District of Florida in Orlando claimed that Orlov eventually succeeded in convincing the man to invest in the trading platform XM DeFi. At Orlov’s insistence to get things moving fast, the man wired $5,000 from his bank account to a crypto account he started for her and bought Bitcoin, which he sent to an address that was provided by Orlov in favor of the XM DeFi trading platform. The scammer deceived the victim with early profits The federal court records showed that Orlov instructed the Florida native on how he should buy and sell digital assets through the website to make profits. “Following his initial investment, Victim 1 was able to view what he learned to be fictitious ‘earnings’ on the website,” court documents said. The man said everything seemed legitimate, since he was able to withdraw about $278 in digital assets from his XM DeFi account to his Crypto.com account. “After his first successful withdrawal of what he believed to be profits from the website, Victim 1 believed that with ‘Orlov’s’ assistance, he could successfully trade gold and make a large amount of money on the platform,” federal court records said. At Orlov’s insistence, the man made another $312,000 in payments from February to May 2024, claiming he thought he was making deals on the trading platform. “During this time, Victim 1 conducted ‘trades’ on and through the ‘XM Defi’ fraudulent website. Nearly each time he conducted a trade, his investment on the website appeared to grow. Victim 1 stated that during this time, it appeared he only lost a small amount of money on two ‘trades,’” court records said. However, by April 2024, the man started having doubts about the whole investment due to funds missing from his XM DeFi account balance. After he complained to Orlov, she insisted everything was fine, and she was a real person. She even sent a picture of the Florida driver’s license, which turned out to be fake, to him. Further checks by federal authorities showed that the state has no one under the name. The Florida man was not the only one scammed in the con, with authorities identifying at least 16 other people who lost more than $4 million to strangers. Get seen where it counts.

This comes as governments worldwide face difficulty in achieving uniform crypto tax regulations , even as the crypto industry heats up with wider adoption. Swiss Government Delays Implementation Of Popular Crypto Law In a press release , the Swiss Federal Council announced that the new Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) will be enshrined into law from January 2026, but will not be implemented until 2027 at the earliest. The National Council’s Economic Affairs and Taxation Committee (ETAC) earlier this month suspended deliberations on the partner states with which Switzerland intends to exchange data under the crypto law, which prompted this decision. The Federal Council also determined that the provisions on crypto assets contained in the Federal Act on the Automatic Exchange of Information in Tax Matters (AEOIA) and AEOI Ordinance shall not apply next year. Meanwhile, the government approved amendments to the Automatic Exchange of Information in Tax Matters (AEOI Ordinance). The release noted that the crypto law contains implementing provisions on amending the Federal Act on the AEOIA. As part of the amendments, the AEOI Ordinance now includes the crypto service providers’ duty to report, duty to conduct due diligence, and duty to register. It also specifies their nexus to Switzerland. Furthermore, under the crypto law, crypto service providers such as exchanges will now directly apply to associations and foundations, and their accounts will be subject to the law. However, they are excluded from the AEOI if they meet certain conditions under the revised ordinance. Lastly, the law also contains transitional provisions that make it easier for the affected parties to implement the amended CRS and the CARF. The Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) will enable the automatic exchange of tax information on crypto transactions between countries. Other countries, including the U.S. and the U.K., are working to implement this global standard of crypto tax reporting into their legal frameworks. U.K. Also Moves To Implement CARF In a release , the U.K. government announced that it is implementing the CARF for the first international data exchanges in 2027. The government noted that the CARF requires U.K. reporting crypto asset service providers (RCASPs) to collect relevant tax information and undertake due diligence in relation to their users on an annual basis. These U.K. RCASPs will also be required to collect information concerning U.K. resident customers. This means that the country’s tax authority, HMRC, will have CARF data on all taxpayers using a U.K.-based RCASP. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the U.S. is also planning to implement the crypto law.

The analyst also revealed what needs to happen for the altcoin to invalidate this potential parabolic rally. XRP Price Could Rally 10x If This 2017 Pattern Plays Out In an X post, ChartNerd predicted that the XRP price could rally 1,000% if a bullish pattern from the 2017 bull cycle plays out. The analyst noted that during the 2017 euphoric run, the altcoin had a 3-month cool-off period where it successfully dropped towards its 3-month 20-EMA for a retest before a 25x move to the upside. Related Reading: Analyst Says Get Ready For XRP Price Above $4 This Cycle ChartNerd revealed that the XRP price has now witnessed the exact same set-up in this 2025 bull cycle. The altcoin recorded a huge breakout last year and is now seeing a 3-month cool-off period towards a 3-month 20-EMA retest. The analyst stated that if history is set to repeat, XRP could see a 10x upside move, signaling a blow-off top. The analyst also alluded to the 2021 lower high, which he noted ties up with both the monthly candle close highs from 2017 and also the SEC lawsuit, which is believed to have suppressed the XRP price during the 2021 cycle. ChartNerd added that to invalidate this potential rally, XRP will need to close below its 3-month 20-EMA at $1.20. Until then, he noted that the bulls remain in control. Meanwhile, ChartNerd outlined $8, $13, and $27 as the potential top-out points for the XRP price. Notably, a rally to any of these price targets will mark a new all-time high (ATH) for the altcoin. Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto had also previously predicted that XRP could reach $27 in this bull run if it mirrors the 2017 price action. XRP Could Be The Next Crypto To Record A Major Run Market commentator Milk Road suggested in an X post that the XRP price could soon record a major run. The platform cited bullish fundamentals for the altcoin, including the fact that RLUSD crossed $1 billion in market cap in record time. The run to this milestone is said to be faster than almost any stablecoin Ripple has ever pushed. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Hit $100 Before Bitcoin Hits $1 Million Furthermore, Milk Road noted that Abu Dhabi’s ADGM has opened the door for institutions to use RLUSD as real collateral, which is also bullish for the XRP price. The market commentator stated that global liquidity with regulated on-ramps could mean the kind of flows that crypto hasn’t seen in months. It is also worth noting that XRP is seeing significant flows into its ecosystem through the U.S. spot ETFs. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.18, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The company filed a full withdrawal with the SEC, bringing an end to a product that once aimed to enter a rapidly expanding market. The move caught interest because it arrived amid high anticipation for XRP ETF launches . Diana (@InvestWithD), a well-known crypto analyst, shared the filing and pointed out that CoinShares did not opt for a temporary pause. She noted that the Form RW signaled a final decision rather than a strategic reset. The filing shows a clear message. CoinShares stated that the transaction it planned “was not effectuated.” It also confirmed that no shares were sold. The company chose to end the entire registration process instead of shifting it to the SEC’s new fast-track path.

𝐅𝐮𝐥𝐥𝐲… pic.twitter.com/pch5U7fpKV — Diana (@InvestWithD) November 28, 2025 Market Conditions Behind the Decision The U.S. ETF market changed swiftly during this cycle. Major firms now dominate the space. Diana pointed to the strength of firms like BlackRock, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton as a central part of the pressure smaller issuers face. Their scale makes it difficult for new entrants to compete on cost, liquidity, and marketing reach. While BlackRock has yet to join the XRP ETF race, many market participants expect it to happen. Experts have also revealed that 12 XRP ETFs are ready to launch . CoinShares appears to be adjusting its priorities to avoid competition. CoinShares also recently sought a major strategic shift through its Nasdaq merger. The company is moving toward a model that focuses on global expansion and diversified revenue streams. A U.S. XRP ETF may no longer fit into that plan. Why This Does Not Harm the XRP Market This withdrawal does not signal reduced interest in XRP. It instead reflects the current state of competition in the ETF industry. Firms without a deep distribution network face high costs to enter a segment where fee compression limits future returns.

Institutional interest in XRP is at record levels. The XRP ETF landscape continues to grow despite CoinShares’ decision to leave. Diana pointed out that 21Shares is preparing to launch its XRP ETF early next week. Market participants expect heavy interest around that debut. Its arrival will keep liquidity flowing into the XRP segment even without CoinShares in the mix. Large issuers maintain a strong presence in the digital asset ETF arena. Many analysts expect BlackRock to enter the XRP ETF market soon , which would create a major shift in visibility and inflows. The foundation for long-term growth remains in place.

55089379,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=870078,1764407244,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55089379.jpeg,"Elderly victim loses $22,000 in Amazon-linked scam",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/scammers-elderly-victim-steal-22000-amazon/,"Scammers have stolen about $22,000 from an elderly man after he fell victim to a sophisticated Bitcoin fraud scheme. According to the police, the scam started with a fraudulent Amazon text message appearing on his phone from Amazon. The text claimed that his account had been compromised. After receiving the fraudulent texts, the victim then received calls from someone who identified himself as Agent John Krebs from the Federal Trade Commission, calling from a Washington, D.C. number. The caller told the man that he was under investigation for money laundering and gave him details on how to resolve the charges. The victim claimed that the scammer asked him to deposit $22,000 into a Bitcoin ATM at a gas station along South Dixie Highway in West Palm Beach. Scammers trick elderly victim into paying $22,000 in BTC Rachel Leitao, public information officer with the West Palm Beach Police Department, noted that residents need to stop paying Bitcoin to criminals who claim they can resolve any issue they have. “No government agency is going to contact you if you need to make a payment at a Bitcoin kiosk. That is a red flag,” she said. Police have now taken it upon themselves to warn residents about the increased rate of fraudulent schemes during the holiday season. Leitao claimed that there is always an increase in scams around the holiday season. The warning comes as scammers have continued to target local victims in the area. According to reports, another local victim, John Klingel, told reporters that he lost more than $38,000 to these scammers who put pressure on him to deposit funds into a Bitcoin kiosk. He claimed that the scammers are very crafty and slick, noting that they will stop at nothing to convince you to pay the fees. The warnings also come amid a rise in cryptocurrency fraud across the United States. The American Association of Retired Persons reported that more than $9.3 billion was lost to scammers due to fraud and theft related to digital assets. The report claimed that elderly people aged 60 or older lost about $2.8 billion of the total funds. As these scams are increasing, the West Palm Beach Police are also putting measures in place to help residents against these scammers. Police urge citizens to be cautious of these criminals The West Palm Beach police recently announced that it is encouraging its residents to sign up for what it calls Operation Senior Shield, a free system that sends alerts and updates on the latest scams to help elderly residents recognize red flags and protect their funds and personal information. “It really focuses on making sure that there’s awareness surrounding these financial and fraud scams,” Leitao said. Klingel said he plans to sign up for the program. The police have assured the general public that the investigation into the West Palm Beach victim’s case remains ongoing, and they are looking to track down the operations of the scammers after he received the funds. At the same time, the police have claimed that it will start sending out alerts to residents who have signed up for the Operation Senior Shield, a development that is set to kickstart at the beginning of next month. Meanwhile, the West Palm Beach police have revealed guidelines that could help citizens avoid these scams. They urge citizens to verify all agency calls via the official number or website. The police also noted that law enforcement will never ask for money, digital assets , or gift cards. They also asked residents not to share their personal information online, urging them to talk to someone they trust around them if they feel that something is off.

This includes highly anticipated funds for XRP, SOL, and LTC. But what does this mean for investors and the broader cryptocurrency market? Why Did CoinShares Withdraw Its Spot ETF Applications? The company cited limited profitability as the primary reason for pulling its spot ETF applications. CoinShares explained that the U.S. market has consolidated around a few major players. This consolidation makes it challenging for smaller issuers to differentiate their products and ensure financial success. This strategic retreat represents a significant shift in the company’s approach to the American market. Rather than competing in an increasingly crowded space, CoinShares is choosing to focus its resources elsewhere. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? The withdrawal of these spot ETF applications affects several major cryptocurrencies. Investors waiting for XRP, SOL, and LTC ETFs will need to reconsider their strategies. However, this doesn’t mean these assets lack investment potential. Consider these key implications: Reduced immediate ETF options for XRP, SOL, and LTC investors Potential short-term price volatility for affected cryptocurrencies Increased importance of direct cryptocurrency investments Focus shifts to existing approved ETFs and alternative investment vehicles How Will CoinShares Move Forward? Instead of pursuing spot ETF applications, CoinShares is redirecting its attention to a $1.2 billion SPAC merger. This alternative strategy aims to secure a Nasdaq listing, providing the company with different growth opportunities. The shift demonstrates how cryptocurrency firms are adapting to market realities. The company’s decision highlights several market challenges: Intense competition among ETF issuers High regulatory compliance costs Need for product differentiation in crowded markets Importance of strategic resource allocation What Can We Learn From This Strategic Move? CoinShares’ withdrawal of its spot ETF applications teaches valuable lessons about the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Market consolidation is becoming increasingly common, and companies must make tough decisions about where to compete. This situation shows that even promising spot ETF applications can face unexpected hurdles. Companies must continuously assess market conditions and be willing to pivot when necessary. The cryptocurrency space remains dynamic, requiring flexible strategies and careful risk management. Conclusion: Looking Beyond Spot ETF Applications CoinShares’ decision to withdraw its spot ETF applications reflects the practical realities of today’s financial markets. While disappointing for some investors, it represents smart business strategy. The company’s pivot toward a Nasdaq listing through its SPAC merger shows alternative paths to growth in the digital asset space. The cryptocurrency market continues to mature, and such strategic decisions are part of that natural evolution. Investors should watch how other companies respond to these market conditions and adjust their own strategies accordingly. Frequently Asked Questions Why did CoinShares withdraw all spot ETF applications? CoinShares withdrew its applications due to limited profitability prospects, citing market consolidation around major issuers and difficulty in product differentiation. Which cryptocurrencies were affected by this withdrawal? The withdrawal affected spot ETF applications for XRP, SOL, and LTC, meaning these specific cryptocurrency ETFs won’t launch through CoinShares. What is CoinShares focusing on instead of ETFs? The company is now concentrating on its $1.2 billion SPAC merger to secure a Nasdaq listing, representing a strategic shift in its growth approach. Does this mean spot ETFs are no longer profitable? Not necessarily. The decision reflects specific market conditions and CoinShares’ position rather than a general statement about spot ETF profitability. Can other companies still launch similar ETFs? Yes, other companies can still pursue spot ETF applications for these cryptocurrencies, though they’ll face the same market challenges. How should investors react to this news? Investors should assess their portfolio strategies and consider alternative ways to gain exposure to these cryptocurrencies beyond ETF structures. Found this analysis helpful?

Currently trading at $2,800 levels after breaking below the $3,000 mark for the first time, the world’s largest smart contract platform faces a delicate market condition fueled by the uncertainty surrounding the international financial market. Despite ongoing accumulation by long-term holders of the cryptocurrency, the constant sell-off by ETF funds and the treasury wallet continues to pose pressures on the decrease in prices. Also predicting the decline of the cryptocurrency below the $2,200 mark in the event of deteriorating international financial market conditions are recent bearish forecasts by some top institutions such as Citi. Among the projects being highlighted in the current crypto news is the one named Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , being pegged as one of the top cryptos to buy for individuals in search of good ROI. Presale Demand Accelerates as Phase 6 Nears Capacity While Ethereum is struggling through resistance levels, Mutuum Finance is recording heavy inflows of funds. The presale of the project has also become the center of attention for many who are seeking the next big cryptocurrency in the market. This presale has already raised $19,020,000 from inception. At the moment, the presale is in Phase 6 and is 95% sold out. People realize the importance of the presale due to its current pricing of $0.035. After the presale ends, the prices will jump to $0.040 per unit. Data indicates the cumulative number of holders has exceeded 18,250, indicating widespread support in excess of pure speculation. Phase 1 initial buyers who participated in the sale already realize a 250% paper profit. However, with the fixed list price at $0.06, the current buyers are poised for a potential 400-500% return on investment. To make it more attractive for people to purchase the token, the group announced the $100,000 giveawa y among ten lucky individuals. Dual Lending Architecture Fixes Liquidity Risk Fragmentation One of the major reasons for the bullish outlook on the future of Mutuum is the freshness it brings to the DeFi world in terms of its approach towards cryptocurrency lending. While regular DeFi platforms follow one uniform system for cryptocurrency lending, the approach adopted by the platform in its Dual Lending Architecture in the form of the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model in conjunction with the Peer-to-Peer (P2P). Marketplace allows for the wide application of its system for various kinds of cryptocurrency assets. This helps span the potential market for cryptocurrency lending for the platform because of its deep-rooted significance in the market for being the best cryptocurrency to invest in 2025. Safety & Roadmap Milestones By the nature of the industry it operates in, where many projects make too many promises with no real follow-through in their security measures and developments, it is refreshing to note that the work being done by the individuals behind Mutuum Finance is top-notch. So far, the V1 protocol is expected to go live on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. It will come equipped with one of its major components: the Liquidator Bot. Additionally, an individual audit by blockchain security business Halborn Security is being performed. Strategic Growth Focus Ethereum is facing a very complicated macroeconomic environment. But in all such complexities, the clarity that exists in the mission of Mutuum along with its immense growth potential in the future make it very attractive. Presale is almost over for MUTM making joining now all the more rewarding for this new crypto coin.

The co-founder of BitMEX asserted that the token model introduced by Monad, which is based on a large fully diluted valuation and a limited supply of circulating tokens, creates a mechanism by which early stakeholders can sell tokens when the public is aware of them. Despite his revelation of a small holding of MON, Hayes stated that he was 99% bearish and that Monad currently holds no competitive edge compared to major blockchains. Arthur Hayes calls Monad’s setup favorable to early investors Hayes said that MON, promoted in some conversations as a possible Ethereum competitor, is structured in a way that leaves retail buyers vulnerable during its first phase of price discovery. He described the token as a VC dump scheme, which was constructed to exploit retail investors, referring to the disparity between the fully diluted valuation and the initial amount of supply on the market. Hayes stated that a combination of small inflows can cause the price to rise, whereby the first to invest can decrease their exposure when late entrants arrive, resulting in unpredictable market dynamics. Hayes also ruled out the opinion that Monad would compete with other major networks in his remarks. According to him, the project had a zero probability of success compared to Ethereum, and it also did not align with Solana’s current status. His comments centered on token economics and distribution, rather than technical specifications, citing issues he had already voiced about assets issued with limited supply and multibillion-dollar valuations. Abrupt reversal on MON sparks further debate Hayes’s criticism came shortly after he entered and exited a position in MON. On November 25, he announced that he had acquired the token, even though he referred to it as another high-FDV, low-float layer-1 asset. Hayes then changed his mind after seven hours and released a chart showing the downward movement of the token, informing his followers that he had lost the position. He wrote, “I’m out. Send this dogshit to ZERO,” which once again intensified market interest in the asset’s rapid price change. I'm out. Send this dogshit to ZERO! $MON 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 pic.twitter.com/qUYgmhvPsT — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) November 27, 2025 The turnaround also contrasted with the past, where he had been making public speeches about some of the assets. The traders cited an example of his action of dumping all his Hyperliquid in September, just a few weeks after he had informed them that he was optimistic. Hayes made these comments as part of a broader suggestion regarding the behavior of early-stage assets in response to concentrated trade and high fully diluted valuations. During the early stages of the token market, supply limits were still being debated by market participants, with implications for liquidity and stability as trading volumes intensified. MON still trades in a high-risk environment in its initial post-airdrop period. As of press time, the token was trading at $0.035874 , recording a 4.16% decline over the past 24 hours, with a 24-hour trading volume of $ 379,410,603.

He says newly launched XRP ETFs are devouring available supply at record speed, long before giants like BlackRock, Vanguard, and Fidelity even step in. As highlighted by market analyst Diana, Claver acknowledges that XRP ETFs are “eating through OTC desks and dark pools like a vacuum.” These private liquidity channels normally cater to institutions making large, discreet purchases, yet even they’re drying up. It’s a clear sign that institutional demand for XRP is accelerating far faster than expected. Claver stressed that today’s XRP ETFs are just the opening act. “We still don’t have BlackRock, Vanguard, or Fidelity,” he noted, warning that the world’s biggest asset managers haven’t even entered the market yet. Once they launch XRP-backed products, he argues, the market could face a seismic supply shock that reshapes liquidity and pricing dynamics. Well, this scenario isn’t hypothetical. Earlier this year, Bitcoin ETFs saw billions in inflows within weeks, as major issuers absorbed massive amounts of BTC. If XRP mirrors that trajectory, and Claver argues demand could be even stronger given XRP’s utility-driven appeal, its available supply could contract far faster than the market expects. If BlackRock, Vanguard, and Fidelity roll out XRP ETFs, the asset would instantly command more institutional fund tracking than Bitcoin, a historic turning point for the entire crypto market. Such a shift would elevate XRP into the ranks of the most institutionally supported digital assets worldwide. The ripple effects would be profound: tighter supply, accelerating ETF accumulation, and intensifying competition among major buyers. This dynamic could propel XRP into an entirely new valuation era while boosting its liquidity, visibility, and legitimacy. In turn, previously cautious investors may be drawn in, reshaping XRP’s long-term market structure. Conclusion Claver highlights a critical turning point for XRP. Early ETFs are already consuming vast liquidity, and with BlackRock, Vanguard, and Fidelity yet to enter, the market edges toward a historic supply crunch. Should these giants launch XRP products, institutional demand could skyrocket, potentially transforming XRP’s valuation, market dynamics, and its role in the crypto ecosystem.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-29 09:33:40

Key Takeaways: Greenidge Generation Holdings shut its New York mine after an electrical switchgear failure caused a fire. The 106-MW site, co-hosting gear with NYDIG, is a critical asset. The outage hits as hashprice sits near ~$39 PH/s, below many miners’ breakeven. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said the incident was triggered by an “electrical switchgear failure,” which led management to de-energize the entire plant as a safety precaution. The site, which hosts company-owned machines as well as equipment operated by NYDIG, has remained offline since the incident. Greenidge Says Dresden Bitcoin Mine to Reopen in Weeks Greenidge said the fire did not damage its mining rigs and added that it expects to restore full operations within “a few weeks,” although no timeline has been provided. The Dresden facility produces roughly 106 megawatts of natural-gas power used directly for Bitcoin mining, making it one of the company’s most important energy assets. The interruption comes at a difficult moment for the mining sector, which continues to grapple with falling profit margins, volatile Bitcoin prices, and rising energy costs. Hashpricem a key indicator of miner profitability, plunged in November after Bitcoin briefly dipped toward $80,000, pushing revenues per unit of computing power below breakeven levels for many operators. Data from Hashrate Index shows hashprice recently recovering to around $39 per petahash per second (PH/s), still below the level most miners consider sustainable for long-term operations. $GREE Greenidge's Dresden Plant Hit by Electrical Fire, Forcing Shutdown of #Bitcoin Mine https://t.co/rSDWNKi3vT — TheMinerMag (@TheMinerMag_) November 28, 2025 The Greenidge fire also follows a wave of stress across the sector. Tether recently confirmed it had shut down its Bitcoin mining operations in Uruguay , citing soaring electricity prices and an unresolved billing dispute with a state-owned utility. At the same time, US authorities have reportedly opened an investigation into Bitmain over national security concerns linked to its ASIC manufacturing business. The Chinese company accounts for the majority of the global mining equipment market, and any restrictions could further disrupt operations for US-based miners. CleanSpark Revenue Surges 102% As reported, CleanSpark delivered what executives described as a “transformative” fiscal year, reporting $766.3 million in revenue for the period ending September 30, 2025, a 102% jump from the previous year. The company’s results show a dramatic reversal from 2024, underscoring how its expanded strategy is reshaping both operations and financial performance. Net income came in at $364.5 million, compared with a $145.8 million loss last year. Adjusted EBITDA surged to $823.4 million, up from $245.8 million a year earlier. The strong fiscal results follow CleanSpark’s $1.15 billion zero-coupon convertible notes offering, which brought $1.13 billion in net proceeds and allowed the firm to repurchase 30.6 million shares for roughly $460 million. As of September 30, CleanSpark held $1.2 billion in Bitcoin, $43 million in cash, and $950.1 million in mining assets, with total assets reaching $3.2 billion and stockholders’ equity at $2.2 billion.

The FBI usually highlights these issues to warn residents about impending thefts and all forms of danger to keep them safe. In its latest warning, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center has warned that scammers and other criminals are now increasingly impersonating financial institutions. The agency claimed that they do this in an attempt to steal money, describing their latest endeavor as what is known as an Account Takeover Fraud Scheme. The FBI claimed that it has received more than 5,000 complaints, claiming the reports have seen losses that have surpassed $262 million. The FBI issues a warning about new scam to the public According to the statement issued by the FBI, the scam typically involves a cybercriminal impersonating the victim’s financial institution’s staff or website in order to obtain access to their accounts. This typically happens through social engineering, which includes calls, texts, and emails, or phishing techniques, which usually involve sending fraudulent text messages that have a semblance of realness, so when the victim opens it, they have unknowingly given permission to the scammer. “Social engineering methods include contacting account owners via fraudulent text messages, calls, or emails to trick the email recipient into providing their login credentials. In some instances, the cyber criminal states there are fraudulent transactions on the financial account and may provide a link to a phishing website that the account owner believes will report the fraud or prevent additional fraudulent transactions,” the FBI’s announcement warns. The FBI alert also mentioned that in some cases, cybercriminals impersonating financial institutions reported to some account owners that their information was used to make fraudulent purchases, like firearms. The cybercriminal then convinces the victim to provide certain details to another cybercriminal posing as a law enforcement agent. The second criminal then convinces the account owner to provide their account information for checks. Talking about the phishing method, the FBI mentioned that the scammers often deploy fraudulent websites that look like the legitimate financial institution, or in some cases, payroll websites. The goal is to trick the account owner into entering their login credentials on the website, giving them away to the scammer unknowingly. Once the criminals are in charge of the account, they quickly wire funds to other accounts that are controlled by other criminals in their network. Scammers move funds using digital assets The FBI mentioned that some of these accounts are linked to digital wallets, making the disbursement of funds easier for them. In addition, it also makes it hard for law enforcement agencies to track and recover these funds for the owners. It states that in some cases, which include most of all the social engineering cases, the criminals change the passwords to the online accounts, locking out the owners until the criminals finish moving the funds in the account. The FBI also issued several tips so residents can keep themselves safe from these criminals and their scams. The agency noted that residents should be careful about the details they share with the public online. They also advised users to be careful when carrying out transactions, urging them to use unique or complex passwords. In addition, the agency recommended users to add their real financial websites to favorites for easy navigation. The FBI also warned residents to stay alert and be watchful against phishing attempts, asking them to report all suspicious activities. “Contact your financial institution as soon as fraud is recognized to request a recall or reversal, as well as a Hold Harmless Letter or Letter of Indemnity. Requesting a recall and obtaining a Hold Harmless Letter/indemnification documents as quickly as possible may reduce or eliminate your financial losses,” the FBI urges.

XRP is up by over 15% since this time last week, but it’s still down by double digits on a monthly scale. What would happen to its price in the first week of the last month of 2025? We decided to ask OpenAI’s highly utilized AI solution. XRP in the Week Ahead ChatGPT argued that the most significant reason behind XRP’s weekly surge to $2.20 as of press time has been the recent launches of spot ETFs tracking its performance. Recall that Canary Capital’s XRPC was the first to hit the US markets in mid-November, followed by similar financial vehicles from Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale. In total, the products attracted over $660 million in net inflows in their first few weeks. Nevertheless, the AI chatbot admitted that XRP remains in a “fragile position” as the market is yet to recover from the late October and Early November crash. In terms of technical aspects, ChatGPT said the following for the week ahead: RSI on the 4H and daily timeframes still shows “neutral recovery” rather than breakout conditions. Volume increased on the upside move, but remains lower than during the selloff — a sign that buyers are cautious. Bulls must reclaim $2.35–$2.40 to restart a larger trend reversal. Continued inflows into the next XRP ETFs, aligned with improved sentiment on the Bitcoin market front, and some institutional adoption updates could propel Ripple’s cross-border token toward the aforementioned $2.40 resistance. However, if the overall market conditions worsen again, or macro fears, such as rate cuts, intensify, then the asset might find itself dipping below $2.00 as it did earlier in November. Most Likely Scenario The AI chatbot believes the most likely scenario for the week ahead is a consolidation phase, meaning XRP will remain sideways, with a lower boundary at $2.18 and an upper one at $2.35. The less viable options would be a bear case and a drop to the $2.00 support, or a more bullish move toward $2.55, but only if the ETF inflows skyrocket or whales change their recent behavior and start to accumulate hard. “XRP has stabilized impressively after a turbulent month, but the market still shows signs of hesitation. The most realistic expectation is a consolidation between $2.18 and $2.35, with a potential breakout toward $2.50 if bullish catalysts line up,” concluded ChatGPT.

The figure exceeds national defense spending and has intensified discussions about long-term debt sustainability, prompting renewed attention toward fixed-supply digital assets such as Bitcoin and emerging projects that mirror its economic structure, including Bitcoin Munari. Rising borrowing expenses have reintroduced fiscal risk into macroeconomic analysis, with interest payments now representing the third-largest line item in the federal budget — surpassed only by Social Security and Medicare. The shift has coincided with the final day of Bitcoin Munari’s Round 2 presale at $0.22, drawing attention from participants reviewing assets whose issuance frameworks are not affected by expanding government liabilities. Federal Interest Costs Reach Multi-Decade High Net interest expenses in FY 2025 increased by $89 billion from the prior year, rising from $881 billion to $970 billion. The amount equals approximately $7,300 per US household and accounts for 3.1% of national GDP, placing it among the highest ratios in modern federal budgeting. The scale of these payments has surpassed allocations for national defense ($917 billion) and Medicaid ($668 billion), underscoring the pace at which debt-service obligations have expanded. Much of the increase reflects sustained borrowing requirements combined with higher average interest rates across short- and medium-term maturities. Analysts tracking federal expenditure note that interest costs have accelerated faster than most discretionary spending categories, placing increased emphasis on how long-term debt levels may influence macroeconomic conditions if borrowing continues at the current rate. The broader market response has included heightened interest in assets structured around verifiable scarcity, especially those tied to fixed issuance schedules. This shift has brought renewed attention to Bitcoin’s 21 million cap and, by extension, to projects adopting similar supply parameters. Bitcoin Munari’s Position Within Fixed-Supply Frameworks The rise in debt-related spending has contributed to a wider examination of digital assets that operate on predictable supply mechanics. Bitcoin Munari’s distribution model reflects this framework through its fixed 21,000,000 BTCM supply, embedded directly into the project’s economic design across both network phases. The project is structured around a dual-environment rollout, beginning as a Solana SPL asset before migrating to its dedicated Layer-1 blockchain through a 1:1 conversion bridge. Interest in fixed-issuance assets has increased as macroeconomic indicators highlight the scale of US borrowing commitments. Against this backdrop, Bitcoin Munari has continued its presale progression, reaching the final day of its second round at $0.22 under the project’s 10-round schedule and $6.00 benchmark valuation. Tokens remain fully unlocked at distribution, with availability commencing at the SPL deployment. Independent coverage from Crypto Show reviewed Bitcoin Munari’s migration sequence, validator structure, and network rollout model, providing an external assessment of the project’s technical components. Bitcoin Munari’s Validator System Opens the Door to Broad Participation Bitcoin Munari’s network model uses a Delegated Proof-of-Stake system organized across three participation tiers. Full validator nodes require 10,000 BTCM, server-grade hardware (8-core CPU, 32GB RAM, 1TB NVMe SSD), and sustained uptime for reward eligibility. A mobile validator tier allows participation beginning at 1,000 BTCM through a lightweight Android client that performs signature verification without storing the full chain. Delegators may stake 100 BTCM or more to existing validators, with rewards distributed proportionally based on validator performance and commission settings. Early network planning includes the transition from the Solana environment to the project’s standalone chain, with features such as EVM compatibility, governance functions, and configurable privacy tools forming the base of the mainnet protocol. The 1:1 migration bridge maintains consistency between the SPL phase and the native chain, preserving the fixed supply across both environments. External Verification and Technical Readiness Bitcoin Munari’s development cycle incorporates multiple external reviews. The project completed a smart-contract audit through Solidproof , underwent an additional review by Spy Wolf , and finalized team verification through Spy Wolf KYC . These evaluations contribute to the project’s technical groundwork as it moves toward its upcoming testnet phase, validator onboarding program, and subsequent mainnet deployment. The convergence of elevated federal borrowing costs and increasing interest in fixed-supply digital assets has shaped the environment surrounding Bitcoin Munari’s current distribution phase. The project continues its progression toward its mainnet transition as market participants evaluate assets with established issuance limits amid ongoing fiscal discussions. These conditions form the backdrop against which today marks the final day of availability at the $0.22 presale price.

55091413,https://timestabloid.com/?p=90923,1764410453,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Crypto News Today: Solana (SOL) Ethereum (ETH) and This $0.035 Altcoin Will Rally Hard Soon,https://timestabloid.com/crypto-news-today-solana-sol-ethereum-eth-and-this-0-035-altcoin/,"Investors watching crypto news today are reassessing what crypto to buy now as fresh volatility sweeps across Ethereum, Solana, and major altcoins. Both ETH and SOL are sliding into key support zones after weeks of downward pressure, prompting traders to explore the best crypto to buy and evaluate which assets could move sharply next. The broader downturn has not stopped institutional flows into Solana nor the steady development attention around Ethereum, yet the search for the best crypto to buy now continues, and a growing number of buyers are turning toward lower-priced alternatives such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently priced at $0.035. Ethereum Tests A Critical Support Zone Ethereum has been falling steadily, retreating from above $3,300 toward $2,680. Intraday action shows a clear pattern of lower highs and lower lows, and open interest has contracted from $15.4 billion to 15.3 billion. This reduction suggests that positions, mostly longs, are being closed rather than rotated into new aggressive shorts. Traders following what crypto to invest in note that falling open interest during a downtrend often reflects de-risking behavior, not a reversal. The rapid drop below $2,800 and the break toward $2,680 highlight persistent selling pressure. Multiple small recovery attempts have failed to alter the broader direction, and analysts note that volatility has increased as Ethereum lost the $3,200–3,300 support region. ETH is now retesting a structural support zone observed between March and July in 2025, and a breakdown below this region could open downside levels at $2,400–2,500. Those tracking the best crypto to invest in will be watching whether ETH can stabilize or whether the trend continues lower into December. Solana Gains Institutional Interest Despite Volatility Solana trades near $127 after sliding 31% over the past thirty days. Despite this decline, institutional flows into SOL have strengthened dramatically. Six U.S. spot ETFs have launched including offerings from Fidelity, VanEck, Bitwise, and 21Shares. Combined assets already exceed $2 billion, and ETF inflows hit $26.2 million on November 18, marking fifteen consecutive days of positive flows. Traders following top crypto opportunities find this behavior notable because steady inflows during selloffs often reflect long-term conviction. Technical structures show SOL sitting on an ascending-trendline support that has held multiple times in 2025. If this level holds, targets near $253 and $295 remain viable heading into 2026. Open interest, however, has collapsed from $8.84 billion to $3.36 billion, indicating substantial unwinding of leveraged positions. This reset positions Solana for sharper moves once a directional break occurs. Analysts evaluating which crypto to buy today believe SOL’s long-term outlook remains supported by strong developer activity and institutional presence. Mutuum Finance Fast Moving Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting increasing attention from traders shifting toward new opportunities. The presale has reached Phase 6 at a price of $0.035, reflecting a 250% rise from Phase 1. The campaign has raised $19,000,000 and onboarded 18,200 holders. Phase 6 is currently 95% filled, and buyers have only a brief window to enter before Phase 7 lifts the price nearly 20% to $0.04. The confirmed launch price of $0.06 positions Phase 6 participants for an estimated 328% ROI, motivating those seeking the next big crypto to act before this tier closes. Many investors tracking top cryptocurrencies note that Phase 6 is selling out fast, and the chance to secure tokens at this price will not last long. MUTM Leaderboard Mutuum Finance (MUTM) recently launched a dashboard showing the top 50 holders and expanded user engagement through a 24-Hour Leaderboard. Each day, the number one ranked contributor earns a $500 MUTM bonus provided at least one transaction occurs within that window. The leaderboard resets daily at 00:00 UTC. This system is resonating strongly with users who are comparing options in the search for the best cryptocurrency to invest in today. It also complements the protocol’s structured presale flow and strengthens long-term activity as the project approaches its next development phase. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is running a $100,000 giveaway divided across ten winners, each receiving $10,000 in MUTM. This initiative has boosted investor interest, particularly among traders who previously focused on SOL and ETH but now want exposure to a lower-cost asset with ongoing incentives. The combination of a fast-moving presale, daily leaderboard competition, and the substantial giveaway campaign has positioned MUTM as a rising choice for those deciding what crypto to buy now. Moving Ahead The market is delivering mixed conditions for Ethereum and Solana, yet institutional inflows and technical setups hint at potential rebounds. However, in the search for the best crypto to buy now, many investors are gravitating toward projects offering early-stage pricing and active community incentives. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as Phase 6 reaches its final stretch and holders anticipate the upcoming shift toward higher pricing in Phase 7.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-xrp-going-parabolic-soon-heres-why/,"Financial commentator Levi Rietveld shared a recent social media post in which he referenced a video from Raoul Pal, highlighting Pal’s discussion of macroeconomic and regulatory factors to suggest how these developments could strengthen the cryptocurrency market and affect XRP’s price. Pal argued that the Treasury General Account (TGA) is likely to decline, quantitative tightening (QT) will come to an end, China appears to be expanding its balance sheet, and forthcoming regulatory shifts and interest-rate cuts are likely to follow. He presented these factors as components of the next phase of the business cycle, which he suggested would move upward and channel purchasing power into risk assets, including crypto. Pal also criticized the short-term focus of many traders who monitor minute-by-minute charts instead of tracking broader macro trends. Rietveld’s post encouraged community members to pay attention to those macro factors and presented them as a potential basis for renewed strength in the cryptocurrency market, especially for XRP. $XRP GOING PARABOLIC SOON? pic.twitter.com/d69v1PichN — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) November 28, 2025 Market reaction and investor commentary In response to Rietveld’s post, an X user known as KtyKty_uuu expanded on the market-mechanism side of the argument, asserting that inflows from an active spot exchange-traded fund for the asset are already supplying liquidity to the market.] That commenter argued that continued ETF-driven demand could feasibly push XRP above targeted price levels within a shorter timeframe, and that sustained inflows next year might support further appreciation. Rietveld’s post largely relays these views without asserting them as certainties. It emphasizes observable policy changes and market mechanics—reduced TGA balances, the cessation of QT, central-bank behavior in China, regulatory adjustments, and prospective rate reductions—as factors that proponents say create an environment favorable to risk-on positioning. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The social-media discussion also highlighted a divergence between macro-driven investors and technical short-term traders, with the former prioritizing policy and liquidity trends. Assessment and implications Rietveld’s coverage summarizes Pal’s macroeconomic outlook and comments from retail observers who are focused on ETF inflows . It does not claim that these factors guarantee a rapid price increase. Instead, it presents them as the reasoning used by those who believe the demand for crypto could strengthen. It is worth noting that this view relies on forecasts about the economy, expectations about policy changes, and assumptions about how the market is structured. Each of these carries uncertainty and depends on how conditions evolve and how both institutional and retail participants react.

The exact size of the investment, which will be funded through the country’s gold and forex reserves, will be determined based on market conditions. Kazakhstan ready to buy cryptocurrency with gold and fiat The National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) may acquire up to $300 million worth of crypto assets, the head of the monetary authority announced on Friday. Speaking at a briefing for local media, NBK Chairman Timur Suleimenov indicated the regulator wants to see the dust from the latest market crash settle, before betting on Bitcoin, RBC reported. “This doesn’t mean we’ve just put $300 million in,” the central bank’s top executive remarked at the press conference, quoted by the Kazakhstani news outlet Zakon.kz, and elaborated: “Maybe we’ll limit ourselves to $50 million, maybe $100 million, or $250 million. This is a very difficult work, given the fact that the entire crypto market has collapsed, and we’re rethinking the prospects for monetization, achieving profitability, and so on.” The total capitalization of the global crypto market has dropped by some $500 billion in November, noted the crypto page of the Russian business news website. Bitcoin (BTC), the cryptocurrency with the largest market cap, fell by 17%, from $110,000 to $81,000, hitting a seven-month low. It has since rebounded to a little over $90,000 at the time of writing. Suleimenov emphasized the money for the crypto investment will come from the NBK’s gold and foreign exchange reserves, not from the Kazakhstan’s National fund at this point. The latter comprises financial assets in the government’s account at the central bank and other tangible assets used to ensure the country’s social and economic stability. The governor also noted that the regulator has already created a separate portfolio of investments in high-tech stocks and financial instruments related to digital assets. He stressed that Kazakhstan’s monetary authority is not going to make hasty investments but intends to wait for good opportunities to emerge, and explained to reporters: “After the current decline in all digital, financial, and crypto assets, we need to let the dust settle before making investment decisions. We are not planning to rush into anything.” The necessary legal framework and infrastructure is already in place, Suleimenov highlighted, but decisions will be made based on a thorough analysis, which is now being conducted. Kazakhstan is carefully building its crypto reserves The governor of the National Bank of Kazakhstan was commenting on previous statements made by one of his deputies this month. Speaking at the parliament in Astana earlier in November, Deputy Chairman Berik Sholpankulov first unveiled that the NBK may use the National Fund and its other reserves to purchase crypto, as reported by Cryptopolitan. Suleimenov himself told Bloomberg the same week that Kazakhstan is building a cryptocurrency reserve that will hold up to $1 billion in digital assets, including coins seized by the state, shares of companies from the industry, and crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Besides, Kazakhstan has one crypto reserve already set up. At the end of September, its Ministry of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Development announced the launch of the Alem Crypto Fund. The latter is backed by Binance, the world’s largest digital asset exchange by daily trading volume, and made its first investment in the trading platform’s native token, BNB.

Our comprehensive Bitcoin price prediction analysis examines the factors that could drive unprecedented growth from 2025 through 2030, providing valuable insights for your investment strategy.

The halving events, institutional adoption, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic conditions all play significant roles in shaping Bitcoin’s future value. Our cryptocurrency analysis considers both technical indicators and fundamental drivers to provide a balanced perspective on where Bitcoin might be heading. Bitcoin Investment Opportunities: 2025 Outlook By 2025, several key developments could significantly impact Bitcoin’s valuation: Post-halving supply shock effects fully materializing Increased institutional Bitcoin investment through ETFs and corporate treasuries Growing adoption in emerging markets as hedge against currency devaluation Technological improvements enhancing Bitcoin’s utility and security Crypto Market Trends Shaping Long-Term BTC Forecast The broader crypto market trends provide essential context for understanding Bitcoin’s potential trajectory. As the dominant cryptocurrency, Bitcoin often sets the tone for the entire digital asset ecosystem. Key trends to monitor include: Year Conservative Prediction Moderate Prediction Bullish Prediction 2025 $120,000 $150,000 $200,000 2026 $140,000 $180,000 $250,000 2028 $200,000 $300,000 $500,000 2030 $250,000 $400,000 $750,000+ Why This Bitcoin Price Prediction Matters for Your Portfolio An accurate Bitcoin price prediction isn’t just about numbers—it’s about understanding the fundamental shifts occurring in global finance. Our BTC forecast considers the evolving role of Bitcoin as both a store of value and a medium of exchange. The ongoing cryptocurrency analysis reveals that we’re still in the early stages of Bitcoin’s adoption curve, suggesting significant room for growth. Key Factors That Could Accelerate Bitcoin Investment Growth Several catalysts could push Bitcoin beyond even the most optimistic predictions: Central bank digital currency integration with Bitcoin networks Major sovereign wealth funds allocating to Bitcoin Global economic instability driving safe-haven demand Technological breakthroughs improving Bitcoin’s scalability and functionality Navigating Crypto Market Trends for Maximum Returns Successful Bitcoin investment requires understanding the cyclical nature of crypto market trends . While short-term volatility is inevitable, the long-term trajectory appears strongly positive. Our analysis suggests that dollar-cost averaging and long-term holding strategies have historically outperformed attempts to time the market. Frequently Asked Questions What is the most reliable Bitcoin price prediction method? Most analysts combine technical analysis with fundamental factors including adoption rates, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic conditions. Companies like Grayscale and analysts including PlanB have developed models that consider Bitcoin’s scarcity and network effects. How does the Bitcoin halving affect long-term price predictions? The halving reduces new Bitcoin supply by 50% approximately every four years. Historical data from previous halvings analyzed by entities like Coinbase shows significant price appreciation typically follows these events, though past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. What role do institutional investors play in Bitcoin’s future price? Institutional adoption through companies like MicroStrategy and Fidelity creates substantial buying pressure and reduces circulating supply. This trend, combined with ETF approvals, could significantly impact future valuations. How accurate have previous Bitcoin price predictions been? Predictions vary widely in accuracy. While some analysts like Cameron Winklevoss have made prescient long-term calls, short-term predictions often miss the mark due to Bitcoin’s volatility and unpredictable market events. What are the biggest risks to these Bitcoin price predictions? Potential risks include regulatory crackdowns by entities like the SEC , technological vulnerabilities, competition from other cryptocurrencies, and broader economic factors that could affect risk asset performance. Conclusion: The Future of Bitcoin Looks Promising Our comprehensive analysis suggests that Bitcoin’s journey from 2025 to 2030 could be transformative for early adopters and strategic investors. While the path may include volatility, the fundamental case for Bitcoin remains strong. The combination of scarcity, growing adoption, and technological advancement creates a compelling investment thesis that could reward patient investors significantly.

Key Takeaways: Bitwise Europe’s research chief, André Dragosch, says Bitcoin now shows a COVID-era risk-reward profile. He argues BTC is already pricing in a recession-like outlook after steep sell-offs and heavy liquidations. Dragosch expects global growth to rebound as past stimulus feeds through, potentially lifting Bitcoin next. In a recent post on X , Dragosch said the market is beginning to resemble the extreme risk-reward environment seen during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. “The last time I saw such an asymmetric risk-reward was during COVID,” Dragosch wrote in a post on X on Friday, pointing to March 2020 when Bitcoin collapsed from about $8,000 to below $5,000 as panic swept through global markets. Bitwise Analyst: Bitcoin Now Trading Like a Global Downturn Is Underway Dragosch argued that today’s setup feels similar, not because of a health crisis, but because Bitcoin is once again trading as if a deep downturn is already here. He said the cryptocurrency appears to be “pricing in” what he described as the most bearish global growth outlook since 2022, a period dominated by aggressive rate tightening from the US Federal Reserve and the shock failure of FTX. “Bitcoin is essentially pricing in a recessionary growth environment,” he said, adding that the market has likely absorbed “a lot of the bad news” already. Recent price action supports the view that sentiment has weakened sharply. Bitcoin is down more than 17% over the past 30 days, according to CoinMarketCap. This is probably the most important work I’ve done on #Bitcoin & Macro so far. It involves a lot of computation and is somewhat complex – because financial markets are complex at the end of the day. The question investors constantly face is: “𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗶𝗻… pic.twitter.com/TUaFGM5SAT — André Dragosch, PhD (@Andre_Dragosch) November 28, 2025 After hitting an all-time high of $125,100 on Oct. 5, the asset slid into a sustained pullback following a $19 billion liquidation wave on Oct. 10. The drop came days after Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs on Chinese imports. Momentum deteriorated further in mid-November when Bitcoin slipped below $100,000, a level many traders viewed as psychological support. Although the price briefly dipped under $90,000 on Nov. 20, buyers quickly stepped in, fueling hopes that the floor may be forming. Dragosch believes the pessimism could be misplaced. He argues that global growth may soon improve as prior monetary stimulus works its way through the system, a pattern similar to the post-COVID expansion. “I genuinely think we’re staring at a similar macro setup right now,” he wrote. Cathie Wood Calls Liquidity Rebound for Crypto As reported, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood has forecasted that the liquidity squeeze hitting crypto and AI markets will reverse within weeks , driven by three Federal Reserve policy shifts expected before year-end. Her firm continues aggressively buying crypto equities during the downturn, deploying over $93 million in a single day this week across beaten-down digital asset stocks. Speaking during ARK’s November market webinar, she identified three temporary liquidity constraints she expects to ease rapidly through Federal Reserve action and reopened government spending. Wood expects the Federal Reserve to end quantitative tightening at its December 10 meeting, immediately easing one pressure point. The government shutdown that caused the Treasury General Account cash buildup has concluded, returning funds to circulation.

Key Takeaways: Upbit found and fixed a wallet flaw that could have exposed private keys, but has not confirmed it caused the $30M hack. The breach drained about 44.5 billion won, while roughly 2.3 billion won has already been frozen. The exchange halted activity, moved funds to cold storage, and pledged full reimbursement. In a statement released Friday, Upbit CEO Oh Kyung-seok disclosed that engineers identified a weakness in the exchange’s wallet software that could have allowed attackers to infer private keys by studying publicly available blockchain data. However, the crypto firm has not confirmed whether the vulnerability played a role in the breach. Upbit Says Internal Wallet Bug May Have Exposed Private Keys The flaw did not stem from the blockchains themselves but from how Upbit’s wallet software generated cryptographic signatures. According to the exchange, the issue may have produced weak or predictable signing data, creating the possibility that a sophisticated attacker could mathematically reconstruct wallet keys by analyzing historical transactions. “We identified and addressed the vulnerability during a comprehensive inspection of all related networks and wallet systems,” Oh said, adding that the company activated emergency response protocols and halted all withdrawals and deposits until systems were verified as secure. Upbit stopped onchain activity on November 26 after detecting abnormal outflows from its Solana-based hot wallets. Tokens impacted included SOL, ORCA, RAY and JUP, the exchange said. Assets were quickly transferred to cold storage while forensic reviews began. Losses totaled an estimated 44.5 billion won ($30 million), including about 38.6 billion won ($26 million) in customer holdings. Upbit says attackers might have inferred private keys by analyzing user wallet address patterns. If true, I doubt anyone other than North Korean hackers (Lazarus) could do this. pic.twitter.com/cS4I8okrVb — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) November 28, 2025 The exchange confirmed that approximately 2.3 billion won ($1.5 million) in funds have already been frozen through coordination with external parties. Upbit emphasized that it has not established a direct link between the wallet vulnerability and the theft. The issue was discovered only during an internal audit triggered by the incident. “No security system can ever be considered perfect,” Oh said, pledging infrastructure upgrades and continued transparency as investigations continue. The company said all affected users would be reimbursed in full using internal reserves. Withdrawals and deposits will remain suspended until final security inspections are completed. South Korean Probe Points to North Korea’s Lazarus Group in Upbit Hack South Korean authorities have launched an investigation, and local reports have cited early intelligence assessments that allegedly connect the intrusion to North Korea’s Lazarus Group. The group has previously been linked to crypto thefts aimed at generating revenue for Pyongyang amid persistent foreign currency shortages. Officials believe this time the hackers may have bypassed core infrastructure by impersonating administrators or compromising internal accounts to authorize the withdrawal. Upbit continues to work with law enforcement agencies and blockchain projects to freeze and recover assets where possible, the exchange said. The incident comes at a sensitive moment for Upbit’s parent company, Dunamu, which is preparing for a merger with South Korean internet giant Naver ahead of a potential public listing.

The daily trend shows continued downside pressure with lower highs and persistent difficulty breaking key resistance levels. The 4-hour chart confirms a tight downward channel, leaving LINK vulnerable unless buyers reclaim higher pivot levels. On November 29, 2025, Chainlink (LINK) trades at $13.06, down 2.27% over the past 24 hours, signaling sustained downward pressure. The token moved between $13.03 and $13.51, showing limited volatility as trading stayed below the $13.2467 midpoint. Sellers maintained control through the later sessions, keeping sentiment cautious as price action shifted into the red zone. Chainlink 1-day price chart: LINK holds key support as downtrend pressure builds The daily chart shows LINK trading just above key support at $13.00, a level buyers continue to defend despite weak momentum. A failed breakout at $13.50 shifted the structure downward, pushing the price back under the $13.20 pivot. LINK now remains in a corrective phase, with sellers maintaining pressure until a breakout above this zone occurs. LINK/USDT Chart: TradingView Further daily chart readings show weakening bullish momentum as sell volume increased and the green zone faded after midday. Sellers took full control around 6:00 PM, pushing LINK into a steady red-zone decline and forming a pattern of lower highs. Indicators such as the RSI slipping toward neutral-lower levels and MACD showing bearish convergence support the downtrend bias. A retest of $13.00 remains likely unless buyers reclaim the $13.20–$13.25 zone with stronger volume. Chainlink 4-hour price chart: LINK consolidates within a tight downward channel On the 4-hour chart, LINK is trading within a tight compression pattern as it struggles to break above the declining resistance line. Multiple rebound attempts stalled below $13.20, confirming strong overhead supply, while support at $13.03 remains the key level to watch. Momentum indicators are fading, suggesting continued range-bound movement unless volume increases. LINK/USDT Chart: TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that LINK is forming a mild downward channel as volatility declines, reflecting a seller-favored structure. Each recovery attempt has been capped by resistance, and buyers must reclaim the intraday pivot to shift sentiment, leaving LINK vulnerable to further pressure near the lower end of its 24-hour range.

The token remains below its daily midpoint of $13.2467, moving within a narrow range of $13.03 to $13.51 as sellers maintain control. On the daily chart, LINK is holding just above key support at $13.00, defended by buyers despite weakening momentum. A failed breakout at $13.50 pushed the price back under the $13.20 pivot, keeping LINK in a corrective phase, with indicators such as the RSI slipping toward neutral-lower levels and MACD showing bearish convergence. The 4-hour chart shows LINK consolidating in a tight downward channel, facing repeated resistance near $13.20 while support at $13.03 remains crucial. Momentum is fading, and further range-bound or downward movement is likely unless buyers reclaim the $13.20–$13.25 zone with strong volume. Overall, sellers dominate both daily and intraday charts, leaving LINK vulnerable to further pressure toward $13.00 unless a decisive breakout occurs. Is Chainlink a good investment? On November 29, 2025, Chainlink (LINK) trades at $13.06, down 2.27%, as sellers maintain control below the $13.2467 midpoint. The token holds support at $13.00 but faces repeated resistance near $13.20, with lower highs forming and momentum fading. The 4-hour chart shows a tight downward channel, signaling continued downside risk. Unless buyers reclaim $13.20–$13.25 with strong volume, LINK remains vulnerable to further pressure toward $13.00, suggesting caution for short-term investors. Why is the LINK price down today? Chainlink (LINK) is down today, trading at $13.06, as sellers maintain control below the daily midpoint of $13.2467. The token faces strong overhead resistance near $13.20, while support at $13.00 is being tested. Lower highs and fading momentum, confirmed on both daily and 4-hour charts, indicate continued downside pressure. LINK remains in a corrective phase within a tight downward channel, and repeated failed breakouts at $13.50–$13.20 have strengthened bearish sentiment. Unless buyers reclaim the $13.20–$13.25 pivot with strong volume, further decline toward $13.00 is likely, which explains the token’s weakness today.

It argues that there is a significant discrepancy between position structure, market sentiment, and macroeconomic policy signals, increasing pricing uncertainty. Related News: Major Altcoin Whales Are Very Active: Here Are Their Transactions and Purchases The report notes that Bitcoin's implied volatility (IV) has declined sharply, reducing demand for downside protection. Despite this, the BTC price remains below a critical price range it has repeatedly failed to break. On-chain data suggests a retest of a key cost level, which has repeatedly played a key role in separating “panic” and “deep value” zones in the market, is imminent. On the macro side, the Fed's shift in tone has reshaped expectations for interest rate cuts. Historically, when seasonal cycles and trend patterns clash, investors tend to misread critical turning points. Meanwhile, it's also noteworthy that Bitcoin has formed a bullish “hammer” formation at its lows. However, the technical outlook suggests that despite these signs, the main downtrend hasn't yet been broken. Analysts note that these conflicting signals could lead to low volatility and high directional search in the short term. *This is not investment advice.

Hyperliquid (HYPE) Eyes Potential Growth After Recent Dips Source: tradingview Hyperliquid (HYPE) currently trades between about $27 and $39. Recently, its price took a dip, falling nearly 4% over the past week and 24% over the last month. Yet, over the past half-year, it has seen a growth of just over 10%. The next resistance level sits at around $46. If HYPE breaches this mark, it could target $58, marking a potential increase of almost 50% from the lower current price. Support levels rest around $22 and $10, preventing further drops. With a decent RSI of 63 and bullish indicators, HYPE shows room for recovery, signaling traders to watch for upward movement in the short term.

A successful push could see the price soaring to $0.55, signaling a potential rally. The article will explore the dynamics behind this crucial moment and uncover which other cryptocurrencies are poised for significant growth. Just as traders analyze resistance and support zones to predict future movements, Outset PR continuously monitors media outlet performance metrics to perfectly align campaigns with current market momentum. By tracking these vital shifts, Outset PR makes sure its narratives are timely and relevant, mirroring how investors seek assets poised for a breakout even in a hesitant market. Cardano’s Price Inches Upward, Eyes on Resistance Levels Source: tradingview Cardano's price currently hovers between three and four-tenths of a dollar. Recent days have shown a slight upward movement, though it still resides below the 10-day moving average. Its current trading range puts it in a delicate balance between the first resistance and support levels. If momentum continues positively, Cardano could test the first resistance level, potentially jumping by around one-fifth of its value. A further surge could push it toward the second resistance, meaning a possible growth of about two-thirds from its current range. While the past month showed notable declines, a change in market sentiment might drive Cardano back up. Presenting Yourself Without Overspending: How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Conclusion ADA recently tested a key price level. Its current movement shows potential for a rise to $0.55. If this level holds, it may signal further gains. Strong support from buyers could pave the way for a continued uptrend. This would bode well for ADA's overall market position. A sustained push above $0.55 could bring new opportunities for buyers and investors. The next few days will be crucial in determining ADA's near-term direction.

As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, investors are closely watching Cardano’s trajectory. This comprehensive Cardano price prediction analysis examines whether ADA can reach the coveted $2 mark by 2030. With blockchain technology advancing rapidly, understanding the factors driving ADA’s potential growth becomes crucial for any serious digital asset investment strategy. What Drives Cardano’s Price Movement? Several key factors influence the ADA price target potential. The development of Cardano’s ecosystem, including smart contract capabilities and decentralized applications, plays a significant role in its valuation. Market adoption, regulatory developments, and overall cryptocurrency market trends also contribute to price fluctuations. Technical analysis of historical patterns provides additional insights for this cryptocurrency forecast. Cardano Price Prediction 2025: The Short-Term Outlook Our analysis suggests that by 2025, Cardano could experience substantial growth based on current development milestones. The continued expansion of Cardano’s blockchain technology infrastructure and increasing institutional interest could drive prices higher. However, market volatility remains a constant factor in any digital asset investment calculation. Year Conservative Prediction Moderate Prediction Optimistic Prediction 2025 $0.85 $1.20 $1.60 2026 $1.10 $1.50 $1.90 2030 $1.80 $2.50 $3.20 Technical Analysis and Market Indicators When creating any cryptocurrency forecast , technical indicators provide valuable insights. Key metrics to monitor include: Trading volume and liquidity patterns Resistance and support levels Moving averages and momentum indicators Network growth and adoption metrics The Role of Blockchain Technology Advancements Cardano’s ongoing development in blockchain technology significantly impacts its long-term price potential. The implementation of Hydra scaling solutions and continued ecosystem growth could substantially increase network utility. As more projects build on Cardano, the fundamental value proposition strengthens, making this digital asset investment increasingly attractive to institutional and retail investors alike. Risk Factors in Cardano Investment While the Cardano price prediction appears promising, investors should consider several risk factors: Regulatory uncertainty across global markets Competition from other blockchain platforms Technology adoption pace and developer activity Overall cryptocurrency market volatility Long-Term ADA Price Target Analysis The journey toward the $2 ADA price target depends on multiple converging factors. Market capitalization growth, increased real-world usage, and broader cryptocurrency adoption all contribute to this ambitious goal. Our cryptocurrency forecast suggests that achieving this milestone requires sustained development progress and favorable market conditions. Investment Strategy Considerations Successful digital asset investment in Cardano requires a balanced approach. Diversification, risk management, and long-term perspective remain essential components of any cryptocurrency portfolio. The evolving blockchain technology landscape continues to present both opportunities and challenges for ADA investors. Frequently Asked Questions What is Cardano’s current development status? Cardano, founded by Charles Hoskinson , continues to evolve through its research-driven approach. The platform has successfully implemented smart contracts and continues to develop scaling solutions. How does Cardano compare to Ethereum? Cardano positions itself as a third-generation blockchain, learning from Ethereum’s challenges while implementing a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism from inception. What companies are building on Cardano? Several projects are developing on Cardano’s blockchain, though specific company partnerships continue to evolve as the ecosystem matures. Conclusion: The Path to $2 The potential for Cardano to reach $2 by 2030 appears within reach based on current trajectories and development milestones. However, investors should maintain realistic expectations and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions. The cryptocurrency market’s inherent volatility means that while the ADA price target of $2 is achievable, it requires careful monitoring of market conditions and technological developments.

55093659,https://finbold.com/?p=258342,1764413894,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,"AI predicts Ethereum price for December 1, 2025",https://finbold.com/ai-predicts-ethereum-price-for-december-1-2025/,"An artificial intelligence model predicts that Ethereum ( ETH ) is likely to hold above the $3,000 support level by December 1. This outlook comes as ETH recovers alongside the broader market, reclaiming the $3,000 mark after days of extended losses that had raised the possibility of sustained declines below $2,000. ETH price prediction For the December 1 price prediction, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which anticipates that Ethereum will trade near $3,360, with a realistic range of $3,300 to $3,420. According to ChatGPT, recent market behavior shows Ethereum consistently attracting buyers in the $3,300 to $3,350 zone, forming a firm support base that limits downside risk. Exchange reserves have dropped to multi-year lows, suggesting immediate selling pressure is constrained as fewer coins are readily available on trading platforms. Mildly bullish catalysts are also supporting an upward bias according to ChatGPT. Staking continues to reduce circulating supply, while DeFi and Layer-2 networks remain active. Markets are also positioning ahead of the December Fusaka upgrade, creating a subtle pre-event lift, though momentum is insufficient for a rapid breakout. At the same time, market sentiment has stabilized following recent volatility, with no signs of panic, forced liquidations, or disorderly sell-offs. Open interest is firming, suggesting traders are cautiously re-entering positions, pointing toward a moderate rebound rather than a renewed decline. Based on these fundamentals, ChatGPT noted that Ethereum’s ceiling remains well-defined, with repeated failures to break above the $3,880 to $4,000 resistance zone. This barrier is preventing a larger trend shift and limits how far the price can climb in the near term. Weighing the current spot level near $3,000, the strong underlying support, and the cautiously improving sentiment backdrop, ChatGPT’s estimate places Ethereum’s most probable landing zone on December 1 at approximately $3,360. Ethereum price probability distribution for Dec 1. Source: ChatGPT ETH price analysis By press time, ETH was trading at $3,004, down 1.6% in the past 24 hours, while on the weekly timeline, the second-ranked cryptocurrency by market capitalization has gained over 10%. ETH one-week price chart. Source: Finbold Ethereum’s current level points to short-term bearish pressures relative to its simple moving averages ( SMAs ). The 50-day SMA sits at $3,509.66, with the current price 14% below it, highlighting recent downward momentum and potential resistance overhead if buyers attempt to reclaim this level. Conversely, the 200-day SMA at $3,400.05 provides stronger long-term support, as ETH remains 12% above it, preserving a bullish structural bias and suggesting resilience against deeper corrections. Complementing this, the 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) of 42.8 indicates neutral territory, far from overbought levels above 70 or oversold levels below 30, implying balanced conditions suitable for consolidation or a moderate upside.

55094021,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=870063,1764414000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55094021.jpeg,"XRP’s Tokenomics: Supply, Escrow, and Market Impact",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/xrp-tokenomics-supply-escrow-market-impact/,"One of the notable ways XRP differs from Bitcoin, Ether, and largely, other cryptocurrencies, is in its supply and tokenomics. If you’ve been in the crypto space long enough, you may have seen one or multiple reports , especially from on-chain trackers like Whale Alert, that 1 billion XRP was unlocked from escrow at Ripple. That happens every month. Up to 1 billion XRP coins are expected to be unlocked every new month. In this article, we will explain why it happens and share other details that make up the XRP tokenomics. Understanding XRP’s Supply Structure All XRP that will ever exist has already been pre-mined, meaning no new coins will be created from mining or earned as a reward from staking. That is why the escrow mechanism was introduced to help manage the supply and circulation in the open market. Total, Circulating, and Maximum Supply XRP currently has a circulating supply of 60.25 billion, according to Coingecko data. The maximum supply, which means the overall amount of XRP that can be created, is fixed at 100 billion. Rather than increasing, however, the total supply is more likely to come below 100 billion, given that some XRP gets permanently destroyed or burned during transactions as a way to create a deflationary pressure for the coin. At the time of writing, a total of 14.2 million XRP has been burned, according to on-chain data from XRPScan. That’s an equivalent of $27.7 million at current market prices. So, those coins are now off the supply that can ever be assessed or traded. Initial Distribution — Ripple Labs, Founders, and Early Investors There were no public sales or ICO at launch. All the supply, that is 100 billion XRP, was pre-minted when the XRP Ledger launched in 2012. Twenty billion (20%) was allocated to the founders of the network, which includes Jed McCaleb, Chris Larsen, and Arthur Britto. The remaining 80 billion (80%) was allocated, or “gifted” as some would say, to the company now known as Ripple. Ripple started as NewCoin, but was later rebranded to OpenCoin, then Ripple Labs, and eventually shortened to Ripple between 2012 and 2015. The company claims to operate independently of the XRP Ledger and XRP . However, it was given that 80 billion supply to fund its payment solutions on XRP Ledger, provide liquidity, and seed markets via partnerships, all for the purpose of promoting the network. How XRP Differs from Bitcoin and Ethereum Supply Models The biggest difference is the fact that XRP is pre-mined, whereas Bitcoin, Ether, and most other cryptocurrencies are not. New Bitcoins are issued through the mathematical process of mining, and there will only ever be 21 million BTC that can be created. On the other hand, new Ether coins are created in the form of staking rewards. ETH does not have a fixed supply, like BTC and XRP. Current Supply Snapshot Market Cap $115.98 billion Circulating Supply 60.25 billion Maximum Supply 100 billion Total Supply 99.98 billion Burned Supply 14.24 million Escrow Holdings 34.75 billion The XRP Escrow System — How It Works The escrow system is how Ripple is able to release and manage XRP’s supply. Why Ripple Locked 55 Billion XRP in Escrow The 80% supply allocated to Ripple had always been a point of contention for many, who feared that the company could oversupply the market with its holdings or even manipulate the price at any point. In order to calm investors on that matter, Ripple started using the escrow system in 2017. At that time, it locked 55 billion coins on 55 separate escrow contracts on the XRP Ledger, with each holding 1 billion coins. So, Ripple introduced the escrow system as a way to boost investors’ trust and also ensure predictability in XRP supply. Monthly Release Mechanism — 1 Billion XRP per Month The escrow contracts are programmed to release exactly 1 billion XRP every month. So, every new month, one or more of the contracts automatically mature and release a total of 1 billion coins. It usually happens in batches for efficiency. For instance, at the beginning of this month, the coins were released in tranches of 200M, 300M, and 500M. But it’s worth mentioning that not all the coins are actually released into market circulation. How Unused XRP Returns to Escrow Ripple uses the coins it receives every month to fund its operational needs, such as providing liquidity through its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service to institutions and partnerships, among other things. So, when those coins are released to Ripple-controlled wallets, the company sells only a portion of that supply via over-the-counter (OTC) arrangements. The leftover coins, usually 70% to 80%, are relocked in a new escrow account to be unlocked at a later date. For instance, this month, Ripple locked a total of 700 million XRP, worth over $1.7 billion, back into escrow. One important thing to note is that the new escrow contract is not placed back into the same monthly slot. Instead, it is placed at the end of the existing escrow queue. Transparency via On-Chain Escrow Transactions Ripple’s use of on-chain escrow is fundamentally different from a company promising to hold funds. That’s because the system is all enforced on-chain on a public and immutable blockchain, precisely the XRP Ledger. The escrow feature is also hard-coded into the XRPL, and there is no hidden backdoor, sort of, that will allow Ripple, at any point, access to those locked coins outside the set maturation date. In addition to that, the XRP Ledger is a public blockchain. Anyone can inspect the entire lifecycle of the escrow accounts and the locked funds. Ripple’s Public Commitments to Predictable Supply The adherence to escrow is Ripple’s biggest commitment to ensuring XRP has a predictable supply. In fact, the company categorically said in its official report that the introduction of the escrow accounts was “to provide additional predictability to the XRP supply.” With the escrow, everyone expects that no more than 1 billion XRP can be released into the market in a single month. Aside from that, Ripple would still return the majority of those coins to escrow, which helps to reduce the possibility of a “supply shock” that could destabilize the XRP price . Ripple also does some other things, like issuing market reports that disclose its holdings and the amount of XRP it sold or relocked for a given period. The Role of Ripple and Institutional Distribution Ripple is the sole distributor of the pre-mined XRP supply. Part of its operations requires the company to sell or distribute XRP to drive the adoption and development of the XRPL ecosystem. Ripple’s Holdings and Strategic Sales Ripple remains the biggest XRP holder, with over 39% of the total supply under its control. According to the company, “Its holdings fall into two categories: XRP that it currently has available in its wallets, and XRP that is subject to on-ledger escrow lockups that will be released each month.” As of September 2025, Ripple reportedly had 4.5 billion XRP in its wallets, which it can sell at any time. It currently has a total of 34.7 billion XRP locked in escrow. The sales are usually off-exchange to prevent an immediate impact on the price of XRP. The company sells directly to market makers, financial institutions, and payment providers, among others, through OTC. Institutional Partnerships — ODL (On-Demand Liquidity) Use Cases The ODL service is one of the biggest use cases and sources of demand for XRP. Ripple started ODL in 2018 to help facilitate faster and cheaper cross-border payments. The ODL service uses XRP as a bridge currency, removing the need for pre-funded accounts for international payments. In Q2 2025, Ripple processed about $1.3 trillion in transactions through ODL. That’s a big source of demand for XRP. XRP Flow in Cross-Border Payments and Liquidity Corridors The use or flow of XRP in ODL payments actually demonstrates why institutional demand for XRP exists, particularly on the payment side. When someone wants to make a payment in USD to a recipient in another country, the payment provider under the ODL service or RippleNet would first convert the USD to XRP, transfer it, and then convert the XRP to the recipient’s local currency. Due to the network speed of the XRP Ledger, which is typically 3 to 5 seconds, the transactions occur much faster than they would with traditional international payment systems. Criticism and Transparency Concerns around XRP Sales Ripple’s sole control of XRP supply and distribution has always been a point of concern for many crypto investors, who argue that it contradicts the decentralized ethos of the crypto space. Though the majority of the stash is locked away in escrow accounts, there are still arguments that such a large supply holding gives Ripple an unprecedented influence over the future of XRP and even portrays the coin as a corporate-controlled asset. Also, Ripple needs to sell coins to meet operational needs. That somewhat creates a sense of constant downward selling pressure on the price, even though the impact is usually not immediate. Whether it is sold through OTC or the open market, it all counts as supply that enters circulation. XRP Supply Dynamics vs Market Behavior The news of XRP unlocks often spooks fear among new investors, especially considering the amount of coins involved. But one can argue that the unlocks mostly have a minimal impact on the price of XRP due to the predictability in the supply. Monthly Escrow Unlocks — Price and Liquidity Impacts One billion XRP are unlocked every month, but not all of it enters circulation – only about 200 to 300 million coins do. With over $7.8 billion in daily trading volume, the market is about to absorb that. So, the sales rarely cause any immediate, significant price drop. It is also worth noting that many people today are already accustomed to the unlock schedule, and so, there is usually no panic-selling pressure as a result, except, perhaps, for new investors. XRP Inflation Rate Compared to Other L1 Tokens XRP’s annual inflation rate falls between 3.9% to 5.9%, assuming 200 million to 300 million coins enter circulation monthly. Here’s how it compares to other major L1 cryptocurrencies. Crypto Inflation Rate Mechanism XRP 3.9-5.9% Escrow release Bitcoin 1.8% (pre-2028 halving) Proof-of-Work reward Ether 0.5-0.8% Proof-of-Stake reward Solana 1.5% Proof-of-Stake reward Ripple’s Buyback Programs and Burn Proposals The XRP Ledger features a burning mechanism that permanently destroys transaction fees on the network, which creates a deflationary pressure for XRP. So far, about 14 million XRP have been burned. Over the years, there have been unofficial proposals from the XRP community for Ripple to burn the remaining supply in escrow. However, Ripple is yet to support such proposals, with the company’s CTO, David Schwartz, publicly dismissing that such a move would guarantee a price rally. Ripple does engage in buyback programs, but not for XRP. The company focuses on repurchasing its private shares to provide liquidity for early investors. XRP’s Circulation on Exchanges vs ODL Corridors XRP’s supply is concentrated on crypto exchanges and ODL corridors. The difference on both ends is that, for ODL, the supply is mainly utility-driven, as XRP is needed or used to facilitate cross-border payments by financial institutions. Meanwhile, on crypto exchanges, the supply fuels the retail and speculative trading. Market Impact of XRP’s Escrow and Supply Design XRP’s escrow and supply design has a contradictory impact on the market, with investors debating whether it acts as a stabilizing force or a suppressive cap on XRP’s price actions. Predictable Release = Stability or Suppression? The monthly 1 billion XRP escrow release, with only a net addition of 200-300 million to circulation after relocking, allows for a controlled flow and stability in XRP’s supply. Some would argue that the monthly unlocks are already known or anticipated in advance, and so the market is able to price in the supply inflation efficiently, especially on the institutional side. However, there are still critics who argue that the continuous stream of XRP that the market must absorb acts as a suppression, capping price increases. How Escrow Transparency Affects Investor Confidence The escrow mechanism is enforced by the XRP Ledger, which is a public blockchain. So, all the processes and contents are open and verifiable, which minimizes the fear of a sudden market dump by Ripple. With the on-chain escrow, XRP holders can audit the release schedule themselves in real-time, without having to rely on Ripple’s words. The “Supply Overhang” Debate — Myth or Market Risk? The supply overhang refers to the remaining 34.75 billion XRP locked in escrow, which some critics say poses a perpetual flooding of liquidity in the market. While the concern may be true, it seems overblown when you look at how Ripple has managed the supply over the years. First of all, the coins in the escrow are cryptographically locked and cannot be released until the set date. Also, the amount actually entering the market is relatively small. So, one can say that the overhang is not an immediate market risk. XRP’s Liquidity Advantage for Institutional Payments XRP is currently the fourth-largest cryptocurrency and ranks among the most actively traded cryptocurrencies by volume. As we mentioned earlier, over $7 billion worth of XRP is traded daily. That’s to say that XRP has deep liquidity that allows institutional payment firms to buy and sell large amounts of XRP quickly without suffering significant slippage. Future Outlook for XRP’s Tokenomics Potential Escrow Modifications or Accelerated Unlocks Ripple has not communicated any plans to modify the escrow or the amount of coins released every month. However, there are some changes that are possible. For instance, Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz once mentioned in a tweet in October 2025 that “Ripple could sell the right to receive the tokens released from escrow or even sell the accounts the escrows complete into.” But the XRP still can’t circulate until their release dates, according to him. Also, if demand for XRP increases rapidly in the future, we could see Ripple relock fewer coins, meaning there will be more coins entering circulation. Ripple’s Long-Term Distribution Strategy Ripple is big on institutional crypto operations. Ripple Swell 2025, which took place earlier in November, centered on XRP’s role in new verticals, including tokenization, real-world assets, custody, and cross-border payments, among other areas. The shift suggests that Ripple’s distribution strategy is expanding beyond the ODL model. Ripple’s ODL service has been the biggest driver of demand for payments by institutions. So, with the new focus on tokenization, etc., it’s likely that we will see more institutional distribution in that regard. Regulatory Influence Regulation is one significant factor that affects XRP market dynamics, considering that it’s largely used by established financial institutions. Post-SEC clarity and court proceedings with Ripple paved the way for the launch of XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and with more regulatory clarity, we could see Ripple push more into the institutional market. XRP’s Role in an Institutional DeFi Landscape Ripple does have plans to position the XRP Ledger as the blockchain for institutional-grade DeFi and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. The company predicts that 10% of global assets will be tokenized in the next five years.",Learn Crypto: Beginner Guides,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-29 11:00:00

His comments come as Bitcoin continues to display unpredictable price movements that have left many investors uncertain about their next moves. On November 29, CZ presented what he described as an unpopular opinion regarding optimal Bitcoin trading practices. The crypto executive advised investors to sell during periods of maximum greed and buy when fear dominates the market. This contrarian approach challenges the instinctive behavior many traders exhibit during volatile conditions. The statement has generated substantial discussion within the cryptocurrency community. Many experienced traders have expressed agreement with the strategy, noting that successful investment decisions require logical thinking rather than emotional reactions. The principle aligns with traditional investment wisdom but carries particular weight when voiced by one of the industry's most prominent figures. Market Sentiment Indicators Show Extreme Fluctuations Bitcoin's current market conditions reflect the volatility CZ referenced in his statement. The Fear and Greed Index has recorded significant swings between extremes in recent weeks. Market greed reached elevated levels during price rallies, while fear indicators spiked sharply when Bitcoin experienced pullbacks. These rapid sentiment shifts create the exact conditions where CZ's strategy becomes relevant. Traders who monitor these indicators without letting emotions dictate their decisions may find opportunities that panic-driven investors miss. The challenge lies in maintaining discipline when market sentiment reaches either extreme. Industry observers have noted that CZ's timing for this message appears deliberate. AT the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $90,644, down 0.93% in the last 24 hours. BTC price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap Bitcoin has been trading within a range that has frustrated both bulls and bears. Neither sustained upward momentum nor prolonged downturns have materialized, leaving traders searching for guidance on positioning their portfolios effectively. Applying the Strategy Beyond Bitcoin While CZ used Bitcoin to illustrate his point, analysts suggest the strategy applies broadly across the cryptocurrency sector. Any established digital asset can benefit from this contrarian approach. The key factor is selecting cryptocurrencies with solid fundamentals and proven track records. Market commentators have simplified the principle further. They emphasize that profitable trades often occur when investors act opposite to the crowd. This concept is not new to financial markets, but its application in crypto requires particular attention due to the sector's heightened volatility. The strategy demands patience and conviction. Buying during maximum fear means purchasing when negative headlines dominate and prices are falling. Selling during maximum greed requires resisting the temptation to hold positions when euphoria suggests prices will climb indefinitely. Both actions contradict natural human instincts.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-29 11:00:09

Related Reading: 320 Ether On The Move: Bhutan Ramps Up Its Staking Game Based on reports, the token is down about 18% for November and was trading below $91,000 as markets quieted heading into the weekend. Market Cleansing Opens The Door For Buyers According to CoinGlass, this decline approaches the scale of losses seen in November 2019, when Bitcoin fell roughly 17%, and is far from the harsh 35% crash of November 2018. Reports have disclosed that some analysts view the drop as a market reset. Nick Ruck, research director at LVRG, said overleveraged positions and weak projects have been mostly cleared out, which could let longer-term holders add exposure at lower prices. Technical Levels Take Center Stage Traders are watching a pair of monthly-close levels closely. An analyst using the handle CrediBull Crypto identified $93,400 and $102,400 as the two most relevant thresholds. A close above $93,000 would be interpreted as a modest positive sign, the analyst said, while any monthly finish above $102,000 would be read as very bullish — though that may not happen until another month. Bitcoin changed hands around $91,450 in midweek trade, failing to break a resistance just under $92,000. Cycle Changes And Institutional Flows Based on reports from industry sources, some market watchers think the rhythm of rallies has shifted since the arrival of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024. According to some analysts, institutional participation has altered the timing and breadth of moves. That has meant gains that once clustered at year-end can show up earlier. Market experts pointed out that November is usually a strong month for Bitcoin, and that a red November has often been followed by a red December in past years. A Stalemate Between Bulls And Bears Matrixport described the market as a rare zone of impasse where sentiment, positioning and macro cues are all converging. Reports noted that Bitcoin rebounded above $91.8K during Thanksgiving, but the move did little to resolve the split between bullish and bearish expectations. 📃#MatrixOnTarget Report – November 28, 2025 ⬇️ Is Bitcoin’s Thanksgiving Tailwind Enough Into Christmas?#Matrixport #Bitcoin #BTC #CryptoMarkets#MarketSentiment #Volatility #OnchainData#FedWatch #Seasonality #ThanksgivingRally pic.twitter.com/CH39quX6Aa — Matrixport Official (@Matrixport_EN) November 28, 2025 Liquidity has thinned, volatility has dropped, and requests for crash protection have faded. Glassnode added that realized losses have risen and futures markets are deleveraging, signs that short-term conviction is weak. That mix leaves the market stuck between a push toward $100K and a slide down to $80K. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces More Downside After Recent Crash, Data Shows Signs Point To A Big Move, Direction Unknown A bullish hammer reversal emerged when Bitcoin briefly touched the $80K area, giving some traders hope of a rally into the holiday season. Others say weak demand and thin liquidity could push prices lower before confidence returns. In either case, markets have been quietly positioning for a larger directional move, even if nobody can say for sure which way that move will go. For now, Bitcoin sits in a cautious in-between. Investors and traders will be watching the monthly close, liquidity measures and options flows for clues. The next clear signal could decide whether late buyers get rewarded — or whether sellers set a new range.

This move marks a change in the firm’s strategy as it looks away from the slowly-saturating US crypto ETF space. CoinShares Pulls Plug On Solana, XRP, Litecoin ETFs On Friday, November 28, CoinShares discontinued its interest in launching multiple spot crypto exchange-traded funds, including the XRP ETF, Solana staking ETF, and Litecoin ETF. The asset manager filed with the US SEC to withdraw its Form S-1 registration statements for these exchange-traded funds. One of the withdrawal applications read: The Registration Statement sought to register shares to be issued in connection with a transaction that was ultimately not effectuated. No shares were sold, or will be sold, pursuant to the above-mentioned Registration Statement. In a bold move, CoinShares sought the SEC’s approval to list spot Litecoin and XRP ETFs in the United States in January 2025. The crypto asset manager then later filed for a spot Solana exchange-traded fund in June, while proposing a staking integration. However, CoinShares’ decision to wind down its push for these spot crypto ETFs seems to align with its shift in product strategy for the United States. Earlier on Friday, the digital asset manager announced its “strategic approach” to the United States market while preparing for its public listing in the country. Jean-Marie Mognetti, CEO and co-founder of CoinShares, said in a statement: The U.S. market presents a different landscape. Single-asset crypto ETPs have been rapidly commoditized, with the market consolidating around large-scale players, leaving limited opportunities for the differentiation that drives sustainable margins. As a result, this market requires a different playbook, one that leverages our core strengths in new product categories where we can deliver genuine investor value and premium economics. With the plug already pulled on the spot single-crypto exchange-traded funds, CoinShares said it still aims to launch new products in the US market over the next 12 – 18 months. Some of these products will include crypto equity exposure vehicles, thematic baskets, and actively managed strategies combining crypto and other assets. Crypto Asset Manager To Focus On ‘Higher-Margin’ Opportunities In US In his statement, the CoinShares CEO also revealed the plans to further trim its US product list by winding down its Bitcoin Futures Leveraged product (with the ticker BTFX). Meanwhile, Mognetti noted that the resources initially allocated to the planned launches of the different single-asset crypto ETFs will now be redirected toward “higher-margin” opportunities. As Bitcoinist reported in September, the European-based digital asset manager is preparing for its public listing in the US on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. This initial public offering will come on the back of its $1.2 billion merger with Vine Hill Capital Investments, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC).",Crypto News|CoinShares|crypto|crypto news|Litecoin ETF|Solana ETF|XRP ETF,EN,0,0,LTC|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-29 11:00:43

Ripple Doesn’t Control XRP,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-ceo-xrp-doesnt-have-a-ceo-ripple-doesnt-control-xrp/,"Crypto analyst and investor Xaif, in a recent post, spoke on remarks from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse that address ongoing misunderstandings about who controls XRP and how decisions are made within its ecosystem. The focus of Xaif’s post is to provide clear, accessible explanations for readers who may still mix up Ripple, the company, with XRP, the open-source digital asset. Brad Garlinghouse: XRP doesn’t have a CEO. Ripple doesn’t control XRP. It’s open-source, decentralized, and the community decides. Amendments have passed even when Ripple opposed them — that’s 80% validator approval, not company control. The XRP ecosystem is bigger than any one… https://t.co/lH4XwXj2ug pic.twitter.com/4aFqwNd4nn — Xaif Crypto| (@Xaif_Crypto) November 28, 2025 Garlinghouse Explains the Structure of the XRP Ecosystem In the video referenced in the tweet, Garlinghouse sets out a straightforward message. Ripple is a private company, and like any company, it has a CEO; XRP does not. He explains that many independent teams and developers contribute to the XRP ecosystem, and none of them operate under a centralized authority for the asset itself. According to him, when people assume XRP has a CEO, it shows a lack of understanding about how the network functions. Garlinghouse stresses that XRP and the XRP Ledger are open-source and decentralized. Changes to the technology require approval from validators, not Ripple. He notes that amendments have been passed even when Ripple disagreed with them. This, he says, demonstrates that control does not sit with the company but with the community. Any change to the XRP Ledger needs 80% validator approval, which ensures that decisions reflect broad support rather than a single entity’s preference. Xaif Clarifies How XRP Escrow Actually Works During the discussion, X user Rui Ferreira raised a question about the escrow that releases XRP each month. Xaif responded with a technical explanation aimed at preventing misunderstandings. He stated that Ripple does not control the escrow. Instead, the system runs automatically through cryptographic, time-locked code. A fixed amount of XRP unlocks every month, and Ripple cannot speed it up, slow it down, or intervene manually. If part of the released supply is not used, it goes back into escrow with a new unlock date. Xaif described the process as predictable and transparent, governed entirely by code rather than human decision-making.

Anyone can run a Twitter campaign, place banners on crypto sites, or pump traffic through Google. But attention isn’t the same as trust — and trust determines whether users stay, investors commit, and partners take you seriously. The reason is simple: ads create awareness, not reputation. In an industry shaped by skepticism, scrutiny, and a long memory for broken promises, reputation comes from validation from credible third parties which cannot be achieved through advertising. This is why strong PR matters and why agencies like Outset PR focus on building the kind of tier-1 credibility that actually changes how the market perceives a project instead of relying on “visibility for visibility’s sake”. Why Ads Fall Short in Crypto Ads have their place. They attract eyeballs, build visibility, and help with short-term user acquisition. But they don’t answer the questions investors, partners, and thoughtful users always ask: Is this project credible? Who stands behind it? Why should I believe what they claim? Is anyone trustworthy talking about them? Crypto audiences are highly skeptical. They’ve seen rug pulls, empty promises, and polished ads behind projects that disappeared overnight. When a project relies heavily on ads but has little third-party coverage, it raises eyebrows. People instinctively look beyond the marketing and search for proof that the brand is worth paying attention to. That proof comes from reputation earned in public. PR Builds What Money Can’t Buy: Credibility Public relations does what ad campaigns are structurally unable to do: it builds trust through external voices. When respected journalists, analysts, and industry publications cover your project, they lend their authority to your story. This does three important things: 1. It validates you in the eyes of your audience. A mention in a publication people trust carries more weight than any amount of paid promotion. 2. It strengthens your narrative. Instead of pushing messages at people, you’re shaping how the market sees you — through reputable channels. 3. It creates durable reputation assets. A well-placed feature or expert commentary stays online indefinitely. It keeps working for you long after the ad budget runs out. How Tier-1 Coverage Builds Trust Coverage in low-authority blogs won’t move markets. It is tier-1 publications that function as trust multipliers. They reach decision-makers: investors, fund managers, exchange listing teams, founders, and users who rely on curated content to filter signals from noise. A single high-quality feature can do more for a project’s credibility than months of paid advertising. This is because big media outlets represent an editorial filter — someone impartial looked at your project and decided it’s worth telling the world about. In crypto, that stamp matters. Outset PR Amplifies Trust in Web3 Through Earned Tier-1 Coverage Breaking into top media outlets doesn’t happen by accident. It requires strategy, relationships, timing, and the ability to frame a story in a way that fits what journalists actually want. A strong PR team typically focuses on several core actions: selecting topics that highlight the project’s real expertise crafting a clear, journalist-ready brief developing compelling angles that stand out in crowded inboxes pitching directly to trusted tier-1 reporters reacting quickly to news cycles and real-time editorial opportunities managing every step from the first email to the published story When done well, this approach bridges the gap between a project’s internal vision and the external validation needed to build a lasting reputation. A good demonstration of this approach in action comes from Outset PR , a team that has built a reputation for securing meaningful tier-1 visibility for crypto brands. One recent case involved Graphite Network, a project with a distinct technical foundation that wasn’t yet reflected in its public presence. Outset PR developed a targeted pitching campaign around Graphite’s expertise and product story. The result: feature coverage in Forbes and VentureBeat, and expert commentary from CTO on Investing.com. It was the result of sharp angle selection, tailored pitches, and ongoing relationships with editors who trust the work coming from Outset PR’s desk. The coverage elevated Graphite’s market credibility, positioned the team as experts, and strengthened investor confidence at a critical time in their growth. That’s the long-term impact PR is meant to deliver. Conclusion: Ads Amplify, but PR Anchors Advertising has a place. It accelerates exposure and drives traffic. But ads don’t build trust, whereas PR provides independent validation, reputational depth, and confidence during turbulence. And at the highest level, tier-1 media coverage becomes a public checkpoint: a sign that a project has survived editorial scrutiny and earned a place in the broader market conversation. Agencies like Outset PR specialize in getting projects to that checkpoint — not through pay-to-play placements, but by shaping strong narratives, pitching them to the right editors, and guiding founders through the scrutiny that top-tier publications require.

The funds will be disbursed through its philanthropic arm, Google.org, through several initiatives. The fund will be used to support programmes focused on building AI talent and strengthening digital safety and security within the community. The initiative is also a core commitment to push forward Nigeria’s vision for digital leadership, directly providing support to the country’s National AI Strategy and the national mandate to create more than one million jobs in the digital sector . Google announces plans to boost AI skills and development in Nigeria The country is set to unlock a projected $15 billion in economic value from artificial intelligence by 2030, according to reports from Public First. This dual focus provides the opportunity for the country to boast a skilled workforce and a secure environment needed for its economic growth. Altogether, the development is expected to make economic growth more sustainable and inclusive. Speaking on the development , Dr. ‘Bosun Tijani, the Minister of Communication, Innovation, and Digital Economy, noted that artificial intelligence is at the heart of Nigeria’s push to improve the level of productivity in its economy. He also added that the country’s intention is to compete globally in technology and innovation among other global nations. “I welcome this important and timely investment from Google and Google.org,” he added. Tijani mentioned that the investment reflects the power of meaningful private sector partnerships in nurturing talent, strengthening the country’s digital infrastructure, and advancing its national AI priorities. “This collaboration directly supports our drive to operationalise our National AI Strategy and to position Nigerian innovators at the forefront of the global AI revolution,” Tijani said. The funding will be provided to five expert organizations, including FATE Foundations and African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS); African Tech Forum (ATF); JA Africa and CyberSafe Foundation. Google, which claims that the funding will help nurture talent, explained that FATE Foundation, in collaboration with AIMS, will integrate an advanced curriculum into universities, while the ATF will launch an innovation challenge to guide developers. Long-standing commitment to Nigeria continues JA Africa, in its quest to improve digital safety, will scale the “Be Internet Awesome” initiative for youth, while the Cybersafe Foundation will strengthen the cybersecurity of public institutions. “We are incredibly proud to partner with the African Institute of Management Sciences on the Advanced AI UpSkilling Project, with support from Google.org,” Adenike Adeyemi, executive director at FATE Foundation, said. Adeyemi also mentioned that the initiative is a direct response to the urgent need for competency in artificial intelligence in Africa, empowering tertiary institutions, lecturers, and students across Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa. She added that the support is in line with FATE Foundation‘s mission to improve innovation and economic growth on the continent, claiming that it will enable Africa to be equipped to lead the global technological future. The announcement is one of Google’s commitments to Nigeria, which includes infrastructure like the Equiano subsea cable and successful initiatives like the 2023 Skills Sprint programme. Others include the 1.2 billion naira commitment to Mind the Gap, a program that has successfully trained 20,991 participants, which includes 5,217 women in AI and tech. The program also successfully moved participants to jobs, internships, and business, showing an advancement in Nigeria’s digital economy. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

People are eagerly on the lookout for the best cryptocurrency to buy in anticipation of the next big bull market. There is also an increasing suggestion being made between the current price of $0.035 for the presale token of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) compared to the massive 2017-2018 surge in the value of XRP. Experts also observe that the potential for return on investment in the latter stages of MUTM presale may possibly be like the parabolic movements that propelled XRP to the top crypto assets. Market analysts also ask whether the new cryptocurrency in the defi market Mutuum will meet its ambitious aim. XRP 2017-2018 To better grasp the analogy, it is important to remember the unconventional price movements XRP made in the previous market cycle. By the end of 2016, XRP was trading at $0.20. Starting from the latter parts of 2017 through the beginning of 2018, the token experienced an astonishing price jump that resulted in reaching an all-time high at $3.84. This made its return-of-profit stand at 1,820%, if one bought the token in the beginning. It’s because the XRP presale’s success made it one of the first successful presales in the market. However, the reason for the hype surrounding Mutuum lies in its presale structure that might provide the same opportunity in a controlled environment. Mutuum’s Presale Momentum and Presale Tokenomics The presale for the Mutuum Finance token has attracted considerable attention from the investment community because of its utility for usage in transactions. However, the presale is in Phase 6 and is over 95% subscribed. This indicates the Fear of Missing Out (FOMO), where $0.035 is the largest available discount before reaching the next token milestone. So far, the project has raised in excess of $19,020,000 from in excess of 18,250 holders since the presale began. The current price for Phase 6 is $0.035, marking a 250% jump from the initial $0.01 in Phase 1. Once the token launches at $0.06, those who purchase the token now stand to gain 415%. Phase 7 will mark the beginning of the $0.04 price. Stablecoin Utility: Connecting DeFi to Traditional Finance One of the crucial aspects that make Mutuum stand out as a very promising defi platform is its focus on the usage of its stablecoin in the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) loan model. The network architecture of Mutuum may help in effective on-chain loan servicing. Also important for the future on- and off-ramping functionalities, in addition to entering the traditional financial industry, is the stablecoin functionality of the protocol. Confidence in Security & Protocol launch To make the cut for the best cryptocurrency to buy now if one is seeking to be a contender, sufficient security measures must be in place. At Mutuum Finance, the issue of security is of great importance to them. Currently, they are undergoing an independent audit by the reputable firm Halborn Security. At the same time, the team is also progressing very quickly. They just announced the V1 Protocol Launch on the Sepolia testnet. As the presale event for Mutuum Finance is quickly nearing its end, the $0.035 entry point presents market participants with the potential for gaining access to a token that holds immense growth potential. A Defining Moment for a New Crypto Coin Thanks to its utility, emphasis on security, and market adoption, MUTM is poised to become the next big thing in the world of cryptocurrencies. Whether it will follow in the footsteps of XRP’s explosive success is highly possible, as the positives make for a compelling argument for those considering the top defi crypto investment opportunity.

A rumor spread rapidly on social media claiming that Coinbase had mistakenly announced the upcoming Open Sea (SEA) ICO. The deleted post detailed a fully diluted market capitalization (FDV) of $3 billion, a total offering of $10 billion, and a fundraising target of $150 million. Given current market conditions, these figures struck many investors as “overinflated.” For comparison, BLUR has a valuation of approximately $120 million, while ME has a valuation of approximately $350 million. Related News: Major Financial Firm BTIG Reveals Its Expectations for the Bitcoin Price This pricing, it's alleged, has led to speculation that the token would need to trade well above $0.30 in the premarket, making the $150 million target unrealistic. Some analysts even suggested this scenario could create a “shorting opportunity.” After a brief period of chaos, the claim was proven false. A parody account named “doomer” posted a completely humorous post claiming that Coinbase would launch an ICO for OpenSea. Despite this, the joke was perceived so realistically that the probability of a SEA token launch jumped from 3% to 55% on the prediction market. Once the situation became clearer, the odds dropped back to 5%. *This is not investment advice.

They range from traditional finance frameworks, such as Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), Price-to-Sell (P/S) ratio, Revenue Yield, and Validator Economics, to more crypto-native metrics, such as Total Value Locked (TVL) Multiple, Market Cap to Total Value Locked (MC/TVL), Metcaife’s Law, Staking Scarcity, L2 Ecosystem, Commitment Premium, App Capital, and Settlement Layer. Severely Undervalued? According to Kim’s findings, the composite fair value of ETH should be $4,869 as of press time. Given its actual market price of just under $3,000, this means that the asset is undervalued by more than 62%. Ethereum Valuation 29.11.2025. Source: ETHVAL A more detailed look into the specific numbers of each framework paints a clear picture. The model shows that ETH should be valued at $9,869 according to Metcalfe’s Law, which reads that the value of a certain network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users. The more the network grows, the more its value should increase exponentially, making it more valuable to each individual user. The second-highest figure ($8,995) comes from the DCF (staking), which treats staking rewards as perpetual cash flows. It bridges traditional finance valuation with crypto-native yield generation. Validator Economics is next in line, showing a fair ETH value of $6,984. Settlement Layer and Commitment Premium also put Ether at over $5,000. Who Said Overvalued? In fact, only two of the 12 metrics show that ETH could be overvalued at current market prices. In legacy finance, the P/S ratio compares a company’s market value to its total sales over a period (usually 12 months). In crypto (or Ethereum in particular now), it works differently since there’s a network, not a company, to evaluate, and there are no sales. For ETH, it compares the market cap to annual transaction fee revenue, and it shows that ETH’s fair value should be under $930. The Revenue Yield, which reverse-engineers fair value from live staking APR and treats ETH like a yield-bearing bond, also shows that the asset might be overvalued, with its price at $1,433.

According to reports, several people have fallen victim to sellers using artificial intelligence-generated adverts to sell their business on its platforms. According to the report, more than 60 people have spoken out after a report by the BBC revealed that several businesses were using fake images and backstories to pose as family-run businesses in the United Kingdom to lure in shoppers. Some of them claimed they had been targeted by advertisements on Facebook , Instagram, and consumer guides, claiming that the businesses were using Meta’s platforms to further deepen and widen their lies. Meta accused of allowing AI adverts without disclosure Meta previously mentioned that it had removed about six companies flagged by the BBC in its earlier report. The company mentioned that the companies claimed to originate from England, but discovered they were shipping cheap goods from Asia. The company said it did not allow fraudulent activities on its platforms and had worked closely with Stop Scams UK to protect users. One of the firms affected is C’est La Vie, which claimed to be a longstanding jewelry retailer run by Patrick and Eileen in Birmingham, but had a return address in China. Another firm, Mabel & Daisy, which used AI-generated pictures of a mother and daughter and claimed to sell clothing from a shop in Bristol, was also removed from the platform. It was discovered that the platform sold cheap clothing from its base in Hong Kong. Other companies that Meta claims it is taking actions against are clothing firms Sylvia & Grace, Chester & Claire, Harrison & Hayes, and Olyndra London, as well as accessories business Omelia & Oliver Jewels. Most of these companies have about one-star reviews on Trustpilot, with hundreds of customers claiming they were led to believe that they were buying the items they sold from brands based in the United Kingdom. Others also claimed that the quality of the goods they sold was below par. Users slam the quality of the products Claire Brown, one of the complainants, claimed that she was persuaded into buying two dresses for £73 from Luxe and Luna London after repeatedly stumbling upon the company’s appealing adverts on Facebook . She noted that when the dresses arrived weeks after she ordered them, they were made of flimsy materials and looked awful. “It felt like a trusted brand after I’d seen it on Facebook so much, you see all these clothing collections, and I liked what I saw,” she said. Brown claimed that she reported the incident to Meta, but failed to get a response from the firm. The company has now stopped its operations on Facebook , dropping a statement on the application that states that life had taken a devastating turn because of the death of a partner. Notably, the statement is almost identical to the one used by fake jewelry business C’est La Vie. “It makes me feel really cross, because I hate people being scammed and the websites are the kind of thing you would share with a friend,” Claire added. Facebook user Stuart claimed he had reported several suspicious companies to Meta, but was advised to influence the ads he saw by hiding them and changing his ad preferences in its response. Stuart claimed that no further action was taken by the platform. Some of the companies fingered in the BBC report appear to have been carrying out controversial drop shipping schemes. This is a development where a third–party buys products from a wholesaler and sells them with a significant markup, despite having never seen the products themselves. The Advertising Standards Authority recently banned ads by a firm that shipped goods from a warehouse in Asia while pretending to be located in the United Kingdom. Don’t just read crypto news.

Prominent crypto analyst Mister Crypto suggests we might be approaching a significant Bitcoin bottom as selling pressure shows clear signs of easing. This potential turning point could mark the beginning of a new upward trajectory for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. What Signals This Potential Bitcoin Bottom? According to Mister Crypto’s latest analysis, several key indicators point toward an approaching Bitcoin bottom. The most compelling evidence comes from the noticeable reduction in selling pressure across major exchanges. When large-scale investors stop liquidating their positions, it often signals that the worst might be over. Moreover, the analyst observed that some sophisticated investors are actually building long positions despite prevailing market fear. This contrarian behavior typically occurs near significant market bottoms when smart money begins accumulating assets at discounted prices. How Does RSI Support the Bitcoin Bottom Theory? The weekly Relative Strength Index provides strong technical evidence for the potential Bitcoin bottom. Currently approaching the 30 level, Bitcoin’s RSI is nearing oversold territory where historical rebounds have frequently occurred. Consider these key RSI patterns that support the Bitcoin bottom thesis: RSI levels below 30 often indicate oversold conditions Previous Bitcoin bottoms formed in similar RSI ranges Strong rallies typically follow these oversold readings Historical data shows that when Bitcoin’s weekly RSI reaches these levels, the asset has consistently staged impressive recoveries. This pattern reinforces the possibility that we’re witnessing another significant Bitcoin bottom formation. Why Are Large Investors Buying During Fear? The current market sentiment presents a fascinating contradiction. While retail investors remain fearful, institutional players are quietly accumulating Bitcoin. This divergence often marks important turning points in cryptocurrency markets. Mister Crypto emphasizes that extreme fear among general investors has historically characterized bullish reversal phases. When the crowd is panicking, experienced traders recognize potential opportunities. This behavior pattern strongly supports the Bitcoin bottom hypothesis. Large investors building positions during fear periods demonstrates their confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Their actions suggest they believe current prices represent attractive entry points near what could be a significant Bitcoin bottom. What Challenges Remain for Bitcoin’s Recovery? While the signs are encouraging, investors should remain cautious. Several factors could still impact the formation of a sustainable Bitcoin bottom: Macroeconomic pressures continue affecting all risk assets Regulatory uncertainty persists in some jurisdictions Trading volumes need confirmation of renewed interest However, the easing selling pressure provides a solid foundation for potential recovery. The reduced liquidation from large holders removes significant downward pressure that has weighed on Bitcoin prices in recent weeks. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors For investors monitoring this potential Bitcoin bottom, several strategies could prove valuable. First, consider dollar-cost averaging to build positions gradually rather than attempting to time the exact bottom. Second, monitor key indicators like exchange flows and funding rates for additional confirmation. Most importantly, maintain perspective about market cycles. Cryptocurrency markets have always been volatile, and successful investors understand that periods of fear often create the best long-term opportunities. Conclusion: A Hopeful Outlook for Bitcoin The evidence suggesting we’re approaching a Bitcoin bottom continues to strengthen. With selling pressure easing, large investors accumulating, and technical indicators flashing oversold signals, the conditions for a meaningful rebound appear to be falling into place. While no one can guarantee the exact timing of market turns, the current setup offers hopeful signs for Bitcoin investors looking beyond short-term volatility. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is a Bitcoin bottom? A Bitcoin bottom refers to the lowest price point in a market cycle before prices begin recovering. It represents the moment when selling pressure exhausts itself and buying interest returns. How reliable is RSI for predicting Bitcoin bottoms? While not perfect, weekly RSI readings below 30 have historically correlated well with significant Bitcoin bottoms. However, investors should use multiple indicators for confirmation. Should I invest all my money at a potential Bitcoin bottom? No, never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider dollar-cost averaging and maintain a diversified portfolio to manage risk. How long do Bitcoin bottoms typically last? Bitcoin bottoms can form quickly or take several weeks. The current easing selling pressure suggests we might be in the later stages of bottom formation. What other indicators confirm a Bitcoin bottom? Look for increasing exchange inflows, positive funding rates, and improving market sentiment alongside technical indicators like RSI. Can external events disrupt Bitcoin bottom formation? Yes, unexpected regulatory news or macroeconomic developments can always impact cryptocurrency markets, so remain informed about broader market conditions. Found this analysis helpful?

Recent news/opinion on Litecoin Canary Capital’s proposed spot Litecoin ETF remains in limbo after the SEC took no action by its Thursday deadline, leaving the crypto industry uncertain amid a looming government shutdown. Analysts say the regulator’s new approach may render old ETF filing deadlines obsolete, as applicants are now being asked to rely solely on S-1 registration approvals. As I understand it, the shutdown could affect the $LTC ETF approval because the @SECGov still needs to sign off on the S-1 and the agency is operating on a skeleton crew.

He shared a screenshot that places XRP beside two other models for cross-border settlement. His post is notable because XRP supporters have long believed in its ability to dominate the cross-border payment market. The reference appears in a report titled Trust Bridges and Money Flows. It offers a direct description of XRP as a “ private settlement asset and marketplace.” That line signals recognition of XRP within a framework that major institutions study closely. The reaction from the market shows why this matters for long-term growth. XRP now sits in a position that could open new channels for adoption. IMF Puts $XRP as One of Three Possible Solutions to Cross-Border Settlement Issues. pic.twitter.com/SISXFA6OIS — Pumpius (@pumpius) November 26, 2025 IMF’s Framing of Settlement Models The IMF text identifies three models for moving value across borders. The first model describes a private asset and its marketplace. The line cites XRP as an example. The second model points to an open-source marketplace. It includes systems built by the Stellar Foundation and newer DeFi networks. The third model focuses on unbacked crypto assets. It uses Strike as the example and notes its use of Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. This structure gives XRP a clear place in a category that stands apart from the other two models. The IMF places it within a market that can sit inside regulated financial frameworks. That distinction could shape how banks approach digital assets in the next stage of global adoption . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The IMF then points to the strength of a public solution that a regulated private entity could run. It explains that this type of system tackles coordination issues and builds trust through clear governance. It also keeps full alignment with financial integrity standards. Why This Recognition Matters for XRP The mention of XRP gives it a clear operational role in a model reviewed by a major global institution. This helps financial firms that want clarity before adopting new technology. It also reduces uncertainty about how XRP fits within regulated settlement systems. It supports Ripple’s message that XRP can provide frictionless payment and strong liquidity benefits. This recognition can push banks and payment providers to examine XRP more closely. It opens the door for new corridors, higher transaction volumes, and more liquidity partnerships. With defined use cases and rising institutional interest, XRP can gain a stronger position in global payments as firms seek reliable cross-border settlement options.

The global healthcare company’s latest acquisition of 126 BTC in November represents a strategic commitment to cryptocurrency that deserves closer examination. Why is Prenetics Bitcoin Investment Growing So Rapidly? The recent Prenetics Bitcoin investment brings their total holdings to 504 BTC, marking a substantial 33.3% increase from their October position of 378 BTC. This aggressive accumulation strategy demonstrates the company’s belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Moreover, it reflects a broader trend of established corporations diversifying into digital assets. Healthcare companies typically maintain conservative investment portfolios. However, Prenetics is breaking this mold with their bold cryptocurrency approach. Their consistent Bitcoin acquisitions suggest a carefully calculated financial strategy rather than speculative gambling. What Does This Mean for Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? The Prenetics Bitcoin investment story provides valuable insights into how mainstream companies are approaching cryptocurrency: Diversification benefits – Bitcoin offers non-correlated asset exposure Inflation hedging – Protection against currency devaluation Long-term growth potential – Belief in cryptocurrency’s future value Strategic allocation – Methodical, planned investment approach This move follows similar strategies by other public companies, creating a snowball effect in corporate cryptocurrency adoption. The Prenetics Bitcoin investment therefore serves as both a financial decision and a market signal. How Significant is the 33.3% Monthly Increase? A 33.3% monthly growth in Bitcoin holdings represents an exceptionally aggressive accumulation strategy. For context, most institutional investors typically make gradual, incremental purchases. The scale and timing of the Prenetics Bitcoin investment suggests either: Strong conviction in current price levels Accelerated treasury diversification plans Response to specific market conditions Long-term strategic positioning This substantial increase positions Prenetics among the more active corporate Bitcoin investors, potentially influencing other healthcare and technology companies to consider similar moves. What Challenges Do Corporate Bitcoin Investments Face? While the Prenetics Bitcoin investment appears promising, corporate cryptocurrency holdings present unique challenges: Regulatory uncertainty – Evolving compliance requirements Price volatility – Quarterly reporting complications Security concerns – Custody and protection of digital assets Accounting complexities – Valuation and reporting standards Despite these hurdles, the continued Prenetics Bitcoin investment demonstrates their confidence in managing these risks effectively. Their public company status adds an additional layer of scrutiny and transparency to their cryptocurrency strategy. What Can We Learn From This Bitcoin Investment Strategy? The Prenetics Bitcoin investment provides actionable insights for both individual and institutional investors. Their methodical approach shows the importance of: Consistent accumulation – Regular purchases regardless of price fluctuations Transparent reporting – Clear communication about cryptocurrency holdings Strategic timing – Taking advantage of market opportunities Long-term perspective – Focusing on multi-year investment horizons This case study in corporate Bitcoin investment strategy offers valuable lessons about cryptocurrency portfolio management and risk assessment. Conclusion: A Bold Step in Corporate Finance Evolution The Prenetics Bitcoin investment represents more than just another corporate treasury decision. It signals a fundamental shift in how established companies view digital assets. With 504 BTC now in their portfolio, Prenetics has positioned itself at the forefront of institutional cryptocurrency adoption. Their growing confidence in Bitcoin suggests we may see similar moves from other Nasdaq-listed companies in the coming months. Frequently Asked Questions How much Bitcoin does Prenetics now own? Prenetics currently holds 504 BTC following their November purchase of 126 additional Bitcoin. What percentage increase does this represent? The November acquisition represents a 33.3% increase from their previous holding of 378 BTC in October. Why would a healthcare company invest in Bitcoin? Companies across various sectors are diversifying into Bitcoin for portfolio diversification, inflation hedging, and potential long-term growth opportunities. Is this a common practice among public companies? While still emerging, corporate Bitcoin investments are becoming more common, with several major companies now holding cryptocurrency in their treasuries. What risks do corporate Bitcoin investments face? Key challenges include price volatility, regulatory uncertainty, security concerns, and accounting complexities. How does this affect Bitcoin’s market perception? Institutional investments like Prenetics’ contribute to Bitcoin’s legitimacy and may encourage broader adoption.

Analyst Ali Martinez outlined the most significant support and resistance lines, which can determine the asset’s next move if broken to either side. Key levels for Dogecoin $DOGE : – Support at $0.08 – Resistance at $0.20 pic.twitter.com/WSVbYdgFHs — Ali (@ali_charts) November 29, 2025 It’s been quite a long time since the OG meme coin traded anywhere near the support level brought up by Martinez. In fact, the latest time DOGE was below $0.10 and close to $0.08 was in the summer of last year, when it successfully tested it and went on a massive run to almost $0.50 after the US presidential elections. In contrast, the resistance at $0.20 was last visited a month ago. After it gave in, DOGE experienced a painful downfall that resulted in bottoming at $0.135 before it posted a relief rally to the current $0.15. These support and resistance levels come at an interesting time for Dogecoin. What started out as a joke a decade ago has now become a legitimized financial product that has a couple of exchange-traded funds on US soil tracking its performance. After Grayscale’s DOGE Trust was converted into a spot ETF last Monday, Bitwise announced the launch of its own such product on Wednesday called BWOW. “DOGE is simply a 12-year-old coin based on a picture of a cute dog, people doing good, and the common ideal in crypto that people should have the freedom to do as they choose. And, against the odds, it has kept its relevance—and its value—longer than just about anything else in crypto,” commented Bitwise’s CEO, Hunter Horsley. Data from SoSoValue, though, shows that the demand for the meme coin was nowhere to be found within the debut week. The total net inflows stood at just over $2 million as the week closed, well behind the XRP and SOL numbers in their first weeks.
