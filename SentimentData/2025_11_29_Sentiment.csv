Cryptos like Solana (SOL), continuing to churn out top performance based on the powerhouse speed of its architecture and the ever-growing ranks of its developer community, are continuously beset by levels of market volatility within their core support regions. Such market dynamics have proven effective in encouraging market participants to seek out the high-asymmetric opportunity of burgeoning new crypto beyond the core market leaders. It’s within such a market context that the extraordinarily rapid momentum of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) must now be noted. At $0.035 per token, now in the 6th presale phase already sold out in excess of 95%, the token has been adopted by over 18,250 individual market participants who together have collectively raised in excess of $19.02 million. Mutuum Finance is quickly emerging as the top crypto to buy for investors seeking early exposure to high-upside DeFi projects. Solana Builds Bullish Momentum in the Form of a Falling Wedge At the moment, the Solana (SOL) market is respecting its falling wedge pattern in remarkable fashion, as buyers continue to make their presences felt along the lower line of the wedge. This particular indicator of reversal in the market appears to suggest that the market may very well be building steam in secret. Once a breakout past the top line of the wedge is achieved, it might very well mark the beginning of the end for the current bear market. However, pending the validation of the larger breakout by further follow-through on higher levels, it also naturally widens its focus on the likes of Mutuum Finance performing equally vigorously in the market, solidifying its status as a top crypto to buy. MUTM Presale Sees Strong Demand Before Phase 7 Mutuum Finance appears to be the new crypto that investors are closely watching for 2025. The presale event that is still ongoing has recorded over 18,250 participants who collectively raised more than $19.02 million. Phase 6 is over 90% complete, offering tokens at $0.035 compared to the initial $0.01 in Phase 1. When the presale enters Phase 7, the token price will increase by 20%, approaching the expected price on the exchange for listing at $0.06 per token. Noting the increasing use of the platform along with the rising token prices, MUTM appears to represent an attractive new crypto opportunity for early adopters targeting double-digit profits in the proliferating DeFi market. Strategic Project Positioning and Platform Fundamentals One of the major milestones in the roadmap of the Mutuum Finance project is the creation of an over-collateralized stablecoin. This is expected to ensure constant liquidity in the system along with stable loan and borrow transactions. Additionally, the implementation of the layer 2 network will make the process of trading quicker and more economical. The dual-lending system of Mutuum Finance brings together lenders, borrowers, and liquidators in one platform through its flexible DeFi credit market. Additionally, the system allows its users to either lend through variable rates of interest or fixed rates of interest in instances where the market is experiencing market volatility. MUTM is recognized for its high utility DeFi token. With the current fundraising of $19.02 million from 18,250+ contributors and selling over 95% of Phase 6 at $0.035 per token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is soon going to be one of the top crypto to buy in the market. Its V1 launch soon in the market along with its dual-lending DeFi model puts it ahead in the competition against the top layer-1 blockchains such as Solana. Take part in the presale of the official Mutuum Finance now, as this new crypto is shaping up to be a pivotal investment for 2025.

According to company statements and law enforcement sources, about 44.5 billion Korean won — roughly $32 million — vanished in the incident that surfaced late November 2025. Upbit paused deposits and withdrawals and said it would repay affected users from its own reserves. Suspected North Korean Ties Based on reports from investigators and industry watchers, authorities are examining links to the Lazarus Group, a cyber unit long tied to North Korea. Security teams point to methods similar to earlier attacks attributed to the same group, including a major breach in 2019 that took 342,000 ETH from the exchange. Officials say the pattern of rapid withdrawals, quick cross-chain transfers, and spreading funds across many wallets matches tactics used in past nation-linked operations. today south korea blamed north korea for the upbit hacknice headlinebut that part came later so what actually happened? an unknown attacker drained a few of upbit’s hot walletswaited a bitthen started moving funds across chains at some point the hacker bridged usdc from… pic.twitter.com/swq8yjIOLR — trix (@trixwtb) November 28, 2025 How The Funds Were Moved Reports have disclosed that the stolen tokens were moved off Solana, converted through several bridges, and routed through multiple chains to make tracking harder. Transfers happened fast and in many small transactions, which complicates tracing attempts on the blockchain. Blockchain analysts are combing transaction histories, but the bridge conversions and mixing steps slow down any straightforward recovery efforts. On-Site Checks And Ongoing Forensics Authorities have launched inspections at Upbit’s systems and are reviewing logs, admin access records, and wallet backups. According to sources close to the probe, investigators suspect an admin credential compromise or impersonation rather than a simple software flaw in Upbit’s servers. While evidence is still being gathered, forensic teams are looking for the entry point used to sign the withdrawal transactions and any indicators of outside control. Investigation And Market Impact The timing of the theft drew attention because it coincided with corporate news: Upbit’s parent, Dunamu, had public talk of a merger with Naver valued at about $10.3 billion. Market players noted the coincidence, and some suggested the attack could aim to distract or unsettle stakeholders. For investors, exchanges, and regulators, the incident renews calls for stricter custody controls, better separation of hot and cold wallets, and clearer rules for large crypto platforms. Yonhap News reports that South Korea’s largest crypto exchange, Upbit, suffered a hack worth about 44.5 billion KRW ($32 million). Authorities are investigating whether North Korea’s Lazarus Group was behind the attack. The group was also linked to Upbit’s 2019 theft of 58… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) November 28, 2025 Upbit has pledged full reimbursement to users hit by the theft and says it will share findings when the probe allows. Based on reports, tracing and recovery work is ongoing but will be slow because of how the assets were fragmented and moved across chains. Watchers say confirmation of Lazarus involvement would mark another example of how state-linked actors continue to target major crypto firms. Authorities have not yet publicly released a definitive attribution. The next steps to watch include any formal statements from prosecutors, whether any of the moved funds are frozen or returned, and how regulators will respond to reduce the chance of similar losses.

From tokenized bonds and money market funds to institutional liquidity rails, the world’s capital is beginning to migrate to an ecosystem where transactions are programmable, auditable, and borderless. Why Is Ethereum Chosen As The Default Choice For Global Rails The global capital markets are moving on-chain to Ethereum because it is credibly neutral. ETH has never experienced downtime, and it possesses the economic security necessary to support the world’s financial system. Investor and founder of GM42NFT, Captain GM, has stated that ETH is not fast enough to support trading because it wasn’t built for it. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Falls 25% But On-Chain Data and Institutional Staking Signal Q4 Recovery Potential However, the attempts to build a genuinely fast on-chain trading environment have consistently led teams to centralize significant parts of the trading system. This move creates security, reliability, and neutrality concerns for a system designed to be global. These compromises are in direct conflict with the very benefits that ETH provides, and make it the chosen blockchain for global finance. This is where Raya Network steps in to solve these issues at the core. Raya is delivering a decentralized exchange (DEX) with institutional-grade execution speed and Ethereum-level security. It’s a platform that is as fast as TradFi and remains simultaneously secure, reliable, and credibly neutral as exactly DeFi should be. “Fast is easy, decentralized is hard, and it’s only Reya that does both,” Captain GM noted. Analyst Alucard mentioned that the Raya network has become one of the few projects that genuinely solves the speed and security problem. The sub-millisecond execution speeds, trades are fully verified on ETH, and there’s no dependence on a single sequencer. This is an engineered combination designed for real progress in the space. However, over 45% of the token supply is allocated to the community. Reya, combined with the ETH buyback mechanism, creates an ecosystem that’s aligned both technically and economically. They’re building something fast and secure, and because of that, Reya sits in a different category. Why Reya’s Design Feels More Like A New Standard Than Another DEX A trader and ambassador of Somnia, Onur, has also explained that his experience with Reya feels like a full redesign of on-chain execution rather than a small improvement. It offers sub-millisecond fills, unified margin, Ethereum security with ZK settlement, and smooth flow through EigenDA. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Attempts Fresh Recovery as Bullish Pressure Builds According to Onur, the peer-to-pool model keeps trades consistent, efficient, and free from bottlenecks or hidden edges. As a result of this approach, Reya isn’t just another venue anymore, and it’s actively becoming the new execution standard for DeFi.

While bulls have regained some ground, selling pressure is still dominating sentiment, and speculation about the start of a new bear market continues to grow. Many analysts warn that the recent bounce may not be enough to shift the broader trend unless stronger demand returns. Related Reading: XRP Reserves On Binance Collapse To Record Lows: Investors Move Toward Long-Term Holding According to fresh data from Darkfost, short-term stress among investors has eased slightly. The amount of BTC sent to exchanges at a loss has dropped sharply, now sitting around 11,600 BTC—significantly lower than the extreme 67,000 BTC capitulation spike recorded on November 22nd. This decline suggests that panic-driven selling may be cooling off, giving the market a temporary moment of stabilization. However, despite this improvement, Bitcoin still faces strong headwinds. Investors remain cautious, liquidity conditions are tight, and macro uncertainty continues to weigh on risk assets. For now, BTC must hold above the $90K region and show sustained strength to avoid renewed downside pressure. The coming sessions may determine whether this rebound marks the start of recovery—or just a pause before another leg lower. Short-Term Holders Face a Critical Decision Point Darkfost adds that the amount of BTC in profit being sent to exchanges by short-term holders remains relatively low at around 9,500 BTC. However, a slight increase has appeared as Bitcoin climbed back above $90K, showing that some STHs have begun testing the market to secure small gains or reduce their exposure. This subtle shift highlights a growing tension among recent buyers, who must choose between waiting for a full return to break even or selling now to minimize further losses. This situation creates a delicate environment. Even though selling pressure has eased, STHs remain highly sensitive to small price movements, and their behavior often dictates short-term market direction. The past few days have been unusually calm compared to the violent capitulation seen earlier in the month, and that calmness is actually constructive. It suggests that panic has temporarily subsided and the market is trying to find balance. What becomes critical now is monitoring how STHs react as Bitcoin approaches their realized price. If they hold and confidence increases, BTC could gain enough stability to push higher. If they sell aggressively, renewed downside pressure could quickly return. The next move from this cohort will likely set the tone for the coming weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Still Negative: US Institutions Keep Selling Despite Easing Pressure Bitcoin Attempts Recovery But Faces Heavy Overhead Resistance Bitcoin’s daily chart shows the asset attempting a recovery after reaching a capitulation low near $80K, but the structure remains fragile. Price has reclaimed the $90K area, yet momentum is limited as BTC trades below the 50-day and 100-day moving averages—both of which continue sloping downward, signaling sustained bearish pressure. The 200-day moving average sits higher, reinforcing the broader downtrend that has formed since early October’s $126K peak. Recent candles reflect a hesitant rebound: upward wicks show sellers defending every push toward $92K–$94K, while the tight body ranges highlight indecision. Volume has cooled significantly compared with the panic-driven sell-off earlier in November, suggesting that forced selling has eased but strong buy-side conviction is still missing. Related Reading: Major Bitcoin LTH Sell-Off Signals Cycle Exhaustion as Supply Drops to 13.6M BTC Structurally, BTC remains below key resistance clusters formed during its previous consolidation. Reclaiming these zones will be essential for invalidating the bearish trend. Until then, every bounce risks becoming a lower high within a broader corrective structure. On the downside, the $85K–$87K region remains the most important support. A breakdown below it could reopen the path toward deeper corrective targets. For now, Bitcoin is attempting to stabilize, but bulls must reclaim higher levels soon to shift market sentiment and avoid renewed downside pressure.

CME confirmed that trading stopped because of a cooling system malfunction at the CyrusOne-operated facility in Aurora, a site that has served as the backbone of CME’s Globex electronic markets for nearly two decades. Due to a cooling issue at CyrusOne data centers, our markets are currently halted. Support is working to resolve the issue in the near term and will advise clients of Pre-Open details as soon as they are available. — CME Group (@CMEGroup) November 28, 2025 The exchange restored full functionality at 1:30 p.m. UTC on Friday, but the interruption had already rippled through Asia and Europe, where participants were dealing with thin post-Thanksgiving liquidity. CME Outage on Thin Thanksgiving Liquidity Sparks Questions From Traders During the outage, traders across asset classes—equities, currencies, commodities, energy, and crypto—reported being unable to close or adjust positions, a scenario that several described as a “nightmare.” One stock trader, Timothy Bozman, publicly accused CME of allowing a “simple issue” to cripple the entire futures complex, questioning how all major markets could be taken offline by a single point of failure. Manipulation at it's best. How in the actual $&#@ could the entire Index Futures, FX Futures, Metals futures, Energy Futures, Agriculture Futures markets and options be halted because of a server overheating. A simple issue could take down @CMEGroup entire futures platform? pic.twitter.com/ZwvDJ4WImy — Timothy Bozman (@MrAmazingBoz) November 28, 2025 Others went further, suggesting that the timing was “too convenient,” given that the halt arrived during the low-volume Asia session on Thanksgiving, when sudden price moves can unfold with limited resistance. Some traders pointed out that silver futures were approaching a record high near $54 just minutes before prices froze, adding fuel to the speculation and frustration. The outage was widespread because the Globex platform handles the majority of CME’s volume. An earlier cryptonews report stated that crude and palm oil markets stopped moving during the halt, while crypto traders saw Bitcoin and Ethereum futures go offline entirely. The timing added complexity for firms preparing month-end rolls, particularly those needing to adjust Treasury futures or SOFR-linked positions Several traders later noted that even after markets reopened, delays continued in Treasury futures and certain rate products. Trading activity had already been muted due to the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, but the outage further slowed an already quiet session. Official communication from CME Group on their website has been posted. It’s officially ruled as a technical halt. Carry on. I’d expect your prop firm to cancel losses for any stuck trades but we’ll see. $NQ $GC $ES pic.twitter.com/kknVpFj7Hj — KD (@KingDipsX) November 28, 2025 One user on X publicly urged CME to cancel losses for trades affected during the freeze, reflecting the broader anxiety of traders locked into moving markets with no ability to act. CME Suffers Major Outage as It Prepares Shift to 24/7 Crypto Trading in 2026 CyrusOne, which operates more than 55 data centers globally and is backed by KKR and BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners, confirmed the cooling malfunction. The Aurora facility is well-known among high-frequency trading firms that place servers as physically close as possible to CME’s matching engines to shave off microseconds. The exchange acknowledged that CME Direct, a platform used for some markets, remained unavailable even after Globex reopened, showing the extent of the disruption. The incident lasted far longer than a similar 2019 CME outage, and it was the latest reminder of how centralized infrastructure can pose systemic risk in electronic markets. CME has faced technical issues in the past, including a 2014 outage triggered by a software malfunction affecting agricultural contracts. Despite the friction, markets resumed and continued adjusting to broader price movements. Bitcoin futures, which closed on Wednesday at $90,355 before the holiday, reopened at $90,940 on Friday and pushed above $93,000 later in the session as BTC rebounded from its recent low of around $80,522. Source: Cryptonews Analysts noted that Bitcoin faces resistance near $95,000, but reclaiming that level could reopen the path toward six-figure territory. The blackout also comes at a moment when CME is expanding its role in the digital asset sector. In October, the exchange said it plans to move its cryptocurrency futures and options into a full 24/7 trading cycle starting in early 2026, subject to regulatory approval. The firm cited rapidly rising demand for continuous risk management in crypto markets, which never close. CME said trading will run nonstop on Globex, aside from a brief weekly maintenance window, and weekend transactions will be assigned to the next business day for clearing and settlement.

The setup formed with an initial peak in August, a higher high in September, and a lower high in November, signaling a possible trend reversal. After breaking below the neckline, the price has returned to this level. Current trading activity suggests that this area is acting as resistance. A failure to reclaim it may keep the downward trend in place. Chart projections show possible support levels near $30, $27, and $25. Analyst Ali Martinez stated , “Hyperliquid $HYPE is retesting the breakdown zone before a potential move toward $25.” At the same time, HYPE has bounced from the lower Bollinger Band near $30 and is moving toward the 20-day moving average at $37. This level remains an important test. A break above it may open the way toward $43, while a rejection could send the price back toward $31. Source: TradingView The MACD shows early signs of momentum turning. The MACD line has moved slightly above the signal line, and the histogram is shifting positive. However, both lines are still below zero, showing that the overall trend is not yet strong. For now, this points to short-term recovery potential but not a confirmed trend reversal. Bullish Scenario: A Recovery Path to $50? Analyst Make Sense shared a more optimistic view, noting that HYPE has shown early strength after a long period of weakness. They wrote, “$HYPE just formed its first solid rebound after a month of pressure.” According to their breakdown, reclaiming the $37–$38 area could trigger further upside. The next target zone sits at $41–$42, followed by a momentum shift around $44. If HYPE moves past that level, the next upside range is between $48 and $50, areas described as holding untested liquidity. Price action near the $36–$38 zone remains key. A strong move above could support further recovery, while a rejection may keep $25 in focus.

According to the model, all three altcoins could face an unusually turbulent December, with macroeconomic shifts and crypto-specific triggers determining whether prices soar or tumble. The broader crypto market has spent the past month in a sharp downturn following a heavy wave of Bitcoin selling, which dragged most major tokens lower. Bitcoin briefly touched a seven-month low near $82,000 last Friday. Despite the recent slump, long-term sentiment across the industry remains largely positive. Development activity on leading blockchains continues to accelerate, and high-resilience assets like XRP, Solana, and Cardano are still viewed as strong contenders for the next cycle. If market conditions calm, each could regain upward momentum. Below is KIMI AI’s breakdown of potential bullish and bearish scenarios for December. XRP (XRP): KIMI AI Expects a Possible Move Toward Either $10 or $2 Depending on December Sentiment KIMI AI’s bearish projection puts Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) at roughly $2.05 by Christmas, should broader market sentiment weaken, a decline of about 6% from its current price of around $2.18. Source: KIMI It would be an anticlimax to XRP’s impressive rally earlier this year, which sent the token to its first new all-time high in seven years, hitting $3.65 in July following Ripple’s major legal victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. XRP has spent several months consolidating inside multiple bullish flag patterns that didn’t result in a breakout. Its relative strength index (RSI) hovers near 50, and the token gained around 15% over the past seven days. If conditions turn favorable, KIMI’s bullish target for XRP stretches to $10. The SEC’s recent approval of nine spot XRP ETFs may catalyze institutional demand, mirroring earlier responses to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF launches. Additional ETF rollouts are likely to follow. Ongoing regulatory clarification or new high-profile partnerships may set the stage for XRP to approach double-digit valuations by 2026. Solana (SOL): KIMI’s Bear Case Targets $30, While a Bull Run Could Push SOL up 450% Solana ($SOL) remains one of 2025’s most heavily used blockchains, currently securing nearly $9 billion in total value locked and maintaining a market cap of roughly $76.6 billion. Both developer activity and network utilization continue to grow rapidly. New Solana ETFs from Bitwise and Grayscale generated early enthusiasm, with traders hoping for demand similar to earlier Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF rollouts. However, this momentum hasn’t prevented recent weakness. SOL slipped 4% in the last 24 hours to trade around $137, and if this trend persists, KIMI estimates a potential drop toward $30 under a deep market downturn. On the bullish side, KIMI AI projects Solana could surge to $750 within the next month, 450% up from current levels and around 2.5x its ATH of $293, set in January. SOL previously rallied to $250 in January before sliding to near $100 in April. While today’s price remains far below previous highs, technical indicators suggest SOL may be nearing a breakout from a bullish flag pattern. Growing interest in real-world asset tokenization, driven by major firms like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton experimenting with Solana, could lend weight to KIMI’s optimistic projection. Cardano (ADA): KIMI Forecasts a Potential 2,300% December Surge Cardano ($ADA) continues to hold a reputation as one of the most academically rigorous and research-driven projects in crypto. Founded by Ethereum co-creator Charles Hoskinson, Cardano emphasizes peer-reviewed development, security, scalability, and sustainability. With a market cap near $15 billion and $190 million in TVL on the network, Cardano remains a major player in the upper tier of layer-1 blockchains, supported by steady developer engagement and a growing ecosystem of decentralized applications. KIMI AI estimates ADA could rise to around $10 by early 2026, an astonishing 2,281% jump from its current price near $0.42 and more than triple its 2021 all-time high of $3.09. Analysts argue that Cardano’s strong fundamentals and consistent upgrades position it as a potential leader in the next DeFi-driven market cycle. However, KIMI’s bearish scenario warns ADA could fall to $0.18 if market conditions worsen, representing a drop of just over 50% for today’s holders. Maxi Doge (MAXI): A Fast-Growing Meme Coin Outside KIMI AI’s Forecast Models While KIMI anticipates that major altcoins may continue to struggle in the short term, presale tokens are still drawing substantial investor attention. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is one of the most talked-about new meme coins, raising nearly $4.2 million in its presale. Positioned as a degen descendant of Dogecoin, MAXI blends tongue-in-cheek humor with active community involvement. According to his lore, Maxi Doge spent years watching his distant cousin Dogecoin dominate the spotlight while grinding out trades in his mother’s basement, pumping weights, and biding his time as he prepared to take the crown. MAXI builds a competitive community culture through trading challenges, meme contests, and highly active social channels. As an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI benefits from strong scalability options, a mature ecosystem, and lower environmental impact, advantages not offered by Dogecoin’s legacy proof-of-work design. Staking rewards currently offer up to 73% APY, though yields will naturally decline as participation increases. The presale price is set at $0.0002705, with automatic increments scheduled through later funding rounds. Buyers can join using MetaMask or Best Wallet . Dogecoin stands no chance!

The asset eventually touched a seven-month low near $82,000 last Friday, a level many traders hope will mark the cycle’s floor. With BTC now holding above $90,000, traders are hoping for an optimistic Christmas month. Veteran crypto investors remain diamond-handed. Long-term optimists view Bitcoin’s pullback as a necessary breather after consecutive months of new all-time highs, a reset phase meant to flush out excess leverage, cool speculation, and lay the groundwork for Bitcoin’s next upward move. As Bitcoin’s dominance loosens and narrative control shifts across the sector, many analysts believe the next major bull surge will lean heavily on altcoins. For that reason, with prices still relatively low, now could be the best time to load up on XRP, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu. XRP (XRP): A Leading Contender for the Future of Global Money Movement Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) continues to anchor the digital payments landscape, boasting near-instant settlement speeds and minimal transaction costs. Its underlying network, the XRP Ledger, is frequently cited as a streamlined and modern alternative to legacy systems such as SWIFT. Ripple’s technology has been pointed out in reports from both the UN Capital Development Fund and the White House, while its growing roster of banking and fintech partners has helped XRP maintain a market capitalization of more than $132 billion. The debut of Ripple’s USD-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD, further showcases the company’s ambitions. Each RLUSD transaction burns a fraction of XRP, subtly tightening supply and linking XRP’s value to the expanding use of Ripple’s products. XRP has climbed 50% over the past year, ending six years of inertia and notching a fresh all-time high of $3.65 in July, while Bitcoin slipped 4% in the same period. With its Relative Strength Index hovering around 50 and the current price of $2.18 sitting just above the 30-day moving average, demand is strengthening thanks to the recent launch of nine XRP ETFs. More funds are expected, and increased institutional access could accelerate inflows. If U.S. lawmakers finally introduce comprehensive crypto regulations before the end of the year, then XRP has a realistic shot at reaching $10 or beyond by 2026. Dogecoin (DOGE): The World’s Favourite Meme Coin Is No Longer a Laughing Matter Dogecoin ($DOGE) , created in 2013, remains the original meme token and is still powered by its energetic “Doge Army.” The coin continues to hold a market cap of around $23 billion, showcasing its remarkable staying power. DOGE’s explosive 2021 rally, boosted by pop culture icons like Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, and Gene Simmons, cemented it as a household crypto name. While it began life as a joke, Dogecoin’s substantial market cap gives it notable price resilience, often mirroring broader movements in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. The token briefly ran up to $0.30 in mid-September before cooling to roughly $0.15 today. The Doge Army’s “Dogecoin to $1” slogan remains a rallying cry, though reaching that milestone in 2025 seems unlikely without any real breakthrough in US crypto policy. A supportive bull market could, however, help DOGE finally break through stubborn resistance around $0.33. Mainstream adoption continues to expand: Tesla accepts DOGE for merchandise purchases, and payment giants such as PayPal and Revolut have integrated DOGE transactions. Dogecoin’s 2021 peak of $0.7316 remains a distant target, one that may only be reachable well into next year. At current levels, DOGE trades nearly 80% below its ATH. Shiba Inu (SHIB): From Meme Coin to Utility Ecosystem Shiba Inu ($SHIB) , launched in August 2020, has evolved into the world’s second-largest meme cryptocurrency, holding a market valuation above $5.1 billion. Thanks to its broad ecosystem and entrenched user base, SHIB now behaves more like a mid-tier blue-chip asset than a high-risk meme token. It currently trades near $0.0000087. A breakout above $0.000022 could open the door for a climb toward $0.00003 by late November, and potentially $0.00005–$0.0001 if market conditions turn highly favorable. Unlike many meme-based projects, Shiba Inu continues to grow real utility through Shibarium, its Ethereum Layer 2 network built to deliver lower fees and faster execution. Upcoming privacy tools and ecosystem upgrades further solidify SHIB’s shift from novelty token to functional crypto platform. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): Meme Culture Meets High-Speed Bitcoin Layer-2 Innovation A rising project to watch heading into 2026 is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a Bitcoin Layer-2 scaling network cosplaying as a meme coin. Beneath its playful branding, the protocol aims to unlock fast transactions, near-zero fees, and full smart-contract support for Bitcoin. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper incorporates decentralized governance along with a Canonical Bridge that enables smooth BTC transfers between chains. The HYPER presale has already exceeded $28.6 million in commitments, and well-known analyst Borch Crypto has floated projections of potential 100× gains. A recent Coinsult audit reported no smart-contract issues, bolstering confidence in the project. The HYPER token drives network operations, governance, and staking, with early presale participants earning up to 40% APY. With momentum rapidly building, 2026 will be the year Bitcoin goes $HYPER.

The firm submitted a formal request to withdraw its S-1 filing, ending a process that began months earlier and left the company outside the group of issuers that launched in November. The move arrives during a period of rapid growth for Solana-based products, rising ETF interest, and a volatile altcoin market that continues to reshuffle issuer strategies. CoinShares Adjusts Its ETF Roadmap The asset manager last updated its Solana staking ETF application on September 26. However, it ultimately chose not to advance the product, leaving seven SOL ETFs currently active in the US market. Besides, CoinShares still has several filings at different stages, though the withdrawn product never entered trading and required structural reconsideration. The decision may point to a redesigned approach to Solana exposure, particularly as staking ETFs must select reliable validators to secure predictable yields. CoinShares continues to offer a Solana-based staking ETP on the Frankfurt exchange. Additionally, the firm manages more than $10 billion in assets and holds about 34% of Europe’s crypto ETP market. Hence, the pullback does not reflect declining interest in Solana. Instead, it may signal a broader shift toward aligning new products with evolving regulatory and market expectations. Altcoin ETF Plans Trimmed Amid Market Weakness The company also withdrew its efforts to introduce ETFs for XRP and Litecoin. Market conditions worsened in recent weeks, creating uncertainty around demand for altcoin products. Moreover, CoinShares is preparing for a merger with Vine Hill Capital, prompting a reassessment of priorities before the upcoming US listing. The removal of the XRP ETF leaves five issuers still competing to launch the next product, with 21Shares expected to begin trading on November 29. Solana Price Holds Strength Despite ETF Reversal Solana traded at $137.83 after a 3.11% daily decline, though weekly gains reached 8.32%. The circulating supply stands at 560 million SOL, placing its market cap near $77.1 billion. Despite the ETF withdrawal, analysts see improving momentum. Marzell noted an 80% potential upside supported by rising transactions, strong user activity, growing futures interest, and $613 million in spot SOL ETF inflows. Source: X Exy observed that SOL broke above its major trendline with a strong bullish candle following an RSI bullish divergence. Consequently, resistance remains firm at $152 and $170.

Could this set the stage for a bullish Shiba Inu price prediction as momentum builds? The second-largest meme coin has now climbed 16% in the past week, riding a broader market rebound that kicked off after a stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report. With sentiment turning and supply shrinking, SHIB may be gearing up for something bigger. HOURLY SHIB UPDATE $SHIB Price: $0.00000864 (1hr 0.17% ▲ | 24hr -0.04% ▼ ) Market Cap: $5,091,883,962 (0.00% ▲) Total Supply: 589,246,218,190,454 TOKENS BURNT Past 24Hrs: 61,833,188 (676.38% ▲) Past 7 Days: 114,424,622 (155.66% ▲) — Shibburn (@shibburn) November 27, 2025 Data from Shibburn, a service that tracks how many SHIB are burned periodically, reported a 676% spike consisting of 61.8 million tokens burned in the past 24 hours alone. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: RSI Sends Early Buy Signal After Winning Streak The daily chart shows SHIB approaching the upper boundary of its descending price channel, a key level that could define its next move. If the price breaks above $0.0000090, momentum may shift quickly, increasing the chances of a run toward $0.00001050. This zone will likely test whether bulls have the conviction to reverse the current trend. Adding strength to the setup, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved above its 14-day moving average, often seen as an early sign of a potential breakout. On the flip side, if SHIB fails to break through this resistance and gets rejected, a retest of recent lows becomes more likely in the near term. While SHIB gears up for a decisive move, early-stage investors are already rotating into fresh opportunities. One of the hottest presales gaining momentum right now is Pepenode ($PEPENODE) , a virtual mining project that turns crypto mining into a reward-driven game. No hardware needed. Players launch and upgrade digital rigs to earn rewards, while every upgrade burns a portion of $PEPENODE forever. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Introduces a Fun Way to Mine Meme Coins Pepenode ($PEPENODE) eliminates the need to make expensive hardware investments to mine meme coins and gamifies the whole process. Players kick things off by building a virtual server and launching as many mining rigs as they want, turning their setup into a competitive income engine. The goal is simple: climb the leaderboard and earn surprise airdrops of top meme coins like Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) and Bonk ($BONK) along the way. To boost their earning power, miners can reinvest using $PEPENODE to upgrade their rigs and scale their output. Up to 70% of the tokens used for upgrades are burned permanently, cutting supply and steadily increasing scarcity. With a staking APY of 584% and interest in the game growing fast, demand for $PEPENODE is on track to surge alongside its player base.

55067952,636184,1764370830,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55067952.jpeg,"Elon Musk’s SpaceX Moves $105 Million In Bitcoin, Is It Time For Selling?",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-is-it-time-for-selling/,"Elon Musk’s SpaceX quietly shifted 1,163 BTC, worth about $105.23 million, into new wallets this week, leading to questions over whether the aerospace giant is preparing for a sale or simply reorganizing its reserves. Blockchain tracker Arkham Intelligence first spotted the transaction on November 27, noting that the bitcoins were moved from a long-dormant treasury wallet into a new address. The move happened just as Bitcoin reclaimed $91,000, and the size of the transaction could be an early signal of selling pressure. SpaceX’s Bitcoin Transfer: Is This Selling Pressure? Data from Arkham Intelligence shows that SpaceX executed the $105.23 million transfer in a single large movement. Although the transfer was substantial, a quick look at SpaceX’s treasury behavior in recent months shows that the activity points to internal restructuring rather than liquidation. Still, the scale of the transaction has left investors asking whether this could be an early signal of selling pressure. Intelligence data shows that the funds were pushed into a new wallet with no immediate ties to exchanges. This difference is important because transfers to exchanges often come with selling activity. Instead, the pattern follows an earlier transaction in late October , when SpaceX moved 281 BTC into a newly created address without any subsequent liquidation. Interestingly, this 281 BTC transfer was preceded by a similar transfer of 1,215 BTC worth $133.68 million in October. The consistency of these movements suggests a gradual upgrade or redistribution of cold-storage arrangements, something that major corporations tend to do periodically to maintain custody security. According to Lookonchain, the recent transfer of 1,163 BTC to the new address “bc1q4p” was possibly made to Coinbase Prime for custody. SpaceX’s balance is substantial even after the recent movement, with roughly 6,095 BTC still under its control, an amount currently valued at $555.637 million and large enough to place the company among the biggest private corporate holders of Bitcoin. Tesla, Musk’s other major enterprise, sits even higher on the leaderboard with 11,509 BTC valued at $1.05 billion, ranking it as the 17th largest publicly traded Bitcoin-holding company in the world. Could SpaceX’s Movements Still Impact Market Sentiment? Despite the absence of clear evidence of selling intent, large transfers tied to high-profile companies like SpaceX inevitably influence sentiment. Bitcoin had just regained the $91,000 region at the time of the transfer, and traders immediately questioned whether Musk’s company might be preparing to offload part of its holdings, especially given the company’s sell-off history during the 2022 bear market. Bitcoin is still stabilizing after a price crash encouraged in part by Owen Gunden, one of the earliest high-profile holders, who unloaded hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of BTC and helped drag the price below $90,000 on November 20. However, the evidence behind SpaceX’s current transfer is still pointing to consolidation rather than liquidation.",Bitcoin News|Arkham Intelligence|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Coinbase Prime|Elon Musk|Lookonchain|Owen Gunden|SpaceX|Tesla,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|ARKM|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-28 23:00:30

November Close May Hold The Key,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/will-bitcoin-btc-end-2025-in-green-november-close-may-hold-the-key/,"While the crypto market bounces from last week’s correction, Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to reclaim a crucial area as support to continue its recovery rally. As the flagship crypto faces some resistance, some market watchers have suggested that this week’s close may be key for its end-of-year performance. Related Reading: Solana Reclaims Crucial Resistance Despite First SOL ETF Outflows – 25% Rally Ahead? Bitcoin Faces Rejection Ahead Of November Close Bitcoin has retested a crucial resistance level for the first time in a week, hitting a one-week high of $93,092 on Friday morning before retracing. The flagship crypto has failed to hold crucial support levels throughout the November corrections, trading below $100,000 for nearly two weeks. A week ago, BTC plunged below $90,000 during the latest market correction, reaching a seven-month low of $80,600. However, the cryptocurrency led this week’s broader recovery, reclaiming key levels over the past few days. Amid its recent performance, some market observers have noted that Bitcoin is currently retesting a crucial re-accumulation region, between $82,000 and $93,000, where the price consolidated after previous pullbacks, including the Q1 market correction. Analyst Rekt Capital highlighted that BTC rebounded more than 7% from the local bottom and has revisited the range high resistance during Friday’s recovery. Now, Bitcoin is attempting to hold the high zone of its local range, retesting the $90,000-$91,000 area as support after being rejected from the key resistance. Previously, he pointed out that last week’s weekly close aligned with the flagship crypto’s monthly range, setting the stage for a potential floor around the $86,000 area, which would develop a new range between this level and the $93,000 resistance. To the analyst, Bitcoin must close the week, which also coincides with November’s monthly close, above $93,5000 and turn this level into support if it wants to further build on its newfound momentum and potentially revisit its two-month downtrend line, which currently sits near the $96,000 mark. “The ~$93500 level happens to be a Four-Year Cycle level. History suggests price should be able to find a way to 12-month close above ~$93500 to finish 2025 green,” Rekt Capital added on X. $98,000 Rally or $88,000 Drop Next? Market watcher Ted Pillows discussed BTC’s short-term future as it faces some resistance around the $92,000-$93,000 levels. To the analysts, reclaiming this area could propel the price towards the $98,000-$100,000 barrier in the coming weeks. On the contrary, he suggested that failing to reclaim this level will send Bitcoin’s price below the $88,000 mark. Earlier this week, Ted warned that this was one of the most important levels to reclaim and hold as support in the short term, as a rejection from this area could trigger a significant drop below the recent lows. Similarly, Daan Crypto Trades noted that the constant sell-off of the past few weeks has created “a ton of marginally lower highs, creating such a big liquidity pocket” between the $97,000-$98,000 zone. This region also aligns with key horizontal price levels in bigger timeframes, making it a “good area to watch,” as BTC continues to consolidate in a relatively tight range.

Analysts Eye 50% December Jump The trader considers that if BTC’s price breaks down, the $88,000 mark could be a good place for a higher low. However, if the price holds above the $91,800 level, it may trigger another retest of the $93,000 resistance. Ultimately, He warned that the market could likely see a “Choppy environment in the short-term surrounding Thanksgiving, which always sees pretty low volume & liquidity.” As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $90,500, a 1.1% decline in the daily timeframe.

This remarkable achievement signals growing institutional confidence in XRP and sets a new benchmark for digital asset investment products. What Makes XRP Spot ETFs So Attractive to Investors? XRP spot ETFs provide investors with direct exposure to XRP without the complexities of managing private keys or navigating cryptocurrency exchanges. These investment vehicles offer several compelling advantages: Regulatory oversight and investor protection Traditional brokerage account accessibility Professional fund management Liquidity and trading convenience Breaking Down the Impressive XRP ETF Numbers The $640 million net inflow represents more than just impressive numbers – it demonstrates real market demand. These XRP spot ETFs now hold $670 million in total net assets, accounting for 0.50% of XRP’s total market capitalization. This substantial allocation shows that institutional investors are taking XRP seriously as a viable asset class. Why Are XRP Spot ETFs Gaining Traction Now? Several factors contribute to the successful launch of these XRP spot ETFs. Regulatory clarity has improved significantly, providing more confidence to both issuers and investors. Moreover, the growing acceptance of digital assets in traditional finance creates perfect conditions for these products to thrive. The timing aligns with increasing institutional interest in cryptocurrency diversification. What Challenges Do XRP Spot ETFs Face? Despite the strong start, XRP spot ETFs must navigate ongoing regulatory developments and market volatility. However, the initial success suggests that these challenges are being effectively managed. The funds’ performance during their first month indicates robust risk management strategies and investor confidence in the underlying asset. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors For investors considering XRP spot ETFs, here are key considerations: Research each fund’s expense ratios and management fees Understand the tax implications in your jurisdiction Diversify across multiple cryptocurrency products Monitor regulatory developments affecting XRP The Future Outlook for XRP Spot ETFs The spectacular debut of these XRP spot ETFs suggests a bright future for cryptocurrency-based investment products.

This achievement demonstrates that institutional investors are embracing cryptocurrency exposure through regulated channels, potentially signaling a new era of mainstream adoption. Frequently Asked Questions What are XRP spot ETFs? XRP spot ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual XRP tokens, providing investors with direct exposure to XRP price movements through traditional brokerage accounts. How do XRP spot ETFs differ from Bitcoin ETFs? While both are cryptocurrency ETFs, XRP spot ETFs specifically track XRP’s price, whereas Bitcoin ETFs track Bitcoin. Each has different regulatory considerations and market dynamics. Are XRP spot ETFs available to all investors? Yes, these XRP spot ETFs are available to any investor with access to traditional brokerage accounts, making XRP investment more accessible than ever. What risks do XRP spot ETFs carry? Like any investment, XRP spot ETFs carry market risk, regulatory risk, and the volatility inherent in cryptocurrency markets, though they offer more protection than direct crypto ownership. Can I trade XRP spot ETFs like regular stocks? Absolutely. XRP spot ETFs trade on major exchanges during market hours, allowing investors to buy and sell shares just like traditional stocks. How do the fees compare to direct XRP ownership? XRP spot ETFs typically charge management fees, but these may be offset by the convenience, security, and regulatory protections they provide compared to direct ownership.

Bitcoin remains at $91,800, Ethereum is at $3,060, while XRP has risen slightly to $2.22, as investors await the next FOMC meeting on December 9 and 10. While the expectation had been that the Fed wouldn’t touch rates, positivity has increased, with JPMorgan changing its opinion this week and suggesting that the central bank will cut its federal funds rate by 0.25%. This is likely to boost the market, so now may actually be an ideal time to get buying again, while tokens remain at a discount. And investors should also consider diversifying into new tokens, with this article looking more closely at PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), the next crypto to turn $100 into $10,000. Next Crypto to Turn $100 into $10,000 – 28 November To understand why PEPENODE is the next crypto to turn $100 into $10,000, it’s worth explaining its unique and innovative mining platform. Mapping your next move in Pepenode isn’t flavor. It’s core gameplay that determines how fast you climb upgrade those Nodes! https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/vY69IDm3C1 — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) November 27, 2025 Rather than require users to invest in expensive mining hardware (as you’d have to do with Bitcoin), PEPENODE enables anyone to mine tokens, all from the comfort of their homes. It gives users the opportunity to build and operate their own virtual mining rigs, which they can grow by spending PEPENODE tokens on virtual mining nodes. By buying more nodes, participants will receive greater mining rewards, a dynamic that should motivate considerable demand for the new coin. PEPENODE will pay out rewards in external coins such as Pepe and Fartcoin, meaning that the incentive to buy more nodes could be very strong (especially if these coins are rallying). On top of this, users can sell on their nodes if they want to scale down or halt their mining operations, providing an additional source of income. In fact, the potential for profit doesn’t stop there, since PEPENODE is also open to staking, and in fact currently offers a very attractive yield of 584%. How to Buy PEPENODE Before It Lists All of these features make PEPENODE one of the most exciting new coins to have emerged in recent weeks, and they’re why we think it’s the next crypto to turn $100 into $10,000. It has the fundamentals and community to be a success, with investors able to join its presale by going to its official website. Its presale has raised just over $2.2 million so far, and this total is likely to continue rising as the sale enters its end stage. By connecting a compatible wallet (e.g., Best Wallet), users can choose how much of the token they want to buy, and then buy it using either ETH, USDT, BNB, or fiat. The token is currently selling at a price of $0.0011685, but this price will rise repeatedly until the sale ends. As such, traders should act quickly, since PEPENODE has the potential to rally strongly once it launches in the next few weeks. This will especially be the case if the Fed does cut rates and the mood turns more bullish, which is looking increasingly likely.

This monumental transaction, valued at approximately $239 million, represents one of the largest single SOL transfers we’ve witnessed this year. But what does this massive movement really mean for Solana investors and the broader crypto ecosystem? What This Massive SOL Transfer Reveals About Market Sentiment When we see a SOL transfer of this magnitude, it immediately raises important questions about market dynamics. Institutional players typically move large sums for specific strategic purposes. This particular SOL transfer could signal several possibilities: Institutional accumulation for long-term holding Preparation for upcoming trading activities Portfolio rebalancing by a major investor Potential preparation for staking or DeFi activities The timing of this SOL transfer is particularly interesting given current market conditions. Large movements often precede significant price action, making this a crucial development to watch. Why Are Institutional SOL Transfers So Important? Institutional SOL transfers like this one carry more weight than typical retail transactions. When $239 million worth of SOL moves to a major exchange like Coinbase Institutional, it suggests sophisticated players are making calculated moves. This SOL transfer demonstrates several key market realities: First, institutional confidence in Solana remains strong despite recent market volatility. Second, the sheer size of this SOL transfer indicates that major investors see current price levels as attractive for entry or repositioning. Moreover, such movements often create ripple effects throughout the entire Solana ecosystem. How This SOL Transfer Could Impact Solana’s Price Action The immediate question on every trader’s mind is how this SOL transfer will affect Solana’s market price. Historically, large transfers to exchanges can signal potential selling pressure. However, the institutional nature of this SOL transfer suggests a more nuanced story. Consider these potential outcomes: Short-term volatility as markets digest the news Increased liquidity on Coinbase Institutional Potential price support if the transfer represents accumulation Market confidence boost from institutional participation This SOL transfer comes at a time when Solana has shown remarkable resilience in the face of broader market challenges. The network’s growing adoption and technological improvements continue to attract serious capital. Understanding Whale Movements in Cryptocurrency Markets Whale transactions like this SOL transfer provide valuable insights into market sentiment. Large holders typically have better market information and longer-term perspectives than retail investors. When we analyze patterns in SOL transfer activity, we can identify several consistent behaviors: Whales often accumulate during price dips and distribute during rallies. Their movements frequently precede major price trends. Institutional SOL transfers tend to be more strategic than emotional, reflecting careful planning and analysis. Key Takeaways From This Monumental SOL Transfer This massive SOL transfer teaches us several crucial lessons about today’s cryptocurrency landscape. The continued institutional interest in Solana validates the network’s fundamental strength. The scale of this movement demonstrates that serious capital remains committed to blockchain innovation. Most importantly, this SOL transfer reminds us that cryptocurrency markets are maturing rapidly. We’re witnessing the transition from speculative trading to strategic institutional participation. This evolution brings both stability and sophistication to the space. Frequently Asked Questions What does a large SOL transfer to an exchange usually mean? Large SOL transfers to exchanges can indicate preparation for selling, but institutional transfers often have more complex strategic purposes including staking, lending, or portfolio management. How does this SOL transfer affect ordinary investors? While direct impact may be limited, such movements can influence market sentiment, liquidity, and price volatility, potentially creating both risks and opportunities for retail investors. Why use Coinbase Institutional for such a large transfer? Coinbase Institutional offers enhanced security, better liquidity access, and specialized services tailored to large-scale investors that aren’t available on retail platforms. Should I be concerned about price drops after this SOL transfer? Not necessarily. Institutional transfers don’t always lead to immediate selling. Often, they represent long-term strategic positioning rather than short-term trading intentions. How common are SOL transfers of this size? While significant, multi-million dollar SOL transfers occur regularly as institutional participation in cryptocurrency markets continues to grow and mature. Can I track future SOL transfers myself? Yes, platforms like Whale Alert and various blockchain explorers allow anyone to monitor large cryptocurrency transactions in real-time across multiple networks.

The altcoin is gaining momentum as a hedge against future quantum vulnerabilities, a theme expected to underpin 2026 due to both technological urgency and investor sentiment. Quantum-resistant tokens have reached a combined market cap of $8.75 billion, with daily trading volume consistently above $1 billion — a sign of strong activity and liquidity. Speaking at the Devconnect conference in 2025, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin warned that quantum breakthroughs could threaten blockchain cryptography as soon as 2028. His push for quantum-resistant protocols has accelerated research and shifted capital toward future-proof projects, with Zcash emerging as the current market leader. Vitalik said quantum computers could crack Bitcoin’s keys by 2028. Some called it FUD but the threat is real.

This duality of leading narratives between privacy coins and quantum resistance could position ZEC for significant inflows. Zcash Price Prediction: Massive Run Incoming? While ZEC has seen a significant unwind over November, it could amount to a brief consolidation in a wider uptrend with the formation of a bullish pennant pattern. The pattern currently faces a key test as its lower boundary is retested alongside supportive momentum indicators. ZEC / USDT 1-day chart, bullish pennant pattern. Source: TradingView . The RSI teeters on a cross above the 50 neutral line with several retests while the MACD closes in on a golden cross. Both show brewing buy pressure and the potential for a fresh uptrend. The key threshold for a confirmed breakout is all-time highs around $760. Flipping this level to support would confirm the push into new price discovery. Fully realised, the pennant pattern eyes a measured 265% move to $1,750. However, as the bull market matures and the privacy coin and quantum resistance narrative grow in relevance, a 950% push to the $5,000 milestone could in focus.

The decision comes after failed negotiations with local authorities over electricity rates, forcing the crypto giant to abandon what was once a promising $500 million investment. This dramatic exit highlights the critical challenges facing cryptocurrency mining operations worldwide. Why Did Tether Uruguay Mining Operations Face Such Rapid Collapse? The core issue revolves around electricity costs, which have become increasingly problematic for cryptocurrency mining operations globally. Tether had initially planned substantial investments in Uruguay, attracted by the country’s renewable energy potential. However, negotiations with local authorities reached an impasse over power pricing, making the operations economically unviable. According to reports, the company is now laying off most of its local staff and completely withdrawing from the country. This represents a significant setback for both Tether’s expansion plans and Uruguay’s ambitions to become a cryptocurrency mining hub. What Challenges Do Crypto Mining Operations Face? Cryptocurrency mining operations confront several critical challenges that can make or break their success: Electricity costs – The single largest operational expense Regulatory uncertainty – Changing government policies Infrastructure requirements – Reliable power and cooling systems Community relations – Local acceptance and support The Tether Uruguay mining situation perfectly illustrates how these factors can combine to derail even well-funded projects. When electricity costs become prohibitive, the entire business model collapses. How Does This Impact the Broader Cryptocurrency Industry? Tether’s withdrawal from Uruguay sends a clear message to the cryptocurrency sector. Mining operations must carefully evaluate their energy dependencies and regulatory environments. The failed Tether Uruguay mining venture demonstrates that even countries with attractive renewable energy resources can present unexpected challenges. Moreover, this development may cause other cryptocurrency companies to reconsider their expansion plans in similar markets. The incident underscores the importance of stable regulatory frameworks and predictable energy pricing for sustainable cryptocurrency mining operations. What Can We Learn From Tether’s Experience? The collapse of the Tether Uruguay mining project offers valuable lessons for the entire industry. First, comprehensive due diligence is essential before committing to large-scale investments. Second, long-term energy contracts with predictable pricing are crucial for operational stability. Finally, maintaining positive relationships with local authorities and communities can prevent sudden operational disruptions. These insights are particularly relevant as the cryptocurrency mining industry continues to evolve and seek sustainable operating models in an increasingly competitive landscape. Conclusion: The Future of Cryptocurrency Mining Tether’s abrupt exit from Uruguay serves as a cautionary tale for cryptocurrency mining operations worldwide. While the promise of renewable energy and favorable conditions initially attracted significant investment, the reality of operational costs and regulatory challenges proved overwhelming. The Tether Uruguay mining shutdown reminds us that sustainable cryptocurrency operations require more than just technical capability – they demand stable economic partnerships and predictable regulatory environments. As the industry matures, we can expect more careful evaluation of potential mining locations and greater emphasis on long-term sustainability rather than short-term opportunities. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Tether choose Uruguay for mining operations initially? Tether selected Uruguay due to its abundant renewable energy resources and initially favorable regulatory environment, making it attractive for energy-intensive cryptocurrency mining. How many jobs were affected by the shutdown? While exact numbers aren’t specified, reports indicate Tether is laying off “most of its local staff” in Uruguay as part of the complete operational withdrawal. Could Tether return to Uruguay if conditions improve? While theoretically possible, the complete withdrawal of operations and staff suggests Tether has moved on to other opportunities, making a return unlikely in the near future. How does this affect Tether’s other business operations? The Uruguay mining shutdown primarily impacts Tether’s mining expansion plans but doesn’t directly affect their stablecoin operations, which remain their core business. Are other cryptocurrency mining companies facing similar challenges? Yes, many mining operations globally are grappling with rising energy costs and regulatory uncertainties, though the specific challenges vary by region. What alternatives does Tether have for mining operations? Tether can explore other countries with stable energy pricing, favorable regulations, and reliable infrastructure for future mining ventures.

XRP Price Prediction: XRP Invalidates Bearish Structure After Climbing Above $2.18 XRP jumped from a key level of resistance at $1.90 in the past few days and has now fully invalidated the bearish structure after pushing past the previous daily low. Source: TradingView Momentum is starting to shift in favor of XRP, with fresh technical signals suggesting a potential reversal. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has just moved above the 14-day moving average, often seen as a classic buy signal that hints at growing strength.

Circle, the issuer of USDC, also made notable progress with nearly a 10% jump in early trading. Strategy, backed by Michael Saylor, alongside Coinbase, logged more modest increases but still participated in the broader market move. Bitcoin itself added around 7% over the past week after briefly dipping to roughly $82,000 on Nov. 21. Interest-Rate Commentary Drives Market Volatility The rapid swings in prediction-market pricing throughout November have largely been tied to comments from Federal Reserve officials. On Oct. 29, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that a December rate cut was “not a foregone conclusion,” which investors interpreted as a hawkish signal. That single remark led to prediction-market odds collapsing from 89% the previous day to around 22% by Nov. 20. The sentiment reversal began on Nov. 17 after Fed Governor Christopher Waller indicated the central bank should actively consider a rate cut next month. He argued that “the labor market is still weak and near stall speed” and that inflation appeared “relatively close” to the Fed’s 2% target. The remarks immediately reshaped expectations and helped drive the latest price rally in crypto-linked assets. Prediction Markets Gain Influence Across Industries Prediction markets have expanded significantly this year as more companies and investors embrace the model. Platforms such as Polymarket and Kalshi have attracted users by allowing wagers on political developments, financial outcomes and major global events. Polymarket recently secured a multi-year partnership to act as the official prediction-market platform for both the UFC and Zuffa Boxing. The company has also grown through other strategic partnerships that broaden the use of prediction contracts across entertainment and sports. Meanwhile, Kalshi has continued its own expansion after attracting major investment rounds that substantially increased its valuation. Both platforms have reported surging user activity as traders increasingly use prediction markets to anticipate economic decisions, including those from the Federal Reserve. Trading Apps Join the Prediction-Market Trend The rapid rise of prediction markets has also caught the attention of larger trading platforms. Robinhood recently confirmed that prediction markets have become one of its fastest-growing revenue categories. The platform said that more than one million users have already traded billions of contracts since the feature launched earlier this year. Rumors have also circulated that Coinbase is developing a prediction-market platform of its own, following the appearance of early interface images. The acceleration of these platforms underscores a broader trend: traders across traditional and crypto markets are relying more heavily on probabilistic pricing tools to interpret and react to policy shifts. As expectations for a December rate cut climb, crypto-linked stocks appear positioned to remain sensitive to any new signals from the Federal Reserve.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-11-28 23:48:14

While most companies would jump at million-dollar contracts, this open source database platform built something far more valuable – a movement. How did Supabase achieve this remarkable valuation? The Supabase valuation journey is nothing short of extraordinary. From $2 billion to $5 billion in just months, the platform’s growth defies conventional startup wisdom. Their secret? Building an open source database ecosystem that developers genuinely love, rather than chasing immediate revenue. The power of open source database strategy Supabase understood something fundamental about modern software development. By focusing on creating the best possible open source database experience, they attracted a massive community of developers who became their biggest advocates. Community-driven development approach Transparent product roadmap Developer-first design philosophy Consistent product improvements Startup growth through strategic rejection Most startups would consider turning down million-dollar contracts as financial suicide. For Supabase, it was strategic genius. They prioritized long-term startup growth over short-term gains, understanding that not all revenue is created equal. Contract Type Short-term Benefit Long-term Cost Enterprise Customization Immediate revenue Product complexity Exclusive Partnerships Guaranteed income Limited market access Custom Features Client retention Development distraction Building backend infrastructure that developers trust The backend infrastructure market is crowded, but Supabase found their niche by focusing on what developers actually need. Their approach to creating reliable, scalable backend infrastructure won them the trust of the developer community. Venture capital funding with a vision The recent $100 million venture capital funding round at a $5 billion valuation wasn’t just about the money. It was validation of their unique approach to building a sustainable business around open source technology. FAQs About Supabase’s Growth Strategy What makes Supabase different from other database platforms? Supabase combines the power of PostgreSQL with real-time capabilities and an intuitive interface, creating a unique open source database experience. How did venture capital funding contribute to their growth? The venture capital funding allowed Supabase to scale their team, improve their infrastructure, and accelerate product development without compromising their open source principles. What challenges did Supabase face in their startup growth journey? Balancing community needs with enterprise requirements, maintaining open source values while building a sustainable business, and competing against well-funded competitors were significant challenges. Why is backend infrastructure becoming so valuable? As more applications move to the cloud and require real-time capabilities, reliable backend infrastructure becomes critical for business success and scalability. How can other startups learn from Supabase’s valuation strategy? Focus on building genuine value for your community, prioritize long-term vision over short-term revenue, and don’t be afraid to say no to opportunities that don’t align with your core mission. Supabase’s journey to a $5 billion valuation teaches us that sometimes the most powerful business strategy involves strategic rejection. By saying no to million-dollar contracts that didn’t align with their vision, they built something far more valuable – a platform that developers genuinely love and trust. Their success proves that in the world of technology, community and vision can be worth more than immediate revenue.

Dogecoin Price Prediction: Can DOGE Still Flip Bullish? With markets treating spot DOGE ETFs as a one-day headline, not a turning point, the bullish setup of a year-long descending triangle pattern remains on the fence. While the past week has seen a bounce from its lower support at $0.13, it has yet to be confirmed as a launchpad level with mixed momentum indicators. DOGE / USD 1-day chart, descending triangle. Source: TradingView . While a golden cross formed on the MACD points to a potential fresh uptrend, an RSI below the neutral 50 line suggests sellers still dominate shorter-term price action. TradFi did not deliver the momentum to flip the balance. While easing pressures favour progress to retest the $0.20 resistance , the failed catalyst keeps lower lows at $0.08 in the cards. If a higher and stronger footing is found above $0.20, a breakout push could be in play. A clean triangle breakout sets up a measured move of roughly 220% to past highs around $0.50, and a fully realised target of $1 for a potoentail 530% gain. Though this target likely hinges on greater TradFi market participation and potential inclusion on mainstream balance sheets. Pepe Node: Don’t Worry About Buying The Dip Hesitancy among TradFi markets makes one thing clear: under current market conditions, entering at a good position can be a challenge, especially for more volatile tokens like DOGE. PepeNode ($PEPENODE) helps with a low-risk way to capitalise on upside without needing to time the market, the pitfall of most meme coin investors. It’s a simple mine-to-earn (M2E) game. No hardware needed. Just log in, acquire virtual nodes, stack rigs, and configure your setup to start earning passive rewards that diversify across top-performing meme coins. The method is already gaining traction. The presale has already passed $2.2 million, while early stakers can still earn up to 583% APY. And thanks to a built-in deflationary model, where 70% of all $PEPENODE spent on nodes and rigs is burned, scarcity supports long-term token value. PepeNode stands out as a smarter way to capture some of the market’s strongest upside—without worrying about timing the perfect entry.

The analysis, released on November 27, highlights a repeatable pattern framework—historically signaling the transition from quiet consolidation to aggressive price expansion. With multiple indicators aligning, XRP is once again approaching a potential breakout window that traders remember well. XRP Price Structure Echoes The 2024 Breakout Setup The analysis shared by “guyonearth” on X argues that XRP is rebuilding the same technical foundation that preceded its major 2024 breakout. In that earlier cycle, the asset spent months tightening within a defined structure before unleashing a vertical rally. The analyst notes that the current configuration follows the same blueprint, with the cryptocurrency once again entering a compressed phase that often precedes high-momentum expansion. The latest chart shows XRP trading inside a descending channel and recently rebounding from the lower boundary—an early signal that momentum may be shifting. The next critical objective is the channel’s upper boundary near $2.40, identified as the confirmation level for renewed upside. A move into this zone would indicate strengthening buyer control and open the door for broader trend acceleration. Central to this setup is the $1.90–$2.00 support corridor, which continues to operate as XRP’s structural floor. The asset has repeatedly reversed from this band, reinforcing it as the market’s preferred pivot. Maintaining this range is essential for preserving the bullish setup , as losing it would disrupt the pattern and undermine continuation prospects. Momentum indicators align with the broader narrative. The RSI is forming higher lows beneath a descending resistance line, suggesting that accumulation is quietly rebuilding. Viewed together, these elements form a unified narrative: XRP is recreating the combination of support integrity, structural tightening, and momentum rebuilding that historically led to a dramatic upward move. The analyst’s standpoint is that, if these components continue to hold, the altcoin may once again be positioning itself for a breakout that mirrors its 2024 trajectory. Bitcoin Dominance Unlocks A Favorable Window Broader market conditions add a supportive backdrop for XRP’s projected rally. The analyst notes that Bitcoin Dominance remains high and stable, as long as it stays above 57.5%. A drop below that level typically triggers stronger capital rotation into altcoins. He expects dominance to eventually fall toward 43%, a shift that would mark a major redistribution of market share. That projected decline forms the window in which the altcoin could gain momentum, provided it continues to hold the $1.90–$2.00 support zone. If Bitcoin dominance rolls over while XRP maintains structural strength, liquidity could tilt sharply toward altcoins. With a clear technical pattern and a short-term target near $2.40, the analyst positions XRP as well-placed to benefit from that rotation.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-29 00:00:07

Bitcoin Has Faced Loss Selling From The Newbie Whales In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the latest trend in the profit/loss realization behavior of the Bitcoin whales. “Whales” broadly refer to the BTC investors that hold at least 1,000 tokens in their balance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Puell Multiple Plunges, But Not Inside Bottom Zone Yet At the current exchange rate, the cutoff for the cohort is equivalent to $91.6 million, which is quite significant. As such, this group represents the big-money hands of the market, who can carry some degree of influence. Whales can be divided into two subgroups based on holding time. Investors of this size who purchased their coins within the past 155 days are known as the short-term holder (STH) or New Whales. Similarly, whales with a longer holding time are called the long-term holder (LTH) or Old Whales. Now, here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the net amount of profit/loss that these Bitcoin whale groups have been realizing through their selling over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin New Whales have shown some loss realization spikes recently. This underwater selling from the cohort has come as the cryptocurrency’s price has gone through a decline. The New Whales include the inexperienced hands of the market who tend to easily panic in the face of volatility. It would appear that this quality of the group has held through the latest crash as well. The Old Whales, on the other hand, are considered to represent the resolute side of the network. From the chart, it’s visible that there has been some loss selling from these large dormant entities recently, but its scale has been small compared to the New Whale capitulation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Be At Risk Of A Deeper Bear If This Ratio Compresses, Says Glassnode The fact that the presence of the Old Whales has been relatively muted through the bearish shift, as well as the rebound that has followed, could be a signal worth keeping an eye on. Speaking of the recovery, the Bitcoin rally has meant that its price has climbed back above a major on-chain cost basis level. As analyst Ali Martinez has shared in an X post, the Bitcoin UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) suggests a strong amount of buying last occurred at $84,500. In on-chain analysis, strong demand zones below the spot price are considered points of potential support for Bitcoin. Similarly, levels above are assumed to be sources of resistance instead. One such major level is present at $112,300. BTC Price Bitcoin’s recovery has furthered during the past day as its price has returned to $92,300.

55070240,https://timestabloid.com/?p=90913,1764374449,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Reveals Only Way To Slow Down XRP ETF,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-reveals-only-way-to-slow-down-xrp-etf/,"A prominent member of the XRP community has outlined why he expects newly launched XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to source their tokens directly from the open market rather than from Ripple’s escrow supply. His view is rooted in the belief that these funds will need to buy significant volumes of XRP to meet demand, which could increase market pressure and eventually drive prices higher. Strong Debut For XRP ETFs The arrival of XRP-based ETFs has already generated substantial interest. The first product, Canary Capital’s XRPC, was launched on Nov. 13 and recorded approximately $245 million in initial inflows. Additional ETFs from Bitwise, Grayscale , and Franklin Templeton have since entered the market. Data from Sosovalue indicates that the four active XRP ETFs have accumulated a combined net inflow of about $643.92 million over the last two weeks. The most recent daily figure, recorded on Nov. 26, showed another $21.81 million entering the products. Despite this activity, XRP’s market performance has not risen as sharply as some investors anticipated. Following a 13% intraday increase between Nov. 23 and 24, the asset has faced resistance around the $2.2 range and has remained in a narrow band for several days. At $2.25, XRP is still down 13% for the month. Even so, some analysts believe that sustained ETF demand could eventually influence price direction. In the first year, the XRP ETF funds will be relentlessly aggressive. There is only ONE way to slow them down… The price HAS to go up. There is no plan B. — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) November 27, 2025 Analyst Predicts Aggressive Accumulation Among the most vocal supporters of this outlook is Chad Steingraber, a game developer and long-time XRP commentator. He has repeatedly maintained that the ETFs will attempt to acquire large quantities of XRP during their initial year of operation. Steingraber argues that the scale of demand these funds are likely to face will require fast and consistent purchasing activity. He estimates that if XRP remains near $2.2, every additional $1 billion flowing into ETFs could represent more than 450 million tokens purchased from the open market. If the price were to climb to $6, the same inflow would secure far fewer tokens, roughly 166 million. In his view, the market can only accommodate this level of accumulation if XRP rises considerably. He has stated that there is no alternative scenario in which the ETFs can meet demand without upward price movement. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He compares this potential trajectory to the behavior of Bitcoin ETFs in 2024, which saw inflows in ten out of twelve months and accumulated over $35 billion worth of BTC during that period, contributing to price appreciation. Why Steingraber Rejects Escrow Purchases Some observers suggest that ETFs could choose to purchase XRP directly from Ripple’s escrow instead of the open market, which would reduce the immediate impact on price. Steingraber disagrees. He notes that authorized participants (APs) responsible for acquiring tokens for ETF creation are required to secure the underlying assets shortly after receiving new inflows. This process typically occurs within two days, giving APs limited flexibility. Because XRP from Ripple’s escrow is released on a predetermined monthly schedule, APs would not reliably have access to additional supply at the exact time it is needed. Steingraber further argues that for ETFs to depend on escrow , Ripple would need to make its entire monthly 1 billion XRP allotment available through Ripple Prime, even if the tokens were not immediately required. He maintains that it would not be in Ripple’s economic interest to release large volumes at a relatively low price, as doing so would reduce the potential value of its holdings in the future.

This crucial indicator provides valuable insights into investor psychology and market direction. Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index helps traders navigate volatile conditions and make informed decisions. What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Shift Mean for Investors? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has moved from ‘Extreme Fear’ to ‘Fear’ category, climbing three points to reach 28. This measurement scale ranges from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed), offering a snapshot of market emotions. The index’s movement suggests changing investor sentiment that could influence trading patterns and price action across major cryptocurrencies. According to data provider Alternative.me, this marks the first time the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has entered the Fear zone since mid-November. This transition indicates that while market anxiety persists, extreme panic has subsided. Investors should monitor these sentiment shifts closely as they often precede significant price movements. How Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index uses multiple data sources to create a comprehensive market sentiment picture. The calculation methodology includes: Volatility (25%) – Measures price fluctuations and market stability Market Volume (25%) – Tracks trading activity and investor participation Social Media (15%) – Analyzes cryptocurrency discussions and sentiment online Surveys (15%) – Gathers direct investor opinions and expectations Bitcoin Dominance (10%) – Monitors Bitcoin’s market share relative to altcoins Search Trends (10%) – Measures public interest through Google search volume This multi-factor approach ensures the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reflects genuine market conditions rather than temporary fluctuations. Each component contributes to a balanced assessment of investor psychology. Why Should You Care About Market Sentiment Indicators? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a valuable contrarian indicator for savvy investors. Historically, extreme fear levels often present buying opportunities, while extreme greed may signal potential market tops. The current reading of 28 suggests cautious optimism might be warranted, though careful risk management remains essential. Many successful traders use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to time their entry and exit points. When fear dominates the market, prices often drop below fundamental values. Conversely, excessive greed can lead to overvaluation and subsequent corrections. Understanding these patterns helps investors avoid emotional decision-making. What Actionable Insights Can You Derive From This Shift? The movement in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index from Extreme Fear to Fear suggests several potential strategies: Dollar-cost averaging – Consider gradual position building during fear periods Portfolio rebalancing – Adjust allocations based on changing risk appetite Risk assessment – Evaluate your tolerance for potential volatility Market research – Use sentiment data to complement technical and fundamental analysis Remember that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index represents one tool among many. Combine it with other analysis methods for comprehensive market understanding. The index’s current reading indicates markets are transitioning from panic to cautious assessment. Final Thoughts: Navigating Market Sentiment Shifts The Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides crucial insights into market psychology that technical analysis alone cannot capture. The shift to Fear territory marks an important transition that investors should monitor closely. While sentiment indicators don’t guarantee future performance, they offer valuable context for decision-making. Successful cryptocurrency investing requires balancing multiple data sources. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as your emotional compass in turbulent markets. Use it to maintain perspective when others succumb to fear or greed extremes. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index measures market sentiment on a scale from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed) using multiple data sources including volatility, volume, and social media sentiment. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index updates daily, providing current market sentiment readings that help investors gauge prevailing market psychology. What does a Fear reading indicate? A Fear reading suggests investors are cautious and potentially pessimistic about short-term price movements, which sometimes presents buying opportunities for long-term investors. Can the Crypto Fear & Greed Index predict price movements? While not a perfect predictor, extreme readings often coincide with market reversals, making it a valuable contrarian indicator when used with other analysis tools. How reliable is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index provides reliable sentiment data when understood as one component of comprehensive market analysis rather than a standalone trading signal.

Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $4.05 Market Cap $2.18B Trading Volume $100.16M Circulating Supply 541.08M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.86 (Sep 2023) 24-h High $4.13 24-h Low $3.99 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 28.67% (Extremely High) 14-Day RSI 42.79 (Neutral) 50-Day SMA $4.40 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 25 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 13/30 (43 %) 200-Day SMA $5.14 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP is consolidating tightly above $4.00, with indicators showing bearish momentum slowly losing strength. Buyers remain most active between $3.85 and $4.00. A break above the $4.08 – $4.20 range could finally trigger a bullish shift. ICP 1-day price analysis On the 1-day chart for November 28, ICP sits at $4.043, holding a shallow consolidation after days of decline. The Bollinger Bands are flattening, showing reduced volatility and signaling that the downtrend may be losing momentum. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The RSI at 42 suggests the market is still weak but no longer oversold, while the MACD histogram is slowly easing from deep negative levels, hinting at early stabilization. The key level is $4.00, which has been defended several times. A move above $4.20 would be the first sign of strength, while losing $4.00 could drag ICP back toward $3.70. ICP 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour timeframe, ICP is drifting sideways around $4.043. The Alligator lines are still slightly bearish but are flattening, which often happens before a trend shift. The MACD is near neutral but still negative, confirming the lack of clear direction. ICP continues to trade between the $4.00 and $4.05 range. A break above $4.08 opens room toward $4.12–$4.15, while slipping under $4.00 could result in a price drop to $3.88.

The Altcoin Season Index serves as a vital thermometer for cryptocurrency market sentiment. This important indicator measures whether 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days.

Currently, the Altcoin Season Index sitting at 21 tells us that Bitcoin continues to outperform most other digital assets. This measurement excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens, giving us a pure view of market performance dynamics. Understanding this Altcoin Season Index reading helps investors make informed decisions about their portfolio allocations. Why Does the Current Altcoin Season Index Matter? The persistent low reading on the Altcoin Season Index indicates several key market conditions: Bitcoin dominance remains strong in current market conditions Investor caution is driving capital toward established assets Market cycles are still in early stages of potential rotation Risk appetite among crypto investors remains measured This Altcoin Season Index reading suggests that while some altcoins may show individual strength, the broader market hasn’t entered a true altcoin season. However, watching changes in this Altcoin Season Index can provide early signals of shifting market trends. How Can Investors Use the Altcoin Season Index? Smart cryptocurrency investors monitor the Altcoin Season Index for strategic planning. When the index begins climbing significantly above current levels, it often signals growing investor confidence in alternative cryptocurrencies.

Historical patterns suggest the Altcoin Season Index typically gains momentum during specific market conditions. Increased institutional adoption, technological breakthroughs, or Bitcoin consolidation phases often precede rises in the Altcoin Season Index. The current reading provides a baseline from which to measure future market movements. Remember that the Altcoin Season Index represents a 90-day performance window, making it a reliable medium-term indicator rather than a short-term trading signal. The consistency at 21 suggests stable market conditions rather than rapid changes. Key Takeaways from the Current Altcoin Season Index Reading The Altcoin Season Index holding at 21 delivers a clear message about current cryptocurrency market dynamics. Bitcoin continues to lead market performance while altcoins await their moment. This doesn’t mean altcoin opportunities don’t exist – rather that selective investing approaches work best in current conditions.

55072251,636022,1764378023,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55072251.jpeg,"Bitmine Resumes Ethereum Accumulation: 14,618 ETH Bought in Latest Move",https://bitcoinist.com/bitmine-resumes-ethereum-accumulation-14618-bought/,"Ethereum has reclaimed the $3,000 level after weeks of heavy selling pressure, yet the recovery remains fragile as momentum continues to fade. The market is still dominated by fear, and confidence among retail traders has weakened significantly. Analysts warn that bulls are losing control of the trend, and some are beginning to call for the early stages of a potential bear market. With Ethereum trading nearly 40% below its August all-time high, every move upward is being met with hesitation, and the broader market environment has yet to stabilize. Despite this uncertainty, large players continue to accumulate ETH, offering a contrasting signal to the prevailing bearish sentiment. According to new data from Lookonchain, Bitmine has been consistently buying Ethereum during this downturn, showing no signs of slowing its accumulation strategy. This persistent interest from large holders suggests that institutional and high-net-worth buyers may still see long-term value at current levels, even as short-term traders remain cautious. Bitmine Deepens Accumulation as Ethereum Struggles for Momentum Lookonchain reports that Bitmine has continued its aggressive accumulation strategy, purchasing another 14,618 ETH—worth roughly $44.34 million—a few hours ago. This new acquisition further strengthens Bitmine’s already massive Ethereum position, which now totals 3.436 million ETH. At current prices, their holdings are valued at approximately $10.39 billion, underscoring their long-term conviction despite the ongoing market turbulence. This level of accumulation from a major player stands in sharp contrast to the broader sentiment across the market, where uncertainty and fear persist. Retail investors remain cautious, and many analysts argue that Ethereum’s failure to reclaim momentum above $3,000 signals a weakening trend. However, Bitmine’s continued purchases suggest a fundamentally different outlook—one rooted in long-term valuation rather than short-term volatility. Large, disciplined buyers often accumulate in periods of market weakness, viewing discounted prices as strategic entry points. Bitmine’s behavior mirrors this pattern and could indicate expectations of higher prices in the months ahead. Still, for Ethereum to benefit from this institutional confidence, it must stabilize and build a stronger support base. The coming weeks will reveal whether this sustained whale demand will outweigh broader selling pressure and help ETH break out of its current downtrend. ETH Attempts Recovery but Faces Strong Resistance Ethereum is attempting to recover after weeks of sustained selling pressure, reclaiming the $3,000 level but still struggling to build meaningful momentum. The chart shows ETH bouncing from the recent low near the mid-$2,600s, where a cluster of demand emerged and halted the sharp decline. However, despite this rebound, Ethereum remains below all three major moving averages—the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day—which now act as layered resistance zones. The 50-day SMA is trending downward and has already crossed below the 100-day SMA, signaling a weakening market structure. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA sits slightly above current prices, reinforcing the idea that ETH is still in a vulnerable position. Price action remains choppy, with lower highs forming consistently since the peak in early October, reflecting persistent bearish control. Volume patterns also confirm this cautionary picture. While the recent bounce came with a modest increase in buying activity, it is still far weaker than the selling volume observed during the November capitulation. For a meaningful trend reversal, ETH must break above the $3,300–$3,400 region, reclaim its moving averages, and establish a higher low.

Despite this rebound, fear and uncertainty continue to dominate sentiment, especially following what analysts describe as the largest short-term holder capitulation in Bitcoin’s history. Related Reading: XRP Reserves On Binance Collapse To Record Lows: Investors Move Toward Long-Term Holding This wave of realized losses—fast, aggressive, and record-breaking—has left many investors questioning whether the recent recovery is sustainable or simply a temporary bounce in a broader downtrend. According to new data from Glassnode, the path ahead remains challenging. Analysts explain that Bitcoin must break above the major supply clusters created by top buyers earlier in the cycle if it is to regain meaningful upward momentum. These clusters represent areas where a large number of investors previously bought at higher prices and may now look to exit at breakeven, increasing the likelihood of heavy sell-side pressure as BTC climbs. Bitcoin Faces Critical Supply Barriers Glassnode reports that Bitcoin is now approaching two major supply clusters that will play a decisive role in determining whether the recent rebound can evolve into a sustained recovery. The first cluster sits between $93,000 and $96,000, while the second—much larger and more structurally important—spans $100,000 to $108,000. These zones were formed by heavy buying activity earlier in the cycle and represent areas where many investors are currently underwater or sitting near breakeven. Because of this, Glassnode notes that these ranges typically act as strong resistance, as recent buyers who endured the latest drawdown may choose to sell once the price returns to their entry levels. This dynamic can create temporary supply walls, slowing down momentum even in moments of aggressive recovery. Bitcoin’s ability to break through these clusters will determine whether it can re-establish a path toward a new all-time high or remain trapped under heavy distribution pressure. The market is now entering a critical phase, with traders closely watching how BTC behaves as it approaches these levels. A clean breakout would signal renewed confidence, while rejection could signal that the broader corrective structure is not yet over. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Still Negative: US Institutions Keep Selling Despite Easing Pressure Testing Support After a Sharp Multi-Week Selloff Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows a market attempting to stabilize after one of the most aggressive drawdowns of the cycle. BTC has rebounded to the $91,500 area following a deep wick to the $80K region last week, signaling that buyers are finally stepping in at key support. This rebound coincides with a strong weekly candle showing a long lower shadow, a classic sign of demand absorption during heavy selloffs. However, despite this bounce, the broader structure remains fragile. The price is trading below the 50-week moving average, a level that previously acted as reliable support throughout the bull phase. Losing this dynamic support earlier in the month was a significant technical break, and BTC is now attempting to reclaim it from below—typically a challenging move that often acts as resistance. Related Reading: Ethereum ICO Whale Sells 20,000 ETH ($58M), Raising Questions Over Market Timing The 100-week moving average around the mid-$80K region has proven critical, halting the decline and serving as the primary area where buyers defended the trend. As long as BTC holds above this zone, the broader market avoids confirming a deeper macro reversal. Volume remains elevated, reflecting capitulation-level activity, and the market is now in a decisive phase. A sustained close above $92K–$94K would strengthen recovery prospects, while rejection would risk another retest of the $80K support.
