Stellar’s steady rise, XRP’s ETF-driven momentum, and Web3Bay’s game-changing approach to e-commerce are making waves across the market. These projects highlight the diverse applications of blockchain, from payments to retail innovation. While Stellar and XRP offer exciting updates in payments and finance, Web3Bay (3BAY) stands out for its innovative take on blockchain-driven e-commerce. Here’s a closer look at how these three projects are shaping the future of crypto. Reshaping Online Marketplaces: Web3Bay’s User-Centric Vision Web3Bay isn’t just another e-commerce project—it’s a revolutionary platform redefining how online shopping works. By combining blockchain technology with user-centric features, Web3Bay eliminates intermediaries, reduces fees, and ensures data security. Its decentralized approach puts control directly into the hands of users, making it a standout in the $6.7 trillion e-commerce industry. The platform’s presale numbers are impressive, with $870,000 raised and 222 million tokens sold so far. Currently, in Stage 4, 3BAY tokens are priced at $0.004562625, with early investors anticipating a massive 6,430% ROI at launch. The structure of Web3Bay’s presale reflects its commitment to inclusivity, starting at just $0.003 per token and increasing by 15% with each stage. What truly sets Web3Bay apart is its community-driven governance. Token holders have voting rights, allowing them to influence platform updates and policies. This collaborative approach fosters trust and ensures that the marketplace evolves to meet the needs of its users. By integrating payment methods like PayPal with blockchain technology, Web3Bay bridges the gap between traditional e-commerce and crypto, making it accessible to a wider audience. Web3Bay’s innovative blend of technology and community involvement positions it as a leader in the e-commerce space. It’s more than just a platform—it’s a movement toward ethical, transparent, and user-focused commerce. Low Fees, High Impact: Stellar’s Appeal to Institutions Stellar continues to gain traction as a strong contender in cross-border payments. Currently trading at $0.4854 with a market cap of $14.89 billion, Stellar’s blockchain is proving to be a practical solution for fast and low-cost transactions. Key partnerships, such as its collaboration with MoneyGram, highlight its relevance in real-world applications. Analysts are optimistic about Stellar’s future, citing increased Total Value Locked (TVL) and growing interest in its payment solutions. As its ecosystem expands, Stellar remains a solid choice for investors seeking long-term growth in a competitive market. XRP’s Road to $7: Are ETF Listings the Game-Changer? XRP is making headlines with its recent price peak of $3.20 and growing anticipation for XRP ETFs. This development is sparking institutional interest and opening doors to broader adoption. Regulatory clarity following the SEC case resolution has bolstered confidence in XRP as a top cryptocurrency for 2025. Experts predict XRP’s price could climb to $5–$7, with potential for even greater gains depending on market conditions. Its efficient cross-border payment system and expanding use cases position XRP as a major player in blockchain finance. For investors looking for a mix of stability and growth potential, XRP remains an appealing option. Final Thoughts Stellar and XRP offer exciting prospects in payments and finance, but Web3Bay brings something truly unique to the table. By focusing on transparency, fairness, and user empowerment, Web3Bay is revolutionizing e-commerce in a way that hasn’t been seen before. Its presale success, with significant ROI potential, reflects the market’s confidence in its vision. For those seeking innovative projects that combine purpose with profitability, Web3Bay is setting a new standard. As it continues to gain momentum, this groundbreaking platform is poised to lead the next wave of blockchain innovation in e-commerce.

XRP has emerged as the most actively traded asset on Coinbase, propelled by Ripple’s efforts in enhancing cross-border payments and expectations for a spot XRP ETF approval. Concurrently, Solana’s price has seen a significant surge, rising over 11% in 24 hours to $239.77, nearing its highest ever price of $263.83. Continued progress in scalability and performance ensures Solana remains a focal point of attention. BlockDAG is capturing interest with its advanced hybrid DAG/PoW architecture. Its presale has impressively accumulated $183.5 million, rewarding early participants with returns of 2,380%. The LAUNCH300 offer, which triples the holdings, showcases its capability for quick and efficient transactions, positioning BlockDAG (BDAG) as a prime candidate for those looking toward the future of cryptocurrency. XRP Takes the Lead on Coinbase! XRP has ascended to become the most traded asset on Coinbase, overtaking Bitcoin, and illustrating its increased popularity, supported by Ripple’s blockchain network aimed at cross-border transactions. The potential for a U.S. approved spot XRP ETF has also intensified interest in the asset. A recent meeting between Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and President-elect Donald Trump has sparked a wave of optimism for beneficial regulatory changes, possibly including the appointment of crypto advocate Paul Atkins as SEC Chair. Ripple’s efforts, such as integrating stablecoins and expanding in the U.S. market, are designed to boost XRP’s usability and value. With XRP/USD trades making up 25% of Coinbase’s volume and increasing confidence in the market, the outlook for XRP’s long-term value is promising. Significant Rise in Solana Price – Spotlight on Future Potential Solana has experienced an impressive 11% increase in just 24 hours, reaching $239.77 and almost hitting its peak of $263.83 set in November 2024. This recent surge, supported by a 104% jump in trading volume, reflects strong market confidence. While there’s cautious optimism about maintaining the momentum, Solana’s efforts to overcome scalability issues are likely to boost its adoption and functionality as the network grows, highlighting its long-term potential in the transforming digital domain. BlockDAG’s Presale Success: Unlock Triple Returns Now Have you ever wished you were part of Bitcoin’s early success or Ethereum’s rapid ascent? BlockDAG offers a new opportunity. It has raised over $183.5 million and sold more than 18 billion coins during its presale, drawing widespread attention. Priced at $0.0248 in the 27th batch out of 45, early participants have realized gains of 2,380%. The LAUNCH300 bonus further enhances this by tripling the holdings of its supporters instantly, presenting a fleeting chance as time is limited. BlockDAG distinguishes itself with a unique hybrid DAG/PoW architecture that addresses the critical shortcomings of traditional blockchains. By emphasizing scalability and transaction efficiency, BlockDAG ensures quicker, more reliable operations that meet the increasing needs of decentralized systems. These technological advances position BlockDAG as a frontrunner in delivering practical, real-world solutions. For those ready to embrace a significant crypto opportunity, BlockDAG combines groundbreaking technology with attractive presale perks. Act swiftly—this moment could lead to substantial benefits in the swiftly shifting digital economy. Wrapping Up Cryptocurrency Trends XRP, Solana, and BlockDAG are making significant strides in the cryptocurrency market, each offering unique opportunities for growth. XRP has risen to become the most actively traded asset on Coinbase, propelled by Ripple’s initiatives aimed at improving cross-border payments and fueled by speculation surrounding a forthcoming spot XRP ETF. These developments have reinforced its status as a stable digital asset. Meanwhile, Solana’s price has shown remarkable growth, surging over 11% in just 24 hours and approaching its all-time high. Ongoing improvements in its transaction processing capabilities affirm Solana’s role as a significant contender in the digital asset arena. Additionally, BlockDAG has demonstrated notable crypto presale success, raising $183.5 million. Its modern hybrid DAG/PoW framework ensures efficient transaction processing, and the LAUNCH300 bonus, which triples holdings, presents an enticing opportunity for those keen to explore new crypto possibilities.

With Arctic Pablo embarking on a daring presale adventure and Dogwifhat dominating the Solana ecosystem, there’s no shortage of exciting options for investors looking for the best meme coin to buy today . Adding to the mix, AI Companions is redefining digital relationships with futuristic technology, creating a niche in the ever-expanding crypto market. Let’s dive into Arctic Pablo’s epic journey. This meme coin combines an adventurous narrative with innovative presale phases. Each phase ties to unique, hidden locations, blending myth and reality. It’s more than a coin—it’s an experience, and it’s capturing the imagination of investors worldwide. Arctic Pablo: The Adventurer of Meme Coins Arctic Pablo ($APC) isn’t your typical meme coin. It’s an exhilarating story of discovery and opportunity. Arctic Pablo, the character, takes investors on an epic journey to uncover Earth’s hidden mysteries. Each presale phase—or location—reveals new stories, engaging its community in an immersive experience. Current Location: Snowy Chores Arctic Pablo has traveled through four locations, including Metropolis, which sold out in just three days. Now in its fifth phase, Snowy Chores, the presale price is $0.000034. With over $320,000 raised so far, Arctic Pablo is proving to be a crowd favorite. And here’s the kicker: the final presale price is $0.0008, with a launch price of $0.008. That’s a staggering 23,441% ROI from the current price. Tokenomics That Work Arctic Pablo’s tokenomics ensure sustainability. The total supply is capped at 221.2 billion APC tokens, with 50% allocated for public presale. Weekly token burns during the presale and any unsold tokens post-presale increase scarcity, driving value. Investors can also enjoy 66% APY staking rewards, making this coin a win-win for both short-term and long-term holders. Why Arctic Pablo Stands Out Arctic Pablo’s appeal lies in its adventurous narrative and unique presale model. Unlike typical stages, Arctic Pablo “travels” to different locations, creating a sense of adventure and urgency. Early investors are not just buying a coin; they’re joining an epic journey where financial gains meet storytelling. Imagine investing $1 now. With $0.000034 per APC, you’d receive 38398.73 tokens. When the launch price hits $0.008, your investment skyrockets to $307.19. That’s not just ROI; that’s life-changing potential. Dogwifhat: Solana’s Meme Coin Powerhouse Dogwifhat ($WIF) has cemented its position as a leading meme coin within the Solana ecosystem. With a market capitalization of $1.41 billion and a circulating supply of nearly 999 million tokens, Dogwifhat is a force to be reckoned with. Impressive Market Stats Dogwifhat’s 24-hour trading volume of $249.93 million reflects strong market activity. While it’s currently 70.72% below its all-time high of $4.85, the token’s journey from an all-time low of $0.00002344 to today’s price showcases its explosive potential. That’s a gain of over 6 million percent, underscoring its appeal to investors seeking massive returns. Built on Solana Leveraging Solana’s fast and cost-efficient blockchain, Dogwifhat offers a seamless trading experience. Its 4.2-star rating on review platforms and 79% bullish community sentiment highlight its popularity. With robust adoption and active trading on platforms like DexScan, Dogwifhat remains a top contender for investors seeking the best meme coin to buy today. Why Choose Dogwifhat? Dogwifhat thrives on community strength and Solana’s ecosystem advantages. Its established market presence and consistent trading volume make it a safer bet for those wary of newer coins. If you’re looking for stability paired with meme coin excitement, Dogwifhat ticks all the boxes. AI Companions: Redefining Digital Relationships AI Companions ($AIC) brings something entirely new to the meme coin scene. Combining AI, VR, AR, and blockchain, this project offers customizable virtual companions tailored to individual preferences. It’s a futuristic concept that merges technology and cryptocurrency. Market Performance Currently priced at $0.1253, AIC has seen an 8.60% increase in the last 24 hours. With a market cap of $94 million and a circulating supply of 749.99 million tokens, it’s making waves in the crypto world. The token’s growth from an all-time low of $0.01749 to its current price highlights its strong upward trajectory, although it remains 40.47% below its all-time high of $0.2099. Innovative Ecosystem AI Companions’ platform is powered by the $AIC token, enabling in-platform purchases and subscriptions. Upcoming catalysts like Tier 1 exchange listings and a $250,000 buyback event make it a promising investment. With bullish sentiment and a growing holder base, AI Companions is positioned for significant growth in 2025. Why AI Companions Matters In a world increasingly driven by AI, $AIC stands out by offering something deeply personal. It’s not just about financial gains; it’s about redefining how we interact with technology. For those seeking innovation and utility in a meme coin, AI Companions is a top pick.

According to a new announcement, Coinbase is officially supporting Toshi ( TOSHI ) starting today. “Coinbase will add support for Toshi (TOSHI) on the Base network. Do not send this asset over other networks or your funds may be lost. Transfers for this asset are available on Coinbase and Coinbase Exchange in the regions where trading is supported.” Coinbase is adding support for TOSHI on Base, an Ethereum ( ETH ) layer-2 network incubated by the exchange. The announcement was made yesterday around 4 p.m. EST. Immediately following the announcement, TOSHI leaped from $0.00036803 to $0.00048477, an over 27% gain. However, the dog-themed memecoin has since crashed to lower levels than before the announcement, trading for $0.0003579 at time of writing, down 5.6% overall in the last 24 hours. TOSHI is just one of a multitude of memecoins that have exploded onto the scene in recent months. Though TOSHI is built on Base, many of the trending tokens have been supported through Solana ( SOL ), which is gaining a reputation as a memecoin trading network. According to Armstrong , the surge of interest in SOL-based memecoins lately has caused operational issues for some Coinbase users. “Team is working hard on scaling our Solana infrastructure now – lots of Solana activity last few days, we were not anticipating this level of surge.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

SAB 121 directed banks and other public companies that they had to mark any customers' crypto assets on their own balance sheets. SAB 122 ""rescinds the interpretive guidance"" and instead directs firms to use Financial Accounting Standards Board rules or International Accounting Standard provisions. ""The staff reminds entities that they should continue to consider existing requirements to provide disclosures that allow investors to understand an entity’s obligation to safeguard crypto-assets held for others,"" Thursday's notice said. The guidance it rescinds, SAB 121, was supported by former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who said it would protect investors in the event of bankruptcies. ""What we have found actually in bankruptcy court, time and again, many times now, that indeed, bankruptcy courts have said that crypto assets are not bankruptcy remote,"" he told Reuters in 2023. However, SAB 121 drew ire from much of the crypto industry, and was the subject of a Congressional Review Act resolution passed by both the House and Senate, though that resolution was vetoed by former President Joe Biden. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who was recently named the head of a new crypto task force, has long opposed the guidance, saying after its adoption in 2022 that the guidance did not account for the SEC not issuing any guidance about how securities laws apply to crypto and that an accounting bulletin might not be the right vehicle for the type of guidance contained in SAB 121.

With new and advanced projects redefining possibilities, the race for the best cryptos for significant returns has never been more competitive. In this buzzing crypto ecosystem, three names are stealing the spotlight: Qubetics ($TICS), Hedera, and Astra. Qubetics has already stirred up excitement in the market with its presale success, selling over 435 million tokens and raising more than $10.4 million. Meanwhile, Hedera impresses with its lightning-fast and energy-efficient network, and Astra brings a unique twist to decentralized finance (DeFi). Each project offers something revolutionary, but is one better suited for your portfolio? Let’s break it down. Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining Blockchain Interoperability First up, let’s talk about Qubetics ($TICS). If you’re eyeing long-term growth and adaptability in the crypto world, Qubetics is a name to know. What sets it apart? Qubetics presale alone is proof of its potential. Over 435 million $TICS tokens have been snapped up by 15,700 eager holders, generating more than $10.4 million in funds. And it’s still in its 18th presale stage! Right now, you can grab $TICS at just $0.0551. But this isn’t just about numbers. Qubetics has a clear mission: to solve the real-world problems that earlier blockchains couldn’t. It’s about creating a connected, seamless ecosystem. For example, its QubeQode IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a game-changer, especially for businesses and professionals. Imagine developing blockchain-based apps or managing digital assets without drowning in complexity—QubeQode makes it all possible. What’s exciting is how approachable Qubetics is. It’s built to make blockchain solutions user-friendly for everyone, from seasoned developers to newcomers. Businesses can leverage it to streamline processes, and individuals can use it for everyday tasks, making it the kind of innovation that actually feels practical. Here’s the kicker: analysts are predicting a massive ROI for $TICS holders. Some project a token price of $0.25 by the end of the presale—a 353% return. And if you’re looking even further ahead, numbers like $10 or $15 after the mainnet launch have been tossed around. Think about what that could mean for your wallet. Hedera: The Green Blockchain That’s Speeding Ahead Hedera isn’t just another blockchain; it’s a statement of what the future of crypto could be. Built on a unique hashgraph consensus mechanism, Hedera is incredibly fast, secure, and eco-friendly. If you’re someone who cares about energy efficiency, this is a blockchain you can feel good about supporting. With transaction speeds that blow traditional blockchains out of the water and a governance model supported by top-tier organizations like Google and IBM, Hedera is the epitome of reliability. Its platform is perfect for everything from secure supply chain management to tokenizing assets. Hedera’s low-cost transactions and scalable solutions make it a go-to choice for developers and enterprises alike. It’s ideal for businesses looking to integrate blockchain without the usual headaches of high fees and slow processing times. Plus, its focus on sustainability means it’s paving the way for a greener crypto future. But what about its potential for returns? Hedera’s growth has been steady, and its utility across industries is expanding rapidly. It might not boast the same presale hype as Qubetics, but its solid infrastructure makes it a dependable long-term investment. Astra: Reinventing DeFi for the Masses Astra is all about making decentralized finance accessible and inclusive. It takes the complexity of DeFi and turns it into something that anyone can understand and use. If you’re a fan of earning passive income or maximizing the utility of your crypto assets, Astra is right up your alley. What sets Astra apart is its focus on simplifying liquidity provision and yield farming. These aren’t just buzzwords—they’re ways to make your crypto work harder for you. Astra’s user-friendly platform ensures that even beginners can dive into DeFi without feeling overwhelmed. The project’s transparency and community-driven approach make it particularly appealing in a space that often feels opaque. By prioritizing security and usability, Astra is carving out a niche for itself in the ever-growing DeFi sector. The Magic of QubeQode IDE Before we wrap up, let’s shine a spotlight on Qubetics’ QubeQode IDE . Why is this such a big deal? Because it’s about breaking down barriers. For too long, blockchain development has been a playground for tech elites, leaving everyone else in the dust. QubeQode changes that by offering an easy-to-use platform for creating and deploying decentralized applications. Whether you’re a solo developer, a small business, or a global enterprise, QubeQode has tools that simplify blockchain integration. It’s intuitive, it’s efficient, and it’s exactly what the blockchain world needs to reach its full potential. By focusing on real-world utility, QubeQode ensures that blockchain isn’t just a buzzword—it’s a practical solution to everyday problems. And that’s what makes Qubetics stand out in a crowded market. Conclusion: Your Move Choosing the best cryptos for significant returns isn’t just about chasing hype; it’s about understanding the real value behind the projects. Qubetics ($TICS), Hedera, and Astra each bring something unique to the table. Whether it’s Qubetics’ visionary QubeQode IDE, Hedera’s eco-friendly speed, or Astra’s accessible DeFi solutions, these projects are reshaping the future of crypto. But let’s be real—Qubetics is making waves right now, and its presale is your golden ticket to get in early. Don’t sit on the sidelines while others seize the opportunity.

The pre-approval indicates the company is successfully done with the regulator’s review process and is qualified for a full MiCA license. The OKX is planning to obtain a full MiCA license in Malta. There, it will provide localized crypto services to over 400 million Europeans through its European Economic Area (EEA) hub. OKX’s platforms will feature regional language options, euro-based trading pairs, and local-language customer support Upon receiving a full MiCA license, OKX will allow clients to access their regulated crypto exchange products, such as OTC trading, spot trading, and bot trading, for 240+ cryptocurrency tokens across 260+ trading pairs and 60+ Euro-based trading pairs. Besides, their website and mobile platform will be customized to the regional language, with a local currency layout and customer relations in the native language. OKX said the achievement fortifies their drive to deliver “secure, transparent, and innovative solutions, ensuring customers benefit from a trusted and compliant platform in Europe’s rapidly evolving crypto landscape.” The platform will allow clients to transact in euros for free via bank transfer and buy cryptos through local payment models. The Malta hub will be a gateway to the 30 EEA member states under MiCA’s unified administrative structure. The company intends to reinvent the crypto experience for individual and institutional clients, offering creative products such as its Advanced Exchange, Simple Exchange, and on-chain wallet solutions. More exchange platforms are planning for MiCA licenses Malta is attracting more exchanges, with Gemini being the latest to announce its intention to acquire a MiCA license there. Gemini said it is dedicated to providing its services in Europe through a local spot in Malta. Another popular global crypto exchange, Crypto.com, made its intention to obtain the MiCA license public on January 17. However, the platform didn’t mention where it had opted to secure its license. Since the European Union fully enacted MiCA, only a handful of crypto asset service providers have gotten the license. Crypto platform MoonPay was among the first CASPs to receive one from the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) on December 30, alongside other firms, including BitStaete, Zebedee Europe, and Zebedee Europe.

A spokesperson said Akhiadov had “moved all his relatives from his native Grozny, Chechnya, to Istanbul “in advance.” Akhiadov, police say, sent “his wife, two younger brothers, sister, and mother” to Turkey “at different times over the five months before committing the crime.” This was part of an attempt to ensure that law enforcement officers did not become “suspicious” about his movements, police claim. Officers did not say who they think sent the coins. But investigators have previously claimed that Akhiadov “swore an oath to the Islamic State [ISIS]” prior to his attack. However, they believe the fighter botched the attack, which was originally intended as a “mass shooting.” Moscow’s Zaryadye Park. (Source: Mos.ru [CC BY 4.0]) Mass Shooting Planned? Officers think that Akhiadov had intended to steal a police officer’s gun and start shooting civilians, possibly in the park. Instead, he attacked a Moscow Administrative Road Inspectorate (MADI) officer, mistaking the man for a police officer due to the latter’s “similar-looking uniform.” During the alleged attack, the fighter inflicted “at least 16 wounds” to the latter’s “vital organs,” police said. The MADI official died shortly after. Police officers say Akhiadov resisted arrest and attacked an officer with pepper spray. Akhiadov was born on August 11, 1994.

This move aligns with the company’s ongoing focus on expanding its Bitcoin strategy while addressing other corporate financial objectives. The offering also includes an option for initial purchasers to acquire an additional $15 million in notes. Semler Scientific Unveils $75M Private Offering to Advance Bitcoin Strategy In a recent press release , Semler Scientific revealed plans to raise $75 million through a private offering of convertible senior notes. The notes, set to mature in 2030, will accrue interest payable semiannually and will be senior unsecured obligations of the company. Investors can convert the notes into cash, shares of Semler Scientific stock, or a combination of both. The offering is designed to provide Semler Scientific with additional financial resources, specifically targeting its Bitcoin strategy. A portion of the proceeds will also support general corporate initiatives. The company has emphasized that the terms of the notes, including interest and conversion rates, will be finalized during the offering’s pricing stage. More so, this move comes days after the medical technology company achieved a 99.3% BTC Yield , reflecting the strength of its Bitcoin treasury strategy. The recent acquisition, supported by proceeds from its ATM offering, raised Semler Scientific’s BTC holdings. Capped Call Transactions To Mitigate Stock Dilution As part of the offering, Semler Scientific plans to engage in capped call transactions with financial institutions. These transactions will reduce the impact of dilution on the company’s common stock arising from note conversions. The capped call agreements are expected to cover the initial number of shares underlying the notes, with provisions for adjustment. To facilitate the capped call transactions, Semler Scientific and its counterparties may conduct various derivative transactions or purchase company stock shares. These activities could influence the market prices of the notes and the company’s stock. Additionally, the company expects these counterparties to adjust their hedging strategies during the note observation period. This activity, or any response to early note conversions, could potentially impact the stock’s value. Stock Declines Amid Announcement Following the announcement, Semler Scientific Inc (SMLR) stock experienced a 12.5% decline, reflecting market concerns over potential share dilution. Investors are reacting cautiously to the issuance of convertible senior notes despite the company’s BTC profits. Preliminary financial results for Q4 2024 indicate revenues between $12.1 million and $12.5 million, with operating income ranging from $3.4 million to $3.7 million. Semler Scientific also reported an unrealized Bitcoin gain of $28.9 million, showcasing the benefits of its treasury strategy. The company’s Bitcoin holdings total 2,321 Bitcoins, acquired at an average price of $82,689 per coin. As of December 31, 2024, Semler Scientific held approximately $9 million in cash and equivalents, signaling strong liquidity to support its future initiatives. Meanwhile, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao has confirmed the prospect of a strategic Bitcoin reserve through a recent X post. He expressed confidence in the initiative, stating, “US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, pretty much confirmed.” Adding a humorous note, Zhao remarked that “crypto is moving at crypto speed again,” reflecting optimism for growth.

Trump Bitcoin MAGA (MAGABTC), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MAGABTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump Bitcoin MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Bitcoin MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Bitcoin MAGA launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Bitcoin MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Bitcoin MAGA by entering its contract address – 3J7GkdTfz7sHdcKcMnD5fm1aDZZUktz7z8NqTdiacLTy – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MAGABTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|BTC|SOL|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-23 23:37:00

In the Jan. 23 letter, Warren proposed fully funding the IRS, closing the carried interest loophole, and implementing a capital gains tax on inherited estates. She emphasized that wealthier Americans should bear more responsibility, noting they are mentioned repeatedly in her proposal. Musk, whose net worth is estimated at $426 billion, would clearly be impacted. Warren raised concerns about DOGE’s policies, citing potential ethical conflicts. She stated, “It is not clear that you and other DOGE leaders are able to identify and mitigate your conflicts of interest and adhere to common-sense ethics standards. As a result, the committee appears to be a venue for corruption.” She also argued that changes to the tax code could generate significant revenue. Warren highlighted how increases to the estate tax exemption have reduced taxable estates. “The tax expenditures arising from the exclusion of capital gains on assets transferred at death totaled about $39 billion in 2019. DOGE should end this stepped-up basis for assets transferred at death, saving over $60 billion per year going forward,” she wrote. Different Visions for Government Spending Despite sharing an interest in efficiency, Warren and Musk remain unlikely allies. Warren has urged President Trump to fully fund the IRS, claiming it could increase enforcement and improve taxpayer services, yielding a 12:1 return on investment. However, President Trump and Musk have charted different paths. On his first day in office, Trump froze hiring across federal agencies. Musk, while initially targeting $2 trillion in cuts, recently acknowledged this figure might be unrealistic, suggesting $1 trillion as a more achievable goal. Given that mandatory spending accounts for two-thirds of the federal budget, including Social Security and Medicare, achieving such reductions remains a significant challenge.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today,EN,0,0,REGULATION|DOGE|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-23 23:37:57

A bill aiming to eliminate the guideline passed both the House and the Senate last year, but President Biden vetoed the bill. Although the issue is a top priority among crypto proponents, the removal of the rule was not a campaign promise. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan recently said American banks are ready to jump at the chance to custody crypto assets. “If the rules come in and make it a real thing that you can actually do business with, you’ll find that the banking system will come in hard on the transactional side of it.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Could the potential XRP futures launch kickoff a meteoric XRP surge to $15? Is CME Listing XRP Futures Contracts Soon? The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) stirred excitement in the crypto community earlier on Wednesday after the Chicago-based futures giant posted the futures page for Ripple’s XRP and Solana (SOL) to its staging subdomain. The price of both cryptocurrencies spiked following the leaked CME futures addition, which suggested that those investment vehicles would be listed on Feb. 10. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart corroborated the page’s existence. https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1882154205202567623 However, CME later clarified that the beta page was mistakenly made public, and that no official decisions regarding futures contracts based on both tokens had been made. “The beta version of the website, which is often used for mock-up drafts, was made public in error,” a spokesperson of the company told FOX Business . “No official decisions have yet been made about launching futures contracts for either token.” Crypto Investment Products Surge Amid Shifting Regulatory Winds Despite CME’s denial, investors are still hopeful that the XRP futures contracts will be eventually launched. Applications for crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and futures products have increased following the reelection of President Donald Trump and the departure of crypto nemesis Gary Gensler from the SEC. Asset managers have already submitted a slew of regulatory filings to list ETFs holdings altcoins, including XRP. This has led to heightened anticipation that an ETF that offers investors direct exposure to XRP could be approved soon following the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs last year. Trump, who has vowed to transform the U.S. into the “world’s crypto capital,” has tapped pro-crypto commissioner Mark Uyeda to serve as interim SEC Chair until Paul Atkins assumes the role under the new Trump administration. Regulatory hurdles must be cleared for XRP ETFs and futures products to be greenlighted. Pundits suggest that crypto advocate Atkins could facilitate this change. Earlier this month, a team of researchers at JP Morgan said that if approved, XRP ETFs could attract an eye-popping $8 billion worth of fresh cash from investors. XRP Headed For $15? Several crypto strategists have suggested that XRP could hit the $15 mark this year, citing the third-largest crypto’s adoption and bullish chart technicals, institutional demand, and a crypto-friendly Trump regime as the tailwinds. Popular analyst Mickybull Crypto, for instance, has previously shared a chart showing XRP trading closer to the upper boundary of a bull flag with an upside target of $15. As of press time, XRP was changing hands at $3.11, according to CoinGecko data.

By 2028, ENS could see significant growth, with predictions suggesting a potential maximum price of $157.81. ENS could achieve its highest price yet, reaching up to $256.44 by 2031. Ethereum Name Service is a network that allows crypto-enthusiasts to rename their crypto addresses into something simpler, making them easier to remember. Renaming crypto addresses through ENS will enable users to recollect and write them quickly. Even though Ethereum Name Service is based on the Ethereum blockchain, it uses its cryptocurrency, ENS. ENS is used for governance purposes on the blockchain network. Users can also send and receive any cryptocurrency with the system’s wallet. The price of ENS has experienced ups and downs since it launched on the market, dropping to as low as $6.7 and hitting an ATH of $85.69. As the adoption of decentralized identities and Web3 technology continues to grow, ENS continues to position itself as a key player in this transformative space. How will this affect investors’ perceptions of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) token? Will ENS go up? How high can ENS go? Will ENS recapture its ATH soon? Let’s get into the Ethereum Name Service price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Name Service Token ENS Price $35 Market Cap $1,263,055,467.93 Trading Volume $169,948,051.91 Circulating Supply 35,365,085.96 ENS All-time High $85.69, Nov 11, 2021 All-time Low $6.70, Oct 19, 2023 24-h High $35.96 24-h Low $32.70 Ethereum Name Service technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Volatility) 5.35% 50-Day SMA $36.06 14-Day RSI 51.92 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 75 (Greed) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $24.75 Ethereum Name Service price analysis: ENS sees slight gains TL;DR Breakdown Ethereum Name Service’s price analysis shows a slight bullish recovery. The resistance for ENS is present at $36.03. A breakout above the resistance could solidify buyer’s interest. The ENS price analysis for January 23 shows a slight price recovery, indicating a positive growth momentum. The resistance level is near $36.03, where selling pressure has been observed, while support is identified around $32.64, providing a potential rebound zone. The movement reflects a short-term uptrend, with traders watching for a breakout above resistance or further dips toward support to determine the next direction. Ethereum Name Service 1-day price chart: ENS is trading within a consolidation range According to the 1-day ENS chart, the price is within a consolidation range, holding between $32.64 and $36.03. The RSI at 52.11 suggests neutral momentum, which indicates a close balance between buyers and sellers. ENS The MACD is slowly but surely making its way toward bullish territory, but there simply is not the strong momentum to suggest an imminent breakout. A decisive breakout above the $36.03 resistance would open the door for an upswing to the next available resistance at $37.85. Should the $32.64 support not hold, we could be looking at a move down to $30.32. ENS/USD 4-hour price chart analysis: Indicators report a growing capital influx As shown on the 4-hour price chart, the coin is approaching the upper band at $35.70, which suggests a growing upward trend., albeit still weak. The Balance of Power indicator at 0.79 indicates increasing buying volume, which is consistent with the CMF indicator at 0.10, reporting a positive capital influx. Indicators report a growing capital influx Should the price breach the $35.70 mark, the positive momentum may strengthen further, targeting higher resistance. On the contrary, if the price struggles to maintain its value above $34.31, it is more likely to pull back to $32.93 or lower. From a short-term point of view, the outlook is mildly bullish, but the price is still trapped within a range. ENS technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $34.26 BUY SMA 5 $34.54 BUY SMA 10 $35.02 SELL SMA 21 $34.54 BUY SMA 50 $36.06 SELL SMA 100 $28.44 BUY SMA 200 $24.75 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $32.68 BUY EMA 5 $32.66 BUY EMA 10 $33.25 BUY EMA 21 $34.27 BUY EMA 50 $33.35 BUY EMA 100 $29.74 BUY EMA 200 $25.84 BUY What to expect from ENS? ENS shows mixed momentum, testing resistance at $35.70. Strong buying activity and positive capital inflow support bullish potential, but a failure to break $34.31 could lead to a pullback toward $32.93. A breakout above $35.70 may drive further gains. Is ENS a good investment? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) can be a good investment if you believe in the long-term potential of decentralized domain names and the growing adoption of blockchain technology. ENS offers a unique utility by allowing users to register human-readable names for Ethereum addresses, which simplifies transactions and interactions within the Ethereum ecosystem. Its value could increase as more users and businesses adopt decentralized web services. Will ENS recover? The ENS price has experienced a sharp drop followed by a gradual recovery, indicating some resilience in the market. While there has been a rebound from the low, whether ENS will fully recover depends on continued buying interest and broader market conditions. Will ENS reach $100? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years, with the price projected to reach $124.93 by 2027. This implies that reaching $100 is plausible within the next few years, driven by positive market trends and increasing adoption. Will ENS reach $500? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years. However, attaining $500, while attainable, might not happen anytime soon. Does ENS have a good long-term future? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) shows a strong long-term potential based on current predictions. The price is expected to increase significantly over the next several years, with forecasts extending up to $250 by 2031.

The study was conducted by Ipsos. It observes how crypto and blockchain technology are viewed in Argentina, Kenya, the Philippines, and Switzerland and how it impacts the lives of people in these countries. For most of the part, the study is based on surveys with 4,000 adults (not specifying the age rates) in Argentina, Kenya, the Philippines, and Switzerland conducted on behalf of Coinbase. The choice of countries aims to give an outlook of societies living in markedly different socioeconomic conditions in different parts of the world (none of these countries belong to the same continent, with the Philippines being an archipelago-based country). The similarities between these countries are the mostly Christian populations and the government systems revolving around the republic model. Nevertheless, the countries have strikingly different areas, positions on the map, historical experiences, cultures, languages, climates, economic states, etc. Coinbase, however, outlines another similarity between Argentina, Kenya, the Philippines, and Switzerland: according to the exchange team, the residents of these countries feel that the local financial systems need to be improved. More than that, generally, the polled residents see cryptocurrencies and blockchain as tools that may enhance their lives in terms of financial wealth and overall give more freedom and independence. The state of economy in these countries The report starts with the statistics demonstrating that in each country, less than a half of all respondents believe that the current financial direction in their country will make them live better than the previous generation. However, even fewer people believe that they will live worse than their parents in Argentina and the Philippines. So it’s fair to say that in Kenya and Switzerland, people don’t approve of the current financial politics in contrast to the past years, while Argentina and the Philippines rather dislike both the current and the previous efforts, believing that nowadays things are a bit better than before. Respondents in all these countries agree that the local financial system should be changed or overhauled completely. They refer to the financial systems of their countries as “slow,” “expensive,” and “unstable.” They also cited a lack of innovation as one of the problems. Top countries to change financial system | Source: Coinbase.com The study reveals four main concerns of the respondents named in the surveys: lack of fairness (discrimination), centralization, decreasing value of the national currency, and too much hard work to earn enough or save money. The distribution of concerns varies from country to country, with Kenya and the Philippines being most critical towards centralization, discrimination, and wage slavery. Switzerland is least concerned about many of these issues while being cautious towards the government’s dependency on banks. Argentinians have the biggest trust issues with their financial institutions and a problem with saving money. Crypto as a remedy Most people polled by Ipsos for the study want to be in charge of their financial state and gain more freedom and control over their money. 7 in 10 respondents see cryptocurrency and blockchain as the way to achieve these goals. More than that, both crypto owners and those who don’t have crypto agree that digital currencies can help them gain more freedom and control over their wealth. You might also like: Kenya preparing to legalize crypto: report Switzerlanders are markedly less interested in crypto than respondents from other countries. However, over 70% of crypto owners in Switzerland believe that crypto offers them more control and freedom. Less than half of the surveyed Switzerlanders with no crypto believe that they need it. Source: Coinbase.com Wider blockchain adoption is also viewed as a favorable factor that may improve the local financial systems and individual wealth. Most respondents believe that blockchain promotes innovation and facilitates control over individual finances. Respondents hope that blockchain will make the system faster and more accessible. In all polls, Switzerland is presented with lower numbers. It reflects the lower expectations associated with Bitcoin and blockchain and the lower level of dissatisfaction with the financial status quo. Looking into this study, you may notice a strong connection between the level of satisfaction with the country’s financial direction and the level of support for cryptocurrencies and blockchain. The residents of Switzerland and Argentina are less concerned with the current financial state of their countries, and they are less into crypto than Kenya and the Philippines. Probably, that’s one of the reasons why not only Kenya but Africa in general, where the population has little to no access to banking services but has smartphones, are usually seen as the driver of the mass adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain-based solutions as the substitute of traditional banks.

Jung, who previously served as Pham’s Counselor and Senior Policy Advisor, will lead the agency’s crypto and digital assets engagement and will build on his experience at Citigroup and prior regulatory roles. CFTC’s Crypto Engagement The appointment comes as part of broader leadership changes shortly after Pham’s interim appointment by President Donald Trump. Pham has been involved in several digital asset initiatives at the CFTC, including the creation of a Digital Asset Markets subcommittee. In 2023, she proposed the establishment of a regulatory sandbox to develop a framework for emerging technologies and outlined plans for a digital asset pilot program. The Trump administration has not yet named a permanent replacement for Rostin Behnam, who will leave the CFTC on February 7th. Former CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz is reportedly a top contender for the position. Throughout his four years at the CFTC, Behnam strongly advocated for the agency to lead the regulation of Bitcoin and other digital currencies. He emphasized the importance of robust oversight as the digital asset market grew rapidly. Under his leadership, the CFTC took major enforcement measures, such as reaching a $2.7 billion settlement with Binance. In its final push, the agency subpoenaed crypto exchange, Coinbase for customer information tied to Polymarket, a prediction market platform accused of regulatory violations. This last-ditch effort just before the Trump takeover came amidst allegations of market manipulation and gambling law breaches at Polymarket. SEC, FDIC Shuffle Besides Pham for CFTC, Mark Uyeda was appointed as the acting chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by President Donald Trump, replacing Gary Gensler. A vocal critic of Gensler’s crypto policies, Uyeda will serve in this role until the Senate confirms a permanent successor. The American attorney has a history of advocating for a more lenient regulatory approach to crypto, particularly against enforcement actions targeting non-fraudulent crypto firms. Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto figure, is Trump’s nominee for permanent SEC chair. At the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), on the other hand, Travis Hill has been named temporary chair following Marty Gruenberg’s resignation. The FDIC has faced criticism, including allegations from Senator Cynthia Lummis, over its handling of digital asset records tied to “Operation Choke Point 2.0.” The post Harry Jung Appointed to Guide CFTC’s Crypto and Digital Asset Strategy appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|CFTC|Donald Trump|SEC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB|BTC,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-01-23 23:58:04

As a pioneer in Oracle blockchain technology, Chainlink continues to cement its leadership in the Real-World Assets (RWA) sector. Its cutting-edge solutions, which enable seamless data integration between blockchains and traditional systems, have garnered widespread adoption and positioned Chainlink as an indispensable part of the decentralized finance ecosystem.

With both technical and fundamental indicators aligning, LINK is well-positioned to weather market volatility and lead the altcoin recovery. Investors are watching closely as Chainlink continues to set itself apart in the evolving crypto landscape, with its $50 target representing a potential milestone in its ongoing growth. LINK Holding Strong Above Key Level Chainlink (LINK) is currently trading at $24.26, a pivotal level that has transitioned from a stubborn resistance to a strong support zone. This shift marks a significant milestone for LINK, as the $24 level had acted as a supply zone for weeks. Now holding firmly as support, it signals that bulls have regained control, setting the stage for a potential surge. The price action suggests that LINK is building momentum to break above the $27 mark, a critical level that could trigger a more explosive rally. With the broader market facing uncertainty and heightened volatility, LINK’s ability to maintain key demand zones showcases its relative strength and investor confidence. This bullish setup positions Chainlink as a standout performer among altcoins, as it continues to weather market turbulence. If bulls can maintain control and push above $27 with conviction, the next rally could propel LINK into higher targets, potentially sparking renewed interest and activity in the altcoin market.

The SUI price is experiencing a notable rebound, with a 4.3% increase, targeting the $5.86 resistance level. Simultaneously, a positive Chainlink (LINK) price analysis signals a potential rise to $38, spurred by escalating institutional interest. Among these developments, BlockDAG ‘s recruitment of Marius Bock, the ex-Cardano project lead, stands out. Tasked with steering the upcoming mainnet launch, Bock’s leadership has propelled BlockDAG’s presale to raise over $183.5 million, offering an impressive 2,380% ROI to early adopters and establishing BDAG as the best long-term crypto asset. These market shifts are substantial and not to be underestimated by those monitoring industry trends. SUI Price Outlook: Bulls Target New Highs The SUI price reached an unprecedented high earlier this year, bolstered by steady gains from mid-2024 to January 2025. Despite a recent 10% drop, the SUI price is rallying, currently at $4.92, and has increased by 4.3% today. The market’s positive funding rates and increased trading volume indicate that another peak may soon be within reach. Current technical indicators position SUI well above crucial EMAs, suggesting that the bullish trend is likely to continue. With the RSI in a neutral zone, the path is open for the SUI price to approach the $5.86 R2 resistance level, provided that buying momentum persists. Market analysts are closely watching these indicators, anticipating potential new highs and ongoing market confidence. Chainlink Price Analysis: Is $38 on the Horizon? Recent Chainlink price analysis reveals that it is poised for a robust rebound, thanks to significant whale purchases totaling over $20 million. This analysis anticipates Chainlink’s price potentially hitting $38 by early February if the current buying trend continues. This outlook is strengthened by Chainlink’s collaborations with leading financial institutions. Chainlink’s recent 10% surge has exceeded the performance of both Bitcoin and Ethereum, drawing heightened attention. While market volatility could temper short-term expectations, the Chainlink price analysis remains optimistic, supported by high trading volumes and growing investor interest, highlighting LINK’s pivotal role in the decentralized finance sector, particularly in data sharing and tokenization. BlockDAG Enhances Global Presence with Marius Bock BlockDAG’s announcement of Marius Bock joining its team marks a significant commitment to scalability enhancements and user adoption expansion. Bock’s rich history with Cardano and his experience at Visa enrich BlockDAG’s team, poised to extend its influence globally. BlockDAG’s unique approach could provide a competitive edge over entities like Chainlink and SUI, especially as it enhances its system for quicker transactions and improved reliability. Currently, BDAG coins are priced at $0.0248, with robust demand as the presale progresses. To date, over $183.5 million has been raised, with 17.9 billion coins sold, delivering substantial returns to early adopters and heightening anticipation for the upcoming mainnet launch. Experts believe Bock’s involvement could position BlockDAG among the best long-term crypto choices for those exploring new opportunities. The team’s strategy of integrating elite talent is crucial for impacting both financial and large-scale enterprise applications. Predictions suggest swift adoption following the mainnet activation, potentially affirming the technology’s transformative impact on blockchain applications globally. Forward-thinking traders consider BlockDAG a vital addition to their financial portfolios. Stay Ahead: The Next Major Crypto Movement The cryptocurrency market is teeming with promising opportunities, with the current period being critical for engagement. The SUI price is steadily climbing, suggesting another record high might be imminent. Meanwhile, recent Chainlink price analysis forecasts a surge to $38, propelled by notable institutional backing. Yet, the strategic addition of Marius Bock to BlockDAG’s team underscores its sophisticated preparation for the mainnet launch. This key appointment is anticipated to significantly enhance the launch’s success. With BlockDAG’s mainnet on the horizon, the platform is poised to redefine blockchain adoption, confirming its status as the best long-term crypto asset. As the market anticipates BlockDAG’s next steps, both seasoned and new traders are advised to closely watch this evolving narrative.

These enhancements are setting the stage for both platforms, marking them as top contenders among this year’s bullish cryptos. Observers are keeping a keen eye on Cardano price predictions and Avalanche’s strategic partnerships, anticipating significant movements. Amid these developments, Web3Bay (3BAY) is emerging as a formidable force in decentralized e-commerce. This platform is transforming the shopping experience by integrating the reliability of traditional retail with the efficiency of blockchain technology, enabling consumers to easily access crypto-powered rewards and discounts. Web3Bay distinguishes itself by offering a fluid transition from conventional online shopping to a blockchain-enhanced marketplace, merging the best of both worlds. Web3Bay: Elevating Online Retail Through Blockchain Innovation Web3Bay is revolutionizing the e-commerce landscape by blending the comfort of familiar shopping experiences with the disruptive power of blockchain technology. While the thought of using cryptocurrencies for daily transactions might intimidate some, Web3Bay is demystifying this process, providing a user-friendly platform that invites consumers to engage with blockchain without a steep learning curve. The platform enhances the appeal of e-commerce with enticing discounts and crypto rewards, making digital commerce both accessible and engaging. A standout feature of Web3Bay is its 3BAY token, currently in the presale stage and offering significant growth potential. Starting at just $0.003, the token price is expected to climb to $0.1959 through successive stages, potentially yielding returns of over 6,430% for early investors. With $870,000 already raised, Web3Bay is affirming its position as a leader among 2025’s bullish cryptos. Web3Bay’s consumer-centric approach not only offers discounts but also empowers shoppers with blockchain-based loyalty rewards. This pioneering platform is not just bridging clicks with crypto; it is setting the stage for integrating NFTs and DeFi functionalities, pointing towards an ambitious future where e-commerce is seamlessly intertwined with blockchain. Cardano’s Plomin Hard Fork: Boosting Governance & Scalability Cardano is making significant strides with its upcoming Plomin hard fork, which will introduce Protocol Version 10, aimed at enhancing governance and scalability. This critical update requires the involvement of 51% of Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) for activation, highlighting the community’s role in Cardano’s evolution. These enhancements are injecting optimism into the market, spurring robust discussions around Cardano price predictions as stakeholders anticipate an upswing in ADA’s valuation. Cardano’s robust development roadmap and active community engagement are solidifying its stature in the blockchain domain. Recent updates aimed at improving transaction efficiency and network performance are foundational for its continued growth, keeping Cardano price predictions in focus as investors and analysts gauge the potential for substantial returns amidst fluctuating market conditions. Avalanche’s Enhanced Scalability & Strategic Partnerships Avalanche is bolstering its infrastructure and market appeal through a strategic partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS), aiming to position itself as a primary blockchain resource for AWS clients and encourage the broader adoption of decentralized applications. Supported by a substantial $250 million fundraise in late 2024, Avalanche is well-equipped to expand its ecosystem and drive future technological upgrades. The introduction of the Avalanche9000 upgrade is set to dramatically reduce Layer-1 deployment costs by 99.9% and cut C-Chain transaction costs by 25 times, crucial improvements that enhance scalability and user adoption. These advancements ensure that Avalanche remains at the forefront of bullish cryptos, with its technical and strategic enhancements paving the way for a more streamlined and accessible blockchain experience. Summing Up! As we look ahead, Cardano’s advancements with the Plomin hard fork and governance upgrades are drawing significant interest, with Cardano price predictions increasingly suggesting a promising growth trajectory. Likewise, Avalanche’s strategic initiatives and the ambitious Avalanche9000 upgrade are reinforcing its position among bullish cryptos , promising substantial improvements in scalability and cost efficiency. While these projects are advancing their networks, Web3Bay is redefining the e-commerce sphere. Its 3BAY token presale, promising exceptional returns, is effectively merging traditional e-commerce with blockchain innovation. Web3Bay’s approachable platform, which marries crypto rewards with familiar shopping experiences, is making blockchain technology accessible to all.

39350804,https://nulltx.com/?p=140510,1737676836,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,From $0.01 to $3 by March 2025: PCHAIN To Outrun Giants Dogecoin and Shiba Inu,https://nulltx.com/from-0-01-to-3-by-march-2025-pchain-to-outrun-giants-dogecoin-and-shiba-inu/,"Dogecoin captured hearts with its meme-fueled rise, and Shiba Inu turned early investors into overnight millionaires. But a new contender, PropiChain (PCHAIN), is stepping up with something more substantial: innovation. Priced at just $0.011 during its presale, PCHAIN is gaining traction as the next big thing, with predictions pointing to an impressive $3 price tag by March 2025. Let’s explore how this AI-powered altcoin is set to leave Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in the dust. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu: Legendary Yet Limited Dogecoin burst onto the scene with its fun, meme-driven appeal, while Shiba Inu followed with a community-focused ecosystem that turned small investments into life-changing gains. While both coins remain crypto favorites, they face challenges that hinder long-term growth. Dogecoin lacks practical use cases, relying largely on its community and celebrity endorsements. Shiba Inu has expanded its ecosystem, including token burns and Shibarium, but its utility remains limited. These limitations are why many investors are turning to utility-driven projects like PCHAIN , which combines blockchain with real-world applications to deliver substantial benefits. Propichain: Transforming Investment Through Innovation PCHAIN is more than just an altcoin; it’s a full-fledged ecosystem designed to address real-world problems. Its features are not only innovative but also practical, appealing to both beginner and experienced investors. Fractional Ownership: Owning High-Value Assets Without Breaking the Bank PCHAIN allows investors to buy fractions of luxury real estate assets. For instance, Propichain can divide a $2 million luxury apartment into 1,000 shares. Instead of needing millions to invest, you could buy a share for as little as $500. This makes high-value investments accessible to everyone, diversifying portfolios and opening wealth-building opportunities once reserved for the ultra-rich. AI-Powered Insights: Smarter, Data-Driven Decisions One of PCHAIN’s standout features is its use of artificial intelligence (AI). For example, the platform can analyze property trends to identify undervalued assets or forecast price trends in the metaverse. Imagine getting a notification about a high-growth neighborhood before prices surge. For investors, this AI-driven approach minimizes guesswork and maximizes potential returns, something Dogecoin and Shiba Inu can’t offer. Metaverse Integration: Invest in Virtual and Physical Real Estate With the metaverse booming, PCHAIN integrates virtual property investments into its ecosystem. Investors can purchase digital land or lease out virtual spaces for events, creating new revenue streams. For example, you could buy a virtual office space and lease it to a global company for hosting meetings in the metaverse. This integration bridges the gap between traditional real estate and emerging digital opportunities. DeFi Tools: Making Your Investment Work for You PCHAIN offers decentralized finance (DeFi) features like staking, lending, and borrowing. You could stake your tokens on the platform to earn passive income or lend them out for interest. Unlike Dogecoin, where returns depend solely on price fluctuations, PCHAIN enables your investments to generate additional earnings over time. Global Accessibility: Breaking Down Investment Barriers PCHAIN’s blockchain infrastructure ensures that anyone, anywhere, can participate in its ecosystem. Whether you’re in New York or Nairobi, you can invest in tokenized properties, trade NFTs, or stake tokens—all from your smartphone. Smart Contracts: Efficient and Transparent Transactions Blockchain-based smart contracts make transactions on PCHAIN fast, secure, and tamper-proof. For example, renting a property or transferring ownership is as simple as clicking a button, with no middlemen involved. Presale at $0.011: A Rare Opportunity Propichain’s presale is in stage 2, with tokens priced at just $0.011. This low entry point offers incredible potential for early investors to secure exponential returns. For example: • A $500 investment today would secure approximately 45,454 tokens. • If PCHAIN hits $3 by 2025, that $500 could grow to a remarkable $136,362. With over 37.5% of tokens already sold and over $2.5 million raised, the presale is quickly gaining momentum. The platform’s recent listing on CoinMarketCap and successful security audit also add to its credibility, ensuring investor confidence. Conclusion: Why PCHAIN Is the Smart Investor’s Choice Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have paved the way for millions to enter the crypto market, but their growth is largely limited to community hype. PCHAIN , on the other hand, delivers innovation and utility through features and DeFi tools. With its presale price of $0.011 and a forecasted $3 target by 2025, PCHAIN offers a rare chance to invest in a project that’s redefining crypto innovation. Don’t miss the opportunity to join this revolution. Act now; secure your tokens and position yourself for a brighter financial future with PCHAIN.

In his recent post, Buterin pointed out the possible adverse effects of such tokens particularly when they are linked to powerful politicians. “Now is the time to talk about the fact that large-scale political coins cross a further line…., whose harm is at most contained to mistakes.” Buterin raised concerns about political tokens such as the TRUMP and MELANIA tokens that emerged during Donald Trump’s inauguration. Based on the images of U.S. President Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, these tokens became popular first and then lost their value. According to Buterin, these tokens are not only fun to collect— they pose a threat of being used for political gain. He noted that foreign actors may use tokens of this kind to affect political processes and the ethical principles of governance. The risks include the risk of abuse, with Buterin arguing that political tokens could make political bribery unregulated and almost unrestricted. Regulation challenges in the crypto industry Buterin also shared his views on the legal environment of cryptocurrencies, including the actions of the former chairman of the SEC, Gary Gensler. He noted that Gensler’s policies have indirectly influenced the crypto market negatively because projects have started hiding their revenue structures. “@GaryGensler created a regime where tokens that give investors clear indication of what their rights are and where their revenue comes from is a “security”, but obfuscated “governance tokens” are potentially in the clear.” He noted that the regulators have put the industry in a position where there is compliance with some aspects of resistance, and this has shaped the industry in ways that were not anticipated. Buterin also criticized Gensler, noting that the actions of the SEC lead to legal risks and impair efficiency. He stated, ” it is a key reason why @GaryGensler must never be christened as a hero, even among crypto skeptics. “ Although political tokens and regulation are the concerns of the crypto market, Buterin still believes in the future of the industry. He said there is a need to go back to the drawing board and focus on long-term and transparent innovation and community-based projects. According to Buterin, the industry can solve the current problems by giving importance to privacy, security, and transparency. In the post, Buterin also explained how innovations in DeFi can be used responsibly and gave examples of the Infinex and True Markets projects. He called on the industry to create systems that support the principles of decentralization while embracing sustainability and equity. He ended the post by stating, “There is a bright future of capital allocation mechanisms that can be built. Acceleration is coming either way; it is our task to choose the brightest possible vector.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",News|Melania|TRUMP,EN,0,0,REGULATION|ETH|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-24 00:17:25

39351845,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=649553,1737678868,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39351845.jpeg,SEC officially rescinds anti-crypto SAB 121,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/sec-officially-rescinds-anti-crypto-sab-121/,"Today, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has pulled the plug on Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121), a rule that had tied crypto companies in regulatory kno ts since 2022. This decision, announced through Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 122 (SAB 122) on January 23, removes the controversial guidance that forced platforms to account for safeguarding crypto-assets as liabilities. The rescission directly affects how crypto companies report risks and obligations tied to safeguarding digital assets held on behalf of users. What SAB 122 changes for crypto The SEC’s new guidance removes the requirements imposed by Topic 5.FF under SAB 121. That bulletin forced crypto platforms to treat their obligation to safeguard users’ assets as liabilities, regardless of whether actual financial risks existed. With SAB 122, that specific directive is gone. The Commission made it clear that entities should now determine any liabilities related to safeguarding risks under broader accounting standards like FASB ASC Subtopic 450-20 or IAS 37. Under these standards, companies are expected to assess potential liabilities based on loss contingencies and provisions. FASB ASC Subtopic 450-20 covers how U.S.-based firms handle these risks, while IAS 37 applies to entities using IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards). “Entities should implement this change retroactively for annual periods starting after December 15, 2024,” the SEC said in its bulletin. Companies can also adopt the rescission earlier for interim or annual filings submitted after the announcement of SAB 122. How the SEC justifies the decisions According to the SEC’s official filing, Staff Accounting Bulletins are not formal rules or legally binding interpretations. Instead, they provide guidance that reflects practices followed by the Division of Corporation Finance and the Office of the Chief Accountant. Vanessa A. Countryman, Secretary of the SEC, confirmed that SAB 122 has officially replaced SAB 121 in the agency’s regulatory framework. The change has also been codified in Title 17 of the Code of Federal Regulations. While the text of SAB 122 will not appear directly in the Code of Federal Regulations, the SEC has made updates to its table of Staff Accounting Bulletins to reflect the change. The rescission of SAB 121 does not mean crypto companies can completely avoid disclosing risks tied to safeguarding users’ assets though. In its announcement, the SEC reminded companies of their existing obligations under broader regulatory requirements. These include Items 101, 105, and 303 of Regulation S-K, which mandate disclosures on business operations, risk factors, and management’s discussion and analysis, respectively. Companies must also follow accounting rules under FASB ASC Topic 275, which addresses risks and uncertainties in financial reporting. The SEC specifically mentioned that companies must disclose any material risks or uncertainties related to safeguarding crypto-assets. The agency also expects companies to provide enough information so investors can understand the financial and operational implications of their obligations.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $10.15 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $16.50. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. Can WIF attain new heights in 2025? Will Dogwifhat reach $10 soon? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $1.77 Market cap $1,429,627,931.13 Trading volume $302,922,358.59 Circulating supply 998,841,665.99 WIF All-time high $4.85 on March 31, 2024 All-time low $0.000023 on November 2023 24-hour high $1.45 24-hour low $1.35 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 14.68% 50-day SMA $2.46 14-Day RSI 44.39 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 75 (Greed) Green days 12/30 (40%) 200-Day SMA $2.24 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis: Buyers re-enter the market; more upsides? TL;DR Breakdown WIF’s price analysis suggests renewed buyer interest. Dogwifhat (WIF) resistance is present at around $1.642. WIF’s support level is present at $1.35. The Dogwifhat price analysis for January 24 shows price recovery and increasing buyer interest. WIF has seen a 0.59% gain in the past 24 hours but is still down by 19% gain in the last 7 days. Will the growing buying interest push WIF above $1.6? Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: WIF trades below 20-day SMA with bullish recovery in sight The 1-day chart shows WIF trading well below the 20-day SMA at $1.64, reflecting a bearish trend. The MACD suggests minimal bullish momentum, with the histogram near neutral and lines close to a crossover. WIF trades below 20-day SMA with a bullish recovery in sight The RSI at 37.12 indicates the asset is near oversold, hinting at potential consolidation or a mild recovery if buying volume increases. A break above $1.64 could signal further upside, while rejection risks revisiting lower support levels near $1.30. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart: WIF indicators show bullish bias, though weak The 4-hour WIF/USDT chart shows slight consolidation after recent volatility. The Bollinger Bands highlight narrowing activity and reduced price fluctuations—a potential buildup for a breakout in either direction. WIF indicators show bullish bias, though weak The Balance of Power (BOP) at 0.88 shows a sharp bullish bias, indicating buyer market dominance. But the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is at about 0.05, revealing that capital inflows are weak, limiting buying power in the market even while the market acts like it is heading upwards. If buyers keep up the momentum, they could take the price up to the next resistance at about $1.48. Otherwise, WIF could fall back to about $1.35. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $1.484 SELL SMA 5 $1.534 SELL SMA 10 $1.732 SELL SMA 21 $1.765 SELL SMA 50 $2.24 SELL SMA 100 $2.53 SELL SMA 200 $2.24 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $1.562 SELL EMA 5 $1.596 SELL EMA 10 $1.694 SELL EMA 21 $1.879 SELL EMA 50 $2.23 SELL EMA 100 $2.37 SELL EMA 200 $2.33 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? WIF is recovering at $1.425 with bullish signs. A clear breakout above $1.48 is needed to confirm a bullish recovery. If momentum holds, WIF could retest $1.64 or consolidate if it breaks support at $1.35. Is Dogwifhat a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain. Its value is driven by community interest and speculation. Projections indicate that by 2025, the price could rise to about $3. While it may have potential for short-term gains, it’s equally risky. Only invest after thorough research. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank and several others. Why is $WIF up? WIF is up 0.59% in the past 24 hours, trading around $1.44. The rise is driven by increased trading volume, market recovery, and speculative interest. However, it’s still far below its $4.85 all-time high. Dogwifhat (WIF) price chart | TradingView Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Will WIF reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and would require exceptional growth, widespread adoption, and wild market speculation. Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $3.5 by 2025 and $10 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

Inaugurated Trump (TRUMPINA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPINA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Inaugurated Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Inaugurated Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Inaugurated Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Inaugurated Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Inaugurated Trump by entering its contract address – 2F9Q7eZwdnfWUY6Pcqvb7KFDXVW2vcoLCDoTkzsHUvTF – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPINA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|SOL|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-24 00:44:00

Interest rates should follow us all over.” While he didn’t explicitly name the Federal Reserve, the implication was clear, setting the stage for friction with Fed Chair Jay Powell, who has repeatedly said the institution’s independence from political interference. During his first term that started in 2016, Trump frequently criticized Powell, whom he appointed, calling him a “bonehead” and publicly mocking his decision-making. He even compared Powell to a golfer who can’t sink a putt once in 2017. The Fed’s current benchmark interest rate stands between 4.25% and 4.5%, after three cuts in late 2024. While markets are predicting no immediate rate adjustments during the meeting, traders anticipate a cut as early as June. CME Group data places the probability of another cut before the end of the year at 50%. Speaking to reporters later in the day, Trump doubled down, saying, “I expect the Fed to listen to me. They must. Powell and I will have that conversation at the right time.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose during his speech, while the two-year Treasury yield, which often reacts to policy signals, edged lower. Inflation, private capital, and economic uncertainties Trump also addressed the ongoing inflation crisis, blaming it squarely on the Biden administration. According to Trump, “wasteful deficit spending” under former President Joe Biden created what he called “the worst inflation crisis in modern history.” Food prices, along with nearly every other essential item, skyrocketed, he said, leaving American families to shoulder the burden. The Federal Reserve has faced its share of criticism over inflation as well. The central bank initially dismissed the 2021 inflation surge as “transitory,” a decision that led to aggressive interest rate hikes totaling 5.25% before the recent cuts. Inflation is still above the Fed’s 2% target. During his speech, Trump also touted a $100 billion joint venture between SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle, named Stargate, to develop artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.S. The project plans to eventually invest $500 billion, and is a part of Trump’s vision to unlock private capital and spur growth. Larry Fink, CEO and founder of BlackRock, weighed in during an interview with CNBC at the Davos event. “I’m cautiously optimistic,” he said. “But there are scenarios where this could be pretty bad. Unlocking private capital will drive growth, but it could also create new inflationary pressures.” Larry warned that these pressures could push interest rates higher, potentially destabilizing equity markets. He pointed to the bond market as an indicator of what could come next.

The pseudonymous analyst known as Pentoshi tells his 846,600 followers on the social media platform X that he’s bullish on PENGU , the utility token for the non-fungible token (NFT) project Pudgy Penguins, as well as the memecoin Fwog ( FWOG ). PENGU is trading at $0.0244 at time of writing. The 88th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 4% in the past 24 hours. FWOG is trading at $0.187 at time of writing. The 380th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down nearly 5% in the past day. Pentoshi also notes that crypto market sentiment is currently “extremely low.” “Here are the charts for the market and alts. What happened? Over-trading is likely a big one, getting chopped on low time frames and not respecting trends or larger ranges. Trading good coins/assets for bad ones, trying to make it overnight, taking too large of risk on low percentage plays, and obviously returns this cycle will diminish bigly in alts as this cycle will be the smallest by far in terms of percentage returns when it’s all said and done for a number of reasons we’ve already discussed. But if you look at the market as a whole, the sentiment and charts don’t align currently.” Source: Pentoshi/X Source: Pentoshi/X Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

This development follows the network’s recent upgrade to its consensus mechanism, adding new capabilities for participants. The staking rewards initiative is expected to increase engagement and strengthen the blockchain’s ecosystem, potentially influencing ALGO price. Algorand Launches Real-Time Staking Rewards for Validators The Algorand blockchain network has unveiled its new staking rewards program, which offers real-time payouts to validators. Validators proposing blocks on the network will earn a minimum of 10 ALGO per block, alongside 50% of transaction fees from the successfully proposed blocks. The rewards are set to decay by 1% for every one million blocks generated. More so, the program, introduced after the network’s recent consensus mechanism upgrade, eliminates measures such as slashing and token lockups. Unlike other proof-of-stake networks, Algorand allows validators to maintain full access to their tokens. This ensures a secure staking environment. Meanwhile, earlier this month, Algorand-linked Exodus Wallet became the first crypto firm to go public on the NYSE American after overcoming SEC rejection in May. Non-Inflationary Supply Supports ALGO’s Market Appeal One of the key features of Algorand’s staking program is its non-inflationary rewards system. The staking rewards are distributed without impacting the total supply of ALGO, maintaining the token’s scarcity. This differentiates Algorand from other networks like Ethereum and Solana, where staking rewards often result in inflationary pressures on the native token. The Algorand Foundation highlighted that the staking rewards program will boost network participation while preserving the blockchain’s long-term economic stability. Participants can engage in liquid staking through platforms like Folks Finance and Tinyman, or use delegated staking options on Pact and Valar. ALGO Price Action and Prediction Algorand’s new staking rewards program comes as its native token, ALGO, trades at $0.4106. The blockchain native token has seen a 1.24% increase over the past 24 hours, with a market capitalization of $3.44 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $275.63 million. Moreover, technical indicators suggest potential bullish momentum for ALGO price. The 7-day Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows a positive crossover, with the MACD line above the signal line. This alignment indicates growing bullish momentum. More so, increasing histogram bars support the bullish momentum, suggesting buyers are gaining control of the market. The gradual upward trend in the MACD signals a potential continuation of bullish activity. Source: TradingView Similarly, the symmetrical triangle pattern visible on the chart signals a bullish breakout as the price consolidates within narrowing trendlines. This formation often precedes significant price movements. With ALGO price trading near the upper boundary of the triangle, a breakout above $0.50 could confirm a strong upward move. The declining volume during consolidation further validates the pattern, hinting at an impending volatility surge.

Research is already underway, and a roadmap for development puts 2050 as the start of practical application. Regional media from Japan reports that investment and holdings powerhouse Softbank is looking to combine cultured cell tissue with artificial intelligence to create “next generation” AI capabilities and save on energy consumption. The story, which sounds like something out of a sci-fi thriller, details that the Softbank Research Institute of Advanced Technology is working with The University of Tokyo to “use brain tissue cultured from iPS cells to directly incorporate the energy-saving and flexible learning ability of the human brain into computing.” Whether this is something credible (if highly controversial) or just a clever way to spend grant money while creating a buzz, is really anyone’s guess. But with the focused, global push from politicians and technocratic corporations for integrating AI into everyday life, and the extreme push to implement AI governance in Japan , the development is noteworthy. Softbank’s vision for BPU (Brain Processing Units) The Friday morning (JST) Toyokeizai write-up explains that while large-scale AI operations currently use a lot of power for computation, the human brain typically requires only about 20 watts for everyday thinking and integration of new data. “We aim to realize it as a new accelerator that coexists with conventional CPUs, GPUs, and quantum computers,” Softbank researcher Sota Sugimura is quoted as saying. But, where do the cells come from? The so-called “brain cells” are created via iPS cells (induced pluripotent stem cells). Project researchers have created what they call “brain organoids” from these cells, which are spherical in shape and measure about o.5 – 1 centimeter in size, containing nerve cells and glial cells. Photo depicting “organoids,” which mimic brain tissue, in a combined state. Source : Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo. According to the report, the organoids have shown reactions to “reward” and “penalty” stimuli, and “a phenomenon that seems to be learning specific to brain cells” was observed. But project researchers note this experiment is still in its early stages, and there are ethical questions to be considered. Further, Toyokeizai’s Toru Ishii details that the cells often react differently to the same stimulus, as they are derived from living organisms with inherent differences. While Softbank R&D researcher Keisuke Asakura is quoted as comparing the organoids to a “baby’s brain” stage, that seems quite a stretch, as at present the experiment is basically electrifying tiny samples of tissue in the lab. Nothing akin to the ineffably rich cognition, feedback, and creativity of an actual human infant. As for a roadmap for the project, “SoftBank aims to apply it as a small, energy-saving sensor by around 2030, expand it to robot control and complex motor tasks around 2040, and further develop it into fields that require advanced judgment, such as autonomous driving and creative fields, from 2050 onwards,” the report explains.

This sharp rise in token burns indicates a growing interest in decreasing the overall supply of SHIB. Moreover, it has raised the possibility that the SHIB price could follow suit, as increased token burn often influences a cryptocurrency’s price movements. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Skyrockets Over 600% Shibburn, the official Shiba Inu token burn tracker, has just reported a dramatic increase in burn rate, with over 3.24 million SHIB tokens permanently removed from circulation. The tracking platform revealed that the SHIB token burn rate shot up by approximately 612.78% in less than 24 hours. This spike represents one of the most significant one-day increases in recent weeks. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Skyrockets 1,068% Amid Market Bleed, Can Bullishness Push Price Above $0.00003 Again? Typically, a surge in a token’s burn rate is largely attributed to community-led initiatives focused on reducing the cryptocurrency’s supply and potentially inducing scarcity. Considering the large size and strong dedication of the Shiba Inu community, it’s not uncommon to see occasional spikes in burn rates. The community has been a strong advocate for token burns, believing that a supply reduction could trigger a price surge for SHIB. Despite the latest burn and substantial decrease in SHIB’s circulating supply, the meme coin’s price has yet to demonstrate any significant upward movement. In fact, Shiba Inu appears to be on a downtrend, as CoinMarketCap reports a 1.6% decline in the last 24 hours and a previous 9.3% drop over the past week. Currently, the price of SHIB is trading at $0.00002, experiencing no recent increases, while its 24-hour trading volume has crashed by 46.33%. Nevertheless, this lack of immediate price action and present bearish conditions does not rule out the potential for a future rally in Shiba Inu. Supporting this possibility of a bull trend driven by heightened token burns, crypto analyst Rananjay Singh commented on the recent 612% spike in the Shiba Inu burn rate on X (formerly Twitter). Singh explained that when a cryptocurrency’s supply declines and demand stays strong, prices tend to increase significantly. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price To $0.000045? Here Are The Major Support And Resistances To Watch Out For The analyst suggests that increased token burns, upcoming updates in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, and the growing excitement among community members could potentially trigger substantial gains for the meme coin in 2025. What’s Next For The SHIB Price? ‘Shib Spain,’ a popular SHIB supporter on X, has predicted that a massive pump could be on the horizon for the meme coin. The analyst connects Ethereum’s price action with Shiba Inu’s, sharing a detailed chart that showed instances when ETH experienced a price reversal and underwent a significant rally. Although the meme coin was not indicated on the chart, the analyst’s mention likely ties his projected SHIB price pump to an increase in ETH. This suggests that if Ethereum experiences a price surge, altcoins like Shiba Inu could follow suit, potentially sparking a significant uptrend.

Fathom Holdings announced on January 23 that it can use up to 50% of its surplus cash reserve to nourish its Bitcoin reserve. The enterprise aims to grant up to $500,000 toward BTC or Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, they noted that they would adjust the allocation to align with the firm’s performance requirements and market circumstances. Bitcoin is critical as a hedge currency risk CFO Joanne Zach of Fathom Holdings is upbeat that the decision to establish a Bitcoin reserve shows their zeal to diversify their treasure holdings. Bitcoin is a decentralized store of value that has been highly adopted since 2023. Zach stated: The integration of Bitcoin into commercial and financial strategies has accelerated across financial markets, positioning it as both a hedge against inflation and a safeguard against economic and currency risks in the global economy . Joanne Zach The announcement did not trigger changes in Fathom’s stock price. It trades around $1.33 per share and has a market cap of approximately $30 million. Fathom CEO Marco Fregenal indicated that they have always been innovators in the digital economy, and having a Bitcoin reserve aligns with their mission. Moreover, the entity plans to enable Bitcoin as a payment option to drive real estate transactions through its software platforms. Corporations and institutions are rapidly adopting Bitcoin Zach said that Fathom chose to go with Bitcoin partly due to corporations’ and institutions’ rapid adoption of digital assets. In their first 11 months of trading, the US spot Bitcoin ETFs broke $100 billion in net assets, marking the most successful ETF launch ever. According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET , more than 70 publicly traded funds have acquired Bitcoin and jointly own more than $64 billion worth of BTC. However, MicroStrategy holds more than three-quarters of the BTC. Other famous tech companies have also submitted a proposal to establish a Bitcoin treasury. Meta and Microsoft are in the queue to create a reserve. However, Microsoft has already voted against the adoption of Bitcoin.

Trump Executive Order (TRUMPEO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPEO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Executive Order can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Executive Order could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Executive Order launched with over $25,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Executive Order on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Executive Order by entering its contract address – Guze7ScXTVo3JPwojxcVX5P7EEcC5ncAByrA47QJ6JzT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPEO.

The latest Polkadot price predictions indicate a wide span, from $5.82 to $23.45, highlighting the uncertainty in DOT’s short-term path. Meanwhile, major players acquiring over 250,000 LTC have sparked a Litecoin (LTC) rally, lifting its price past $120. In the meantime, BlockDAG’s LAUNCH300 promotion has ignited a purchasing spree among big players! They are seizing this opportunity, which offers a 300% bonus on BlockDAG (BDAG) coins, positioning it as the best crypto coin to buy. This boost in activity has propelled BlockDAG’s presale to $183.5 million, with batch 27 almost sold out. Polkadot Price Predictions for 2025 Polkadot price predictions for 2025 vary widely. Currently valued around $6.80 with a market cap of $11.92 billion, some analysts believe it might range between $5.82 and $18.01, with a high target of $23.45 if positive trends hold. Other sources, like DigitalCoinPrice, predict DOT could reach $16.00–$17.04 by the end of the year, possibly climbing to $28.04 by 2027. However, potential setbacks such as cyber-attacks could push its price down to $11.00. Market fluctuations and new developments will be crucial in determining DOT’s price trajectory. Litecoin (LTC) Rally: Exploring the 19% Jump Litecoin has seen a significant 19% jump in the last 24 hours, driving its price over $120. This notable rally distinguishes itself in the current market climate. A key factor for this Litecoin (LTC) rally is the increased involvement of major investors. Data from on-chain analytics provider Santiment shows these large stakeholders have been amassing Litecoin, with a total of 250,000 LTC (about $30 million) bought in the recent week. This surge in accumulation by major holders is likely powering the ongoing Litecoin (LTC) rally. The sustainability of this rally will hinge on the big players’ future actions. Big Rewards with BlockDAG’s LAUNCH300: Triple Your BDAG Instantly! BlockDAG’s LAUNCH300 promotion offers a substantial 300% bonus on each BDAG purchase, making it the most generous deal by BlockDAG to date, allowing participants to triple their stash at no additional cost. The promotion arrives at an opportune moment, with BlockDAG’s presale already amassing $183.5 million, signaling a surge in big purchases. With the presale nearing its $600 million goal, confidence in the project remains high. This robust presale performance and support from major participants suggest that BDAG could hit $1 by 2025. Priced at $0.0248 in batch 27, early entrants have the chance for a substantial 3932% gain if BDAG reaches $1. Those who got in early have seen returns of 2380%, solidifying its status as the best crypto coin to buy currently. The LAUNCH300 is also an excellent opportunity for participants to dive into the BDAG ecosystem and immediately enhance their holdings. For instance, purchasing 1,000 BDAG now would yield an additional 3,000 BDAG, totaling 4,000 coins. Many have quickly acted to secure BDAG at this price to optimize their gains. With batch 27 nearly sold out and prices set to increase in the next phase, acting now is crucial. The 300% bonus offer is limited, and buying now could lead to significant growth by 2025. Wrapping Up the Top Crypto Pick for 2025 Polkadot price predictions range from $5.82 to $23.45, indicating market uncertainty and fluctuations. Meanwhile, the recent Litecoin (LTC) rally has pushed its price over $120, though its future remains uncertain. Yet, BlockDAG’s potential outshines others, with predictions setting a $1 price by the 2025 mainnet launch. Strong backing by big purchasers has pushed the crypto presale towards its $600 million goal. For those seeking the highest returns for the least expense, BlockDAG’s LAUNCH300 bonus positions it as the best crypto coin to buy for 2025. But with the window closing soon, swift action is advised to secure a possible 3932% return if BDAG reaches $1.

Among those most affected could be Tether (USDT), a cornerstone of the crypto economy known for its role in providing liquidity and stability. Recent legislative proposals in the United States aim to enforce strict reserve requirements for stablecoins, sparking concerns that Tether, known for its opaque reserve disclosures, could face delisting from major exchanges. This regulatory uncertainty makes it a precarious time for Tether investors. However, as one door may be closing, another opens with Web3Bay (3BAY), a rising blockchain-based e-commerce platform, which is not only navigating these turbulent waters but is also projected to offer a staggering 10,000% ROI by the end of 2025, according to its current presale momentum and market predictions. Regulatory Challenges Faced By Tether Tether, the dominant player in the stablecoin market, is under severe scrutiny due to its reserve management practices. Proposed U.S. legislation that requires stablecoins to have full reserve backing could severely impact Tether’s listing on major exchanges. This legislation comes amid longstanding concerns about Tether’s transparency and the true backing of its USDT tokens. Historically, Tether claimed that each token was backed one-to-one by U.S. dollars, but revelations have shown that its reserves are also held in other assets, which may not always be as liquid or stable as U.S. dollars. The potential for Tether to be delisted stems from these regulatory pressures, compounded by investigations and criticisms from financial authorities that question the adequacy of its reserve holdings. These issues not only risk Tether’s ability to operate under new regulations but also undermine user and investor confidence. Web3Bay: An Emerging Giant with Promising Prospects In contrast to Tether’s regulatory woes, Web3Bay presents a lucrative opportunity. This blockchain-driven e-commerce platform has swiftly gained traction by capitalizing on the need for more secure and transparent online transactions. Recently, Web3Bay announced a significant milestone for its ongoing presale, raising $870,000 in just under 4 stages, which solidifies its market position and underscores strong investor confidence. If you were to invest $1,000 in Web3Bay tokens at the current price of $0.004562, you could purchase approximately 219,211 tokens. Looking ahead, if Web3Bay’s token price reaches the expected launch price of $0.10 by the end of 2025, the value of your investment would soar. Specifically, your 219,211 tokens would then be worth $21,921.10. This represents a substantial increase, turning your initial $1,000 investment into over $21,921.10—an impressive return on investment of about 2,092%, which is a significant gain for any investor looking for opportunities within the emerging blockchain technology market. However, given the current momentum of its presale and the optimistic market sentiment surrounding it, there’s potential for the price to climb even higher, possibly reaching up to $0.50 per token. Should this happen, your initial investment could soar to $109,605.50, delivering an ROI of approximately 10,000%. Key Takeaways the cryptocurrency sector is approaching a critical juncture, particularly for stablecoins like Tether, which are bracing for potential upheavals due to upcoming U.S. regulatory changes. These changes, aimed at enforcing strict reserve requirements, could significantly disrupt Tether’s operations, potentially leading to its delisting from major exchanges. This regulatory uncertainty casts a shadow over Tether’s stability and reliability as a safe haven within the crypto market. In contrast, this period of uncertainty for Tether highlights a significant opportunity for investors to pivot towards more promising and innovative cryptocurrencies. Web3Bay, a blockchain-based e-commerce platform, is emerging as a particularly attractive alternative. With its robust presale performance suggesting a potential for up to 10,000% ROI by the end of 2025, Web3Bay stands out not just for its impressive financial prospects but also for its strategic positioning at the intersection of blockchain technology and digital commerce. This platform exemplifies how the integration of blockchain can revolutionize traditional industries, making it a beacon for potential growth and substantial returns. For investors and market participants, the current scenario underscores the importance of adaptability and strategic foresight. While Tether faces challenges, the rise of platforms like Web3Bay showcases the dynamic nature of the crypto market and the continuous evolution of blockchain applications.

John E. Deaton, a prominent attorney known for advocating on behalf of XRP, has shared insights into what it would take to establish such a reserve. Deaton emphasized that the legal and regulatory framework will play a critical role in determining the future of a national digital asset stockpile. John Deaton Stance on Strategic Bitcoin Reserve In a bid to clear the air on the “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” term, Pro XRP lawyer John E. Deaton weighed in on the matter. To him, the meaning of an SBR differ depending on the context in which it is being used. Deaton also noted that an SBR can simply consist in keeping the seized Bitcoin and other digital currencies in a virtual vault instead of selling them. In addition, he said this could be done under the overseeing of the president through the issuance of an executive order. John Deaton said, “If you want to call that a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, then I am sure that we will get one.” However, he noted that in case of an SBR where government is directly buying Bitcoin, this would require a law. He mentioned the bill proposed by Senator Cynthia Lummis as an example of how such a policy could be implemented. Moreover, with Senator Cynthia Lummis’ new role as chair in the Senate’s Digital Assets Subcommittee, experts including Binance founder CZ have shown optimism for the strategic Bitcoin reserve. Trump’s Executive Order and “Stockpile” Terminology President Donald Trump has recently issued an executive order which is aimed at the creation of a national digital asset reserve. The order created a working group that was to study the possibility of developing and maintaining such a stockpile. The language of the order only indicated the term “stockpile” not “reserve.” According to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, there was a difference between these two terms: “Trump was very particular even as far back as this summer at the Bitcoin conference to say ‘Stockpile’ and not ‘Reserve.’” This points more towards the administration not being in the market to buy Bitcoin but rather to keep certain assets within the government. The working group is expected to recommend guidelines for the stockpile control, which may involve assets acquired in accordance with the law enforcement activities. During these speculations, Pierre Rochard, the Vice President of Research at Riot Platforms, stated that Ripple Labs has been against the formation of a Bitcoin-centric reserve. Rochard alleged that the company was using its power to advance its own digital currency, XRP, over Bitcoin, which is something that the CEO of Ripple has dismissed . Status of U.S. Government Crypto Holdings Concurrrently, data from Arkham Intelligence reveals the extent of cryptocurrency holdings currently under U.S. government control. These holdings are mainly the property acquired through the police operations. Currently, the government’s digital asset portfolio consists of 198,109 BTC with a market capitalization of about $20 billion and lesser amounts of Ethereum, stablecoins, and other tokens.. The executive order as a result does not impose on the government to keep all these assets for an unspecified period. Instead, it prescribes the need to develop guidelines that can be used to determine which assets should be kept. Analyst Alex Thorn highlighted that the language of the order suggests that not all the seized assets would be permanently retained. Similarly, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart has also noted the feasibility of this approach, saying, “Honestly a very logical and measured approach to this, in my opinion.” The post Pro XRP Lawyer Reveals Requirement To Create Strategic Bitcoin Reserve appeared first on CoinGape .",Uncategorized|Bitcoin Reserve|Donald Trump Crypto|John Deaton,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|XRP|REGULATION|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-01-24 02:12:06

Think about Cardano’s journey—it started at mere pennies, and by 2021, it skyrocketed to an all-time high of $3.101. Stories like these are a harsh reminder of missed opportunities that could’ve changed your life. But while regret doesn’t pay the bills, learning from it might. The good news? A new crypto gem is making waves, and you still have a chance to join early. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) —the next big crypto to explode, according to analysts. Unlike its predecessors, which focused on singular functionalities, Qubetics is revolutionizing the space by solving real-world problems, uniting blockchains, and creating tools that businesses and individuals can actually use. With its presale currently in the 18th stage, this could be your golden opportunity to secure a spot before it’s too late. Qubetics Could Be the Opportunity You’ve Been Waiting For If you’re feeling the sting of missing out on Cardano or other early crypto opportunities, Qubetics is here to turn that around. Let’s be real: you might’ve missed the exclusive Qubetics whitelist, where early birds got a chance to sign up with no upfront investment. Back then, tokens were offered at an incredibly low $0.01 for those lucky enough to get notified early. Fast forward to today, and the project is in its 18th presale stage, now priced at $0.0551. If you think you’ve missed your chance again, think twice—it’s still affordable and packed with massive potential. Every presale stage for Qubetics lasts only seven days and ends with a 10% price increase. That means waiting too long could push it out of your budget faster than you think. With over $10.4 million already raised, more than 435 million tokens sold, and 15,700+ holders backing it, the momentum is undeniable. Analysts are already predicting that $TICS could hit $1 after the presale ends, offering a potential ROI of 1713.57%. But that’s not all—Qubetics isn’t just another crypto. It’s the world’s first Web3 aggregator, uniting leading blockchains under one ecosystem. Its QubeQode IDE , a cutting-edge development platform, is a game-changer. Imagine a drag-and-drop interface allowing businesses to integrate blockchain functionalities like token management and user authentication into their apps seamlessly. For example, a small e-commerce store can integrate blockchain-based loyalty programs without needing a team of developers. A freelance creator could set up smart contracts for secure payments in minutes. And enterprises? They can scale operations with tokenized assets and decentralized apps, cutting costs and complexity. Missed opportunities like Cardano don’t come back. But with Qubetics presale still live, you can make the right call today. Investing $750 at the current price of $0.0551 could get you approximately 13,614 $TICS tokens. If Qubetics hits $1 after the presale, that’s a cool $13,614. And if it soars to $10 after the mainnet launch in Q2 2025, you’re looking at $136,140. You don’t want to regret missing this one. Toncoin’s ICO Success and Current Growth Toncoin, originally launched as part of Telegram’s blockchain initiative, is another example of an ICO success story that’s hard to ignore. Its ICO price was a modest $0.10, offering early investors a rare opportunity to get in on the ground floor. However, after legal troubles with the SEC, Telegram had to step away from the project, and the community took over. Despite the initial hiccups, Toncoin has made a remarkable comeback. As of today, Toncoin trades at around $5.20, showcasing impressive growth since its initial offering. The coin now powers the TON blockchain, a highly scalable and efficient network optimized for dApps and cross-chain transactions. The ecosystem has drawn attention for its user-friendly integration with Telegram, allowing seamless crypto transactions for millions of users globally. For example, a small business using Telegram could integrate Toncoin payments to accept crypto seamlessly from its customers. This streamlined approach has made Toncoin a favorite for utility-focused use cases. And with its growing adoption, the project continues to gain momentum. The takeaway? Early investment in ICOs like Toncoin can lead to significant returns, as its current price is 52 times its initial offering. If you missed out on Toncoin back in the day, Qubetics might just be your second shot at life-changing gains. Don’t Let Regret Define Your Future Missing out on projects like Cardano and Toncoin is tough, but it’s also a wake-up call. Cryptos like Qubetics don’t come around every day, and the potential ROI here is hard to ignore. With its presale currently at $0.0551 and predictions of hitting $1 or even $10 post-mainnet launch, this could be your opportunity to turn the tables. So why wait? The clock is ticking on Qubetics’ presale, and with each stage lasting only seven days and ending with a 10% price hike, time is literally money. Join the Qubetics presale now and secure your spot in what analysts are calling the next big crypto to explode . Your future self might just thank you for it.

US SEC Withdraws Controversial SAB 121 The U.S. SEC has posted a notice on its website that SAB 121 that was released in 2022 was withdrawn with the release of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 122 . SAB 121 stated that companies that have custody of cryptocurrencies for their clients must recognize these crypto-assets as liabilities in their financial statements. The guidance had come under much criticism from the crypto industry and lawmakers, stating that the rule raised compliance costs and deterred banks from offering digital asset custody services. Meanwhile, the SEC noted that instead of following the guidance provided in the statement, entities should continue to use the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or International Accounting Standards (IAS) to account for the crypto assets. Hester Peirce, a SEC commissioner and now the head of the agency’s recently created crypto unit, expressed support for the move. “Bye, bye SAB 121! It’s not been fun,” Peirce shared on X (previously Twitter) on Thursday. She had earlier described it as a rather rigid policy that is disadvantageous to the growth of innovation. Criticism and Legal Challenges Surrounding SAB 121 Since its introduction, SAB 121 has been criticized by the crypto industry and members of both parties in Congress. Critics had complained that the rule was introduced in the absence of a proper public consultation process and that it was aimed at firms in the digital asset industry specifically. The banking industry also voiced out its concern, saying that the rule hampers their capacity to give out custodial services for the digital assets. The US SEC’s former chairman Gary Gensler, who backed the rule, said it was needed to safeguard investors in case of bankruptcies. Gensler provided examples of bankruptcy courts claims that customer cryptocurrency was not shielded from creditors, and, therefore, the need to put more measures in place. Nonetheless, in 2024, Congress tried to repeal SAB 121 through a bipartisan resolution by passing it in both the House and the Senate. However, the resolution was vetoed by then President Joe Biden. It remained effective up to the Thursday announcement in light of leadership switch at the SEC as well as beginning of a new administration under pro-crypto President Donald Trump who has affirmed his intention to make US a home for crypto. Leadership Change Marks New Direction for the US SEC Gary Gensler has stepped down as the US SEC Chair this week, and Mark Uyeda, the Republican Commissioner, has taken over as the acting chair. On Tuesday, Uyeda released members of the crypto task force led by Hester Peirce to tackle the crypto asset regulation. “The SEC has primarily relied on enforcement actions to regulate crypto, which has created uncertainty,” the SEC said in a statement. “Clarity and practical solutions for those seeking compliance have been elusive.” The task force wants to introduce a clearer and more predictable approach to regulating cryptocurrencies. This change has been made after a long time of criticism that Gensler has taken a reactive and punitive approach while at the SEC. Industry and Lawmakers Welcome the Decision The crypto industry and banking sector have hailed the withdrawal of SAB 121 as a move towards promoting innovation and decreasing the regulatory burden. Paige Pidano Paridon, co-head of the Bank Policy Institute’s regulatory affairs, said that the decision would allow the banks to regain their capacity for being the secure guardians of digital assets. At the same time, the lawmakers who voted against SAB 121 also announced their support. Pro-crypto Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, the new digital assets subcommittee chair from Wyoming called the rule “disastrous” and celebrated its removal. Mike Flood, the representative who proposed a resolution to repeal SAB 121 in 2024, characterized the withdrawal as a positive sign of bipartisan support and shift in US crypto policy.

The Japanese crypto market lags behind other regions, with only 8% penetration and limited demand for altcoins beyond BTC, ETH, and XRP. Coincheck's valuation is high at 13 times book value, and I see too many risks in longing CNCK at this time. In early December, Coincheck Group N.V. ( CNCK ) became one of the latest Nasdaq-listed crypto-businesses through a SPAC merger with Thunder Bridge Capital Partners IV, Inc. ( THCP ). Following the completion of the deal, Coincheck is just the second company listed on the Nasdaq after Coinbase ( COIN ) to primarily operate a cryptocurrency exchange business. Though headquartered in the Netherlands, Coincheck operates a Japan-based exchange. In this article, we'll look at the company's past financial performance, balance sheet, and the cryptocurrency market in Japan. Coincheck Business Segments Revenue Segment Breakout FY24 (Coincheck) Coincheck Group N.V. primarily operates the Coincheck cryptocurrency exchange. Transaction revenue makes up 92.5% of the company's total revenue with the remaining 7.5% of revenue derived from products like NFTs, IEOs, wholesale services, subscriptions, and on/off ramp fees. In the transaction revenue segment, Coincheck's gross margins have generally been in decline for each of the last three years. For FY year ended March 2022, 2023, and 2024, Coincheck's margin between sales and COGS was 4.05%, 3.45%, and 3.45% respectively. That number is even slightly lower at 3.39% as of six months ended September: Coincheck The good news is Coincheck grew revenue by 130% year over year in the six months ended September and flipped from a net loss in the 2023 period to a $3.2 million gain through the first half of FY 2025. Coincheck While the company has flipped back to net profit to begin its fiscal year, top line revenue is well below the highs from fiscal years 2021 and 2022. Coincheck's exchange business operates only in Japan, and that market has historically under-performed other jurisdictions from a market penetration standpoint. The Japanese Crypto Market As I see it, Coincheck is a bet on the expansion of the Japanese cryptocurrency market. The company claims the top market position in the Japanese crypto consumer market with 20% share and 2.1 million accounts. This is a market that currently lags other jurisdictions from a crypto-holder penetration standpoint according to Coincheck's November investor deck. 17% of the United States population is estimated to hold cryptocurrencies in some form while less than 8% of Japan's population holds crypto. Coincheck This is in spite of a crypto-regulatory environment in Japan that is more established than the United States. Interestingly, US-headquartered crypto exchange businesses Coinbase and Kraken both left the Japan market due to softness in the broad crypto market several years ago. Kraken cited focused use of resources in other jurisdictions as one of the reasons for leaving Japan. There are two ways to look at that; on one hand, it could be a clear sign that market demand for crypto is limited in Japan. On the other hand, it's an indication that Coincheck has less competition in Japan if that consumer demand should ever return to previous highs. The company offers prospective shareholders solid insight on market expense and user acquisition costs. Coincheck Through the first half of 2024, market expenses have exceeded revenue generated from users who have completed the know-your-customer on-boarding process. Cost per user increased to $46 during the April-June 2024 quarter. Each of these signals - customer acquisition costs exceeding revenue from new users and cost of acquisition approaching/exceeding $50 - were signs of exhaustion in the crypto market during the 2021 bull run. Balance Sheet The overwhelming majority of assets on Coincheck's balance sheet are customer assets: Assets (Coincheck) As of the end of September 2024, Coincheck had total assets of 690.4 billion yen, 85% of which are safeguarded assets with an additional 7% made up of segregated deposits. The company has 10.6 billion yen in cash and equivalents against 1.4 billion in total non-current liabilities: Liabilities as of Sept 2024 (Coincheck) Coincheck also operates a lending and borrowing service with customers and discloses 35.6 billion yen in crypto assets held against the 35.5 billion yen in crypto borrowings. The safeguard assets are mainly Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) with the two coins accounting for 83% of safeguard assets: Safeguard assets breakout (Coincheck) XRP ( XRP-USD ) makes up another 10% of total safeguard assets. Meaning just 7% of the customer crypto assets that are held through Coincheck are assets other than BTC, ETH, and XRP. This says to me that in addition to lagging the broad crypto penetration observed in other jurisdictions, the Japan market seems to have very little appetite for cryptocurrencies outside of those that are near the top of the market capitalization list. Risks Observing CNCK through some basic valuation multiples, it's hard to make the argument that the company is 'cheap' at a $1.2 billion valuation. Coincheck's truest peer in the market is Coinbase. I've made no bones about my view that COIN stock is overvalued fundamentally in past SA articles. I still hold that view on COIN and CNCK is arguably even more expensive : Data by YCharts At 13 times book value, CNCK is trading at nearly double the valuation of COIN. At about a $1 billion in first half FY 2025 top line revenue, CNCK is trading at an annualized sales multiple of 6 - this is actually a bit cheaper than COIN but well beyond the 3x financial sector median. It's important to point out that since Coincheck operates in just one country, there is a considerable amount of jurisdiction risk at play in longing CNCK. First, there is currency risk in the yen. While the BOJ is expected to increase rates by 25 bps on January 24th, a 0.5% interest rate would be the highest short term rate in Japan since 2007. Higher rates from the BOJ could pose a risk to the broader market as well if last summer was any indication . Second, global insurgents could theoretically take share from Coincheck if the Japanese market were to ever sniff the interest in cryptocurrencies that it had back in 2021. Finally, Coincheck's user base is primarily buying BTC and ETH through the platform. If spot ETFs are approved in Japan, it could potentially diminish the need for Coincheck in the eyes of the company's user base. Closing Summary I think there are too many risks in longing CNCK. There is valuation risk, single jurisdiction risk, and market risk. Demand for crypto assets in Japan simply has not been as robust as it is in the rest of the world. Furthermore, the market demand for altcoins in Japan doesn't appear to be existent at all judging by Coincheck's balance sheet. With 93% of safeguard assets sitting in BTC, ETH, and XRP - Coincheck's customer does not go very far down the market cap list for digital asset exposure. I see very little switching cost for the consumer if BTC, ETH, and XRP are the only assets that have real market demand. And given the fact that Coincheck's marketing spend through the first half of 2024 was already outpacing revenue from on-boarded customers, I just don't have a lot of confidence in CNCK position at this point in time.",CNCK,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|ASIA|EXCHANGE|BTC,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-24 02:55:40

Crypto Exchange Phemex Suspends Withdrawals After Suspicious Transactions,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/30-million-hack-alert-crypto-exchange-phemex-suspends-withdrawals-after-suspicious-transactions/,"Crypto exchange Phemex appears to have been the victim of a multi-million exploit on Thursday, according to online reports. Millions worth of USDT, USDC, Ethereum (ETH), and other crypto assets were stolen from the exchange’s hot wallets, resulting in a temporary half of withdrawals. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) To $300 This Month? ‘All Bets Are Off’ Once It Reclaims This Level Phemex Suffers First Crypto Exchange Hack Of 2025 On Thursday morning, the first crypto exchange hack of the year hit the industry. Multiple reports revealed suspicious activity involving Phemex’s hot wallets was taking place over several chains. Blockchain security firm Cyvvers shared on X it had detected multiple transactions to several suspicious wallets on different chains, “including BNB, ETH, OP, POL, BASE, and ARB.” The security firm’s initial report stated that over $29 million worth of crypto had been transferred to the suspicious addresses, later raising the sum. “Upon deeper analysis, it has come to light that both BTC and TRON blockchains have also been impacted, with the estimated total loss now reaching approximately $37 million,” the update read. Cyvvers seemingly identified around 125 suspicious transactions spread across the different blockchains and noted that the attackers had started swapping the tokens to Ethereum (ETH) to avoid potential freezing measures. Meanwhile, on-chain data analysis firm Lookonchain broke down the crypto heist, stating that the hack had taken around $31 million worth of crypto assets. According to the analysis, 3.48 million USDC, 3.42 million USDT, and 841 ETH, worth $2.7 million were drained from the exchange’s hot wallet. Additionally, the attackers took 110,701 LINK, 142 billion PEPE, 1.19 million FET, and 29,509 AVAX, valued at around $7.3 million combined. Lookonchain also listed ONDO, TRX, CRV, JASMY, AAVE, SHIB, GRT, and BRETT, as part of the stolen crypto assets. Compensation Plan In The Works After the news, Phemex CEO Federico Variola confirmed the attack on one of the crypto exchange’s hot wallets. Variola assured users that Phemex’s cold wallets remained safe and that they were investigating the reports. The exchange then announced on X the temporary halt of withdrawals due to the emergency inspection and strengthening of the security measures but did not offer further details about the incident. To ensure security, withdrawals have been temporarily suspended while we conduct an emergency inspection and strengthen wallet services. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. Withdrawals will be restored soon. Phemex and the development team apologize for the disruption. Our mission to provide a seamless and trusted trading environment remains firm. Nonetheless, the post stated that ongoing business operations were fine and that trading services continued as usual. Phemex’s team also revealed they are working on a compensation plan, which will be announced soon. It’s worth noting that, in 2024, the number of hacks and total value lost increased from the year prior. According to Chainalysis data, 2024 was the fourth consecutive year in which the funds stolen from crypto hacks exceeded the billion-dollar mark. Related Reading: Number Of New Trump-Themed Malicious Tokens Spike 206% After Official Memecoin Launch Additionally, the total value stolen surged to $2.2 billion last year, and it became the year with the most individual hacks, reaching 303 incidents by December. Centralized exchanges (CEXs) were the most targeted platforms in Q2 and Q3, recording some of the largest incidents in the industry’s history, while Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms accounted for the largest share of stolen assets in Q1, like most quarters between 2021 and 2023.

In 2028, JASMY will range between $0.109 and $0.125, with an average price of $0.117. In 2031, JASMY will range between $0.188 and $0.204, with an average price of $0.196. JASMY aims to use the Internet of Things (IoT) platforms created to store data in a decentralized format. JasmyCoin (JASMY-USD) has quickly gained momentum in 2024, tripling in value and attracting significant interest from investors. Developed by former Sony executives, JasmyCoin offers a unique proposition allowing users to monetize their data. This innovative approach has resonated with investors seeking alternatives to traditional cryptocurrencies. Japanese law strictly governs cryptocurrency transactions subject to Financial Services Agency inspections. There are no restrictions on owning and investing in cryptocurrencies. Some crypto influencers also criticize the project. According to Jerry Banfield’s review on YouTube, red flags include a poor website and zero mentions of the coin utility on the website.

These community-driven projects have taken the world by storm, transforming from internet jokes to billion-dollar assets. For adventurous investors, meme coins represent both high-risk and high-reward opportunities, making them one of the most exciting niches in the crypto ecosystem. This week, one meme coin is rising above the noise: BTFD Coin . With its promising features like staking rewards and a strong community, it’s emerging as a serious contender in the crypto space. As we dive deeper, we’ll also take a look at two iconic players in the meme coin world—Dogecoin and Shiba Inu—to see how they compare to this up-and-coming gem. BTFD Coin: The Staking Dynamo with 90% APY BTFD Coin, short for “Buy The Dip,” is grabbing headlines as one of the top meme coins to invest in right now. It’s not just the name that’s catchy; the coin brings serious features to the table, making it a standout in a crowded market. With a focus on passive income through staking, BTFD Coin offers investors an unparalleled opportunity to grow their portfolio while holding their coins. What truly sets BTFD Coin apart is its staking feature, which boasts a jaw-dropping 90% annual percentage yield (APY). For those new to staking, this means your coins earn you additional rewards just for holding them in the network. It’s the kind of innovative approach that appeals to both seasoned investors and crypto newcomers looking for long-term returns. The project doesn’t stop there. BTFD Coin also boasts a vibrant community, complete with unique characters like Baby Bull and Raging Bull that add a playful yet engaging twist to the project. The coin’s Play-to-Earn (P2E) game further deepens its ecosystem, rewarding players while promoting a fun and interactive environment. Now, let’s talk numbers. BTFD Coin is in its 14th presale stage, with over $5.5 million raised and more than 66 billion coins sold. With a presale price of $0.00016, early investors stand to gain significantly once the coin launches. If BTFD Coin achieves its post-launch target of $0.0006, a $1,000 investment today could turn into $3,750. And if it reaches $0.006 in the long run, you’d be looking at a staggering $37,500—truly cementing its place among the top meme coins to invest in. Dogecoin: The OG Meme Coin That Keeps Delivering When it comes to meme coins, Dogecoin is the undeniable pioneer. What started as a lighthearted joke in 2013 has since evolved into a household name, supported by a devoted community and endorsements from influential figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s simplicity and accessibility have always been its strength. It’s widely used for tipping, donations, and even as a payment method at select retailers. While its use cases might not be as expansive as newer tokens, its reputation as the “original” meme coin keeps it relevant in the ever-changing crypto world. In recent months, Dogecoin has seen renewed interest, partly due to institutional support and its potential use in real-world applications like Tesla’s rumored payment integrations. For investors, its long history and strong market capitalization make it a relatively stable choice in the volatile meme coin market. Though it may lack the explosive growth potential of newer coins like BTFD, Dogecoin remains a must-have for anyone exploring the top meme coins to invest in. Shiba Inu: From Meme to Multi-Utility Powerhouse Shiba Inu, often dubbed the “Dogecoin killer,” has built a reputation as one of the most ambitious meme coins in the market. Launched in 2020, Shiba Inu has evolved from being a simple meme token to an ecosystem that includes decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, a native decentralized exchange (ShibaSwap), and its very own metaverse project. One of Shiba Inu’s biggest draws is its robust tokenomics, including a deflationary burn mechanism that reduces the supply over time. This strategy not only supports price growth but also aligns with long-term investor interests. Its ever-growing community, known as the Shib Army, has been instrumental in driving adoption and building excitement around the project. Recent developments, like the launch of the Shibarium Layer-2 solution, aim to lower transaction costs and make the network more scalable. These advancements put Shiba Inu in a unique position to compete with larger blockchain platforms while maintaining its meme coin charm. If you’re searching for a meme coin with utility and growth potential, Shiba Inu deserves a spot in your portfolio of top meme coins to invest in. Conclusion: BTFD Coin Leads the Pack Meme coins offer a thrilling mix of innovation, community, and potential returns, and this week’s lineup is no exception. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu hold their own as industry heavyweights, BTFD Coin emerges as the top pick for investors seeking something fresh and rewarding. Its 90% APY staking feature, engaging ecosystem, and impressive presale performance make it a standout choice among the top meme coins to invest in this week . With the clock ticking on its presale, now is the perfect time to secure your position in BTFD Coin before the price climbs higher. Whether you’re looking for a stable veteran like Dogecoin, a multi-utility project like Shiba Inu, or the next big thing in meme coins, the opportunities are endless. Happy investing!

There are ongoing discussions among crypto traders about the possibility that the Nollars Network will play a significant role in the upcoming payment system called “Money,” which is being developed for the X social media platform (formerly known as Twitter) by Elon Musk. When will the X payment system ‘MONEY’ Launch? The launch of the MONEY application is anticipated to take place sometime in 2025, and it is expected that Dogecoin (DOGE), the original memecoin, will be a primary cryptocurrency option within this system. Analysts predict that Dogecoin’s value could rise significantly, potentially exceeding $1 from its current price of 36 cents by the time “MONEY” launches. Speculation suggests that the upcoming Nollars Network IES Layer-2 blockchain may influence how Dogecoin is utilized within the X platform. There are several reasons behind this speculation, largely tied to Elon Musk’s rationale for choosing Dogecoin. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin is not a deflationary currency, and its larger token supply makes it psychologically more appealing for transactions. Additionally, Dogecoin operates on its own blockchain, which facilitates fast transactions and app development. However, one limitation of Dogecoin is its lack of cross-chain capabilities. This is where the Nollars Network (NOLA) is thought to make a significant contribution. How Nollars will help The upcoming blockchain aims to address this gap by providing a solution through its IES (Ineffable Exchange System) Layer 2 technology. This will serve as the foundational layer for a future project designed to enable multi-blockchain swaps of memecoins. The Nollars Network’s mainnet is expected to be the core of various decentralized applications, facilitating quicker and more cost-effective transactions for Dogecoin compared to traditional crypto exchanges. The $NOLA token is critical in facilitating these transactions and has seen increasing interest during its presale phase. Notably, large investors in the crypto space have been acquiring substantial amounts of NOLA tokens, suggesting that these informed investors may anticipate significant news forthcoming about the project. So far, 11 investors have purchased sizable amounts of NOLA, reflecting strong support for the ecosystem. Additionally, smaller investors, often referred to as “crypto shrimp and crabs,” have been consistently dollar cost averaging (DCA) into the project. The presale currently offers the $NOLA token at a discounted price of $0.50, presenting a potential profit opportunity for investors. The token is confirmed to launch on crypto exchanges in May at a listing price that is projected to be 66% higher than its initial offering, at 83 cents. The Money application on X is rumored to go live within the second to third quarters of this year, further contributing to speculation that Dogecoin will be the primary choice for peer-to-peer payments within this new ecosystem.",Information,EN,0,0,DOGE|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-24 03:39:04

The bulletin, which mandated that companies holding cryptocurrencies on behalf of clients record these assets as liabilities, was replaced with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 122, signalling a shift in regulatory policy.

It’s not been fun: SEC.gov | Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 122 4:26 am · 24 Jan 2025 10.4K Reply Copy link Read 772 replies Under the updated framework, companies will assess their obligations to safeguard crypto-assets using broader accounting standards, including US GAAP contingency rules and IFRS guidelines. The revisions apply retroactively to fiscal years starting after December 15, 2024, with provisions for early adoption. The withdrawal of SAB 121 comes amid several leadership changes at the SEC. Republican Commissioner Mark Uyeda has assumed the role of acting chair, while a new crypto task force led by Hester Peirce has been established to develop clearer regulatory frameworks. In a statement, the SEC acknowledged the criticisms of its prior enforcement-heavy approach to crypto regulation, describing it as a source of uncertainty. The new task force aims to introduce clarity and practical compliance solutions for the industry. Criticism of the SAB 121 Since its release, SAB 121 faced widespread criticism from the crypto industry, lawmakers, and financial institutions. Opponents argued that the guidance increased compliance costs, deterred banks from offering digital asset custody services, and lacked adequate public consultation. The banking sector voiced concerns that SAB 121 impeded their ability to act as custodians for digital assets, while crypto advocates and lawmakers saw it as a move specifically targeting the digital asset industry. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce described the rule as overly rigid and an obstacle to innovation. Gary Gensler, the former SEC chair who supported the rule, defended it as a necessary measure to protect investors in bankruptcy scenarios, citing cases where customer cryptocurrency assets were not shielded from creditors. However, efforts to repeal SAB 121 in 2024, including a bipartisan resolution passed by Congress, were vetoed by then-President Joe Biden. Reactions to the repeal of SAB 121 The removal of SAB 121 has been welcomed by the crypto industry and financial institutions as a step toward reducing regulatory burdens and fostering innovation. Paige Pidano Paridon, co-head of the Bank Policy Institute’s regulatory affairs, praised the decision, noting that it would enable banks to securely manage digital assets. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a pro-crypto Republican and chair of the Senate’s digital assets subcommittee, called the rule “disastrous” and celebrated its repeal.

Musk Buys XRP (MUSKXRP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKXRP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Buys XRP can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Buys XRP could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Buys XRP launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Buys XRP on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Buys XRP by entering its contract address – FVAvgfVYwkgDkDhuKZ4Js41d64LHUsbMRoVzCyJUExtq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKXRP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|XRP|BUSINESS|DOGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-24 03:49:08

Tokens like TON and Kaspa have shown strong performance in their respective niches, but Web3Bay (3BAY) is emerging as the utility token with the most potential to dominate the market in 2025. With a presale that has already raised over $870,000 and sold more than 225 million tokens, Web3Bay offers a compelling mix of utility, scalability, and ROI potential that makes it stand out.Let’s dive into how utility coins have fared well in the past, why TON and Kaspa are impressive but limited in scope, and why Web3Bay is the token smart investors should be focusing on now. Utility Coins: Proven Winners in Crypto History shows that utility tokens tied to platforms with real-world use cases often see exponential growth in market capitalization. Take Binance Coin (BNB) as an example. Initially launched as a utility token for discounted trading fees on the Binance exchange, BNB expanded its ecosystem to include staking, payments, and even NFTs. This broad utility turned BNB into a top cryptocurrency, with a market cap in the hundreds of billions. Similarly, Ethereum (ETH) transitioned from being a speculative investment to a cornerstone of decentralized applications and smart contracts, driving its value to historic highs. These examples prove that utility tokens offering practical solutions tend to outperform speculative coins over the long term. Web3Bay is poised to follow this trajectory, combining blockchain technology with a decentralized e-commerce platform to create tangible value for users. TON: Telegram’s Token Makes Waves, But With Limits TON (The Open Network) has made headlines as the cryptocurrency associated with Telegram. Its focus on speed and scalability has earned it a loyal following, with features designed to support payments, decentralized applications, and financial services within the Telegram ecosystem. TON’s integration with a massive user base gives it a unique advantage, but its use case remains tightly linked to Telegram, limiting its broader applicability. For investors, this raises a concern: can TON’s utility grow beyond Telegram’s ecosystem? While TON excels at what it does, its reliance on a single platform could restrict its growth in comparison to more versatile tokens like Web3Bay. Web3Bay’s utility extends far beyond a single ecosystem. It addresses global challenges in e-commerce by providing a decentralized marketplace where buyers and sellers can transact without high fees or centralized intermediaries. Kaspa: Fast and Secure, but Niche Kaspa (KAS) has gained attention for its innovative BlockDAG technology, which enables fast and secure transactions with high throughput. It’s particularly appealing to blockchain purists who value efficiency and decentralization. Over the past year, Kaspa has seen significant price growth, reflecting strong market interest in its unique technical approach. However, Kaspa’s utility is primarily focused on being a fast transactional layer, making it highly niche. While Kaspa excels in its core functionality, it lacks the multi-faceted utility that platforms like Web3Bay bring to the table. Web3Bay’s roadmap includes an NFT marketplace, staking rewards, cross-chain compatibility, and decentralized governance. Web3Bay: The Utility Token with Massive ROI Potential Web3Bay combines utility with profitability, making it the ultimate utility token for 2025. Currently priced at $0.004562625 in its fourth presale stage, 3BAY tokens are projected to launch at $0.1959, offering early investors an astounding 6,430% ROI. Compare this to the performance of TON or Kaspa, which have seen gains but lack the scalability and market scope of Web3Bay. Web3Bay’s decentralized e-commerce platform eliminates high fees, enables borderless transactions, and provides users with governance rights through its DAO. For small businesses in developing regions, this is a game-changer, allowing them to reach global markets without the barriers imposed by centralized systems. Let’s consider a scenario: An early investor purchases $1,000 worth of 3BAY tokens at the current presale price. By the time the token hits its launch price, that investment could grow to $42,939. This isn’t just speculation—it’s backed by the platform’s real-world utility and growing adoption. Best Utility Tokens To Keep In Your Watchlist Smart investors know that best utility tokens with broad applications and growing ecosystems are the long-term bets. While TON and Kaspa have their merits, Web3Bay offers unmatched potential for growth and profitability. With $870,000 raised in its presale and a 6,430% ROI on the horizon, Web3Bay is the kind of investment opportunity that doesn’t come around often. Don’t miss your chance to secure 3BAY tokens and be part of a platform that’s reshaping the global economy.

Among the standout contenders is PropiChain , a project rapidly gaining recognition for its real-world applications and massive growth potential. PropiChain and two other emerging AI altcoins are set to redefine blockchain innovation. These tokens aren’t just buzzworthy; they’re built to solve real-world problems while offering investors unprecedented opportunities. In this article, we uncover the top three best AI altcoins for 2025, that could offer explosive 50,000% returns as they break into the mainstream market. Why Dogecoin and Solana Are Facing Stiff Competition from the Best AI Altcoins in 2025 Dogecoin and Solana have dominated the crypto space, but the AI altcoin revolution is quickly changing the game. While Dogecoin’s meme-driven appeal and Solana’s scalability have earned them loyal followings, they’re no match for the potential of the best AI altcoins. These AI tokens integrate blockchain with intelligent solutions, opening up new frontiers that Dogecoin and Solana can’t compete with. As the best AI altcoins market explodes in 2025, investors are focusing on these innovative projects, expecting up to 50,000% returns that far surpass anything Dogecoin or Solana can offer. PropiChain and How Its AI Features Make It Stand Out Among The Best AI Altcoins in 2025 PropiChain stands out as one of the best AI altcoins, transforming the real estate sector through its innovative use of AI and DeFi technologies. The platform aims to address critical issues like inefficiencies, high transaction costs, and fraud, setting a new standard for property investments. One of PropiChain’s key features is its smart contract architecture, which is designed to streamline complex real estate transactions. These smart contracts securely manage legal agreements, KYC processes, and sensitive information, ensuring transparency and legal compliance. AI is central to PropiChain’s capabilities. Through its Automated Valuation Model, PropiChain offers predictive market insights and accurate property valuations.

Additionally, PropiChain embraces the metaverse to enhance property exploration, allowing users to virtually tour, stage, and meet in the digital space. This removes geographical barriers, making international property transactions easier and more efficient without needing physical realtors. Through these features, PropiChain is poised to reshape the future of real estate investments, distinguishing itself as a powerful force among the best AI altcoins in the market. NeuroNet AI: Merging AI with Decentralized Data on the Blockchain NeuroNet AI is rapidly emerging as one of the best AI altcoins. It integrates artificial intelligence with decentralized data to create a platform that disrupts industries like healthcare and finance. Like other best AI altcoins, NeuroNet AI is engineered to provide real-time data insights while maintaining user privacy, a key advantage in today’s data-driven world. As investors eye Solana’s potential, NeuroNet AI stands out as a prime contender, thanks to its upcoming partnerships and significant advancements in AI technology. These developments solidify its place as one of the best AI altcoins to watch for in 2025. Given its innovative approach to AI and blockchain, NeuroNet AI is positioned to reshape the landscape of decentralized applications, making it one of the most promising AI altcoins on the market. Synapse Intelligence: Enhancing Smart Contracts for Decentralized Applications with AI Synapse Intelligence is quickly rising as one of the best AI altcoins, making waves in the crypto world ahead of the anticipated Solana bull run. This decentralized platform uses AI to elevate the functionality of smart contracts, offering a unique edge over other altcoins like Dogecoin. What sets Synapse Intelligence apart from other AI altcoins is its ability to integrate real-time data inputs into self-executing contracts, optimizing outcomes across various decentralized applications. Crypto analysts are confident that Synapse Intelligence will gain significant momentum, particularly before the expected Trump-backed Solana bull run in 2025, positioning early investors for substantial rewards. Why PropiChain Presale is Taking The Lead as the Best AI Altcoin for 2025 PropiChain is emerging as one of the best AI altcoins for 2025 and beyond. As its presale moves from round 2, the altcoin is expected to surge by 108.9%. Currently priced at an all-time low of $0.011, PropiChain is forecasted to rise by 800% at the listing, with analysts predicting a $3 valuation by Q1 2025. The project is also safe to trade on as its smart contracts have been audited by BlockAudit , a security blockchain firm.

Deaton Explores Three Possible Outcomes of SEC Legal Battle appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The ongoing legal battle between the SEC and Ripple Labs has been one of the most closely watched cases in the cryptocurrency world. As the case continues to develop, experts and industry insiders are speculating about the possible outcomes and their broader implications for the future of crypto regulation in the United States. In an interview with Thinking Crypto, Crypto supporter, attorney and founder of Crypto Law John Deaton weighed in on this matter and opened up about three scenarios The Appeal Continues One of the paths for the SEC vs Ripple case is that the appeal process could continue. This would involve the SEC pressing on with its stance that XRP is a security, a position they have long maintained. While Ripple has repeatedly contested this view, an extended appeal could result in a drawn-out legal battle that would keep uncertainty hanging over the crypto industry. The SEC Dismisses the Appeal and Ripple Settles A more plausible scenario is that the SEC ultimately dismisses the appeal and Ripple settles the case by paying the $125 million fine that was issued by the court. This outcome would bring some closure to the case and provide clearer guidance on the status of XRP. This is the most likely scenario, especially considering the current political climate, with President Trump announcing his vision of making the U.S. the “crypto capital of the world.” The SEC Drops the Appeal and Shifts Focus Another possibility is that the SEC drops the appeal entirely and does not enforce the $125 million fine. In this case, Ripple would be free to continue its operations without the looming threat of legal action. With leaders like David Sacks serving as the White House’s AI and Crypto Czar, the U.S. government might seek to create a more favorable regulatory environment that encourages innovation rather than stifling it.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-24 04:03:39

The price is now correcting gains and might find bids near the $3.00 level. XRP price started a downside correction from the $3.250 zone. The price is now trading below $3.150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3.10 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start a fresh increase if it stays above the $3.00 support. XRP Price Dips To Support XRP price managed to start a fresh increase from the $3.050 support zone, but upsides were limited compared to Bitcoin . The price was able to surpass the $3.150 level before the bears appeared. A high was formed at $3.25 and the price corrected all gains. A low was formed at $3.035 and the price is now consolidating below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.285 swing high to the $3.035 low. The price is now trading below $3.15 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $3.10 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3.10 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $3.160 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.285 swing high to the $3.035 low. The next resistance is $3.20. A clear move above the $3.20 resistance might send the price toward the $3.250 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.350 resistance or even $3.3650 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $3.450. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $3.10 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3.050 level. The next major support is near the $3.00 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $3.00 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.880 support. The next major support sits near the $2.750 zone.

Analyzing Justin Sun’s Confidence Through $TRUMP,https://square.htx.com/trade-new-cryptos-only-on-htx-analyzing-justin-suns-confidence-through-trump/,"On January 17, a tweet by Justin Sun generated significant buzz within the crypto community. “Trade new cryptos only on HTX!” This bold claim in the highly competitive centralized exchange industry, was swiftly validated by HTX’s actions. Just one day later, on January 18, the launch of the official meme coin of U.S. President Donald Trump, $TRUMP, ignited the crypto market. Demonstrating its agility, HTX quickly listed $TRUMP for spot and grid trading in around seven hours after the coin’s release, outpacing most major exchanges. This early mover advantage allowed HTX users capitalize on the coin’s surge – $TRUMP experienced a staggering 1,250% increase within an hour, catapulting it into the limelight and dominating social media discourse. As a result, user interest in HTX soared, with many inquiring about download and sign up processes. HTX undeniably became the epicenter of the $TRUMP frenzy. HTX immediately expanded its $TRUMP offerings, introducing margin and perpetual futures trading after spot trading. A series of $TRUMP trading contests, including a Futures Trading Carnival with doubled rewards, were launched to maximize user benefits and enhance their trading experience. The rapid listing of $TRUMP exemplifies HTX’s consistent approach. Throughout 2024, a period marked by the rise of diverse sectors and countless success stories, HTX consistently positioned itself at the forefront. Solana meme coins, the RWA sector, election-themed coins, TRON-based meme coins, the expanding TON ecosystem, revived NFT projects, and emerging DeSci and AI Agent sectors all witnessed early HTX listings. Crypto gems like $WIF, $BOME, $SUNDOG, $NEIROCTO, and $ACTSOL, initially listed on HTX, stand testament to the platform’s ability to identify and list high-quality projects. For trending cryptos, HTX offers a comprehensive suite of services beyond spot, futures, and margin trading. High-return Earn products, mining events, and rewarding trading contests further enhance user profitability. At the same time, HTX Live, HTX Learn, and HTX Square provide valuable educational resources to deepen user understanding of market dynamics and refine investment strategies. By combining early trading opportunities, diverse activities, and robust educational support, HTX empowers users to maximize their returns when trading new cryptos. This comprehensive approach substantiates Justin Sun’s claim that “Trade new cryptos only on HTX,” a sentiment echoed by user comments such as, “HTX’s been impressive lately, and almost every new crypto is multiplying in value” and “HTX is definitely the best at meeting user needs.” Justin Sun’s enduring dedication to cryptocurrency innovation, coupled with HTX’s 11-year operational history and proven ability to navigate both bull and bear markets, sets them apart in the industry. HTX has garnered a stellar reputation for its user-centric approach. As we enter 2025, HTX’s asset listing team continues its momentum. Recent additions like $BIO, $XTER, $AVAAI, and $BUZZ have already demonstrated significant growth potential. Under Justin Sun’s leadership and driven by a sharp eye for crypto selection, rapid listings, and a top-notch user experience, HTX is well on its way to making “Trade new cryptos only on HTX” a reality for a growing number of traders.

It’s Blackrock taking a bolder approach to the world’s top digital asset. According to Arkham Intelligence’s recent tracking, BlackRock reportedly bought $600 million worth of Bitcoin on January 22nd, the most significant buy this year. Arkham added that this latest acquisition pushed the company’s holdings to 569,343 Bitcoins, currently valued at $58.32 billion. In addition to Bitcoin, BlackRock holds other digital assets, including 74.5 million USDC tokens, $3.7 billion worth of Ether, and coins like UBXS, Colle AI, MOG, TUA, and SPX6900. BlackRock Leads Bitcoin Purchases In Last 7 Days This year, BlackRock’s aggressive acquisition of Bitcoin got off to a scorching start. Lookonchain revealed on Twitter/X that among all funds, BlackRock’s iShares receive the most Bitcoin inflows. Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust comes in next, with a total of 208 Bitcoins, then followed by the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which acquired 165 Bitcoins on the same day. Jan 22 Update: 10 #Bitcoin ETFsNetFlow: +6,719 $BTC (+$700.94M) #BlackRock (iShares) inflows 6,208 $BTC ($647.67M) and currently holds 569,343 $BTC ($59.4B). 9 #Ethereum ETFsNetFlow: +18,108 $ETH (+$59.59M) #BlackRock (iShares) inflows 16,959 $ETH ($55.81M) and currently holds… pic.twitter.com/I2EAn9iABF — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 22, 2025 Looking at the seven-day net inflow, BlackRock remains the top player in the industry. Over this period, BlackRock’s iShares fund acquired 15,351 Bitcoin, double the numbers submitted by Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust. Akr21 Shares was also a top performer in the last seven days, adding almost 4,000 Bitcoins to its holdings. BlackRock Adds Substantial Number Of ETH To Grow Its Holdings BlackRock’s holdings also include other digital assets, including ETH. In the same data shared by LookonChain, BlackRock added around 58 ETH but lags behind the acquisition of VanEck, with its 732 ETH tokens purchased in the last seven days. Although BlackRock adds a substantial number of ETH tokens, its investments in Bitcoin matter to the industry. The company’s Bitcoin purchases are often a measure of the market’s performance. Since launching the spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, BlackRock has consistently led the segment with aggressive purchases. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Bitcoin: “If everyone adopted a 2% or 5% allocation, you could see Bitcoin at $700,000” Incredible how far Bitcoin has come. pic.twitter.com/psxP3aq4WI — Geiger Capital (@Geiger_Capital) January 22, 2025 Fink Remains Bullish On BTC, Targets $700k Bitcoin is currently trading at $104,000, a little lower than its closing price yesterday. Analysts are nonetheless optimistic about Bitcoin’s price trajectory based on its recent success. Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, has shown confidence about the potential price of Bitcoin. Fink told the World Economic Forum that Bitcoin was becoming more and more popular with asset management companies and international investment funds. According to Fink, these companies desire BlackRock’s opinion on Bitcoin. If everyone owns Bitcoin and contributes 2% to 5%, the industry will reach $700k, Fink continued. In addition, Fink stressed that they are not endorsing Bitcoin, but rather highlighting its potential. Bitcoin could see some improvement under Trump, according to Samara Cohen, another BlackRock official. According to Cohen, Bitcoin is doing well in the market under Trump. Once regulations are clear, Cohen anticipates a banner year for Bitcoin.

The organization argues that a prior decision by the District Court for the Southern District of New York undermines investor protections. Ripple’s Victory Under Scrutiny In its brief , Better Markets claims that XRP qualifies as a security. The non-profit also asserted that the district court’s ruling weakened the Howey test, a cornerstone of U.S. securities laws, by narrowing the definition of “investment contracts.” According to the organization, the court excluded many crypto transactions from regulations, potentially exposing investors to fraud. It claims that retail traders are at risk since the SEC now has a diminished capacity to protect less sophisticated investors from fraudulent schemes because of the court’s interpretation of the law. Ripple won a partial victory against the SEC in a case the regulator brought against it, alleging the payments platform conducted an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP. In that ruling, District Judge Analisa Torres declared the token was not a security when sold to retail investors on crypto exchanges. However, she found it violated securities laws when offered to institutional investors. Legal Expert Dismisses Better Markets’ Action Better Markets’ move comes just a week after the SEC formally appealed against Judge Torres’ ruling, asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to overturn it. While the agency called the judge’s decision “factually and legally” wrong, Ripple’s top attorney, Stuart Alderoty, described the appeal as “a rehash of already failed arguments.” The brief has sparked reactions from legal experts and the crypto community at large. Some have pointed out ties between the Better Markets CEO Denis Kelleher and the Biden administration, where he was part of the transition team, alleging bias. Lawyer Jeremy Hogan has criticized the organization’s argument as lacking substance and failing to engage with the court’s finding. “Better Market’s Amicus Brief was hard to read. Not because I don’t think this case will ever be ruled on by the appellate court, but because it COMPLETELY misses (or misconstrues?) what the Trial Judge ruled,” he said.

While Bitcoin (BTC) price traded above the $104K level on Friday, leading altcoins have shown mixed actions. Notably, Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) traded in the green zone, whereas XRP and meme coins like DOGE traded in the red. Simultaneously, the global crypto market cap witnessed a marginal 0.11% fall over the past day, reaching $3.54 trillion as of press time. However, the total market volume witnessed a notable 40% uptick from yesterday, reaching $202.98 billion. Here’s a brief report on some of the most renowned cryptocurrencies and their price action on January 24. Crypto Prices Today: Bitcoin & Altcoins Flag Mixed Signals Notably, BTC and top alts such as Ether and SOL have traded in the green, gaining 1%-3% intraday. However, XRP and meme coins such as DOGE and Shiba Inu have lost nearly 2% in value. Overall, the mixed price movements underscored a highly volatile trend currently prevailing across the broader crypto sector, with market watchers cautious over future price movements. Bitcoin Price Today At $104K BTC price recorded gains worth 1% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $104,088. The flagship crypto’s 24-hour low and high were $101,257.80 and $106,820.33, respectively. Notably, BTC price traded in the green alongside soaring optimism in light of heightened market interest in the asset. CoinGape reported that Semler Scientific revealed a $75M convertible notes offering in an effort to expand its Bitcoin strategy. However, top crypto analyst Ali Martinez has recently posted on X , spotlighting immense greed taking over the Bitcoin market. Altogether, the current market stats have sparked uncertain speculations over the asset’s future trajectory. Ethereum Price Today Up 2% ETH price chart illustrated a 2% surge in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $3,299. The cryptocurrency’s intraday low and high were registered as $3,184.07 and $3,347.66, respectively. A recent ETH price analysis by CoinGape reveals that the token struggles to surpass the $3,500 mark amid severe market concerns prevailing in light of the Ethereum Foundation’s selloffs. Market watchers continue to eye short-term volatility amid these selloffs, driven by uncertain investor sentiments. XRP Price Today Slips 1% XRP price also showcased a waning movement, falling nearly 1% in the past 24 hours to $3.12. The token’s broader chart showcases a period of sideways trading, with the intraday low and high being $3.04 and $3.17, respectively. Despite the recent slumping action, a recent XRP price analysis by CoinGape revealed that the crypto eyes a $5 price target in the wake of bullish market dynamics. Intriguingly, the coin’s potential upside includes a stockpile of catalysts, encompassing a potential Ripple ETF approval, XRP futures launch by CME, and RLUSD adoption. Solna Price Today Rides Rollercoaster SOL price chart indicated a highly turbulent movement, with the asset hovering in both red and green territories intraday. As of press time, SOL price gained nearly 1.5% and is sitting at $252.63. The coin’s intraday low and high were $242.50 and $257.43, respectively. A recent SOL price analysis by CoinGape revealed that the token could potentially rally to $300 ahead, given the market sees a Solana ETF approval. Meme Crypto Prices Today Simultaneously, DOGE price waned by 1% in the past 24 hours to reach $0.3483. Further, even SHIB price tanked nearly 2% intraday, reaching $0.00001978. The TRUMP token also followed, crashing 11% and standing at $33.09. Overall, the broader meme coin sector has seen remarkable volatility in the past 24 hours. Top Crypto Gainer Prices Today Mantle (MNT) Price: $1.17 24-hour Gain: +10% Ethereum Classic (ETC) Price: $27.14 24-hour Gain: +3% Jupiter (JUP) Price: $0.7976 24-hour Gain: +3% KuCoin Token (KCS) Price: $12.16 24-hour Gain: +6% Top Crypto Loser Prices Today ai16z (AI16Z) Price: $0.8148 24-hour Loss: -14% Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) Price: $1.23 24-hour Loss: -14% THORChain (RUNE) Price: $2.78 24-hour Loss: -11% XDC Network (XDC) Price: $0.1112 24-hour Loss: -10% Despite the current price turbulence, broader sentiments surrounding crypto prices’ future appear to be optimistic. MicroStrategy lead Michael Saylor has recently posted on X , stating, “The Crypto Renaissance has officially begun.” This statement has sparked considerable bullishness, coming against the backdrop of Donald Trump’s recent pro-crypto movers, including the recent rescinding of SAB 121 .

Trump Bitcoin MAGA (MAGABTC), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MAGABTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump Bitcoin MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Bitcoin MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Bitcoin MAGA launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Bitcoin MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Bitcoin MAGA by entering its contract address – 3J7GkdTfz7sHdcKcMnD5fm1aDZZUktz7z8NqTdiacLTy – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MAGABTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|BTC|SOL|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-24 04:46:00

This move is being hailed as incredibly bullish, as it opens the door for banks to offer crypto custody, buy and sell digital assets, and provide related services to clients. SAB 121 had required banks to treat crypto as a liability on their balance sheets, making it difficult for them to engage with crypto assets. With the rescindment, banks are now free to offer a range of crypto services, including custody and trading, without the same restrictions. This decision comes after growing pressure from major financial institutions, with CEOs from Bank of America, State Street, and other banks calling for clearer regulations to allow them to enter the crypto space. Many view this as a step towards making the U.S. a global leader in digital assets. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a strong advocate for crypto innovation, celebrated the repeal of SAB 121, calling it a victory for American innovation and the digital asset industry. With new leadership like Lummis heading the Senate’s Digital Asset Subcommittee, there is hope that further pro-crypto legislation will follow. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce wrote on social media, “Bye, bye SAB 121! It’s not been fun.” Bye, bye SAB 121!

In a bulletin issued on Jan. 23, the SEC announced that Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 122 officially rescinds SAB 121, a policy introduced in March 2022 that faced significant pushback from the crypto industry. SAB 121 had drawn criticism for its cumbersome reporting requirements, with industry leaders arguing it made custody of digital assets unnecessarily complicated. The rule’s removal was met with relief, as highlighted by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce’s celebratory Jan. 23 post on X: “Bye, bye SAB 121! It’s not been fun.” Bye, bye SAB 121! It's not been fun: https://t.co/cIwUc0isUE | Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 122 — Hester Peirce (@HesterPeirce) January 23, 2025 Last year, Congress also enacted a joint expression opposing SAB 121, but then-President Joe Biden vetoed it.

A day after Donald Trump signed into his second term as President, he appointed SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda as interim SEC chair . Uyeda commented last October on how SEC’s take under Gary Gensler was nothing short of a disaster . Interestingly, Cornerstone Research reported on Jan. 23 that the SEC under Gary Gensler initiated just 33 actions involving cryptocurrencies in his final year as SEC chairman — down from 47 in the year prior, which saw the largest amount of enforcement activity. Last year, the SEC sued 90 bitcoin defendants or respondents, comprising 57 persons and 33 companies. What SAB 121 repeal means for the crypto community ? SAB 121 revocation by the SEC will serve the common by enabling custodians for Bitcoin ( BTC ) through regulated banks and financial institutions. This shift could also improve security and trust, providing a more secure alternative for those new to self-custody or cryptocurrency wallets. It could also spur greater adoption, as users may find it easier to interface with crypto through trusted institutions. Some people, like children and the elderly, need custodians. Others want smooth inheritance transfers and others want loans using their BTC in custody as collateral. BTC is freedom money and you can interact with it anyway you want. — Carl Horton (@Carl_W_Horton) January 24, 2025 Moreover, institutional custody also helps mitigate the risk of losing private keys and provides improved financial inclusion for people who are not able to create secure digital wallets. This revocation can instill confidence and even greater participation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem as regulatory clarity born from it continues.

Not only is this such a stretch and makes zero mention of Bitcoin, but do you see the hypocrisy in all of this? Satoshi's entire point… pic.twitter.com/8jXzmJBIdi — Jacob King (@JacobKinge) January 23, 2025 Jacob, the WhaleWire CEO, posted on X expressing and criticizing the response from the BTC community to the SEC’s recent revocation of SAB 121. He adds that the BTC community is homing in on the news that banks can now hold BTC, even though SAB 121 doesn’t actually mention BTC at all. Satoshi Nakamoto stated at the time that the goal of the original BTC protocol was to eliminate the need for third-party control, says Jacob. According to him, this year, 2025, is when the BTC ecosystem feels just a bit counterintuitive since it wants banks to store their BTC. Ultimately, he claims BTC itself has succumbed to greed and delusion and forebodes ill for the community.

TRUMP Coin shot up faster than an impromptu tweet from the man himself, creating a tidal wave of short-term gains. But before you get too cozy in your newly minted TRUMP Coin positions, let’s talk about the next big contender for meme coin supremacy— Doge Uprising TRUMP Coin: Short-Term Spark, Long-Term Questions It’s no secret that the crypto market thrives on headlines, and what better way to grab attention than with the most talked-about figure in global politics?

Sure, it might make for a fun speculative asset in the short term, but when the dust settles, the real question is whether the hype will fizzle out as quickly as it arrived. Doge Uprising: A Presale Worth Watching Now, let’s talk about the coin that’s quietly making waves and could be the real heavyweight in the meme coin ring: Doge Uprising. Unlike TRUMP Coin, which is, let’s face it, more about name recognition than substance, Doge Uprising is building something that could outlast the latest viral trends.

Doge Uprising could easily make it the next big thing in the crypto market. If you’re serious about making a smart investment, Doge Uprising’s presale is a no-brainer. You’ll be part of a growing community and the upward trajectory of the price is already a clear indicator that this coin is ready to take off.

Highlighting Ripple’s support for President Donald Trump’s administration, King suggests that Ripple’s actions are part of a broader effort to secure regulatory clarity and position XRP as a key player in global finance. Trump's inauguration raised over $200,000,000 breaking all prior records. Ripple donated 500% more than crypto industry peers like Coinbase and Kraken. As a former Ripple employee, here is my take on their strategy and how it will affect $XRP : pic.twitter.com/Oh3EPFRpoQ — Austin King (@0xASK) January 21, 2025 Ripple’s Support for Trump King noted Ripple’s significant financial contributions to Trump’s record-breaking inauguration, surpassing industry peers like Coinbase and Kraken. This financial backing highlights Ripple’s strategic alignment with the Trump administration, with King emphasizing that Ripple’s primary goal is regulatory clarity, not favoritism. King shared a clip of an interview where Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse echoed this sentiment. Garlinghouse listed regulatory clarity as one of three things the crypto market needs to thrive. Ripple has repeatedly called for updated regulatory frameworks to replace outdated laws like the existing securities laws from the 1940s which former SEC Chair Gary Gensler tried to enforce on cryptocurrencies. As Garlinghouse noted in another interview, “One of the biggest problems the crypto industry has had isn’t the idea there’s too much regulation. It’s just the regulation is not even clear.” Ripple’s Vision for XRP King highlighted the ambitious vision of Ripple’s founders, particularly Chris Larsen , who has a history of pioneering large-scale financial innovations. Larsen’s earlier ventures, such as E-Loan and Prosper, illustrate his long-standing focus on transforming financial systems. According to King, Ripple’s current payment focus is just the beginning. The ultimate objective is for Ripple to become a global settlement network capable of facilitating trillions of dollars in transactions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 King suggests that this vision is increasingly attainable under a regulatory framework supported by the Trump administration. This framework could position XRP as a core asset for banks and fintech, enabling them to manage assets and conduct transactions on the XRP Ledger. Additionally, King anticipates that competing blockchain networks, such as Ethereum and Solana, may need to adapt as XRP’s utility grows. Potential Growth for XRP King outlined several potential benefits for XRP if Ripple’s regulatory goals are achieved. First, he anticipates increased adoption of XRP by financial institutions to enhance asset management and transaction efficiency. Second, the XRP Ledger’s revenue model could expand significantly, shifting from a payments-centric focus to broader financial applications. King projects this could result in a 400x increase in revenue. Furthermore, King believes Ripple’s proactive regulatory efforts could cement the United States as a leader in the crypto industry. Garlinghouse previously noted that getting regulatory clarity will help the U.S. lead the crypto market, and this aligns with Trump’s goal to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world.

Here’s why experts predict astonishing 50x returns this year, based on Rollblock’s recent surge in adoption. Rollblock (RBLK) Holders Will See Community Rewards And Huge Growth Rollblock ( RBLK ) brings a completely new casino experience to the Web3 generation. Rollblock’s platform offers a massive selection of 7,000 table games, slot machines, and a sports betting mode that enables live betting across thousands of international sporting events. Recently, the platform has been witnessing extraordinary growth, as in December alone, Rollblock took in more than $1.75 million in wagered bets. This looks set to double in January as momentum remains high. Rollblock brings incredible levels of transparency to its user base by recording all transactions onto the Ethereum blockchain, allowing its gamers to verify that all transactions have been faithfully recorded. This alone is a massive game changer for this $500 billion industry and will help Rollblock to scale to enormous heights this year. Being fully Web3-based, all payouts are made in the native RBLK token. This offers huge benefits to its holders, including free spins, VIP access, and the potential to stake holdings for up to 30% in staking yield. This is thanks to the profit-sharing scheme that takes up to 30% of its operating profits to buy up RBLK on the open market. 60% of these tokens are immediately destroyed to bring down the circulating supply, while the remaining 40% fund the staking APY. With stage nine tokens already more than 70% sold, the current price of $0.047 will be heading upwards fast in the coming months, and many analysts predict a run to $1. Shiba Inu (SHIB) TREAT Launch Cannot Stem The Losses Shiba Inu developers recently launched the TREAT token, which aims to incentivize the use of the chain through on-chain rewards. It also aims to improve liquidity for the upcoming stablecoin SHI. TREAT launched on exchanges this week and has seen promising interest from Shiba Inu token holders. Despite this, Shiba Inu has fallen by 10% today to hit $0.00002. In the past month Shiba Inu holders are down by 12% as selling pressure has been especially fierce. Pepe (PEPE) In A Rut Following Musk Pump Pepe has fallen by 2.8% over the last day of trading to reach $0.0000152. Pepe rallied hard earlier this month when the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, adopted a Pepe meme as his X profile picture. Pepe was the talk of TradFi, and its token price surged by more than 30%. However, since then, the Pepe rally has stalled, and Pepe holders have watched in dismay as their portfolios have dropped by 16% in just a week. Pepe now needs buyers to step in with size in order to reclaim its former bullish momentum. Rollblock On Its Way To A Dollar In 2025 The volatility of meme coins such as Pepe and Shiba Inu has led many holders to jump ship into projects with more utility. Rollblock ($RBLK) is seen by many as a safe haven thanks to its massive potential to disrupt the gaming space. December’s growth is just the start—many analysts have set their sights on a $1 RBLK price this year, making the current price of $0.047 an opportunity not to be missed.

She urged federal regulators to investigate potential ethics violations, underscoring the need for accountability. Last week, just ahead of his inauguration as the 47th US President, Trump launched the $TRUMP memecoin , making the announcement on Truth Social. Shortly after, Melania Trump unveiled the $MELANIA coin through her social media channels, with distribution handled by MKT World, a company connected to her. Warren and Rep. Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts drafted a letter to the US Office of Government Ethics, the SEC, the Treasury and the CFTC, outlining their concerns. They argued that the launch has personally enriched Trump, created a pathway for the crypto industry to channel funds to him, and introduced a volatile financial asset allowing people worldwide to speculate on his political future. Additionally, they posed questions to the regulators, expecting answers by Feb. 4. Trump’s Memecoins Spark Fears of Unregulated Global Influence and Investor Risks They added that Trump and his wife’s net worth skyrocketed to $58b overnight. They raised concerns that anyone, including leaders from hostile nations, could secretly purchase these coins, potentially enabling unregulated and untraceable foreign influence over the US President. At the same time, they said that Trump’s supporters shoulder the financial risks tied to $TRUMP and $MELANIA. Additionally, they cautioned that these memecoins could ultimately harm the very people Trump claims to support. They alleged that Trump and his businesses, which control 80% of $TRUMP, could sell their holdings after three years, reaping enormous profits while triggering a sharp decline in the coin’s value, leaving his supporters to bear the financial losses. Chainalysis Reveals Trump’s Memecoins Dominated by 40 Crypto Whales Warren and Auchincloss raised concerns about the Trump family’s substantial ownership of the tokens and the conflicts of interest it creates. They pointed out that Trump’s companies, on average, could release 24m tokens into the market each month. With current prices fluctuating, this would translate to a monthly income of around $1.73b, totaling about $20.7b annually. This week, Chainalysis revealed that the majority of Donald Trump’s Official Trump ($TRUMP) token and Melania Trump’s Melania Meme ($MELANIA) token are largely controlled by just 40 crypto whales . These whales, each holding $10 million or more in tokens, account for 94% of the total token supply. Meanwhile, Chainalysis noted that smaller holders make up only a tiny fraction of the market.

It even spiked below $0.350. A low was formed at $0.3416 and the price is now consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.4014 swing high to the $0.3416 low.

Per Simin Ilbo , the city, a satellite of Seoul, announced it had taken the coins from crypto wallets belonging to 157 Goyang residents. Goyang Seizes Coins from 157 Citizens The city, in the affluent Gyeonggi Province, is a short commute away from central Seoul. A lake in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. (Source: hyolee2 [CC BY-SA 3.0]) The move is a departure for local governments and provincial tax offices in South Korea. In recent years, South Korean cities and provinces have made use of new powers to force domestic crypto firms to hand over crypto wallet data pertaining to their residents. However, they have mainly used these powers to recover unpaid local tax bills. In many instances, they have liquidated citizens’ Bitcoin (BTC) and other tokens. In other cases, they have given residents an ultimatum. They have warned: “Pay your fines or we will sell your crypto.” Goyang’s move indicates that cities are now willing to go further. They now seem set to use their powers to seize coins from citizens who fail to pay a range of council-imposed fines. The city said the 157 residents failed to pay a range of “vehicle insurance and inspection delay fines.” South Korea is dusting off a tool last used 21 years ago to help stabilize its currency: issuing up to 20 trillion won in special bonds https://t.co/Lqku3SmXTC — Bloomberg (@business) January 22, 2025 Crypto Exchanges Handed Over Data Goyang said it was responding to a rise in activity in the domestic crypto market. It said it “concluded that cryptocurrencies could be used as a means of concealing assets” by people who default on vehicle fines. Gyeonggi Province asked the nation’s four biggest crypto exchanges (Bithumb, Upbit, Korbit, Coinone) to turn over customer data on Goyang-based individuals. The province then matched up its data with its own list of “chronic defaulters.” It focused on Goyang residents with outstanding vehicle fines worth “KRW 1 million [around $696] or more.” Goyang officials said they expect the move will encourage other crypto-holding citizens with outstanding traffic fines to pay up.

We will do our best to ensure a system of fair taxation.

On Jan. 24, Ross Ulbricht made his appearance on X for the first time after 11 years in prison. Ross Ulbricht took to X to thank President Donald Trump, who fully pardoned his sentencing of life without parole and called the sentencing ‘Ridiculous.’ In the X post, Ulbricht emphasized the importance of ‘second chances’ and thanked all his supporters, saying “it is a victory, and it is your victory too.” pic.twitter.com/pbqRh9spnk — Ross Ulbricht (@RealRossU) January 24, 2025 Ulbricht was the founder of the Silk Road darknet marketplace. Silk Road operated as a secret service on the Tor network and facilitated the anonymous buying and selling of illegal drugs as well as other goods using Bitcoin ( BTC ). He was sentenced to life in 2015 after being convicted in a federal trial on multiple counts, including conspiracy to engage in a racketeering enterprise, money laundering, and hacking of computers. Ulbricht, whose X account was run by his wife until now, previously tweeted that he was not associated with any meme coin bearing his name. However, a cryptocurrency of a similar name was launched in Jun. 2024, which soared as high as $0.04243 on Jan. 22, 2025, the day Ulbricht was fully pardoned by the President. The ROSS token has now seen a dip in its price after almost three months of being bullish, as per CoinMarketCap. The Ross Ulbricht token’s price chart shows a bearish phase until late 2024, followed by a significant surge and a steep drop in early 2025. Sourced from CoinMarketCap by crypto.news Does Ross Ulbricht have any crypto holdings to his name? As reported by Fortune Crypto , Ross Ulbricht had over 144,000 BTCs when he got arrested. After his arrest, nearly $184 million was forfeited by the court, resulting in government auctions of the BTCs. The U.S. Marshals Service disposed of its BTCs in 2014 when the asset’s price crashed to $300. The auctions raised $48 million, a small percentage of the $14 billion they would be worth today.

From Kansas lawmakers proposing a bold move to allow Bitcoin-backed ETFs in public employee retirement funds to supporters rallying behind Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht's reintegration with significant crypto donations, these developments show the expanding role of digital assets in shaping public policy and individual financial transitions. Ross Ulbricht’s Post-Prison Transition Fund Receives Over $270K in Crypto Donations Supporters of Ross Ulbricht , the founder of the infamous Silk Road darknet marketplace, have rallied to help him reintegrate into society after more than 11 years behind bars. Following his pardon by former US President Donald Trump on Jan. 21, blockchain data shows that the Free Ross campaign has raised over $270,000 in cryptocurrency donations to support Ulbricht’s transition to his new life. The Free Ross campaign, a long-standing initiative advocating for Ulbricht’s freedom and criminal justice reform, has seen a significant influx of donations in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A wallet operated by the campaign has received more than $270,000 worth of Bitcoin (BTC) since Ulbricht’s release. Major contributions include a $111,111 donation from cryptocurrency exchange Kraken. Additionally, an Ethereum (ETH) wallet associated with the campaign has accumulated roughly $2,400 in ETH, alongside smaller donations in Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Binance Coin (BNB), and Dogecoin (DOGE). While the campaign previously focused on raising funds to secure Ulbricht’s release and advocate for criminal justice reform, the current purpose of the donations appears to be supporting his reintegration into society. However, details about how these funds will be allocated remain unclear. The Free Ross campaign has not publicly disclosed how much money was raised prior to Jan. 21 or provided specifics on its plans for future use. Ross Ulbricht, originally from Austin, Texas, created and operated the Silk Road marketplace from 2011 until his arrest in San Francisco in 2013. The platform, accessible only via the Tor network, allowed users to conduct anonymous transactions using Bitcoin. While many of the transactions were legitimate, the marketplace became notorious for enabling the sale of illicit goods and services, including drugs. In 2015, Ulbricht was convicted on multiple charges, including money laundering, conspiracy to traffic narcotics, and computer hacking. He was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. His case became a focal point in debates about online privacy, the role of cryptocurrency in illicit activities, and the ethics of harsh sentencing in the digital age. Ulbricht’s family, particularly his mother, Lyn Ulbricht, became vocal advocates for his release, arguing that the sentence was disproportionate and that he was unfairly punished as a scapegoat for broader issues in the darknet and cryptocurrency worlds. Their advocacy eventually reached the White House, culminating in a presidential pardon by Donald Trump. Life After Prison: Unanswered Questions Since his release, Ulbricht has maintained a low public profile. He has not made any statements to the media or posted on social media platforms. However, filmmakers Blake J. Harris and Jonah Tulis have revealed plans to release a documentary based on interviews with Ulbricht, scheduled for release in 2025. The film is expected to delve into his life, the rise and fall of Silk Road, and his journey through the criminal justice system. Ulbricht’s financial status also remains a topic of speculation. According to Conor Grogan, a director at Coinbase, Ulbricht may have access to as much as $47 million in Bitcoin, potentially linked to wallets associated with the Silk Road platform. Much of the cryptocurrency tied to Silk Road has already been seized by US authorities, with some assets auctioned off by the government. Ulbricht’s future remains uncertain. His release marks a significant turning point, but reintegrating into society after more than a decade in prison presents its own set of challenges. Support from the cryptocurrency community demonstrates that he still has a dedicated base of advocates willing to assist him during this transition. The funds raised for Ulbricht show the growing use of cryptocurrency as a means of supporting causes and individuals. For Ulbricht, these donations may offer a financial safety net as he navigates life outside prison walls. However, with many unanswered questions about his plans, financial resources, and public role moving forward, his story continues to captivate and divide opinions within the crypto and broader communities. Kansas Senator Proposes Bitcoin ETF Investment for Public Employee Retirement Funds In other crypto news, Kansas State Senator Craig Bowser has introduced a bill to allow the state’s public employee retirement funds to invest in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Senate Bill 34, presented on Jan. 16, proposes allocating up to 10% of the Kansas Public Employees Retirement System (KPERS) funds into Bitcoin-backed ETFs, potentially marking a significant shift in state investment policy. Senate Bill 34 seeks to grant the KPERS board of trustees the authority to invest and reinvest up to 10% of the fund’s money in Bitcoin-backed ETFs. According to the bill, these ETFs must be issued by an investment company registered in Kansas. The proposal explicitly aims to provide exposure to Bitcoin within a regulated framework while maintaining safeguards for beneficiaries. The bill includes several notable provisions: Investment Cap: The KPERS board may invest up to 10% of the retirement fund in Bitcoin ETFs. However, if the value of the ETFs exceeds the 10% threshold, the board is not required to sell unless doing so would serve the best interests of the fund's beneficiaries. Performance Oversight: The board is mandated to conduct an annual examination of the investment program, ensuring that the performance and risk management of the Bitcoin ETF investments are closely monitored. Regulated Framework: The bill stipulates that only Bitcoin ETFs issued by Kansas-registered investment companies would qualify, providing an added layer of regulatory oversight. While the proposal represents a significant step for Bitcoin advocates in Kansas, it must undergo the legislative process before becoming law. After being introduced on Jan. 16, Senate Bill 34 was referred to the Committee on Financial Institutions and Insurance on Jan. 17. From there, it must pass several additional legislative stages before being sent to the Kansas House of Representatives for consideration. If approved by both chambers, the bill would then require the governor’s signature to become law. The legislative process in Kansas is rigorous, and the bill will likely face scrutiny from lawmakers weighing the risks and benefits of cryptocurrency investments in state-managed retirement funds. Supporters argue that Bitcoin’s historical performance and its growing adoption as a store of value make it a compelling addition to investment portfolios. Critics, however, may raise concerns about the volatility and regulatory uncertainties surrounding cryptocurrencies. The introduction of Senate Bill 34 marks a potential turning point in Kansas lawmakers’ attitude toward cryptocurrency investments. Historically, the state has been cautious about digital assets. In 2023, lawmakers in the Kansas House of Representatives introduced a bill to cap political donations made in cryptocurrency at $100. The proposed cap was based on the “fair market value” of the digital assets at the time of receipt and would have required the immediate conversion of crypto donations into US dollars. The bill, however, failed to advance due to procedural issues and missed deadlines. Senator Bowser’s proposal stands in stark contrast to the restrictive approach of the 2023 bill, signaling a growing recognition of cryptocurrency’s potential role in mainstream finance. By focusing on Bitcoin ETFs—a regulated and widely accepted investment product—the new bill aims to balance innovation with fiduciary responsibility. Bitcoin ETF Exposure for Retirement Funds: A National Trend? Kansas’ consideration of Bitcoin-backed ETFs for public retirement funds mirrors a broader trend of increasing institutional interest in cryptocurrency investments. Bitcoin ETFs have gained traction as a gateway for traditional investors to access cryptocurrency markets without directly holding or managing digital assets. These products are regulated by financial authorities, providing a layer of security and oversight that appeals to institutional and retail investors alike. If Senate Bill 34 becomes law, Kansas would join a growing list of jurisdictions exploring cryptocurrency as an investment option for public funds. The move could pave the way for other states to consider similar measures, particularly as Bitcoin’s role in global finance continues to expand. While the potential benefits of Bitcoin ETF investments include diversification and exposure to an emerging asset class, the proposal is not without risks. Bitcoin’s price volatility and regulatory uncertainties could impact the performance of the ETFs, potentially affecting the stability of the retirement fund. The annual examination mandated by the bill is a critical measure to mitigate these risks and ensure that investments align with the fund’s fiduciary responsibilities. Supporters of the bill argue that Bitcoin’s limited supply and increasing adoption make it an attractive long-term investment, particularly in the face of inflation and economic uncertainty. Opponents, however, may question whether it is appropriate to expose retirement funds to an asset class known for its price swings. As Senate Bill 34 progresses through the legislative process, it will undoubtedly spark debate about the role of cryptocurrency in public finance. The proposal reflects a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s legitimacy as an investment asset while highlighting the need for careful oversight and regulation.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|ETH|ADA,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-24 05:30:00

Trump Executive Order (TRUMPEO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPEO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Executive Order can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Executive Order could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Executive Order launched with over $25,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Executive Order on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Executive Order by entering its contract address – Guze7ScXTVo3JPwojxcVX5P7EEcC5ncAByrA47QJ6JzT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPEO.

This week’s expiry event is slightly larger than last week’s , but it is unlikely to have any major impact on spot crypto markets, which have calmed following a volatile week. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.48, which means that there are more than twice as many call (long) contracts expiring than puts (shorts). Open interest, or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is highest at the $120,000 strike price, which has $2.4 billion in OI, according to Deribit. There is also around $1.7 billion in OI at the $110,000 strike price, as derivatives traders remain bullish. The anticipated announcements and crypto executive orders following US President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday did not materialize, causing cryptocurrency market indicators to stabilize, reported Deribit this week. While Bitcoin options markets still show some unusual trading patterns, overall market excitement has subsided, it added. Bitcoin OI by expiry. Source: Deribit In addition to today’s batch of Bitcoin options, around 168,000 Ethereum contracts are expiring as well. These have a notional value of $543 million and a put/call ratio of 0.47. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $3.5 billion. Crypto Market Outlook Spot markets have remained relatively stable over the past 24 hours, with total capitalization at $3.7 trillion following a volatile week . The market cap is exactly where it was last week, so the Trump pump following the US president’s inauguration on Monday was very short-lived. Bitcoin has dropped 4% from this week’s all-time high, which was almost revisited on Thursday. The asset was trading up 3% on the day at $105,000 at the time of writing, having held above six figures for most of this week. Ethereum is up 5% on the day at $3,370, but it remains deflated following dissent and infighting at the Ethereum Foundation. Altcoins remain mixed with minor gains and losses across the board during the Friday morning Asian trading session. Nevertheless, market sentiment is strengthening as the first crypto-related executive order gets the approval signature from President Trump.

Baby Dogecoin’s recent climb of 2.72% and Turbo’s $71 million trading volume show how quickly investors shift their attention. Amid this frenzy, new players like Arctic Pablo are setting the stage for something extraordinary. The question on everyone’s mind? What’s the next big crypto? Enter Arctic Pablo, a meme coin with a narrative like no other. Its journey across icy landscapes, its deflationary mechanics, and its unmatched ROI potential make it a top contender. While Baby Dogecoin attracts the meme-loving crowd and TRUMP Meme Coin ignites political passion, Arctic Pablo offers an immersive, adventurous story that bridges myth and reality. Let’s dive into these projects and see why they capture the crypto world’s imagination. Arctic Pablo: The Mythical Explorer Leading the Charge In the heart of the Arctic, a daring explorer named Arctic Pablo is on a journey like no other. With a snowmobile and an adventurous spirit, Pablo’s quest is to uncover the earth’s hidden treasures. With every icy realm he traverses, he unlocks $APC coins—tokens that hold monetary value and promise of adventure, prosperity, and mystery. Arctic Pablo isn’t just about trading; it’s about storytelling. Each presale phase represents a unique location Pablo visits—from frostbitten islands to mystical caves. Investors are part of this journey, with the chance to secure early coins at just $0.000034. With over $320,000 raised in under two weeks, Arctic Pablo has already explored four locations, completing them in record time. Currently, he’s at Snowy Chores, the fifth stop in this epic tale. It is one of the next big crypto s to watch. And here’s the kicker: Arctic Pablo’s tokenomics are designed to ensure long-term value. A robust burn mechanism eliminates unsold tokens weekly, creating scarcity. Early investors have a shot at an ROI of over 23,441%, with a presale-to-launch price leap from $0.000034 to $0.008. Imagine investing $500 now and watching it grow to $117,632.08 when $APC lists at $0.008. The narrative of Arctic Pablo isn’t just about myth—it’s about creating a tangible wealth-generation opportunity. The community is another pillar of Arctic Pablo’s success. Referral incentives reward users for spreading the word, and adding a collaborative element to the adventure. Backed by the Binance Smart Chain, the coin’s transparency and deflationary environment make it a standout in the meme coin universe. Arctic Pablo is more than a coin; it’s a gateway to an extraordinary world where myths meet reality, and the ROI speaks for itself. Baby Dogecoin: The Cuteness That Packs a Punch Who can resist Baby Dogecoin’s charm? With a live price of $2.26e-9 and a 24-hour trading volume of over $56 million, Baby Doge has cemented its place in the meme coin hierarchy. But don’t let its adorable branding fool you; this coin means business. Its community-centric approach and robust tokenomics make it a favorite among Gen Z and Millennials. Baby Dogecoin’s appeal lies in its accessibility. With a circulating supply of 163 quadrillion tokens, it’s a low-entry barrier coin that’s perfect for first-time crypto enthusiasts. And let’s not forget its commitment to charity—Baby Doge has donated millions to animal shelters and rescue organizations, aligning itself with a cause that resonates with its audience. The coin’s deflationary model ensures that every transaction contributes to its value. A small percentage of each trade is burned, while another portion is redistributed to holders, incentivizing long-term investments. It’s this dual mechanism of scarcity and reward that has made Baby Dogecoin one of the most talked-about coins in the meme category. TRUMP Meme Coin: Political Satire Meets Blockchain If you thought politics and crypto don’t mix, TRUMP Meme Coin is here to change your mind. This politically charged meme coin capitalizes on the former president’s global recognition to create a unique market presence. Trading on humor and controversy, TRUMP Meme Coin has become a talking point among crypto enthusiasts and political commentators alike. What sets TRUMP Meme Coin apart is its ability to spark debates. Whether you love or hate the man it’s named after, you can’t deny the coin’s buzz. This meme coin thrives on its divisive nature, attracting supporters and critics. Its success lies in its ability to generate attention, which in the crypto world often translates to value. Conclusion: Which Coin Will Dominate? Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo, Baby Dogecoin, and TRUMP Meme Coin each bring something unique. Arctic Pablo captivates investors with its adventurous narrative and unprecedented ROI potential, making it a must-watch for those seeking both excitement and profit. Baby Dogecoin’s community-driven approach and charitable initiatives make it a feel-good investment with a solid foundation. Meanwhile, TRUMP Meme Coin’s audacious strategy ensures it remains in the spotlight, albeit with higher risks.

As per a report by Cornerstone Research , the agency initiated only 33 crypto-related actions in its last year under Gensler, down from 47 actions the previous year, which marked its peak enforcement period. Gensler’s $5B penalties mark aggressive enforcement in 2024 Though the number of actions was down, the money penalties in the crypto sector reached a record $5 billion in 2024, mainly because of the SEC’s $4.5 billion settlement with Terraform Labs. In total, the agency charged 90 defendants in crypto enforcement actions last year, including 33 firms and 57 individuals. Gensler, Biden’s pick in 2021, stepped down as SEC chairman on Jan. 20, 2025, after Trump’s return to the White House. Under Gensler’s leadership, the SEC took nearly 80% more crypto-related enforcement actions than his predecessor, Jay Clayton, who was SEC chairman from 2017 until 2020. Cornerstone said over half of the SEC’s enforcement actions in 2024 were in September and October, with only four actions initiated after the US elections in November. Cornerstone’s analysis found that the most common allegations in crypto-related cases were fraud and unregistered securities, at 73% and 58%, respectively. The report also found rising charges of market manipulation and failure to register as a broker-dealer. Of the 207 crypto enforcement actions brought by the SEC since 2013, 47% have been related to initial coin offerings and non-fungible tokens. Mark Uyeda shifts SEC priorities by repealing controversial crypto rule Under acting chair Mark Uyeda, Trump’s appointee to lead the SEC, the agency has already begun shifting its priorities. On Jan. 23, just days after Gensler’s departure, the SEC repealed Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, a controversial rule that required banks and other financial institutions that hold cryptos to treat them as liabilities on their balance sheets. The new administration has interpreted this as a shift in regulatory priorities. Commenting on the developments, Lauren Compere, head of stewardship and engagement at Boston Common Asset Management, said: “While we anticipated that the Trump administration’s appointed SEC chair, interim or permanent, would oversee a fundamental shift in priorities, Uyeda’s past suggestion that companies could go around established SEC rules, which is cause for significant concern.” – Lauren Compere Uyeda will temporarily head the SEC while Trump’s nominee, Paul Atkins, undergoes the approval process, which is expected to take several months. He has previously been critical of the shareholder filing process, saying that companies should be able to bypass the SEC’s no-action process and set their own standards for shareholder resolutions.

As a revolutionary PayFi token, Remittix transforms cross-border payments by combining blockchain technology with traditional banking. With over 6,000 record-holders and over $5.4 million raised in record time, Remittix is capturing attention as a high-potential investment opportunity poised for explosive growth. Why Remittix Will Unlock A New Level of Liquidity in 2025 International payments have always been costly, slow and full of hidden charges. Today with cross-border payments space projected to top $250 trillion by 2027, better solutions are required. Remittix (RTX) is rising to the call by combining blockchain and conventional banking, allowing users to send money internationally without the typical hassles. Remittix allows crypto holders to instantly convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat, sending transfers directly to any bank account. Businesses and individuals benefit from faster transactions without high costs or complicated processes. Unlike traditional banks that impose hidden fees, Remittix uses flat and transparent rates. Recipients get the amount of money the sender sends, giving users better rates than major banks. The platform simplifies crypto payments by making them as easy and familiar as standard bank transfers while providing true financial flexibility. Platforms like Stripe, Wise and Coinbase currently dominate the digital payments market. Remittix, however, introduces an innovative approach to cross-border transactions with its crypto-fiat feature. Remittix eliminating intermediaries reduces time and fees, making it appealing to businesses and individuals. Remittix also provides businesses with a Pay API to accept cryptocurrency payments and settle them into fiat bank accounts. This integration simplifies engaging in the crypto market without the need to manage multiple currencies. It also positions Remittix as a prime candidate for future institutional adoption, increasing the potential value of its $RTX token. Security is a top priority for Remittix. The platform is built upon an audited smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Certifications from BlockSAFU and SolidProof also prove its security and transparency, making it a preferred option for worldwide financial transactions. Remittix Hits Over $5.6 Million in ICO Funds in Record Time Remittix’s native token , $RTX, powers key platform functions like governance and staking. Token holders can earn up to 8% APY rewards by staking their $RTX. The platform also offers a VIP tier program for higher returns, providing additional incentives based on investment levels. Tier 3 VIP investors enjoy enhanced rewards of up to 18% APY and special privileges, including voting rights on critical platform decisions. This tiered system rewards long-term commitment and provides excellent value for dedicated investors. Currently, $RTX sells for $0.0297 in its presale phase. Over $5.6 million has been raised, a sign of high investor confidence in the project. With its robust cross-border payment solutions and attractive staking rewards, Remittix is positioned for rapid growth. Analysts predict potential returns of 10x before February and up to 40x before the end of the presale, making $RTX an enticing investment opportunity.

Initially trading around the $9.50 level on January 22, the token skyrocketed 140% to break beyond $25 as speculators reacted to the news. At press time, the asset has lost some value and is down to $17. Victory for Tornado Cash Tornado Cash’s legal woes started in August 2022 when OFAC designated it as a sanctioned entity, claiming the Lazarus Group, a criminal organization linked to the North Korean regime, had used the platform to launder stolen cryptocurrencies worth more than $455 million. Subsequently, one of its developers, Alex Pertsev, was arrested in The Netherlands, charged with money laundering, found guilty , and sentenced to five years in prison. The mixer’s co-founder, Roman Storm, was also arrested in August 2023 and charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. With his trial scheduled for April 14, 2025, he has publicly defended himself, claiming he is being prosecuted for writing open-source code. However, following the judgment against Tornado Cash, six individuals led by crypto advocate Joseph van Loon sued the U.S. Treasury, OFAC, then-Secretary Janet Yellen, and OFAC Director Andrea Gacki, accusing them of overreach. Loon and his fellow plaintiffs argued that there were no grounds for sanctioning the crypto mixer because it was software rather than a person or entity. Their view was supported by an appellate court in November 2024. It ruled that the immutable nature of the service’s smart contracts meant it could not be defined as “property,” a concept in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) that OFAC had used to justify its sanctioning of Tornado Cash. According to the court, the lines of codes making up the smart contracts could not be subjected to ownership or control since they operated autonomously without human intervention, thus falling outside the purview of the IEEPA. The latest determination upholds the November judgment, which the government agencies had sought to be reheard. However, it does not impact the criminal case against Storm and fellow co-founder Roman Semenov, who remains at large. Market Reacts While the value of the TORN token skyrocketed in the aftermath of the court’s decision, it has since cooled down, going from a high of $25.28, per data from CoinGecko to $17.00. However, its current price is still 122% higher than a week ago and an 88% improvement over 30 days. The coin has a market capitalization north of $68 million, and its recent performance puts it vastly ahead of the broader crypto market, which is up a mere 1.8%.

While some tokens gain instant popularity through hype, others struggle to build long-term value. Among the fleeting memes, a new contender is rising to the top: $PEPETO—the “God of Frogs.” Unlike other meme coins that have been driven by short-lived political or celebrity-driven hype, $PEPETO is proving that memes can be both fun and meaningful. But what makes $PEPETO different from the rest of the pack? The Shortcomings of Political Tokens: $TRUMP and $MELANIA In the world of meme coins, political tokens like $TRUMP and $MELANIA have stirred interest due to their affiliations with high-profile figures. $TRUMP, for instance, hit an eye-popping $36.15 billion in trading volume within just 24 hours of its launch. Meanwhile, $MELANIA leveraged the fame of Melania Trump to capture attention. However, these tokens face significant challenges. For starters, $TRUMP is highly centralized, with a staggering 80% of tokens controlled by Trump-affiliated entities, raising concerns about transparency and fairness. In contrast, $MELANIA suffers from a lack of real-world utility—relying heavily on celebrity branding, which could easily fade over time. $PEPETO: A Meme Coin with Real Potential Enter $PEPETO, a meme coin that’s breaking away from the mold. Unlike $TRUMP and $MELANIA, $PEPETO is not just another trend—it’s built for long-term growth. During its presale, $PEPETO raised over $3.7 million and has already garnered a community of over 55,000 supporters. What’s truly exciting about $PEPETO is that it combines humor with functionality—proving that meme coins can be both entertaining and valuable. What Makes $PEPETO Stand Out? Unbeatable Staking Rewards With an impressive 387% annual return, $PEPETO offers one of the highest staking yields in the market, attracting investors who want to earn passive income while supporting a promising project. Cross-Chain Bridge $PEPETO’s 30-second cross-chain bridge allows users to easily transfer tokens between different blockchains, cutting down on transaction fees and delays—common pain points for many cryptocurrency investors. PepetoSwap Exchange $PEPETO is launching its own exchange—PepetoSwap—which will allow users to trade with zero-fee transactions. This platform is set to resolve the issues of high fees and liquidity fragmentation that have plagued other meme coin exchanges. Decentralized Governance Through a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) model, $PEPETO empowers its community to make decisions, ensuring the token evolves transparently and remains true to the values of its supporters. Affordable Entry At just $0.000000105 during its presale, $PEPETO offers a rare opportunity for early investors to get in at an incredibly low price before it hits major exchanges. The Power of the Pepeto Army One of the driving forces behind $PEPETO’s success is its growing community—the Pepeto Army. This dedicated group of supporters is spreading the word and engaging with the project across platforms like Twitter, Telegram, and YouTube. The Pepeto Army not only amplifies the token’s cultural impact but also strengthens its financial foundation by creating a network effect that drives both adoption and loyalty. The Day of Judgment aligns with Trump’s inauguration, timing is key, and $Pepeto ’s strategy is unmatched. Unlike competitors like Lucifer, aka Pepe, who missed the mark, $Pepeto waits for the perfect moment to rise as the crypto space turns bullish. : https://t.co/RyI7SlT0Mh pic.twitter.com/EBgBrGy3D7 — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) January 12, 2025 While other meme coins may rely on political or celebrity hype, $PEPETO is focused on sustainable growth and real-world utility. The growing interest from whale investors is a clear sign that major players are confident in the long-term potential of $PEPETO. As the project gears up for its exchange listings and the launch of PepetoSwap, its momentum is only expected to increase.

39360510,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=123589,1737698962,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,An Interview With Mantle Network,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/an-interview-with-mantle-network/,"In an exclusive interview with BitcoinWorld , we got the chance to speak with Joshua Cheong, Product Lead at Mantle What is the main goal of Mantle Network, and how does it benefit users in the blockchain world? To give some background, Mantle Network is an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution that fully supports Ethereum smart contracts and tooling – delivering the same functionality as Ethereum but with much cheaper transaction fees. Since our mainnet launch, we have grown to support over 260 decentralised applications (dApps) across all verticals, creating a diverse and thriving Web3 ecosystem. Mantle’s goal is to bridge the gap between traditional finance and DeFi by building institutional-grade infrastructure. Having witnessed firsthand how traditional banking infrastructure struggles with the rapid pace of digital innovation, we’re building a platform that combines the best of both — the security and familiarity of TradFi with the efficiency and accessibility of blockchain technology. Our focus is to become the premier liquidity chain for institutional-grade settlement and value transfer. In doing so, we aim to pave the way for next-generation banking in tandem with broader blockchain adoption. Can you explain what zero-knowledge rollups are and why they are important for Mantle Network? Zero-knowledge rollups (ZK rollups) represent a significant advancement in L2 technology, particularly for institutional use cases. It enhances scalability and efficiency by bundling multiple transactions off-chain and verifying them with cryptographic proofs to ensure maximum security. For Mantle Network, this technology is transformative. By transitioning to a ZK validity rollup through Succinct’s SP1, Mantle is able to achieve chain finality in one hour — a 168x improvement over traditional optimistic rollup builds. This is particularly crucial for institutional users requiring fast, secure settlement. The combination of rapid finality and capital efficiencies available through the Mantle Ecosystem creates a conducive environment for large-scale asset movements. Why did Mantle Network decide to switch from optimistic to zero-knowledge architecture? While an optimistic rollup build served us well initially as a tried-and-tested scaling solution, the lengthy 7-day withdrawal period created friction for users who require rapid settlement capabilities. Shortening withdrawals would previously require third-party bridges that are much more capital inefficient as they require liquidity pools and high slippage. This is sufficient for retail use cases over small amounts of token value but for a real-world institution that is bringing in large amounts of capital, the architecture reaches a bottleneck as the cost of idle capital for 7 days is not acceptable for any traditional financial institution. Enter ZK scaling architecture, a pivotal upgrade in scaling technologies that use cryptographic proofs to instantly verify transactions, drastically reducing chain finality and improving user experience. Fast finality through ZK validity proofs, while maintaining the cost efficiency inherent to rollups and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence, allows developers to seamlessly leverage existing Ethereum tooling with transaction costs remaining at fractions of a cent. More importantly, the switch synergistically aligns with Mantle’s vision of creating a liquidity chain tailored for institutional-grade asset settlement and value transfer. Institutions can move capital more efficiently and take advantage of market opportunities as they happen. With our proven expertise in invigorating promising web3 projects and enabling commercial success via extensive resources and support, Mantle’s collaboration with Succinct positions us to set a new benchmark for institutional-grade Ethereum scalability. How does reducing transaction finality time to one hour make things better for users and developers? For users, the reduced transaction finality time would mean that they are now able to move their assets between Mantle Network and Ethereum much faster — making trading more efficient, with improved market dynamics thanks to tighter spreads, lower slippage and optimised gas fees. This further broadens asset accessibility across the Mantle Ecosystem, giving users more options and access to Mantle-based assets such as mETH, cmETH and FBTC (valued over $3.7Bn) to proliferate across the wider decentralised finance (DeFi) domain. As for developers, this translates to a smoother and more reliable operating environment for them to build and iterate their applications on Mantle Network. Improved interoperability opens up opportunities for cross-rollup and multi-chain initiatives, enhancing business economics and scale for sophisticated financial applications. What role does Succinct’s SP1 technology play in Mantle Network’s upgrade? Succinct’s SP1 is an open-source technology that creates efficient ZK proofs using programmer-friendly language (Rust language) and instruction set architecture (RISC-V). It is so performant such that upon release, it was multiple magnitudes more performant over the next best solution. Prior to the introduction of SP1, the use of ZK technology for scaling the Ethereum Virtual Machine was both extremely expensive and difficult to work with in-development. It required many compromises either by limiting the scope of the Ethereum Virtual Machine used or accepting a high level of operational costs. SP1 represents a “tipping point” in the industry that makes it possible to operate ZK provers efficiently at scale. If we assume Moore’s law to continue and that GPU/CPU hardware continues to cheapen, it will be likely that the rest of the industry will follow in our footsteps. How will this upgrade make using Mantle Network faster, cheaper, and more secure? At Mantle, we believe that continuous innovation is essential to driving the future of decentralized finance and creating a thriving ecosystem for builders and users. As we transition to a zero-knowledge (ZK) validity rollup, this upgrade will significantly enhance Mantle Network’s capabilities, achieving chain finality within one hour — a 168x improvement over existing bridging capabilities. Moreover, with secure 1-hour withdrawals, Mantle Network will enable better swap market spreads, lower slippage, better money markets, improved interest rates, and broader asset availability. By integrating Mantle Network’s modular architecture, Eigen-DA powered data availability solution, and ZK proofs via SP1, the culmination of advanced scaling technologies keep transaction costs at fractions of a cent, even for complex institutional operations. This further creates a solid foundation for robust security via cryptographic proofs, ensuring institutional-grade security guarantees without compromising performance and efficiency gains. What does this change mean for developers who want to build on Mantle Network? For developers, this upgrade creates an optimal environment for building institutional-grade applications. The integration of SP1 technology reduces the complexity and cost of deploying and scaling highly-performant decentralized applications (dApps) while ensuring a seamless developer experience. Moreover, developers stand to benefit from Mantle’s extensive ecosystem support, including our $200M EcoFund, grants and robust technical infrastructure. With faster transaction finality, lower gas fees, and enhanced security, developers can focus on innovation and functionality rather than operational limitations. Additionally, the network’s adherence to EVM standards ensures full compatibility with existing Ethereum tools and frameworks, enabling developers to leverage their expertise while accessing the advanced capabilities of Mantle Network. How do you see Mantle Network’s innovations impacting the future of Ethereum and blockchain technology? Mantle Network’s innovations, particularly through the integration of technologies like SP1, exemplify the transformative potential of Layer 2 solutions in advancing Ethereum’s ecosystem without compromising its core principles. By addressing scalability, cost-efficiency, and security, Mantle accelerates Ethereum’s adoption as the backbone of dApps and financial systems — proving that institutional-scale throughput is indeed possible on ETH-aligned Layer 2s. These advancements set a benchmark for the broader blockchain industry, supporting Ethereum’s roadmap through applied research for proposals like the Beam chain. Beam chain would be an upgrade to Ethereum’s core protocol and uses ZK technology for validators and staking services. By being the largest early-mover of ZK for scalability, we remain future-relevant in the long-term Ethereum roadmap while developing expertise to offer thought leadership for innovation across the broader Web3 industry.

While there’s some short-term uncertainty, the overall market sentiment remains bullish, suggesting that XRP could be gearing up for a bullish rally if key levels hold. XRP has erased the gains made in the last seven days and is currently down by more than four percent on the weekly chart. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.17 and is aiming to rise above the $3.20 levels. Price Targets and Bullish Outlook XRP is currently moving through a complex correction , but long-term bullish expectations remain in place. If XRP can break above the critical level of $3.40, it could target $4.20 next, with $5 and $6.60 also in play as potential future price levels. These targets align with key Fibonacci extensions and are seen as crucial milestones in the coming weeks. The immediate focus will be on the breakout above $3.40, which would signal further upside potential for the token. Support Levels and Potential Pullbacks In the short-term, XRP faces important support levels. The $2.52 to $2.94 range is critical for the price to stay above in order to maintain bullish expectations. If the price dips below $2.52, the chances for further upward momentum may diminish. A break below $2.32 would weaken the bullish case, signaling a possible larger correction. What to Watch for in the Coming Days The key levels to focus on are the $2.52 and $3.40 ranges. A sustained movement above $3.40 could confirm the start of a bullish rally, pushing XRP toward $4.20 and eventually higher targets. On the flip side, if XRP struggles to hold above the critical support levels, further consolidation or a short-term pullback could occur.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-24 06:11:23

A potential insolvency situation could be created if all loans and savers positions were closed and repaid at exactly the same time, and if market sentiment also caused a steep decline in RUNE. THORChain meets its lending obligations by minting RUNE and selling it into liquidity pools. As such, deposits had been turned off a year ago as the community became increasingly concerned with the risk at the time. Some community members allege liabilities of nearly $200 million.

In the same light, Cardano (ADA) investors are relieved by the new predictions that have emerged for the next month. Amid all these, Remittix (RTX) has investors excited about big profits that could make many millionaires in 2025. Let’s look at what’s happening with these coins and why people think Remittix could be the best coin to buy. Solana Rises Despite Network Challenges Solana has added new features to make it even better. More DeFi projects and NFTs are popping up on its network, which is helping it stay relevant. However, some investors are displeased by Solana’s recent network issues. Notably, Solana-based apps including the decentralized exchange Jupiter and the digital wallet Phantom experienced poor performance on January 19, 2025. Users reported troubles shortly after First Lady Melania Trump’s own meme coin caused the price of $TRUMP to plunge. Even with these problems, Solana has bounced back. Its price has surged 22% over the past week, making it a good choice for those who want a reliable option in their portfolio. People who like to stick with what they know still see Solana as a top pick. Major Surge on the Horizon For Cardano Cardano investors have heaved a sigh of relief following major predictions for ADA. Despite its recent struggles, Cardano’s price is expected to increase by 111.06% to $ 2.05 by February 22. This is double the current price and definitely positions ADA among the best coins to buy. The team behind Cardano focuses on security and making the network more efficient. These have been regarded as some of the major factors behind the positive outlook. Cardano’s price is low compared to its past highs but if the predictions go right, it could rise further to reclaim previous highs. For long-term investors, Cardano is worth keeping an eye on. It has a great history and with the right upgrades, it can reach for the moon. That said, many are starting to believe that other coins offer better chances for much bigger returns. Why Remittix Is Grabbing Attention Remittix is the coin everyone is talking about. It’s part of the PayFi sector, focusing on making international money transfers cheaper and faster. This coin is not just another project—it solves a real problem. The presale for RTX has been a huge success. At a current price of $0.0282 per token, it’s affordable, and many think its value will skyrocket. Experts believe it could go up 20 times in 2025. This is why it’s being called one of the best coins to buy right now. Unlike Solana and Cardano, which are already well-known, Remittix feels fresh. It’s gaining popularity online, especially among younger investors looking for something new. People love its focus on making money transfers simple and cost-effective. Remittix has made over $5.7 million so far in its ICO from the sale of RTX tokens. This reflects the adoption level and investment appeal of RTX. The success of the presale shows that people are beginning to see the huge prospects it offers. New coins often have lower prices, making them easier for anyone to buy. If the project does well, these coins can bring much bigger returns than more established options. It’s a risk, but for some, it’s worth it. If you’re looking for a safe bet, Solana might still be a good choice. It has a strong track record and continues to grow. Cardano is more of a long-term option, but it might not bring the quick profits some investors want. For those looking to take a chance on something new, Remittix could be the answer. Its low DeFi coin price and potential for massive growth make it one of the best cryptos to buy. Predictions of 20x returns are hard to ignore. Crypto investing is always about finding the right balance. Solana offers reliability, Cardano provides stability, and Remittix delivers excitement. The key is to pick what fits your goals. Whether you play it safe or go for the big win, the crypto market always has opportunities. Right now, Remittix is making a strong case for being the top pick for anyone wanting a fresh start in crypto. Act now to avoid regrets. You are still early and can win big from this ICO.

The trading platform airdropped 700 million JUP coins, worth approximately $500 million, to over 2 million wallets. Jupiter 🪐 @JupiterExchange · Follow omg the largest user airdrop in history is today 🤯 12:50 pm · 22 Jan 2025 13.4K Reply Copy link Read 1.5K replies As of January 24, 61% of qualified participants, 578,657 wallets, had claimed their assets. Meanwhile, trader attention switched to the exchange’s native token amid the ecosystem developments. JUP witnessed fluctuations following the events, with some participants profit-taking after the distribution. However, the trend has shifted as the alt displays robust momentum amidst the prevailing broad market recoveries . JUP maintained bullishness on its daily chart, gaining over 10% within the past day to trade above $0.8560. The over $350 million in 24-hour trading volume signals impressive trader activity. The latest airdrop event likely renewed trader optimism on JUP. Despite earlier profit-taking tendencies, the “Jupuary” airdrop magnified trading activities while boosting liquidity. These elements remain crucial in stabilizing the market. Reduced liquidations and increased open interest signal recoveries Coinalyze data shows JUP experienced massive volatility last weekend, with long liquidations surpassing 1.2 million and shorts above 800,000 on January 18. The stats confirmed magnified trading pressure, possibly from market speculations of sharp price movements. Jupiter has seen reduced liquidations since January 19. The altcoin saw liquidations amounting to $916K in the past day, with $502K longs and $414K shorts rekt in the past 24 hours. Source – Coinalyze That reflects a significant cooldown from weekend figures, suggesting a stabilising JUP ecosystem. Meanwhile, the calmer environment matches the prevailing increase in open interest. JUP’s open interest increased by 22% over the past 24 hours to surpass $227 million, according to Coinglass . That indicates notable recoveries from the intense fluctuations between January 18 and 19. The Open Interest maintained gains above $110 million this week, signaling market stability after the latest airdrop-driven sell-offs. Furthermore, Jupiter’s total value locked (TVL) on the Solana blockchain has thrived over the past sessions. According to DeFillama, the metric stands at $2.87 billion at press time, a significant jump from $2.36 ten days ago. The latest airdrop contributes to the increased activity, which has attracted massive user participation. JUP price outlook The native token exhibited a bullish stance today, displaying bull dominance on the daily timeframe. Chart by Coinmarketcap While broad market recoveries drove JUP’s latest gains, increased activity following the “Jupuary” airdrop fueled the asset’s upside trajectory. JUP appears to boost adequate steam for continued gains in the near term. Decisive buyer resurgence could propel the alt past the $0.81 resistance. Overcoming this hurdle will catalyze more surges to $0.95 – a 10% increase from current prices. The 1H Chaikin Money Flow supports the upward narrative. The indicator has climbed from yesterday’s -0.34 to 0.02 at press time. Jupiter chart price , source: TradingView . Such trends confirm increased cash flowing into JUP’s ecosystem amid investor comeback. Also, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence is on the verge of a bullish crossover, indicating waning seller activity. However, an abrupt bearish wave might plunge JUP towards July 2024 lows of $0.63 – approximately 27% from current prices.

The occurrence has elicited concern across the crypto space, with strong indications pointing to North Korean hackers per usual. The hack started by first compromising one of Phemex’s hot wallets, limping off with $30 million; worse was still to come. But it went on and worsened, and more tokens fell in the process, such as: $USDC, $USDT, $ETH, $LINK, $PEPE, $FET, and $AVAX. Cyvers and Lookonchain security firms reported the activities by observing that there were misleading transactions that pointed towards a breach. Notable amounts stolen include 3.48 million USDC,841 ETH ($2.7 million),110,701 LINK ($2.69 million) and 142 billion PEPE ($2.12 million). Phemex’s Response and Assurances The hack led to withdrawal suspension at Phemex as a measure to mitigate the problem. CEO Federico Variola discussed the issue on X outlining it with a statement that the funds, having been taken from a hot wallet which the exchange is currently investigating, the cold wallets are nevertheless fully auditable at any given time given the platform’s proof-of-reserves. “As for cold wallets, they are protected, and everyone can verify that,” Variola said.

Don’t Let Best Crypto Presale to Buy Now Be Your Second Regret in 2025!,https://thecoinrise.com/regret-missing-the-notcoin-initial-boom-dont-let-best-crypto-presale-to-buy-now-be-your-second-regret-in-2025/,"Let’s face it—crypto is a game of timing. Remember when Notcoin made headlines, and early investors laughed their way to the bank? If you’re reading this and kicking yourself for missing that ride, you’re not alone. But guess what? You’ve got a second shot at making it big. Enter BTFD Coin (BTFD) , the best crypto presale to buy right now, which has already raised over $5.5 million. With its presale in the 14th stage and over 66 billion coins sold to 9,200+ holders, BTFD is offering you an open door to the crypto elite. Now, let’s dive deeper into why BTFD Coin is the talk of the town and how it’s stepping into the spotlight after Notcoin paved the way. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolution You Can’t Ignore BTFD Coin (short for “Buy The Dip”) is the next big thing in the crypto world. Unlike most meme coins, BTFD isn’t just a trend—it’s a movement. Its presale is setting records, currently priced at $0.00016, and analysts are buzzing with predictions of a massive ROI post-listing. The coin is projected to hit $0.0006 after the presale ends, offering a whopping 275% return on investment. Imagine this: a $2,500 investment at the current presale price could turn into $9,375 once the coin hits its listing price. That’s the kind of math that gets hearts racing! But what makes BTFD stand out from other meme coins? Play-to-Earn Game: Launching on January 1, 2025, BTFD’s P2E game combines fun and financial rewards. Users can earn BTFD tokens while enjoying a thrilling gaming experience. Staking Rewards: With an incredible 90% APY, staking your BTFD tokens isn’t just profitable; it’s a ticket to passive income. Community Power: Dubbed the Bulls Squad, BTFD’s vibrant community is more than just holders—they’re investors, gamers, and die-hard enthusiasts. The presale performance speaks volumes about its potential. Over 66 billion coins sold, $5.5 million raised, and 9,200+ investors already on board. If you’re still hesitating, remember, that the train doesn’t wait forever. Referral Rewards: Multiply Your Gains Want to make even more money? BTFD’s referral program is as juicy as it gets. Here’s the breakdown: Share your unique referral code with your network. Earn 10% of every BTFD purchase made using your code if you rank in the top 20 on the leaderboard. Your referrals also get a 10% bonus for purchases above $50. The leaderboard resets monthly, so there’s always a new chance to win. With rewards tracked in real-time, you can watch your earnings stack up. Why just buy when you can help others join in and get paid for it? This is the beauty of this best crypto presale ! Notcoin: A Missed Opportunity That Still Haunts Notcoin made waves when it launched, proving that even a meme coin can deliver staggering returns if timed right. Launched with a playful theme and minimal hype, Notcoin became a sleeper hit, turning early $100 investments into tens of thousands of dollars within months. But as the price soared, the window of opportunity slammed shut for many. Notcoin’s history is a stark reminder of how quickly the crypto market can shift. From its humble beginnings to its peak price, Notcoin created millionaires almost overnight. Yet, not all news about Notcoin has been rosy. Its later stages saw diminished returns, with the market oversaturated and newer projects stealing the limelight. Fast forward to today, and Notcoin remains a reminder of what could have been. Analysts argue that its success was due to its early positioning in the meme coin space, coupled with a community-driven push that gave it its meteoric rise. However, those who got in late saw minimal gains—a lesson in why getting in early is crucial. With BTFD Coin following a similar trajectory but with far more utility and community engagement, it’s clear that history is repeating itself. The question is, will you seize this opportunity or let it pass you by again? Why Analysts Predict Big Things for BTFD Coin Crypto analysts are abuzz about BTFD’s potential. Its presale success alone sets it apart, but it’s the features and roadmap that have experts predicting a breakout year for the coin. The P2E game is already making headlines, with gamers excited to earn while they play. Plus, the staking rewards program—offering a jaw-dropping 90% APY —is expected to attract long-term holders, stabilizing the coin’s value. Analysts believe BTFD’s community-first approach, combined with its real-world utility, sets it apart from other meme coins. Unlike projects that rely solely on hype, BTFD is building an ecosystem where every participant benefits. Whether it’s through staking, gaming, or referrals, BTFD ensures there’s more than one way to earn. And let’s not forget the listing price of $0.0006. At that valuation, early investors are poised for returns that could rival Notcoin’s early success. If you’ve ever dreamed of turning a modest investment into a small fortune, BTFD’s presale is your golden ticket. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on the Best Crypto Presale to Buy If Notcoin taught us anything, it’s that early opportunities don’t wait. The best crypto presale to buy right now is undoubtedly BTFD Coin , with its stellar presale performance, engaging P2E game, and sky-high staking rewards. With $5.5 million already raised and the 14th presale stage underway, the clock is ticking. This isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a movement. Don’t let another golden opportunity slip through your fingers. Join the BTFD Coin presale today, and ride the wave of crypto’s next big thing. Sign up now before the dip turns into a peak!

Technical sentiments highlight increased positive action, suggesting a sustained bullish sentiment. The resistance and support trendline of Mantle are $1.40 and $1.00.

Bitcoin dropped from its all-time high of $108K and was exchanging hands at $104K at the time of publication. Despite the market correction, the Trump family project World Liberty Foundation has accumulated cryptocurrencies worth $49M in the past six hours. On-chain data showed that WLF bought an additional $9.8 million worth of wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) yesterday. The decentralized finance (DeFi) project also purchased another $2.6 million worth of TRX. Arkham showed that World Liberty Financial now held $370 million worth of cryptocurrencies. WLF holds $183.95 million worth of ETH, $57.29M worth of WBTC, $43.91M USDC, $10.28M TRX, and $8.42M worth of USDT. WLF purchases came as sales of the project’s own tokens headed into the final stage, with 2.4 billion WLFI tokens, a total of 25 billion, still available. Since the sale of WLFI went live in September, the project has raised a total of $1.1 billion. WLF also announced on Tuesday that it purchased several cryptocurrencies to commemorate Trump’s inauguration as the 47th President of the U.S. The project purchased $47 million worth of ETH and WBTC each. WLF also bought $4.7M worth of Aave, LINK, TRX, and ENA each. The cryptocurrency project also invested $32.8 million in 7,022 SETI, $14.7 million in 5,037 MENA, and $18.8 million in 7,413 SWEAT. Spot On Chain revealed the purchases were part of a broader strategy to expand WLF’s market footprint and capitalize on opportunities across the crypto space. Since its launch, Trump’s family has promoted the project, and DT Marks DEFI, LLC, a company associated with the President, is expected to receive 75% of the WLF’s revenue. The Arkham analytic platform also indicated Donald Trump’s Liberty Financial (WLFI) had become a top 0.1% holder of staked Ethereum (stETH) after accumulating $33 million stETH. The timing of these investments coincided with renewed interest in the platform, fueled by Trump and Melania’s launch of TRUMP and MELANIA memecoins on the Solana blockchain. WLF heightens interest in the crypto industry World Liberty Financial’s recent purchases came amid the changing landscape of the U.S. crypto regulation. The new Trump administration will embrace more pro-crypto policies after the expected departure of Gary Gensler as SEC chair. Tron founder Justin Sun, who invested $30 million in WLFI tokens in November, revealed he was optimistic about the future of crypto under the Trump administration’s anticipated stance. Sun also revealed on Monday another investment of $45 million in WLFI tokens, which pushed TRON DAO’s total portfolio in WLFI to $75M. “In my view, if I have made any money in cryptocurrency, all credit goes to President Trump. Both Trump Coin and World Liberty Financial are bound to perform exceptionally well.” – Justin Sun , founder of Tron Sun also emphasized that he was looking forward to seeing the Trump administration’s pro-crypto stance inspire and develop policies and initiatives to drive innovation and promote financial inclusion. WLF announced on Monday that it had successfully completed its 20% token supply sale. The cryptocurrency project also revealed an additional 5% token supply due to increased demand and interest across the crypto industry. World Liberty Financial is also actively building its digital presence as it expands its cryptocurrency portfolio. On January 19, the cryptocurrency project purchased four Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains through a multi-signature address: the world liberty.eth, trump coin.eth, eric trump.eth, and barrontrump.eth ENS domains.

Digital Asset Investor, a prominent crypto figure on X, shared a clip of Yusko’s appearance on the Good Morning Crypto Show, which sparked discussions about the evolving role of cryptocurrencies in national policy. Yusko suggested that the upcoming Donald Trump administration might consider expanding its crypto reserve strategy beyond Bitcoin to include other U.S.-developed cryptocurrencies, such as XRP, Cardano, and Hedera. He pointed to the efforts of these projects’ founders to build connections with influential figures, including Eric Trump, as a potential factor in their inclusion. There’s some talk.

He speculated that it might even be designated as the foundational layer for central bank digital currency (CBDC) projects or broader banking infrastructure. Such a move, if implemented, could signify a major shift in the U.S. approach to integrating blockchain technology into its financial systems. Highlighting XRP’s potential, Yusko contrasted its utility with Bitcoin’s status as digital gold. While Bitcoin’s primary role is widely recognized as a store of value, Yusko argued that cryptocurrencies like XRP could fulfill different purposes within a diverse financial ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Trump Administration and Digital Asset Reserves Discussions around the Trump administration’s crypto policy have intensified lately, particularly following a report that Trump plans to establish a national reserve in U.S.-made digital assets, including XRP and Solana . This initiative would prioritize these two assets and similar blockchain projects developed in the U.S. Trump’s idea could bolster the country’s leadership in the global crypto economy. Ripple has been prominently mentioned in these discussions. Its ongoing dialogue with the Trump team members, including recent meetings between Ripple executives and Trump , and a subsequent meeting with Vice President J. D. Vance, shows the company’s potential significance in this initiative. Although this move could impact Bitcoin’s global dominance, the idea of a U.S.-based crypto reserve appears to be gaining traction. While Yusko acknowledged that the implementation of such policies might not occur immediately, he emphasized the transformative potential of leveraging XRP as part of a national financial strategy. He highlighted that if XRP is integrated into a CBDC framework or banking infrastructure, it could redefine its role within the cryptocurrency market and legitimize blockchain technology in the country.

Reveals Whether He Bought Memecoins!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/binance-former-ceo-cz-talks-about-memecoins-through-trump-reveals-whether-he-bought-memecoins/,"CZ, the former CEO of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, spoke about memecoins. Speaking about the memecoin industry through Donald Trump's own memecoin TRUMP, which has been on the agenda recently, CZ said that memecoins have pros and cons. Emphasizing that investors should decide for themselves whether to invest in memecoins, considering all the pros and cons, CZ explained that he had never bought memecoins before. CZ responded to concerns about memecoins in a post on his X account, acknowledging that they have both benefits and drawbacks. CZ stated that memecoins can introduce new users to the cryptocurrency industry and validate the industry. CZ said that at this point, especially the issuance of memecoins by high-profile names such as the US President validates and supports crypto. But the celebrity also acknowledged concerns about the lack of intrinsic value associated with memecoins and the potential for short-term speculation. CZ emphasized the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, stating that individuals have the freedom to choose not to purchase crypto. He explained that as a founder, he does not personally invest in memecoins or NFTs, but respects the choices of others. “Possible pros of memecoins: Crypto is not a zero-sum game. Some of the people who bought TRUMP were probably not in crypto before. So, to some extent, it helped grow the space. Also, the fact that the US President has issued a meme coin also validates crypto. Possible cons to this: No dividends or long-term value. No intrinsic value, etc. (I've heard this about Bitcoin too.) Given these pros and cons, I guess the main point is that in a decentralized world, no one is forcing anyone to buy or not buy memes or any cryptocurrency. You don't have to mess with memecoins if you don't want to. But other people should have their own choices too. “I'm a builder myself. I haven't bought any Memecoins or NFTs. But just because I don't know how to appreciate something doesn't mean I'm against it.” https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1882512298352292344 *This is not investment advice.

This development comes after President Donald Trump announced via executive order to create a national digital asset stockpile. Hence, the chances of BTC hitting $120K before January 2025 ends are high . While many expected a Bitcoin reserve, the president took a generalist route, hinting that the US could accumulate Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as well. *TRUMP ORDER ON CRYPTO TO DEVELOP NATIONAL DIGITAL ASSET STOCKPILE: FOX — db (@tier10k) January 23, 2025 *bitcoin price updated as of No data found for bitcoin on 30 minutes ago. Despite this bullish announcement, the crypto markets remain unchanged except for the short-term volatility. However, technicals suggest that BTC hovers above the $100K psychological level and is primed for a bounce. Many analysts speculate that the news of a national crypto stockpile is not priced in and expect a massive rally. As noted above, the chances are high, but will Bitcoin price rise to $120K in the next seven days? Let’s find out. Will Bitcoin Price Hit $120K in Next 7 Days? From a technical standpoint, BTC price firmly stands above the $100K psychological level , despite recent market volatility. This signals strength and hints buyers could be defending this key support , hinting at a bounce. The key support levels include $100K, $98,638 and $96,800 . Even if BTC slides below $100K, the $99K to $96K is a buy zone , as noted in a previous article. The 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) hovers inside this buy zone at $98,638, making it a good place to accumulate BTC. On the contrary, the ATH at $110K, $115K and $120K are key resistance levels that could cause friction for the uptrend and where investors should consider booking profits . BTC/USDT 4-hour chart Technicals Indicate Clear Skies The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been bouncing off 50 for the past few days, adding credence to the idea that buyers are defending $100K support . A rebound off the mean level will signal a bullish momentum comeback and support Bitcoin revisiting its $110K ATH. The Awesome Oscillator (AO) shows no clear signal due to the recent chop. However, the recent descent in histogram bars coupled with consolidation reveals reduced bullish momentum. BTC Open Interest Recovers to ATH Levels On December 18, 2024, Bitcoin price hit an all-time high of $106K. Interestingly, the Open Interest (OI) also hit a new high of $71.85 billion. As a result of market uncertainty and profit-taking, the OI dropped to a low of $58.87 billion on January 12. The recent optimism surrounding the US President’s inauguration and approval of the national crypto stockpile has caught investors’ attention, which also explains the surge in OI back to the ATH levels. Currently, the OI sits at $67.52 billion. BTC Open Interest To summarize, Bitcoin price prediction is bullish. Technicals and other data points suggest that a bounce from $100K is likely . The next logical take-profit level for BTC is $120K. With only seven days left for the first month of 2025 to end, it is likely the month-end dynamics could trigger a volatile move to $120K.

39362986,https://invezz.com/?p=2468279,1737704287,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Explained: Trump’s executive order to support the growth of cryptocurrency,https://invezz.com/news/2025/01/24/explained-trumps-executive-order-to-support-the-growth-of-cryptocurrency/,"On Thursday, President Donald Trump signed an executive action that addresses key promises he made to the cryptocurrency industry during his 2024 campaign. “The digital asset industry plays a crucial role in innovation and economic development in the United States, as well as our nation’s international leadership,” the order said. “It is therefore the policy of my administration to support the responsible growth and use of digital assets.” Here’s a breakdown of what the order does and doesn’t do, and its implications for the crypto world. Creation of a presidential working group on digital assets The executive order establishes a task force to coordinate the development of clear regulations for the digital asset industry. This group, chaired by White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks, will include high-ranking officials like the Treasury Secretary and the SEC Chair. Key tasks for the group include identifying all existing regulations and policies affecting crypto within 30 days as well as submitting recommendations on these policies within 60 days. The task force will also be required to deliver a comprehensive report with legislative and regulatory proposals within 180 days. Anchorage Digital CEO Nathan McCauley praised the move, stating it marks a “significant first step” toward consistent and transparent regulation. Evaluation of a national digital asset stockpile While Trump stopped short of authorizing the immediate creation of a “strategic national bitcoin stockpile,” the order directs the working group to assess its feasibility. This evaluation includes exploring the potential use of cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the federal government as well as proposing criteria for managing and expanding such a reserve. The scope of this proposed stockpile could extend beyond Bitcoin, encompassing other digital assets seized through law enforcement actions. Prohibition of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) Trump delivered on his campaign promise to outlaw the creation of CBDCs, which are government-controlled cryptocurrencies. As per the order, CBDC has been defined as “a form of digital money or monetary value, denominated in the national unit of account, that is a direct liability of the central bank.” According to Trump’s order, agencies are prohibited from undertaking any action to establish, issue, or promote CBDCs within the jurisdiction of the United States or abroad. They can only do so if they are required by law. “Except to the extent required by law, any ongoing plans or initiatives at any agency related to the creation of a CBDC within the jurisdiction of the United States shall be immediately terminated, and no further actions may be taken to develop or implement such plans or initiatives,” read the order. While this prohibition resonates with crypto enthusiasts wary of state oversight, critics, like crypto researcher Molly White, argue it is largely symbolic, as no federal agency had seriously pursued a CBDC initiative. Rescinding Biden’s 2022 crypto Executive Order Trump revoked an earlier directive from President Joe Biden, which focused on studying digital assets and addressing their potential risks. This signals a departure from Biden’s cautious approach to crypto and a move toward more industry-friendly policies. Crypto industry reactions Bitcoin (BTC) experienced volatility following the announcement, initially rising and then falling, before settling slightly higher over a 24-hour period. The mixed market response reflects uncertainty about the order’s immediate impact. Sean Farrell, head of digital assets at Fundstrat, remarked in a Yahoo Finance report that the action had been “priced in” by the market. However, he noted that Trump’s pro-crypto stance is “huge” for the long-term future of the industry. Other developments already underway reflect the administration’s influence. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently rescinded accounting guidance (SAB 121) , which had hindered banks and broker-dealers from offering crypto custody services.

Ethereum ( ETH ) co-founder Vitalik Buterin warns that profit-driven models, like those in Solana ( SOL ), could mess with Ethereum’s principles, stressing how important it is to keep the network decentralized and socially grounded, calling it a contrast to what he calls the “Wall Street greed-is-good mentality.” In a blog post on Jan. 23, Buterin highlighted Ethereum’s decade-long mission to create a “global, censorship-resistant permissionless blockchain” and how it’s rooted in open-source values, much like projects like Linux and Mozilla. “The goal of Ethereum is the same as what it has been from day 1: building a global, censorship-resistant permissionless blockchain,” Buterin says. He also points out that the network’s scaling strategy, which focuses on layer-2 solutions, is key to keeping its decentralized social and technical foundation intact. You might also like: Bitcoin.com CEO: Ethereum may be skipped in this cycle due to having a “wokie energy.” Having what? The Ethereum co-founder also seems to be not buying into calls for a shift toward high-gas-limit layer-1 scaling, something some rivals are pushing. He argues that “this approach compromises too much of the benefits of Ethereum’s current social structure.” “One possible shortcut for scaling is to give up on L2s, and do everything through L1 with a much higher gas limit (either across many shards, or on one shard). However, this approach compromises too much of the benefits of Ethereum’s current social structure, which has been so effective at getting the benefits of different forms of research, development and ecosystem-building culture at the same time.” Vitalik Buterin Instead, he’s pushing the community to double down on accelerating layer-2 improvements, like scaling blobs, boosting interoperability, and upping security. Buterin’s warning comes on the heels of the Ethereum Foundation catching some heat for constantly selling off ETH to cover costs. As crypto.news reported earlier, a lot of people in the community are questioning whether that’s in line with Ethereum’s original vision.

Since then, TRX has struggled to regain its peak and has entered a consolidation phase. From December 5, 2024, to January 14, 2025, TRX fell to $0.22, forming a descending triangle—a bearish pattern indicating increasing selling pressure.

The platform owes nearly $200 million in ecosystem debt. In DeFi, ecosystem debt occurs when a blockchain owes more tokens than it holds, as seen with THORChain’s current situation. This often results from overambitious promises or mismanagement, leading to financial imbalances. On the other hand, leverage risk comes when users are using their crypto assets as collateral to borrow against to improve their positions. Leverage risks can magnify profits but also come with massive losses if the market falls short, possibly resulting in liquidations. THORChain network temporarily halts operations to address financial instability and implement a restructuring plan. Sourced from X by crypto.news According to Blockbeats , THORChain has $97 million in borrowing liability and $102 million in depositor and synthetic asset liabilities. This financial imbalance has pushed the blockchain to the brink of bankruptcy.

These risks have, in turn, affected the native token of THORChain RUNE ( RUNE ) token, resulting in price volatility where the token tanked over 40% in the last 24 hours, as of Jan 24. This situation has also led to a loss of confidence in the protocol, and the THORChain validators are currently voting on a restructuring plan.

The features that could send it in a downward reflective spiral are disabled and will be… — TCB (@1984_is_today) January 24, 2025 This restructuring plan will help stabilize the system and avoid more risk to the ecosystem. According to a THORChain core investor, TCB, risky lending and leverage features such as ThorFi were highlighted as primary cause of instability and has subsequently been removed from the blockchain. Without ThorFI's features, @THORChain would probably be a top 10 protocol. It's been a series of good news since streaming swaps launched that didn't even get noticed, it was an uninvestible asset and smart capital couldn't even touch it because of the complexity. — TCB (@1984_is_today) January 24, 2025 Additionally, the restructuring plan also includes efforts to regain users’ trust. As of now, integrations with wallets such as Trust Wallet and Coinbase are allowing users to connect to THORChain, and liquidity providers would be ensuring liquidity, helping the blockchain get back on its feet. Risks associated with DeFi lending While many within the crypto community earn passive income through DeFi lending, they are not devoid of risks. In Mar. 2020, MakerDAO went into an ecosystem debt of $6.65 million. The platform had to mint and sell MKR tokens to cover over $4.5 million as part of its debt repayment strategy. Overcomplicated features such as too much leverage can destabilize protocols, emphasizing the need for streamlined designs. Further, effective risk management systems also need to be in place to avoid ecosystem debt and protect users’ funds.

Two Factors That Say ‘No Way’,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/think-dogecoin-has-topped-out-two-factors-no-way/,"In an analysis provided by crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA), Dogecoin (DOGE) emerges as an altcoin defying current market skepticism, with technical indicators suggesting a bullish continuation rather than a peak. Dogecoin Is Still Bullish Kevin’s latest post on X highlights Dogecoin’s performance against its 50 and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA). “Dogecoin is still seeing fast expansion on the 50 and 200 simple moving averages after its weekly golden cross occurred,” he noted. This golden cross, a bullish indicator where the 50-day SMA crosses above the 200-day SMA, suggests sustained upward momentum. Related Reading: Dogecoin ETFs Will Skyrocket Price To $15, Forecasts Analyst Further examining the Fibonacci retracement levels, Kevin pointed out that Dogecoin is “above the macro golden pocket at .26 cents and is battling the macro .786.” The ‘golden pocket’—typically located between the 0.618 and 0.65 Fibonacci levels—is often considered a crucial support zone. Kevin argues that maintaining a price above this level is bullish. “If you think this chart is bearish in its current spot then you need some help. Not gonna focus on individual altcoins very much because BTC will determine the next move in the market no matter what your altcoin chart looks like but needed to remind people who are bad mouthing how crazy they look when we’re at the same price we were at in November when the market was rallying hard. Nothing has changed and cycle tops don’t occur when everyone is bearish,” Kevin expounded. Kevin further illustrated the erratic nature of crypto market sentiment, contrasting reactions from November and January. “When Dogecoin was hitting .35 cents in November, everyone was screaming to the hills that they were so bullish. DOGE at .35 cents in January, everyone is screaming that Doge sucks, I should have sold this thing a long time ago. Do you see how market psychology works? Pretty interesting,” he detailed. Bitcoin Needs To Move First Kevin also discussed Bitcoin’s influence on the broader crypto market, emphasizing its role as a leading indicator for altcoins like Dogecoin. He labeled yesterday’s market reaction to the crypto executive order by US President Donald Trump as a non-impactful in the long run. Related Reading: Dogecoin ETF Filing Takes Market By Storm, Can Positive Sentiment Trigger 200% Rise To $1 ATH? “BTC time and time again has failed to break the 1.703 FIB at 106.8K. Even though we broke out of this bullish falling channel on the daily time frame, we have failed to see any real money flow come into the asset if anything it has been decreasing over the last 48 hours. The Trump executive order was an obvious buy the rumor, sell the news event like all events are, so to me, that was always a nothing burger,” he elaborated. Despite these challenges, Kevin remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s potential for recovery. “I still think we’re experiencing seasonality in BTC as January’s are always really bad months, especially in the post halving year. I believe the goal should be to demoralize and anger as many investors as possible before starting the next leg higher, which should come within the next 1-3 weeks. Stay tuned!” he predicts. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.35.

Recent data provided by the token’s burn tracker indicated that over 6 million coins were permanently removed from the asset’s market supply. In turn, traders and investors anticipate a bullish impact on SHIB price, with their optimism further supported by the latest community developments. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Blows Up 1000% As Over 6M Coins Destroyed As per an X post by the burn tracker Shibburn on January 24, the intraday Shiba Inu burn rate spiraled 1041%, propelling market optimism surrounding the meme crypto. Primarily, as 6.7 million tokens were removed from the circulating supply, traders and investors anticipated price gains ahead, mirroring the law of supply and demand. For context, the meme coin’s burn mechanism sends SHIB tokens to a null address, thereby permanently removing them from the supply. In light of the abovementioned blow, market watchers expect a potential upswing despite the demand remaining the same. Latest Community Developments Inject Additional Optimism Simultaneously, it’s worth mentioning that the leading meme coin ‘s community has also secured a landmark achievement recently. The introduction of ShibOS, a blockchain-based operating system, has emerged as a revolutionary action in the Web3 space. Notably, the SHIB community introduced ShibOS , offering users seamless Web2 to Web3 transition opportunities for various use cases. This advancement, coupled with the Shiba Inu burn rate surge, has birthed noteworthy bullishness over the meme-themed asset’s long-term forecast. What’s Ahead For SHIB? At the time of reporting, SHIB price witnessed a gain of slightly over 1% and is trading at $0.00002028. The cryptocurrency’s 24-hour low and high were $0.00001954 and $0.00002047, flagging a highly turbulent intraday action. Notably, the broader price chart for the meme coin shows a period of sideways trading, underscoring a consolidation. However, the abovementioned Shiba Inu burn rate surge and recent developments can push the asset to witness remarkable gains ahead. Intriguingly, a recent SHIB price analysis by CoinGape reveals that it remains vital for the coin to break the key resistance at the $0.00002 level to embark upon a bullish movement. Traders and Investors continue to keep the token on their radars, awaiting bolstered price actions ahead.

The network has paused THORFI services, probably due to its financial uncertainty, which has circulated shock waves across the markets. The functions like swaps remain active while the lending operations are on hold. Although a ‘90-day’ restrictive initiative has been enforced, financial instability amid the rising speculation of a bull run and a strong altseason raises concern. All it started when Bitcoin borrowings increased when prices were lower, which required the minting of additional RUNE. Meanwhile, the lack of liquidity within the network added up more fire and as a result, the RUNE price underwent a massive drop of over 30%. As per the report, a pause has been imposed to prevent panic selling that could destabilize the platform. While some believe the Thorchain network is functional, the decentralised cross-chain protocol is working perfectly fine. As it generates huge amounts of fees, the platform cannot be insolvent, and adding an additional feature, lending, did not go in favour of the platform. However, the losses are said to be minimal, which could be overcome soon. Meanwhile, some believe Thorchain is following in the footsteps of Terra (LUNA) and hence could easily go to their levels. The platform is believed to be insolvent in a death spiral to death as the developers are alleged to have rugged their own network. Besides, the RUNE/BTC has headed back to the 2020 levels, experiencing a 96% drop from the peak in 2021, which is a major bearish flag for THORFI. As the borrowers may start repaying their loans, Thorchain has to realise losses by minting and selling RUNE. As per some reports, only a minimum amount of BTC & ETH in the Bitcoin and Ethereum pools are left on Thorchain. Hence, the next few hours could be extremely important for the Thorchain & RUNE price as well as the entire crypto space. If the market manages to absorb the shock waves, the FUD could be squashed effectively, but if RUNE/BTC continues to drop, Thorchain is feared to be the next LUNA.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,RUNE|TRADING|LUNA|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-24 07:46:06

He terms the range as the “topping cloud.” He also warns that if the market rises above the range, it may not hold. Potential Profits for Bitcoin Holders According to Bitbo data, a short-term BTC holder has paid an average price of $90,349 per BTC, and a long-term BTC holder has paid an average price of $24,627. This implies that if the market hits $150,000, a short-term holder will get an average profit of 66.0229%, and a long-term holder an average profit of 509.088%. Comparing 2025 to the 2016-2017 BTC Cycle In the first quarter of 2016, the Bitcoin market recorded a change of -3.25%; in the second, around +61.6%; in the third, -9.34%; and the fourth, +58%. In the first quarter of 2017, the market registered a change of +11.2%; in the second, +131.5%; in the third, +74.1%; and in the fourth, +226.1%. Check states that there are a lot of similarities between the present cycle and the 2016-2017 cycle. In both 2017 and 2016, the market showed impressive performance in the second and the third quarters of the year and expressed weakness in the first quarter. This indicates that the market may experience consolidation until May and a massive surge in the late 2025. Trader’s 2025 Bitcoin Predictions Traders expect strong price movements in 2025, but predictions differ on timing and magnitude. A crypto trader, identified as Bitquant, opines that claims of Bitcoin topping out now are premature. He expresses confidence in the market to gain further. Meanwhile, crypto trader Braver forecasts that the BTC market will demonstrate strong bullish momentum in the first quarter of 2025. Indirectly accepting the argument regarding the similarities between the current cycle and the 2016-2017 cycle, Braver acknowledges the possibility of the market reaching a macro top in the final quarter of the year. However, contrary to this assumption, cryptocurrency trader Mags asserts that the Bitcoin market will reach an all-time high between July and October. As Bitcoin mirrors patterns from the 2016-2017 cycle, analysts and traders forecast significant price movements in 2025. With a potential peak at $150,000, the crypto market looks set for an exciting year.",News|Bitcoin|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-24 07:47:12

His comments come amid rising criticism of the Ethereum Foundation, the grant-giving nonprofit that helps support Ethereum, as the asset loses market cap and mindshare to competitors. The widely watched ether-bitcoin ratio is down to 2021 levels. Bitcoin touched a record high above $109,000 earlier Monday and has returned 160% to investors over the past year. Ether, in the meantime, has gained just 40% in the period and is hovering some 30% below its 2021 peak, as a CoinDesk analysis showed. Another call-out was to increase Ethereum’s blob count while setting a minimum price for blobs, viewing them as “another possible revenue generator.” “If you take the average blob fee of the last 30 days, and suppose it stays the same (due to induced demand) while blob count increases to 128, Ethereum would burn 713,000 ETH per year,” Buterin noted, adding that such a favorable demand curve was “not guaranteed” and hence not an isolated strategy to bump ETH’s value. Blobs are like regular transactions with an extra piece of transaction data attached. However, unlike traditional transactions, blob-carrying transactions do not permanently occupy the mainnet space and are only available for 18 days. Since November, the daily tally of blobs averaged a record 21,000, with just two Layer 2s – Coinbase's BASE and World Chain – accounting for 55% of the daily activity. Sustained demand for Layer 2s could quickly deplete available capacity, as a CoinDesk analysis noted earlier in the week.",Markets,EN,0,0,ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BUSINESS|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-24 07:53:08

The crypto market is so huge, and at the same pace, it’s growing. To beginners, this area requires an understanding of how different it is from traditional investments. Success here comes from knowing where to look for information and how to evaluate new opportunities. Key Considerations Before Investing Before getting into new cryptocurrencies, consider these questions: Where does cryptocurrency fit into the bigger picture of your portfolio? Is cryptocurrency a good long-term investment? Should you invest in Initial Coin Offerings? Is it worth investing in NFTs? What is DeFi, and are there investment opportunities there? The crypto market is confusing. Scams and a lack of standardized valuation criteria send investors running for cover. Adding cryptocurrencies to a portfolio, however, can add diversity and high growth potential. Where to Find New Cryptocurrencies You can explore various platforms and tools to discover emerging cryptocurrencies: Cryptocurrency Exchanges Platforms like Binance , Coinbase , Crypto.com , and Kraken are great starting points. Most major exchanges list new coins as they launch. Some exchanges, like Coinbase, require an account to access detailed information about new cryptocurrencies. Data Aggregators Data aggregators provide up-to-date crypto information: CoinMarketCap : Lists new coins along with prices, market caps, and trading volumes. CoinGecko : Offers similar features to help you analyze coins. Social Media Social platforms provide real-time updates on crypto trends: X (formerly Twitter) : Follow developers and projects for updates on new coins. Telegram : Join crypto-related groups for direct communication with project teams. Discord : Many projects maintain servers for announcements and discussions. Specialized Tools Use tools to analyze and verify cryptocurrencies: KryptView : Research tokens by name or address. TokenSniffer : Provides audits of coins, highlighting potential risks. BSCCheck : Examines tokens on the Binance Smart Chain. Websites Explore reputable websites for crypto news and insights: Trading View Top ICO List DEX Screener Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Platforms DeFi platforms like Uniswap , Aave , and Maker allow users to engage in peer-to-peer transactions, lending, and borrowing. Many have native tokens that power their ecosystems. NFT Marketplaces NFTs are digital ownership of assets. New NFTs are listed on platforms such as OpenSea and Rarible. Specialized marketplaces like NBA TopShot sell to niche audiences. Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) ICOs raise funds for new projects. While fewer exist today due to stricter regulations, some opportunities remain. Always check if the ICO is registered with regulatory agencies. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) ETFs offer indirect exposure to cryptocurrencies. For instance, the Bitcoin Spot ETFs approved in 2024 allow investors to purchase shares in funds that hold cryptocurrencies. Evaluating New Cryptocurrencies Once you identify potential investments, analyze them carefully. Here are some factors to consider: Use Cases What purpose does cryptocurrency serve? Coins with strong use cases, like Ethereum (ETH) for smart contracts , often have higher potential. Market Metrics Review these key metrics: Price : Current value per coin. Market Cap : Total value of all circulating coins. Trading Volume : Amount traded in the last 24 hours. Community and Social Sentiment A strong community often supports a coin’s growth. Check forums, social media, and project updates to gauge sentiment. Regulations and Legal Status Ensure the cryptocurrency complies with local laws. Avoid coins involved in legal disputes or regulatory issues. Whitepapers A project’s whitepaper explains its purpose and technology. Analyze its clarity and feasibility. Tools for Analysis Here’s a quick comparison of popular tools: Tool Function Key Features CoinMarketCap Tracks new cryptocurrencies Prices, market cap, trading volumes TokenSniffer Analyzes token legitimacy Contract audits, risk flags, holder analysis KryptView Provides token research Holder data, transaction details Trading View Offers technical analysis tools Charts, price trends Common Red Flags Watch out for these warning signs to avoid scams: Exaggerated Promises : Claims of guaranteed returns. Lack of Transparency : Incomplete or vague whitepapers. High Concentration : Large token supplies held by few wallets. Unverified Contracts : Missing or unverified contract details. Staying Informed The crypto market changes rapidly. To stay ahead, regularly monitor: New listings on exchanges. Social media updates from project teams. Trends in DeFi platforms and NFT marketplaces. Investing in new cryptocurrencies can be exciting and profitable. Use reliable sources, conduct thorough research, and stay vigilant against scams. By following this guide, you can explore opportunities while minimizing risks.

Dog-themed Dogcoin (DCOIN), a memecoin project launched on the Ethereum (ETH) network, has registered palpable gains in the past 24 hours backed by a robust online community of investors. According to the latest market data, DCOIN price was up around 500 percent to trade about $0.00455 on Friday, during the early London session. The small-cap memecoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $4.5 million, had a 24-hour average traded volume of about $12.3 million, up over 13x. Top Reasons Why Dogcoin (DCOIN) Has Gained Significant Organic Traction Already listed on the Biconomy Exchange, the DCOIN memecoin has attracted more than 1.5k on-chain holders. Furthermore, the DCOIN developers did not participate in presale nor team allocations but provided the entire supply of the memecoin to the liquidity pool. According to market data from Dexscreener, nearly 40 Ethereum (ETH), worth about $130k, has been locked in the liquidity pool on the Uniswap protocol to ensure seamless DeFi trading. Consequently, crypto traders can seamlessly access DCOIN memecoin via top wallets – such as MetaMask and Trust Walley – without any hidden fees. “Dogcoin offers a chance to be part of a truly community-powered project.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Rekt Capital tells his 105,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin may be about to exit a corrective phase and enter another price discovery phase based on a historical pattern. Crypto traders and analysts refer to price discovery as a situation where a coin trades at levels never seen before in its history. “We’re already seeing this U-shaped reversal. So what is the confirmation signal that we need to see before we transition into the second price discovery uptrend? Because this corrective period is pretty much over. We haven’t really broken to new highs sustainably. We have made new all-time highs, but I’d like to see candle body new all-time highs just to showcase that this is a sustainable breakout and that we’re going to continue rallying higher. We need to see confirmation of breaking those old all-time highs and that final major resistance on the weekly time frame.” Rekt Capital/YouTube The analyst says that price discovery may ignite once Bitcoin overcomes the $104,671 level on the weekly chart. “The takeaway is very very simple: weekly close above this final major resistance and we might very well be off to the races.” Bitcoin is trading for $103,621 at time of writing. ?

Solana shows promise with its fast blockchain, Ripple remains a top choice for global payments and Remittix is making waves with its affordable and quick cross-border solutions. These projects are catching investors attention, offering potential for growth and making them some of the best coins to watch this year. Solana’s Price Drops but Hopes for a Rebound Stay Strong From its all-time high of $295.83 which it attained on January 19, Solana (SOL) has fallen 14%. Though the price has dropped, many investors still think Solana might recover and soar shortly. More people purchasing Solana once more is one encouraging indication. Solana’s spot market witnessed a lot of money streaming in over the previous day, indicating rising curiosity in the cryptocurrency. This is a significant departure from only one day before, when $137 million left Solana’s market the most in thirty days. Solana’s price has increased by 15% throughout the last 7 days in response to this revived interest. More people buying than selling drives the price up. This indicates that, looking for another significant price increase, investors are beginning to purchase once again and are convinced in Solana’s future. Although Solana’s price has suffered, its demand and purchasing activities may assist in recovery. Many feel it might not only hit its all-time high but even surpass it. XRP Price Might Drop Soon, But Don’t Worry! The price of XRP could somewhat decline during the next twelve hours. However, there is no need to worry, this is really normal! Calculations based on how bitcoin behaved throughout the last 24 hours may affect prices including XRP. This indicates just how the system operates, not because anything negative occurred. Many analysts believe XRP’s price will get stronger between January 19th and 20th, so long-term things seem favorable. Those who do not observe daily percentage-based pricing adjustments would notably benefit from this information. If you have been concerned, keep in mind that cryptocurrencies operate with these little fluctuations. People who are already aware of crypto movements most likely realize this is not very significant. Thus, simply be patient if you see XRP’s price declining momentarily. After these little adjustments, prices usually recover and even strengthen. Here’s Why Remittix Could Be the Next Big Thing in Crypto Remittix is changing how we send money worldwide by combining blockchain technology with regular money systems. It allows people to make fast and affordable cross-border payments. With support for over 40 cryptocurrencies, like Cardano, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin and Ethereum, Remittix can instantly convert these digital currencies into regular money, like USD or GBP.

Unlike traditional payment services like Stripe, Wise or even crypto-only platforms like Coinbase Wallet, Remittix stands out. It supports over 30 fiat currencies and 50 crypto pairs, making it one of the best coins to buy now if you’re looking for a platform with versatility and convenience. What makes Remittix special is its flat-fee system. Instead of charging hidden costs like many banks, it ensures that the exact amount you send reaches the recipient. This feature makes it one of the best coins to invest today for people and businesses looking for a fair, cost-effective way to transfer money.

Experts predict it could grow 25 times during the presale phase and gain over 5,000% after launch.

In 2027, it will range between $2.47 and $2.80, with an average price of $2.54. In 2030, it will range between $7.94 and $9.64, with an average price of $8.17. Unlike the common sentiment of being a meme token, ApeCoin (APE) has utility. APE is an ERC-20 token that governs the ApeCoin DAO. The token also has utility within an affiliated company, Yuga Labs, the firm behind the Otherside metaverse, BAYC, and MAYC NFTs. Will APE reach $10? What will be its price in 2025? Let’s explore these and more in the Cryptopolitan Price Prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Apecoin Ticker APE Current price $1.02 Market cap $765.95M Trading volume $92.79M Circulating supply 752.65M All-time high $39.40 on Mar 17, 2022 All-time low $0.4826 on Aug 5, 2024 24-hour high $1.03 24-hour low $0.9757 APE price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 9.19% 50-day SMA $1.2963 200-day SMA $0.9811 Sentiment Bearish Fear and Greed Index 75 (Greed) Green days 14/30 (47%) APE price analysis As of the time of writing (January 24), APE’s price had dropped by 12.66% in one week but up 2.03% in the last 24 hours, trading at approximately $1.02. The cryptocurrency’s trading volume rose by 25.30% in 24 hours. APE/USD 1-day chart analysis APE/USD 1-day price chart APE rose above $2 in December, reaching a high of $2.57, after which it started correcting. It now trades below the $1.10 mark. The MACD histogram shows the price is experiencing little momentum as it continues to drop. The William Alligator trendlines show high market volatility. APE/USD 4-hour chart analysis APE/USD 4-hour price chart The 4-hour chart highlights APE’s drop after it peaked at $1.40 on January 6. It registered continuous red candles as it fell closer to $1. At current levels, the drop has slowed with waning volatility. APE technical analysis: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 1.0734 SELL SMA 5 1.0393 SELL SMA 10 1.1235 SELL SMA 21 1.1458 SELL SMA 50 1.2963 SELL SMA 100 1.2291 SELL SMA 200 0.9811 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 1.0681 SELL EMA 5 1.0920 SELL EMA 10 1.1405 SELL EMA 21 1.2054 SELL EMA 50 1.2566 SELL EMA 100 1.1977 SELL EMA 200 1.1497 SELL What to expect from APE price analysis next? APE price analysis shows the market has been bearish despite registering little momentum in recent days, meaning the bears are still in control. Why is APE down? APE is correcting from highs registered in the last quarter of 2024. The rdro could be attributed to the wider market sentiment. Will APE reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, APE will break above $10 in 2030. At the time, APE should have bridged to ApeChain and grown much utility and applications such as in the metaverse. Will APE reach $100? It is unlikely that the APE price will be extended to $100 in the foreseeable future. At such a valuation, APE will be more valuable than the USDT stablecoin, which is more of a ‘household’ cryptocurrency. Will APE reach $1000? It is unlikely that the APE price will reach $1000 before 2030. Is APE a good investment?

Solana’s ETF Race and Hedera’s Enterprise Partnerships appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency landscape continues to thrive as groundbreaking projects redefine blockchain applications. Qubetics , Solana, and Hedera exemplify this innovation, offering compelling opportunities for growth in 2025.

Qubetics: Transforming Asset Markets with Tokenization The Qubetics tokenized assets marketplace is set to revolutionize traditional asset markets by addressing limited liquidity and lack of transparency. Qubetics enables seamless trading and efficient holdings management by creating a secondary market for tokenized assets . This increased liquidity accelerates the appreciation of asset values and empowers investors with greater flexibility to realize their gains. At the core of Qubetics’ success is the $TICS token, which continues to generate significant interest during its 18th presale stage. Priced at $0.0551, the token has raised $10.4 million, attracting a robust community of 15,700 holders who have acquired 435 million tokens.

As the ETF approval process unfolds, Solana’s position as a leader in the blockchain space ensures its continued relevance, making it a strong contender for the best cryptos to buy for January 2025.

Jake Auchincloss demand U.S. regulators investigate President Trump’s TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins. In a letter addressed to multiple federal agencies, including the US Office of Government Ethics, the SEC, the Treasury and the CFTC, Warren and Auchincloss outlined several concerns regarding the Trump family’s line of meme coins . One of the main concerns raised in the document is the potential ethics violation that comes with the mass token launch, as basically anyone in the world could purchase TRUMP ( TRUMP ) and boost the President’s net worth, including “secretive foreign buyers seeking to curry influence with the administration.” “Anyone, including the leaders of hostile nations, can covertly buy these coins, raising the specter of uninhibited and untraceable foreign influence over the President of the United States,” wrote Warren and Auchincloss in a joint letter. In the document, the pair noted that Trump and his wife’s combined net worth has surged to $58 billion overnight, thanks to the meme coins named after them which now represent nearly 90% of the 47th President’s net worth. They also claim the Trump organization has gained a profit of $58 million in trading fees alone by Jan. 20.

However, its value has since crashed by more than 50%, from $73 to $34. According to data from crypto.news, TRUMP’s market cap currently stands at $6.8 billion. Meanwhile, MELANIA ( MELANIA ) suffered an even greater loss. Despite bouncing to an all-time high of $13 on launch day, the token’s value has since fallen by 80% to only $2.56. Are TRUMP and MELANIA heading towards a rug-pull? In the letter, Warren and Auchincloss noted that the Trump meme coins came with a disclaimer that say the “Trump Memes” are only meant to be symbol of support for Trump’s ideals and beliefs and are not considered “the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any type.” “The terms and conditions of both TRUMP and MELANIA purport to indemnify the coins from any fraud-related claims and prevent purchasers from joining class action lawsuits against the coin or its issuers,” wrote Warren and Auchincloss in the letter. They questioned whether this disclaimer was enough to exempt the meme coins from federal law, deterring investors from filing complaints in the event of a major loss. However, they asked regulators if they would commit to investigating the tokens if investors did file complaints. The pair claimed that 80% of the TRUMP meme coins are reportedly held by CIC Digital and Fight Fight Fight LLC, two companies affiliated with the Trump Organization, citing a CNN report . They alleged that these organizations could easily sell their holdings and gain enormous profits, while simultaneously triggering a sharp decline in the coin’s value leading to major financial losses for other investors. As previously reported by crypto.news, Chainalysis found that around 60 wallets hold the majority of the funds generated by the TRUMP token. The firm also noted that over 77% of TRUMP-holding wallets made a profit worth less than $100.

Lightchain AI has rapidly gained attention due to its emphasis on scalability, transparency, and practical applications. The project has already gathered over $11.6 million at a presale price of $0.00525, showcasing strong investor faith in its groundbreaking vision. Although Polkadot and Litecoin maintain their popularity, Lightchain AI's innovative approach makes it a standout investment, offering impressive ROI potential, and positioning it as a leading contender for 2025. Polkadot (DOT) and Litecoin (LTC): Established Forces in Cryptocurrency Polkadot (DOT) and Litecoin (LTC) continue to hold significant influence in the crypto world. On January 18, 2025, DOT was priced at $7.59, marking a 6.15% uptick from its previous close, with an intraday high of $7.60 and a low of $7.11. Meanwhile, LTC stood at $137.84, reflecting a 10.67% increase, reaching an intraday high of $140.63 and a low of $122.83. Polkadot's innovative multi-chain structure enhances interoperability among different blockchains, boosting both scalability and security. Its governance framework allows DOT holders to participate in network governance, promoting a decentralized ecosystem. Litecoin, launched in 2011, is known for its quicker transaction times and reduced fees compared to Bitcoin, making it ideal for everyday use. Its long-standing presence and steady performance have cemented its reputation as a dependable digital currency. Both cryptocurrencies have shown their resilience and adaptability, staying relevant in the ever-changing digital asset landscape. Why Analysts See Lightchain AI as a Potential Powerhouse for Growth Lightchain AI is catching the eye of analysts for its potential to offer substantial returns, thanks to its unique focus on innovation and long-term value. The platform's scalability features, such as sharding and Layer 2 advancements, ensure high transaction throughput, making it ideal for practical AI applications. Its roadmap shows steady progress, with the Testnet Rollout in January 2025 allowing for community-driven performance assessment. Lightchain AI emphasizes decentralized governance, empowering stakeholders to collaboratively shape the ecosystem. Its strong tokenomics, featuring deflationary measures and an emphasis on sustainability, further increase its attractiveness. By addressing industry challenges like transparency and efficiency, Lightchain AI emerges as a strong contender for significant growth in the blockchain realm. Lightchain AI's Journey to Becoming a Market Leader As the cryptocurrency landscape shifts, new frontrunners emerge, challenging traditional norms with fresh solutions. Lightchain AI has established itself as a key player, utilizing advanced technology to fill industry gaps and offering stakeholders unparalleled investment prospects. Its distinct blend of scalability, transparency, governance, and sustainability positions it as a formidable candidate for explosive gains in 2025 and beyond. Both investors and analysts are acknowledging Lightchain AI's potential, with its recent presale success underscoring the project's promising future. Act now, and seize the chance to be part of the future leader in the crypto sphere. Keep a close watch on Lightchain AI's journey as it continues to set the stage for remarkable gains in the coming years. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

DTX Exchange, a buzzworthy platform, facilitates the trading of various assets between fiat and cryptocurrencies. It's poised to deliver spectacular returns in 2025 and aims to be the standout DeFi project of that year. SHIB has dominated the meme coin space with a market cap of $13 billion. Significant capital is required for price increments, meaning Shiba Inu's price will likely remain volatile. Analysts aren't feeling optimistic, but with superior alternatives emerging, traders can lock in their profits and transition to DTX Exchange for improved returns. Analysts Forecast Shiba Inu Price Adjustment As the second most favored meme coin, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen renewed interest with the introduction of the TRUMP coin. The price of Shiba Inu was erratic last week, showing both losses and gains, leaving predictions less than hopeful. Currently, Shiba Inu's price stands at $0.00002092, and it's anticipated to increase at a modest 3.5% inflation rate. The token faces uncertainty, and a bullish path is necessary to enhance its long-term prospects. Presently, Shiba Inu's price is testing resistance levels, a crucial point that could determine its future. A breakthrough could eventually drive the price much higher. If met with rejection at this pivotal resistance, SHIB may retest support levels, negating any bullish potential and dropping easily to $0.00001946. Reaching the all-time high seems a distant dream, and garnering support and attracting more buyers is essential to push the price upward. The price of Shiba Inu has also been buoyed by network activity, with the SHIB community burning tokens. This scarcity naturally pushes prices up. DTX Exchange: A DeFi Project Worth Watching DTX Exchange sets itself apart with its offerings for traders and investors.

Amid this, a recent report hints toward a potential BTC rally by 20% during the Chinese New Year, citing historical trends. Besides, it also comes amid soaring market optimism over a potential Bitcoin Strategic Reserve and pro-crypto regulations in the US, especially after Donald Trump’s inauguration. Bitcoin News: Why BTC Can Rally This Chinese New Year? The Chinese New Year has proven to be a bullish period for Bitcoin. In 11 out of the last 12 years, Bitcoin delivered positive returns during this festive season, achieving an 83% success rate, Matrixport reported . The report attributes this trend to heightened trading activity, as families and investors exchange gifts and funds, driving demand for Bitcoin. Meanwhile, the on-chain analytics firm highlights China’s dominance in Bitcoin’s early days. By 2014, the country controlled nearly 70% of global Bitcoin trading , fueled by strict capital controls, speculative investments, and large-scale mining operations. Besides, the Chinese tech sector played a pivotal role, in building mining rigs and increasing the number of validation nodes globally. In addition, the report noted that as more people learn about and buy Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency gains momentum. However, few events rival the Chinese New Year in amplifying this network effect. Source: Matrixport, X Major Technical, Macroeconomic, & Global Factors At Play Matrixport noted that Bitcoin’s current price is influenced by conflicting forces. On the technical side, oversold indicators suggest potential support, while weekly metrics point to overbought conditions. On the macroeconomic front, the Federal Reserve’s hawkish policies and tightening liquidity present challenges. However, expectations of the US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve under a pro-crypto Trump presidency offer bullish support. Meanwhile, Donald Trump made a flurry of pro-crypto promises during his election campaign, which bolstered market sentiment. Besides, the US SEC has also rescinded the SAB 121 crypto accounting rule, which has further fueled market sentiment. On the other hand, Trump has recently reiterated his stance on making the US the crypto capital. Besides, his pro-crypto focus is also evidenced by the recent executive order to create a national digital asset stockpile. Simultaneously, Matrixport noted that stablecoin minting remains subdued post-December’s FOMC meeting, signaling limited fiat inflows. However, funding rates for Bitcoin show early signs of recovery. This delicate balance has kept Bitcoin prices in a consolidation phase, poised for potential breakout opportunities. Can BTC Surge 20% This Chinese New Year? The Chinese New Year, starting January 29, marks a statistically significant period for Bitcoin. In 2022 and 2023, Bitcoin surged by 26% and 23%, respectively, reinforcing the reliability of this seasonal trend. Meanwhile, Matrixport analysts emphasize this period as the “most favorable 20-day window” for Bitcoin , offering promising opportunities for long positions. With daily reversal indicators signaling potential, many traders see the festive season as a unique catalyst for growth. Having said that, a BTC rally by 20% is likely if the history repeats this year. However, investors remained cautious, given some recent Bitcoin news that has dampened the market sentiment. For context, recent reports of China dumping its BTC holdings have added to concern this week amid a volatile market trend. What’s Next For Bitcoin Price? BTC price today delivered more than a 3% gain to trade at $105,489, with its trading volume soaring 65% to $99 billion. Notably, the crypto has touched an all-time high of $109K on Trump’s inauguration day, reflecting the market’s growing confidence. However, the current Relative Strength Index stands at 61, signaling a strong uptrend momentum for the crypto. Bitcoin price chart In addition, the recent market trends and global leaders’ shifting focus towards BTC could further boost the ongoing rally in the asset. Notably, a recent Bitcoin price analysis also hints towards a potential rally for the crypto to $120K, indicating the strong confidence of the market participants.

This move has coincided with a significant drop in Ripple’s XRP. Leading the charge, IntelMarkets is shaking up the trillion-dollar crypto landscape with its remarkable AI integration and deployment of automated trading robots, generating substantial gains. What’s Behind XRP’s Decline? Here’s the Scoop. Ripple’s XRP has taken a hit as several crypto markets experienced sell-offs today. The price plummeted over 5% amidst a broad crypto downturn affecting numerous major digital currencies. Ongoing regulatory uncertainties surrounding XRP have heightened investment risks, exacerbating market pressures. XRP's price edged near the $3 support level, surprising many traders. It is positioned close to the upper edge of the Bollinger Bands on both daily and weekly charts. Increased activity from short sellers has further driven the price downward. Various market analysts anticipate multiple potential outcomes for XRP's price in the immediate future. Even if current support levels hold, another 10% drop in value could occur. Some analyses suggest that if the selling doesn’t cease or slow down, XRP might lose roughly a third of its value. Major exchanges are reporting substantial sell-offs as the market downturn gathers momentum. Melania Trump Unveils Memecoin Amid Trump Presidency Ahead of her husband Donald Trump's inauguration as U.S. president, Melania Trump has introduced her own cryptocurrency named Melania. The token, hosted on the Solana blockchain, enters the market with a valuation of $1.7 billion, following the previous launch of $TRUMP, which currently holds a $12 billion valuation. She revealed the launch on social media platform X, inviting users to join the ‘Official Melania Meme’ movement. Both the $MELANIA and $TRUMP websites feature disclaimers stating that the tokens are not meant as investment vehicles or securities, adding a strategic note of caution to their marketing efforts. These developments reflect a complete turnaround in the Trump family's stance on digital currencies, with Donald Trump having previously dismissed crypto as a ‘scam.’ During his campaign, however, he embraced the sector, vowing to reduce regulatory obstacles and establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. His election victory also boosted market optimism, pushing BTC to a new all-time high of $107,000. AI-Powered Crypto Trading Platform Challenges Industry Leaders While the changing market sentiment has resulted in significant declines in XRP, a formidable competitor is quietly gearing up for a major launch. IntelMarkets , a dual-chain AI-based crypto trading platform, offers up to 1,000x leverage and advanced trading tools for its users. So far, INTL has become the year's hottest presale, with over $7 million already raised. With ongoing enhancements and practical product launches, IntelMarkets is poised to outshine major cryptocurrency players thanks to its widespread adoption among institutional investors and retail traders. The platform’s dual-functionality offers traders the flexibility to select their preferred blockchain based on their trading strategies. IntelMarkets’ Presale Stage 8 Sells Out Rapidly: Advances to Stage 9 IntelMarkets completed its presale rounds ahead of schedule, according to expert analysts. They claim that if the platform maintains its current momentum among investors, it could become the next XRP. With its strong statistics and bullish transactions, IntelMarkets is set to surpass projects like Ripple soon after its listing. As Ripple’s XRP faces resistance from investors, leading to significant sell-offs and ecosystem dips, IntelMarkets is receiving extraordinary support from the market.

Trump's Inauguration Causes Crypto Turbulence: $XYZ Meme Coin Set for a Massive 99,900% Surge The upcoming inauguration of Donald Trump is shaking up the crypto market, paving the way for an unprecedented bull run. As the initial excitement wanes, major cryptocurrencies manage only modest double-digit gains, while meme coins are capturing the spotlight. Remember PNUT's 4,500% spike or FRED's 6,000% leap? Those are tales of the past, overshadowed by fleeting hype. These coins crumbled under the pressure of mass sell-offs, leaving hopeful investors with losses. But the crypto arena is ruthless — a new powerhouse is emerging, aiming to shatter profit records with an extraordinary 99,900% rise.

Solana's SOL: A Fast Track in the Crypto World Picture a world where digital transactions are nearly instantaneous. That's the promise of Solana. This innovative blockchain platform focuses on speed and scalability without relying on complex solutions to improve performance. Its unique architecture allows for rapid transaction processing, making it an ideal platform for decentralized applications, competing with giants like Ethereum and Cardano. The SOL coin fuels this ecosystem, enabling transactions, running applications, and rewarding network supporters. So, should SOL catch your eye now? With its speedy network and adaptable development options, Solana is drawing the attention of developers and investors. Its ability to handle high-demand projects without delays gives it an edge over some competitors. In today's market, where speed and scalability matter, SOL stands out. While Ethereum grapples with congestion and some platforms need additional layers to scale, Solana remains straightforward and efficient. This makes SOL a compelling choice for those interested in a cryptocurrency backed by solid technology and promising potential. Dogecoin: From Meme to Market Player Dogecoin started as a joke in 2013, created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer. They envisioned a fun alternative to Bitcoin, using a Shiba Inu meme as its emblem. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has an unlimited supply, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially viewed as a ""memecoin,"" its value surged in 2021, propelled by social media and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin entered the top ten cryptocurrencies, valued at over $50 billion, showcasing the influence of community and social media in financial markets. Dogecoin's strength lies in its community and brand recognition. Its technology, built on Litecoin, facilitates quick transactions with minimal fees. While other cryptocurrencies emphasize scarcity, Dogecoin's abundance promotes spending and tipping. In today's market, there's a demand for cryptocurrencies with practical uses and robust networks. Developments like potential payment adoption add to Dogecoin's allure. However, the crypto market's volatility means Dogecoin's price is influenced by social media. Compared to other coins, Dogecoin offers simplicity and fun. Whether it's appealing now depends on market conditions and investor interest, but its journey from a meme to a serious contender is remarkable. XRP: The Swift Crypto Revolutionizing Global Transactions XRP is a digital currency designed for fast, cost-effective transfers. Backed by the XRP Ledger, it aims to simplify moving money, much like sending an email. Developed by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP debuted with 100 billion coins, most of which were allocated to Ripple, a company enhancing the network and supporting its expansion. XRP operates independently of a central authority, ensuring secure and irreversible transactions across borders without the need for a bank account. The name XRP derives from ""ripple credits,"" underscoring its mission to streamline payments across currencies. XRP's appeal lies in its speed and affordability. Transactions are completed in seconds, significantly faster than Bitcoin or Ethereum, making it ideal for global money transfers without exorbitant fees or delays. In today's market, XRP distinguishes itself with a focus on real-world payments. As demand for efficient fund transfers grows, XRP's usage could increase. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, XRP emphasizes seamless transactions rather than merely being a store of value. With trends favoring faster, cheaper transactions, XRP appears well-positioned to make a notable impact. Conclusion While SOL, DOGE, and XRP are making strides, XYZVerse's unique sports meme platform and ambitious growth objectives set it apart as a prominent player in the current bullish market.

The coin encounters resistance at $1.14 and has support at $0.58. Despite a recent 26% decline over the past month, it has shown promising growth of approximately 90% over the last six months. The momentum is mixed, with an RSI below 50 and a stochastic reading of 57.82, indicating potential for upward movement. Surpassing the resistance at $1.14 could pave the way for a new attempt at $1.42. Breaking through this level might result in noteworthy gains. However, maintaining above the 100-day moving average of $0.91 is critical for sustaining a positive trend. Worldcoin (WLD) Prepares for a Possible Comeback Worldcoin is striving for a recovery. Its current price fluctuates between $1.71 and $2.24, just below the 10-day simple moving average of $2.01. The nearest resistance is at $2.58, and overcoming it could push the price toward $3.12, representing a rise of more than 30% from its current high. The RSI is below 50, suggesting Worldcoin is not overbought. Weekly, it's down over 7%, and monthly, it's over 16% down. Bulls are optimistic that Worldcoin can reverse this trend. With the crypto market showing bullish signs, Worldcoin could see brighter days soon. Fantom's Ascent: Get Ready for a Major Move! Fantom (FTM) is showing potential with its current trading range between $0.20 and $0.30. It recently experienced a surge of over 5% in a week, indicating the start of an upward trend. The nearest resistance is at $0.35, and breaking this level could propel it toward $0.40 rapidly. The 10-day moving average points to bullish momentum, potentially leading to a 30% increase in the near future. Chart indicators like MACD and RSI are stable, suggesting room for growth. Strong support above $0.20 reduces downside risks. Brace yourself, as Fantom might be on the verge of a breakout. Solana Poised for a Potential Breakout Amid Market Optimism Solana's price is showing bullish tendencies, currently moving between $182 and $308. It has recently gained over 34% in a week and nearly 47% in six months. Its RSI suggests it's not overbought, leaving room for further growth. The closest barrier is at $365; breaking this could drive prices towards $491. The recent price increase and proximity to resistance levels indicate potential upward movement. Momentum indicators like the Stochastic also support a positive trend. The Solana network continues to attract attention for its speed and efficiency, further boosting investor interest. As altcoins gain traction, Solana may experience significant growth soon. Conclusion While ENA, WLD, FTM, and SOL show promise, their short-term gains might be limited.

Among these, Ripple (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and the new entrant, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) , are making considerable waves. These cryptocurrencies are showing potential, driven by market trends, technical indicators, and growing user adoption. XRP Update: Surge Driven by Market Optimism and Legal News Ripple’s XRP has recently seen an uptick in value, with its price reaching $3.37 on Coinmarketcap. This represents a 24.5% increase over the past week, positioning XRP among the top performers in the crypto space. Investor interest is largely fueled by Ripple's ongoing legal battle with the U.S. SEC. A court decision recently clarified that XRP is not considered a security for public sales, boosting investor confidence. With the SEC's appeal still underway, the market remains hopeful for a favorable outcome. Ripple continues to foster partnerships with financial institutions and remains vital for cross-border transactions. Analysts predict XRP might soon test new peaks, with targets around $4.40 based on technical analysis. Should regulatory clarity improve, XRP's price could reach between $5 and $7 by the end of 2025, making it a viable long-term investment option. Source X Dogecoin News: DOGE Regains Strength Amid Market Revival Dogecoin, the leading memecoin, has climbed 10% over the past week, with its price now standing at $0.40549 on Coinmarketcap. This surge coincides with a general rise in memecoin popularity and Bitcoin's trading above $100,000. The rise in DOGE is partially due to an increase in whale activity, with 200 million DOGE tokens accumulated in just two days. This heightened demand has fueled a bullish momentum, with technical patterns suggesting a potential climb to $1.75. The growing acceptance of DOGE is bolstered by strong community support and its integration into various payment platforms. Source X Cardano Forecast: ADA Nears Crucial Resistance Points Cardano (ADA) is off to a strong start in 2025, surging by 17% in the past week, with its price now at $1.13 on Coinmarketcap. This growth is supported by increased whale activity, with the number of wallets holding between one and ten million ADA steadily rising. ADA's technical outlook is promising, as indicated by upward-trending EMAs and a recent golden cross formation. The coin is poised to tackle the first major resistance at $1.15, with additional targets of $1.50 and $1.63. A key support level at $1.03 is crucial for maintaining this bullish trend. Long-term ADA holders remain optimistic, with noted trader Peter Brandt observing a double-bottom base that could signal the start of a significant bull run. Source X Yeti Ouro (YETIO) Gains Traction as a New Contender Yeti Ouro is a new player in the crypto arena, currently in its presale phase and drawing significant interest. The token is available at $0.017 during Stage 2 of the presale. The Yeti Ouro ecosystem is powered by an innovative development team working with top game asset developers to create their new game, Yeti Go. The game promises high-quality gameplay with its intricate mechanics, realistic environments, and dynamic sound design. Yeti Ouro's P2E racing game, YetiGo, currently under development using Unreal Engine 5, is gaining significant attention. The development team has partnered with industry veterans who have worked on renowned games like Call of Duty and The Witcher 3, ensuring high production value. This makes YetiGo an appealing option for blockchain gaming enthusiasts and investors. The development team recently released a video offering a sneak peek at the Level 1 map. This expansive map features a deathmatch-style gameplay, allowing players to dodge attackers and collect power-ups. More details are yet to be unveiled, including garages for vehicle upgrades and challenging terrains. With its combination of technological innovation and community growth, YETIO stands out as a promising asset. Early investors can expect significant returns as the project evolves, with analysts forecasting high demand once the token is listed on exchanges.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum managed to hold above $3,300 and closed this week with a 1% price increase. While this is not much, it does show that buyers are resilient at this key support level. The longer this happens, the more confidence the market will have in ETH moving higher. The current price action is also turning positive if we look at the momentum indicators on the daily timeframe. The MACD made a bullish cross recently and the RSI is making higher lows. These are early signals that Ethereum could soon wake up to challenge the resistance levels at $3,600 and $4,000 again. Looking ahead, Ethereum could surprise the market with a sharp move considering it did not do much in the past month while other altcoins like XRP and Solana made new price records. Eventually, profits will rotate and Ethereum is definitely one of the top candidates for market participants. Chart by Tradingview Ripple ( XRP ) XRP is down almost 5% on the weekly chart after it failed to rally above $3.4. The price is currently around $3.2 at the time of this writing and buyers seem absent or uninterested. Therefore, the cryptocurrency has been consolidating above the $3 key support level. As long as XRP stays above $3, there is a good shot at higher levels. But the longer buyers delay a clear breakout above $3.4 the more concerned holders will become. This is why it is critical for XRP to continue its rally. Looking ahead, the coin seems at a critical junction here. A failure to move higher could soon be interpreted as bearish and see the price break under $3. On the other hand, breaking above $3.4 would quickly see XRP move towards $4 next. Chart by Tradingview Cardano (ADA) ADA is down 11% on the weekly chart after sellers pushed the price down from $1.1 to $1 which acts as a key support. So far, buyers managed to keep this cryptocurrency above this level, but momentum is not really on their side. If we zoom out, ADA has been in a range since late November 2024 when it was rejected at $1.3 which also acts as an important resistance. The strongest support is found at 90 cents. As long as the price does not leave this range, the consolidation period continues. Looking ahead, Cardano seems to be in an impasse which reminds us of XRP’s price action. A clean breakout is required to resume the bullish trend, but until it happens, any delay could test the patience of ADA holders. Chart by Tradingview Binance Coin (BNB) Binance Coin closes the week with a 4% loss after it failed to stay above $700. But sellers don’t seem too interested in taking BNB lower at this time. Hence, the price has been hovering around the key support at $690. This lack of momentum has turned the action quite flat. What is worrying, however, is that the daily MACD has turned bearish this week. This could lead to additional selling pressure later on. Looking ahead, BNB could fall to $650 if sellers return or even to $600. These are the next key support levels should $690 break in the next few days. If so, that would likely indicate an overall market correction that could also see ADA and XRP make lower lows. Chart by Tradingview Solana (SOL) Solana continues to impress with a 22% rally in the past week and a new record price at $295. This is mainly due to the renewed attention to its chain after Trump launched its own meme token on Solana last Saturday. With liquidity fighting to reach Solana from all other competing chains, SOL saw a huge influx of liquidity and demand. This quickly pumped its price. Since then, the price entered a shallow correction that saw the price briefly drop to $230 before returning to $260 as of today. As long as the meme mania on Solana continues, this will sustain and push SOL’s price higher. Looking ahead, while the Trump meme FOMO subsided since last week, new meme tokens are being released daily that attract liquidity to Solana. This is bullish for SOL’s price and could see it make new price records in the future that could exceed $300.

As a result, analysts like Markus Thielen predict major growth for Ethereum. Meanwhile, the launch of Etherealize could also attract traditional finance players to Ethereum's ecosystem. Internal changes in the Ethereum Foundation, including calls for new leadership and a larger role for Consensys, are all signs that the ecosystem is more than ready to adapt to the much more favorable regulatory and market environment under President Donald Trump. Analysts Expect Ethereum to Rally Ethereum (ETH) may be on the verge of a major breakout after the pivotal decision by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to cancel a crypto accounting rule that previously prevented financial firms from offering cryptocurrency services. The SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 was introduced in March of 2022, and it required firms holding cryptocurrencies to record them as liabilities on their balance sheets. However, on Jan. 23, the SEC revoked this rule. Markus Thielen , head of research at 10x Research, pointed out the potential impact that this decision could have on Ethereum. He suggested that this regulatory shift could catalyze the expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi) services, of which Ethereum is a core infrastructure of the ecosystem. Thielen also mentioned that despite typically not being an avid advocate for Ethereum, its current price action presents a very compelling case for a low-risk, high-reward opportunity. At press time, ETH was trading hands at $3,373 after its price jumped by more than 4% over the past 24 hours of trading. Thielen suggested that there is a very real possibility of a breakout above the current triangle pattern on Ether’s chart. (Source: 10x Research ) The potential for Ethereum to reach new heights caused a lot of optimism among other crypto analysts as well. Titan of Crypto stated on social media that a $7,000 price for Ethereum is “inevitable.” Another trader called Crypto Caesar also predicted a surge for the asset. These bullish sentiments align with broader developments in the Ethereum ecosystem, including the anticipated approval of Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that allow staking, which was recently pointed out by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin. Lubin also revealed that the Trump family could soon expand its presence in the cryptocurrency space by building large-scale businesses on Ethereum. Ethereum Gets a Boost with New Institutional Marketing Arm ETH’s price could also receive a nice boost now that Etherealize , a new Ethereum-focused marketing firm, recently launched. Its main mission is to promote Ethereum and its token Ether to institutional investors. The project is backed by funding from the Ethereum Foundation and co-founder Vitalik Buterin, and debuted on Jan. 22. Overall, it plans to bridge the gap in institutional understanding of blockchain technology. Anthony Sassano, host of The Daily Gwei, praised the timing of the launch, and pointed to the pro-crypto stance of the Trump administration as an ideal backdrop for Etherealize to advocate for Ethereum's potential on Wall Street. Ethereum struggled to reclaim its all-time high of over $4,800 that was set in 2021, even after ETFs for ETH launched in the United States last July. On the other hand, Bitcoin soared to new peaks, driven by huge inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs and optimism surrounding President Trump’s crypto-friendly policies. The company is co-founded with TradFi veterans Vivek Raman and James Fickel, and it offers a suite of tools for institutions to tokenize real-world assets on Ethereum. This approach is very similar to efforts by other major financial players like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and Guggenheim, which have already started exploring tokenization on blockchain networks. Raman believes tokenization has the potential to transform industries like treasury markets, mutual funds, stocks, bonds, commodities, and real estate, by building on the early success of stablecoins. He pointed out that public blockchains like Ethereum can enable institutions to reduce costs and improve operational efficiency by using tokenized assets for trade and commerce. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently said something very similar by calling for the rapid approval of tokenization for bonds and stocks by the US SEC. BlackRock’s own tokenized money market fund on Ethereum attracted over $394 million, ranking as the third-largest tokenized treasury asset according to data from Dune Analytics . The Ethereum Foundation also recently announced plans to allocate 50,000 ETH, which is valued at close to $164 million, to support Ethereum’s decentralized finance ecosystem. Vitalik Buterin revealed that the nonprofit will undergo organizational changes to better support developers and enhance transparency in the community. Consensys Ready to Take Bigger Role in Ethereum Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin recently voiced his support for an overhaul of the Ethereum Foundation (EF) and shared that he is ready for his company, Consensys, to take on a bigger role in the ecosystem. During an interview , Lubin acknowledged that Consensys historically took more of a backseat to avoid perceptions of undue influence, but recent developments indicated that many people in the community still look to the company to champion Ethereum. The Ethereum community faced many internal tensions over the past few weeks, especially with criticism directed at EF’s perceived lack of leadership under Executive Director Aya Miyaguchi. Dissatisfaction also grew over the slow progress of Ethereum’s scaling roadmap and the stagnation of ETH’s price. This led to calls for Miyaguchi to be replaced with Ethereum researcher Danny Ryan. Despite the criticism, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin still defended Miyaguchi. Lubin believes there is a call for a shift in EF’s approach, particularly as the pro-crypto stance of the current US administration and expected regulatory changes created an environment that is ripe for growth and innovation. He suggested that EF has to adopt a more high-energy and risk-taking mindset to align more with the evolving ecosystem. Buterin agrees with this, and recently hinted that there will be major changes to EF’s leadership structure. He also suggested that Consensys or a similar organization could take over greater responsibilities. Consensys was established as a for-profit entity in 2014 to develop Ethereum infrastructure and applications. However, it has been operating under scrutiny for a long time now due to concerns about corporate influence on the blockchain’s direction. Buterin’s recent statements signaled a shift which suggests that Consensys could play a larger role when it comes to helping Ethereum reach its goals. Lubin welcomed the suggestion, and stated that the company is very eager to actively compete and provide interfaces for businesses and governments. Community discussions mostly centered on replacing Miyaguchi, whose low-profile leadership attracted a lot of criticism. However, her understated approach may have been instrumental in shielding Ethereum from regulatory scrutiny, particularly during the SEC’s investigation into whether ETH qualifies as a security. Although Buterin shared that the Foundation is working hard to improve EF’s technical expertise and ecosystem engagement, he dismissed the idea of a drastic ideological pivot for the foundation. In other words, it seems like Ethereum is more focused on an evolution rather than a complete departure from its established principles.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|REGULATION|ZRX|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-24 09:32:31

Noones, a Bitcoin ( BTC ) peer-to-peer marketplace founded by Paxful’s ex-CEO Ray Youssef, appears to have suffered a big hack. In early January, suspicious outflows drained around $7.9 million from the platform’s hot wallets on Ethereum ( ETH ), TRON ( TRX ), Solana ( SOL ), and BNB Chain ( BNB ), on-chain sleuth ZachXBT wrote in a Telegram post on Jan. 24. The blockchain investigator revealed the incident, showing hundreds of transactions, each under $7,000, as the funds were siphoned off. The stolen funds were bridged between Ethereum and BNB Chain before being funneled into Tornado Cash, a crypto mixer often used to obscure the trail of stolen funds. You might also like: LastPass hackers drained $12.4m ETH from 100+ wallets: ZachXBT The timing also raised eyebrows. Noones had announced maintenance around the same time as the hack, but, as ZachXBT noted, “no official statement was made about any security incident.” As of press time, Noones made no public statements on the matter. Noones came onto the scene in 2023, launched by Ray Youssef, who previously co-founded Paxful, another name in peer-to-peer crypto trading. Youssef saw Noones as a more community-driven alternative to Paxful, designed to give users easier access to crypto and digital payments while steering clear of some of the challenges he seemed to face at Paxful.

The S&P 500 surged to an all-time high of 6,118.71, breaking its previous December record of 6,090.27. The surge followed his address at the World Economic Forum on Jan. 24. Bitcoin didn’t miss the party, climbing from $102,000 to $105,000 within hours of his executive order promoting crypto, as Cryptopolitan reported last night. U.S. crude oil prices dipped after Trump announced plans to “ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil.” Global benchmark Brent crude followed, dropping sharply. At the same time, he also said he was gonna force a cut to interest rates, causing the 2-year Treasury yield, which tracks short-term rates, to tick downward. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 0.92%, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.22%. This is the fourth consecutive session of gains across all three indexes. The Fed faces a Trump crisis With the Federal Reserve set to meet next week, Trump’s comments are likely to influence discussions. Chair Jay Powell’s upcoming press conference has investors expecting hyper volatility, with the chance of a rate cut being near zero, according to the CMEGroup’s FedWatch Tool. When asked if he thought the Fed would actually listen to him if he demands a rate cut, the president responded with a simple “yeah.” This is because there is a lot of tension between him and the central bank’s officials, though mainly Powell. Though they used to be close friends and it was even Trump who first nominated Powell for the job, the president has said he quickly realized that Powell had betrayed him by deliberately doing things that benefited the Democratic Party, while ruining the president’s reputation. Powell, for his part, said last year that he would sue Trump if he attempts to force his way into their decision-making. An action like that is powerful enough to crash both the economy and financial markets.

The flagship cryptocurrency has registered an increase of nearly 3% over the past 24 hours and is currently trading around $104,612, with bulls looking to push it beyond $105,000. Ethereum (ETH) also registered a substantial recovery, rising over 4% to reclaim $3,300 and move to its current level of $3,330. Markets have bounced back after a bearish and highly volatile couple of days, with most cryptocurrencies trading in the green. Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA) , Tron (TRX) , Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Toncoin (TON), Hedera (HBAR), and Polkadot (DOT) registered substantial gains. As a result, the crypto market cap recorded an increase of nearly 2% and currently sits at 3.57%. Trump Issues Executive Order Banning CBDCs In a move that could have significant ramifications, US President Donald Trump has issued an executive order banning the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the US. The executive order, titled “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Finance Technology” introduces several key provisions, including a ban on the creation and issuance of a CBDC in the US. It also establishes several measures to regulate digital assets like stablecoins and cryptocurrencies. The executive order defines a CBDC as a form of digital money or monetary value denominated in the national unit of account that is a direct liability of the central bank. The order states, “Except to the extent required by law, agencies are hereby prohibited from undertaking any action to establish, issue, or promote CBDCs both within the US and abroad. Additionally, any ongoing plans or initiatives related to CBDC creation will be immediately halted.” A Presidential Working Group US President Donald Trump has ordered the creation of a cryptocurrency working group tasked with developing new digital asset regulations and exploring the creation of a cryptocurrency stockpile. The highly anticipated order also ordered that banking services for crypto companies be protected, alluding to claims US lenders have directed lenders to cut crypto companies from banking services, a charge regulators have vehemently denied. The order was met with enthusiasm by the crypto industry, which has been pushing for the new administration to send a strong sign of support for the industry. Nathan McCauley, CEO and co-founder of Anchorage Digital, stated, “Today’s crypto executive order marks a sea change in U.S. digital asset policy. By taking a whole-of-government approach to crypto, the Administration is making a significant first step toward writing clear, consistent rules of the road.” If implemented, Trump’s executive order could bring crypto into the mainstream. Tim Scott, Republican Chair of the Senate Banking Committee, stated, “Just days into his administration, President Trump is delivering on his promises... to keep the United States a leader in digital assets innovation.” SEC Rescinds SAB 121 Requirement The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has withdrawn the controversial SAB 121 requirement for crypto accounting which outlined strict disclosure requirements for financial institutions holding crypto on their books. The SEC issued SAB 122, rescinding SAB 121, and allowing financial institutions that hold crypto on behalf of their customers to determine whether to declare the digital assets as a liability. SAB 121 required custody providers to treat crypto holdings as both an asset and a liability. However, this was a sticking point for crypto firms who opposed the requirement due to the complexity of account practices. The withdrawal of SAB 121 highlights the Trump administration’s crypto-friendly stance, which Trump had alluded to during campaigning. Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda had also publicly opposed SAB 121 during former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s term. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) faced significant volatility on Thursday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. As a result, BTC saw wild price swings before ultimately registering a marginal increase. Analysts believe further volatility lies ahead, and traders could capitalize on significant price swings. Indicators suggest BTC, currently trading around $104,500, is like a coiled spring that could go in either direction. The indicator analysts are referring to is the 60-day price range, which represents the maximum and minimum price ticks in percentage terms. A tiger range indicates stable market conditions. A Glassnode analysis shows BTC’s 60-day range is tighter than the current trading range. Historically, such conditions indicate significant volatility. Glassnode stated in its report, “All of these instances have occurred before a significant burst of volatility, with the majority being in early bull markets or prior to late-stage capitulations in bear cycles.” BTC has been trading in a steady upward trajectory since its collapse last week when it dipped to an intraday low of $89,397. It recovered over the next two sessions, rising above the 20 and 50-day SMAs and settling at $100,051 by Wednesday. However, it was back in the red on Thursday, dropping to an intraday low of $97,094 before settling at $99,798, registering only a marginal decline. Buyers returned to the market on Friday as BTC rose nearly 4% to surge past $100,000 and settle at $103,732. The price was back in the red on Saturday, dropping marginally on Saturday and then by 2.07% on Sunday to settle at $101,434. Source: TradingView BTC started the current week facing significant volatility as it surged to a new all-time high on Monday, reaching $109,312. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching this level and the price fell to an intraday low of $99,516 before reclaiming $100,000 and settling at $102,408. Sellers attempted to drive BTC below $100,000 on Tuesday as it fell to an intraday low of $100,161. However, it recovered from this level to register an increase of nearly 4% and settle at $106,054. Despite strong momentum, BTC was back in the red on Wednesday, dropping 2.21% and settling at $103,715. Volatility returned to the market on Thursday as buyers and sellers sought to establish control. As a result, BTC rose to an intraday high of $106,913, and dropped to an intraday low of $101,290, before ultimately registering a marginal increase and settling at $104,004. The current session sees BTC up nearly 1% and trading just above $105,000. If buyers can maintain momentum, we could see BTC test its all-time high and potentially move beyond $110,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is at the cusp of pushing above $3,400 after finally breaking past the 20-day SMA and a key resistance level. ETH faced significant volatility over the past few sessions as it struggled to stay above the 20-day SMA, with the price dipping below $3,300 during the ongoing week. Despite ETH’s recent volatility, it was bullish at the beginning of the previous week. The price surged past the 20-day SMA on Wednesday after registering an increase of nearly 7% and moving to $3,450.

Buyers returned to the market on Friday, pushing ETH up nearly 5% to $3,473. Bearish sentiment returned over the weekend as ETH dropped 4.84% on Saturday to slip below the 20-day SMA and settle at $3,305.

Bullish sentiment registered a substantial increase on Saturday as SOL surged an incredible 19.19% and settled at $261.

Source: TradingView Volatility and bearish sentiment persisted on Monday as SOL rose to an intraday high of $272 and dropped to an intraday low of $229 before ultimately settling at $241, registering a drop of just over 4%. Despite facing significant volatility, SOL rose 3.47% on Tuesday and settled at $250. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as SOL surged to an intraday high of $272. However, selling pressure at this level forced the price down, and SOL settled at $257, registering an increase of nearly 3%. Sellers returned to the market on Thursday as SOL dropped to an intraday low of $242 before recovering and settling at $253. The current session sees SOL up nearly 3% and trading around $260. Arbitrum (ARB) Price Analysis Arbitrum (ARB) is trading in a narrow range as it struggles to build momentum and push above the 20-day SMA, which acted as a dynamic resistance level. ARB crossed the 20-day SMA on Friday, rising nearly 8% and settling at $0.815. However, bearish sentiment returned on Saturday as the price fell below the 20-day SMA and settled at $0.766. Sellers retained control on Sunday, and ARB dropped nearly 9% to $0.698. Buyers attempted a recovery on Monday as ARB rose to an intraday high of $0.759.

Mantle ( MNT ) bounded 17% to an intraday high of $1.28 on Jan. 24 while bringing its market to nearly $4.2 billion at press time. The price surge came along with a 60% jump in the altcoin’s daily trading volume which was hovering over $213 million. Notably, the altcoin began its price upswing on Jan. 20 and has gained 32% since then, while its gains over the past year have reached 104%. The altcoin currently stands as the 40th largest crypto asset per data from CoinGecko, with a circulating supply of over 3.36 billion tokens. What led the MNT rally? MNT rallied after its developers announced six key products the project is working on this year to expand its ecosystem. The Mantle ecosystem already includes the modular layer-2 blockchain Mantle Network, the mETH protocol—a liquid staking product—and its wrapped BTC product ‘Ignition FBC.’ However, the project has now introduced three new pillars to support its growth: a crypto fund called Enhanced Index Fund, a blockchain-based banking platform named Mantle Banking, and MantleX, a platform focused on creating AI agents. The rally was also supported by a surge in Mantle ’s daily active and new addresses involved in MNT transactions. On-chain data from IntoTheblock shows a 50% jump in the number of active addresses completing at least one MNT transaction over the past week. Additionally, the number of new addresses created has also increased by nearly 16% during the period. Source: IntoTheBlock An uptick in daily active addresses and new addresses is a sign of strong network health and indicates growing adoption of the network.

As talk of a US national Bitcoin Reserve grows, the topic has become a topic of discussion between Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Riot Platforms Vice President Pierre Rochard. Pierre Rochard, vice president of Bitcoin mining company Riot Platforms, claimed that Ripple is the biggest obstacle to the US Bitcoin strategic reserve. Pierre Rochard stated that Ripple (XRP) is the biggest obstacle to introducing Bitcoin as a strategic asset in the US. Accordingly, Rochard claimed that Ripple aggressively lobbied and spent millions of dollars to block the BTC reserve plan. Rochard also claimed that Ripple was prioritizing XRP over supporting Bitcoin. He added that the Ripple hurdle was potentially due to Ripple’s interest in introducing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) that could run on its infrastructure. Ripple CEO's Response Was Quick! In the face of these significant allegations, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also made a statement and denied the allegations that Ripple was lobbying against the Bitcoin reserve plan. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has denied allegations that the company is lobbying against a US Bitcoin reserve, stating that he supports a multi-token reserve. As the Bitcoin reserve debate continues, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao stated that the Bitcoin reserve has almost been approved following the appointment of Senator Cynthia Lummis to chair the Senate Digital Assets Subcommittee. https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1882513710616621442 *This is not investment advice.

Just hours before Trump’s inauguration, WLFI made headlines for acquiring over $109 million in digital assets across six cryptocurrencies in a single day. Among the standout transactions was the purchase of 177.26 Wrapped Bitcoin ( WBTC ), worth approximately $18.8 million. WBTC, a Bitcoin derivative token designed to operate natively on the Ethereum ( ETH ) blockchain, has become increasingly popular for bridging Bitcoin’s liquidity into decentralized finance ecosystems. The buying spree coincides with Trump’s broader initiative to establish a national digital asset stockpile, reflecting his administration’s commitment to bolstering the U.S.’s position in blockchain technology. As of January 2024 WLFI has continued to make aggressive moves in the market, including the acquisition of 3,079 ETH for approximately $10 million and 10.61 million TRX (TRON), valued at $2.65 million according to data retrieved by Finbold from Arkham Intelligence.

Wrapped Bitcoin’s inclusion further demonstrates WLFI’s focus on leveraging Ethereum’s ecosystem for Bitcoin’s liquidity. This strategic alignment is echoed by WLFI’s increasing interest in TRON, a blockchain designed for high-throughput decentralized applications, signaling potential integration into scalable infrastructure for payments or dApps.

Multiple DeFi and traditional finance companies have looked into tokenization, setting up the sector for doubling its size in 2025. Tokenized real world assets (RWA) grew to $7.9B with more diversity in 2024. The issuance of tokens based on bonds or money markets reflected demand from DeFi projects, as well as traditional finance testing out the potential for tokenization. The value of tokenized assets peaked at $8.52B in early 2025, later sliding due to users flowing out of Usual Protocol. The value of tokenized real-world assets rose close to an all-time peak, led by legacy DeFi protocols like Maker and Tether Gold. BlackRock’s BUIDL token is still growing more conservatively, carrying $589.36M in tokenized money market instruments. Demand for BUIDL comes from Ondo and other DeFi protocols that are seeking a predictable and secure collateral. RWA is usually tied to blue-chip DeFi, and is used as a collateral for loans, which are then used for riskier trading activities. With the expectations of a bull market in 2025, the main prediction is for the current tokenization sector to double its value locked. Currently, the main use case for tokenized assets is increased security for DeFi protocols. Tokenized RWA are also more often tied to highly liquid assets, so far bypassing the tokenization of real estate or stocks, with some niche exceptions. Despite the relatively conservative approach, tokenized real-world assets \tripled their value in 2024, with more diverse issuers. The biggest factor for growth was the inflow of new protocols, which quickly added more value locked. One of the biggest effects was due to Usual Protocol, which claims $1.24B in assets under management. Most of the tokenized RWA end up as the basis for new types of stablecoins, or support older instruments. Gold is also a part of the well-established infrastructure for tokenization. RWA tokenization still lacks a common standard Crypto projects have already established their position with different approaches to tokenization. Recently, BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink called for mass real-world asset tokenization, requesting the US Securities and Exchange Commission to approve of the mass tokenization for stocks and bonds. Fink spoke for the CNBC Squawk Box during the Davos World Economic Forum, explaining that tokenized assets would simplify share voting and ownership structures. Tokenization may be easy for crypto projects, and multiple startups have created informal tokens based on stocks or markets. However, official tokenization may be a challenge when selecting the right chain and infrastructure. Currently, most RWA tokenization still uses Ethereum (ETH), posing challenges for high-activity assets. Most tokenized RWA are held in treasuries, and have relatively small organic markets. In the case of mass tokenization, trading speed would be essential, testing the limit of even the fastest blockchains. Tokenization among crypto projects is still small compared to the $1.64 trillion in available assets. However, the constraints from the size of the crypto market may limit the growth. Expected new regulations from the USA may affect the RWA tokenization process and introduce standards and limitations. RWA narrative goes through market recovery Among crypto projects, RWA is still mostly a narrative grouping some of the most prominent DeFi projects. Recently, the whole RWA sector recovered, to over $38B in total market capitalization. The biggest winners were Chainlink (LINK) and Ondo Finance (ONDO), which aim to provide the infrastructure for reliable tokenization and data management. ONDO remains among the leading tokens on a 90-day time frame, along with other RWA assets. RWA assets outperformed on a 90-day time frame, and are emerging with a slight advantage after traders moved away from the AI agent narrative (Source: Dune Analytics ) RWA is one of the few narratives to get ahead of meme tokens on a weekly time frame. Currently, most altcoin narratives lag behind Bitcoin (BTC), but RWA comes ahead of other trends. Based on the relative strength metric, AI agents had the biggest weekly loss , while interest switched over to RWA, with small positive growth. RWA has always remained a staple narrative with positive growth for the last three months, though lagging behind the explosive development of AI agents.

It seems the new administration may be aiming to tackle both. President Donald Trump signs a ban on CBDC On Thursday, President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order “to establish regulatory clarity for digital financial technology and secure America’s position as the global leader in the digital asset economy.” A key point in the order is the long-anticipated ban on widely loathed – at least in crypto circles – central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The order, available on the White House’s website , states as follows: “The Executive Order prohibits agencies from undertaking any action to establish, issue, or promote central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).” Trump’s working group to evaluate the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve The executive order establishes a working group – referred to as the Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets – to develop regulations for digital assets, including cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. The team charged with the mission will be headed by David Sacks, the White House AI and Crypto Czar, and will include the Treasury secretary, attorney general, and the SEC’s chair. The group will explore the idea of a national Bitcoin reserve, similar to the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, to help stabilize the economy. The proposed crypto reserve would involve the US government holding a large amount of Bitcoin as a reserve asset. The idea has already been floated for at least several months. In August 2024, Senator Cynthia Lummis proposed legislation to purchase 200,000 Bitcoin annually for five years, aiming for a reserve of one million Bitcoin. The initiative was aimed at strengthening the US dollar and fighting inflation. Eliminating Biden’s administration overreach Last but not least, Donald Trump’s Executive Order overturns the previous administration’s approach to digital assets, which, it argues, hindered innovation and hurt the economic liberty of Americans. The order aims to position the US as a global leader in digital finance by eliminating excessive regulation and fostering a crypto-friendly environment free from government overreach. By banning CBDCs and pushing for a Bitcoin reserve, Trump and his team make good on their pre-electoral promises. However, challenges are plenty, and the final shape as well as the long-term impact of the proposed changes remain to be seen.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION|BTC|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-24 09:55:51

On one hand, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is seeing a trading volume surge of over 23.59%, even as it wrestles with a one-month dip of 16.26%. On the other hand, Dogecoin (DOGE) is buzzing with the news of a potential ETF, despite a 66.59% drop in trading volume. Amid all this excitement, a new player is charging ahead: BTFD Coin (BTFD), offering a jaw-dropping 90% APY staking opportunity. Meme coins are no longer just about jokes—they’re vehicles for serious profits and dedicated communities. For those looking for the top meme coins to invest in , BTFD Coin is rewriting the narrative with unmatched staking rewards, its play-to-earn (P2E) game, and a thriving community of bulls. Let’s break down why BTFD Coin stands out as a top meme coin to invest in, alongside the latest updates on DOGE and PENGU. Own the Dip: BTFD Coin’s 90% APY Staking Is a Game Changer If you’ve ever wanted to ride the bull wave, BTFD Coin is where you start. This isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a revolution. From its incredible P2E game, launched on January 1, to its skyrocketing presale performance—now in Stage 14 with over $5.5 million raised—BTFD is turning heads. At $0.00016 per coin, this is your chance to own the dip before it’s gone. The highlight? A staggering 90% APY staking reward. Imagine staking $BTFD tokens and watching your rewards grow like never before. This kind of return is unheard of in traditional markets and even among most cryptos. For those searching for the top meme coins to invest, here’s a simple scenario: if you invest $5,000 at the current price of $0.00016 per coin, you’ll get 31,250,000 tokens. When BTFD hits its projected price of $0.0006 at the end of the presale, your investment would balloon to $18,750. That’s nearly a 4x return—without factoring in staking rewards. And there’s more. Stage 13 tokens were burned, creating a tighter supply and boosting demand. Plus, the LAUNCH100 bonus code doubles your token count during Stage 14. Buy $1,000 worth of BTFD, and you’ll get $2,000 worth of tokens. It’s the ultimate bull run, and the presale is your ticket. So, how do you join the action? It’s simple: Set up your wallet with MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT. Visit the presale page , connect your wallet, and apply the LAUNCH100 code. Buy your tokens, stake them, and watch your rewards multiply. With BTFD’s focus on community, innovation, and unbeatable staking rewards, it’s clear why this coin is one of the top choices in this list of top meme coins to invest in right now. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): A Cultural Icon in Crypto Pudgy Penguins isn’t just a meme coin; it’s a phenomenon. Trading at $0.02592, PENGU has seen a 6.42% uptick in the last 24 hours, although it’s down 24.16% over the past week. Still, its trading volume is up 23.59%, a sign of growing interest. PENGU’s appeal lies in its story. It’s the official token of Pudgy Penguins, a brand that has taken the crypto and pop culture worlds by storm. From dominating social media with over 50 billion views to being featured in ETF commercials, Pudgy Penguins is more than a community—it’s a movement. While the coin’s price is far from its all-time high of $0.05738 last month, the community remains optimistic. The concept of “The Huddle” unites fans around memes, good vibes, and a shared belief in the prophecy of the Penguin. For those who believe in the long-term potential of cultural capital in crypto, PENGU is a coin to watch. And with its recent trading volume surge, it’s clear that the Penguin fanbase is as passionate as ever. Dogecoin (DOGE): ETF Buzz Sparks Fresh Optimism Dogecoin might be the original meme coin, but it’s far from being outdated. Trading at $0.3535, DOGE is showing signs of a bullish breakout despite a 3% dip in the last 24 hours. Its trading volume is down by 66.59%, but the buzz around a potential Dogecoin ETF is reigniting investor interest. On January 22, Bitwise Asset Management filed for a DOGE ETF, following similar filings by Rex Shares and Osprey Funds. If approved, a Dogecoin ETF could attract significant institutional investment, much like Bitcoin ETFs have done. Even a small fraction of those inflows could drive DOGE prices to new heights. DOGE also benefits from its enduring popularity and a strong community that embraces its playful nature. Its 10.02% one-month gain reflects renewed confidence, and with the ETF filing in progress, the coin could be poised for a major breakout. As always, Dogecoin remains a symbol of the unpredictable, meme-driven potential of the crypto market. The Bottom Line Based on our research and market trends, the meme coin landscape is as dynamic as ever. For those looking for the top meme coins to invest in, BTFD Coin is stealing the show with its 90% APY staking rewards and presale momentum, offering an unparalleled opportunity to own the dip and ride the bull run. Meanwhile, Pudgy Penguins continues to thrive as a cultural icon, and Dogecoin is making headlines with its ETF buzz.

Within the first 24 hours of trading, the VINE token recorded significant activity, reaching a temporary market capitalization of $400 million before stabilizing. While it has since experienced a slight decline, its trading volume continues to rise, currently reaching $1.37 billion, securing a spot among the most traded assets on the Solana blockchain. On-chain data indicates activity among new wallet addresses, with some reporting unrealized gains exceeding $1 million. The $VINE token was launched by its founder, Rus Yusupov, marking the first major tech company founder to issue a cryptocurrency after the Trump Coin craze. Its core mission is to disrupt the traditional centralized economic model by introducing a decentralized ecosystem aimed at transforming content creation and monetization. The token's potential lies in giving creators direct ownership and control over their content, creating a more transparent and fair platform compared to centralized alternatives. As of this writing, the $VINE token price is $0.25, up by 1697.34% in the last 48 hours. Eight hours ago, a tweet from founder Rus Yusupov on X led to a 39.37% increase in VINE's trading volume. Currently, BYDFi supports VINE/USDT spot trading with a minimum trade amount of just $10. The platform has also launched several other popular tokens, including SONIC/USDT , AIOS/USDT , and BUZZ/USDT . Additionally, BYDFi is offering new users a welcome bonus of up to 8100 USDT . Users can claim this reward by completing simple tasks. For more details, users can refer to the BYDFi website . About VINE VINE , the platform that gave rise to the token, was established in 2012 and quickly gained 200 million users with its innovative 10-second video format. It was later acquired by Twitter, leading to the platform's shutdown. For U.S. users, Vine was not only a short video platform but also a pioneering force behind individual content creation and the rapid spread of consumer culture. On January 19, 2025, Elon Musk mentioned in a public reply that X (formerly Twitter) was considering bringing Vine back, sparking renewed excitement and anticipation for the Vine brand. About BYDFi Founded in 2020, BYDFi is a Forbes-certified top 10 global crypto exchange with more than 1,000,000 loyal users worldwide. The platform has earned multiple MSB (Money Services Business) licenses across various countries and regions.

That’s another big splash into the sea of cryptocurrency by traditional finance corporations, making the industry’s dream of institutional adoption a reality. Crypto’s Institutional Adoption Is Happening Institutional adoption has always been a key part of the overall industry’s broadest roadmap for the future. Major US banks like Morgan Stanley used to ignore Bitcoin and other crypto assets. Then they laughed at them and derided them as criminal, if not impractical and foolish. But now, major players in corporate finance, like investment management giant BlackRock and now Morgan Stanley, have entered the bustling scene. Jamie Dimon’s JP Morgan and company may still be a holdout on crypto, but its competitors are entering the field with rabid ambitions to remake the world using blockchain’s techniques and platforms. When Sorkin asked about his views on cryptocurrency, Pick said his bank was ready to act. But it wants to be sure to do so with regulatory approval: “For us, the equation is really around whether we, as a highly regulated financial institution, can act as transactors.” That would allow Morgan Stanley to utilize the blockchain and provide cryptocurrency services to its customers. “We’ll be working with Treasury and the other regulators to figure out how we can offer that in a safe way,” Pick said. Morgan Stanley Takes Lead on Bitcoin Morgan Stanley is a leviathan in the traditional finance world. But it has been quicker than its competitors to jump on the blockchain bandwagon with the moon boys. It was among the first U.S. banks to offer BTC custody services to wealthy clients in 2021. During 2024’s Bitcoin ETF rush, the Midtown Manhattan banking giant took the lead in buying BTC exchange-traded funds. The company revealed a $269 million investment in Bitcoin ETFs last year. Pick’s statements to CNBC weren’t the only good news out of Davos for crypto from the banking sector this week. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said if regulators give the go-ahead, “you will find the banking system will come in hard on the transactional side of it.” The post Morgan Stanley CEO: Bank Planning Big Move Into Crypto appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Bitcoin|Morgan Stanley,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-01-24 10:02:25

On the surface, that argument seems logical . Polymarket's inclusion of sports prediction markets makes it seem like a competitor to licensed sportsbooks around the world. After all, even prediction market's harshest critics acknowledge that there's some kind of value in an investment mechanism to hedge against events like an election, but the outcome of a sporting match just doesn't have the same material impact as an election or war. But, beneath the surface, the argument that prediction markets are simply a Web3 version of gambling falls short, argues New York-based crypto attorney Aaron Brogan. “If you are a state-licensed gambling product, then you are taking one side of the bet. You’re essentially betting against your users,"" Brogan said. ""You’re booking the bets…and offering certain odds to users. Whether you make money or not depends on the odds you set.” Prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi, in contrast, act as neutral intermediaries that match trades without taking a side, making money via transaction fees. ""You are not taking a side of the bet as the market in that case, which fundamentally changes the incentives involved and makes the product different in a holistic way,” Brogan said, pointing out that prediction market platforms don't ban their best users in the same way casinos boot out card counting pros as it kills the house's mathematical edge. “Prediction markets aren’t gambling because they’re not structured to be,” Brogan said. “They’re tools for understanding, hedging, and creating public goods. That’s what makes them fundamentally different.” Getting an online gambling license in the U.S. was a herculean effort, and one might wonder why the new players in the space, like Draft Kings or incumbents like MGM, which followed in opening up online sports betting operations, don't go after prediction markets at the state level where gambling is regulated. The key legal distinction, says Brogan, lies in the regulatory framework. In the U.S., prediction markets that are registered as Designated Contract Markets (DCMs) fall under federal regulation via the Commodity Exchange Act, which preempts state gambling laws. “Federal law in the United States preempts state law,” Brogan explained. “The Commodity Exchange Act includes a specific provision that precludes state regulation of federally registered derivatives. If you are federally registered, the states can’t regulate you."" Kalshi seems to feel confident in this argument, as the prediction market platform, which actively pursued registration with the Commodities Futures and Trading Commission – and fought its initial attempts to block election-related prediction markets – recently launched Super Bowl betting markets. But this might not work for its competitors. “Polymarket, for example, is not registered in the United States, so arguably, states could go to its founder and say, ‘You’ve been facilitating sports betting, which is a felony in this state,’ and bring legal action. Registered exchanges, however, don’t face this issue because of their federal status,” Brogan said. While Polymarket and Kalshi are the two most recognizable names in the space, there are plenty of other new entrants which are following in their footsteps. One of which is the crypto exchange Crypto.com, which recently launched Crypto.com sports after filing self-certification as a DCM with the CFTC. The key thing is, Brogan explained, is that if the CFTC does not take action within 24 hours after the self-certification papers are filed, then the applicant can treat that as a green light. “If these are able to proliferate, and if the CFTC doesn’t take action, which they haven’t done yet, they’re going to end up eating these sportsbooks’ lunch. This is a $21 billion industry, and this new product is going to be way better,” he concludes.",Policy,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|COMMODITY|EXCHANGE|ASIA,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-24 10:05:41

THORChain Halts Bitcoin, Ethereum Withdrawals Amid Solvency Concerns, RUNE Drops 30% According to messages from THORChain’s Telegram channels, network node operators proposed and implemented a 90-day withdrawal pause today. The move aims to prevent a possible liquidity crisis and allow time to develop a plan to resolve outstanding debts. THORChain’s lending program only supports BTC and ETH, but their savings vaults have a wider range of assets. The protocol risks bankruptcy if all loans and savings positions are closed at the same time, especially if market sentiment triggers a sharp decline in the price of RUNE. The protocol meets its lending obligations by minting RUNE and selling it to liquidity pools, a mechanism that has raised concerns in the past. In fact, THORChain had already disabled new deposits a year ago due to fears of increased risk. Some community members estimate that THORChain’s liabilities are around $200 million, with $107 million of them sitting in liquidity pools. If liquidity providers (LPs) or RUNE holders panic and begin to withdraw or sell their assets, this could further strain the stability of the protocol. Despite the turbulence, THORChain’s core service of cross-chain swaps has not been affected. Users can continue to swap and benefit from liquidity pools without interruption. *This is not investment advice.
