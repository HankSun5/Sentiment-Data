Stellar’s steady rise, XRP’s ETF-driven momentum, and Web3Bay’s game-changing approach to e-commerce are making waves across the market. These projects highlight the diverse applications of blockchain, from payments to retail innovation. While Stellar and XRP offer exciting updates in payments and finance, Web3Bay (3BAY) stands out for its innovative take on blockchain-driven e-commerce. Here’s a closer look at how these three projects are shaping the future of crypto. Reshaping Online Marketplaces: Web3Bay’s User-Centric Vision Web3Bay isn’t just another e-commerce project—it’s a revolutionary platform redefining how online shopping works. By combining blockchain technology with user-centric features, Web3Bay eliminates intermediaries, reduces fees, and ensures data security. Its decentralized approach puts control directly into the hands of users, making it a standout in the $6.7 trillion e-commerce industry. The platform’s presale numbers are impressive, with $870,000 raised and 222 million tokens sold so far. Currently, in Stage 4, 3BAY tokens are priced at $0.004562625, with early investors anticipating a massive 6,430% ROI at launch. The structure of Web3Bay’s presale reflects its commitment to inclusivity, starting at just $0.003 per token and increasing by 15% with each stage. What truly sets Web3Bay apart is its community-driven governance. Token holders have voting rights, allowing them to influence platform updates and policies. This collaborative approach fosters trust and ensures that the marketplace evolves to meet the needs of its users. By integrating payment methods like PayPal with blockchain technology, Web3Bay bridges the gap between traditional e-commerce and crypto, making it accessible to a wider audience. Web3Bay’s innovative blend of technology and community involvement positions it as a leader in the e-commerce space. It’s more than just a platform—it’s a movement toward ethical, transparent, and user-focused commerce. Low Fees, High Impact: Stellar’s Appeal to Institutions Stellar continues to gain traction as a strong contender in cross-border payments. Currently trading at $0.4854 with a market cap of $14.89 billion, Stellar’s blockchain is proving to be a practical solution for fast and low-cost transactions. Key partnerships, such as its collaboration with MoneyGram, highlight its relevance in real-world applications. Analysts are optimistic about Stellar’s future, citing increased Total Value Locked (TVL) and growing interest in its payment solutions. As its ecosystem expands, Stellar remains a solid choice for investors seeking long-term growth in a competitive market. XRP’s Road to $7: Are ETF Listings the Game-Changer? XRP is making headlines with its recent price peak of $3.20 and growing anticipation for XRP ETFs. This development is sparking institutional interest and opening doors to broader adoption. Regulatory clarity following the SEC case resolution has bolstered confidence in XRP as a top cryptocurrency for 2025. Experts predict XRP’s price could climb to $5–$7, with potential for even greater gains depending on market conditions. Its efficient cross-border payment system and expanding use cases position XRP as a major player in blockchain finance. For investors looking for a mix of stability and growth potential, XRP remains an appealing option. Final Thoughts Stellar and XRP offer exciting prospects in payments and finance, but Web3Bay brings something truly unique to the table. By focusing on transparency, fairness, and user empowerment, Web3Bay is revolutionizing e-commerce in a way that hasn’t been seen before. Its presale success, with significant ROI potential, reflects the market’s confidence in its vision. For those seeking innovative projects that combine purpose with profitability, Web3Bay is setting a new standard. As it continues to gain momentum, this groundbreaking platform is poised to lead the next wave of blockchain innovation in e-commerce.

XRP has emerged as the most actively traded asset on Coinbase, propelled by Ripple’s efforts in enhancing cross-border payments and expectations for a spot XRP ETF approval. Concurrently, Solana’s price has seen a significant surge, rising over 11% in 24 hours to $239.77, nearing its highest ever price of $263.83. Continued progress in scalability and performance ensures Solana remains a focal point of attention. BlockDAG is capturing interest with its advanced hybrid DAG/PoW architecture. Its presale has impressively accumulated $183.5 million, rewarding early participants with returns of 2,380%. The LAUNCH300 offer, which triples the holdings, showcases its capability for quick and efficient transactions, positioning BlockDAG (BDAG) as a prime candidate for those looking toward the future of cryptocurrency. XRP Takes the Lead on Coinbase! XRP has ascended to become the most traded asset on Coinbase, overtaking Bitcoin, and illustrating its increased popularity, supported by Ripple’s blockchain network aimed at cross-border transactions. The potential for a U.S. approved spot XRP ETF has also intensified interest in the asset. A recent meeting between Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and President-elect Donald Trump has sparked a wave of optimism for beneficial regulatory changes, possibly including the appointment of crypto advocate Paul Atkins as SEC Chair. Ripple’s efforts, such as integrating stablecoins and expanding in the U.S. market, are designed to boost XRP’s usability and value. With XRP/USD trades making up 25% of Coinbase’s volume and increasing confidence in the market, the outlook for XRP’s long-term value is promising. Significant Rise in Solana Price – Spotlight on Future Potential Solana has experienced an impressive 11% increase in just 24 hours, reaching $239.77 and almost hitting its peak of $263.83 set in November 2024. This recent surge, supported by a 104% jump in trading volume, reflects strong market confidence. While there’s cautious optimism about maintaining the momentum, Solana’s efforts to overcome scalability issues are likely to boost its adoption and functionality as the network grows, highlighting its long-term potential in the transforming digital domain. BlockDAG’s Presale Success: Unlock Triple Returns Now Have you ever wished you were part of Bitcoin’s early success or Ethereum’s rapid ascent? BlockDAG offers a new opportunity. It has raised over $183.5 million and sold more than 18 billion coins during its presale, drawing widespread attention. Priced at $0.0248 in the 27th batch out of 45, early participants have realized gains of 2,380%. The LAUNCH300 bonus further enhances this by tripling the holdings of its supporters instantly, presenting a fleeting chance as time is limited. BlockDAG distinguishes itself with a unique hybrid DAG/PoW architecture that addresses the critical shortcomings of traditional blockchains. By emphasizing scalability and transaction efficiency, BlockDAG ensures quicker, more reliable operations that meet the increasing needs of decentralized systems. These technological advances position BlockDAG as a frontrunner in delivering practical, real-world solutions. For those ready to embrace a significant crypto opportunity, BlockDAG combines groundbreaking technology with attractive presale perks. Act swiftly—this moment could lead to substantial benefits in the swiftly shifting digital economy. Wrapping Up Cryptocurrency Trends XRP, Solana, and BlockDAG are making significant strides in the cryptocurrency market, each offering unique opportunities for growth. XRP has risen to become the most actively traded asset on Coinbase, propelled by Ripple’s initiatives aimed at improving cross-border payments and fueled by speculation surrounding a forthcoming spot XRP ETF. These developments have reinforced its status as a stable digital asset. Meanwhile, Solana’s price has shown remarkable growth, surging over 11% in just 24 hours and approaching its all-time high. Ongoing improvements in its transaction processing capabilities affirm Solana’s role as a significant contender in the digital asset arena. Additionally, BlockDAG has demonstrated notable crypto presale success, raising $183.5 million. Its modern hybrid DAG/PoW framework ensures efficient transaction processing, and the LAUNCH300 bonus, which triples holdings, presents an enticing opportunity for those keen to explore new crypto possibilities.

With Arctic Pablo embarking on a daring presale adventure and Dogwifhat dominating the Solana ecosystem, there’s no shortage of exciting options for investors looking for the best meme coin to buy today . Adding to the mix, AI Companions is redefining digital relationships with futuristic technology, creating a niche in the ever-expanding crypto market. Let’s dive into Arctic Pablo’s epic journey. This meme coin combines an adventurous narrative with innovative presale phases. Each phase ties to unique, hidden locations, blending myth and reality. It’s more than a coin—it’s an experience, and it’s capturing the imagination of investors worldwide. Arctic Pablo: The Adventurer of Meme Coins Arctic Pablo ($APC) isn’t your typical meme coin. It’s an exhilarating story of discovery and opportunity. Arctic Pablo, the character, takes investors on an epic journey to uncover Earth’s hidden mysteries. Each presale phase—or location—reveals new stories, engaging its community in an immersive experience. Current Location: Snowy Chores Arctic Pablo has traveled through four locations, including Metropolis, which sold out in just three days. Now in its fifth phase, Snowy Chores, the presale price is $0.000034. With over $320,000 raised so far, Arctic Pablo is proving to be a crowd favorite. And here’s the kicker: the final presale price is $0.0008, with a launch price of $0.008. That’s a staggering 23,441% ROI from the current price. Tokenomics That Work Arctic Pablo’s tokenomics ensure sustainability. The total supply is capped at 221.2 billion APC tokens, with 50% allocated for public presale. Weekly token burns during the presale and any unsold tokens post-presale increase scarcity, driving value. Investors can also enjoy 66% APY staking rewards, making this coin a win-win for both short-term and long-term holders. Why Arctic Pablo Stands Out Arctic Pablo’s appeal lies in its adventurous narrative and unique presale model. Unlike typical stages, Arctic Pablo “travels” to different locations, creating a sense of adventure and urgency. Early investors are not just buying a coin; they’re joining an epic journey where financial gains meet storytelling. Imagine investing $1 now. With $0.000034 per APC, you’d receive 38398.73 tokens. When the launch price hits $0.008, your investment skyrockets to $307.19. That’s not just ROI; that’s life-changing potential. Dogwifhat: Solana’s Meme Coin Powerhouse Dogwifhat ($WIF) has cemented its position as a leading meme coin within the Solana ecosystem. With a market capitalization of $1.41 billion and a circulating supply of nearly 999 million tokens, Dogwifhat is a force to be reckoned with. Impressive Market Stats Dogwifhat’s 24-hour trading volume of $249.93 million reflects strong market activity. While it’s currently 70.72% below its all-time high of $4.85, the token’s journey from an all-time low of $0.00002344 to today’s price showcases its explosive potential. That’s a gain of over 6 million percent, underscoring its appeal to investors seeking massive returns. Built on Solana Leveraging Solana’s fast and cost-efficient blockchain, Dogwifhat offers a seamless trading experience. Its 4.2-star rating on review platforms and 79% bullish community sentiment highlight its popularity. With robust adoption and active trading on platforms like DexScan, Dogwifhat remains a top contender for investors seeking the best meme coin to buy today. Why Choose Dogwifhat? Dogwifhat thrives on community strength and Solana’s ecosystem advantages. Its established market presence and consistent trading volume make it a safer bet for those wary of newer coins. If you’re looking for stability paired with meme coin excitement, Dogwifhat ticks all the boxes. AI Companions: Redefining Digital Relationships AI Companions ($AIC) brings something entirely new to the meme coin scene. Combining AI, VR, AR, and blockchain, this project offers customizable virtual companions tailored to individual preferences. It’s a futuristic concept that merges technology and cryptocurrency. Market Performance Currently priced at $0.1253, AIC has seen an 8.60% increase in the last 24 hours. With a market cap of $94 million and a circulating supply of 749.99 million tokens, it’s making waves in the crypto world. The token’s growth from an all-time low of $0.01749 to its current price highlights its strong upward trajectory, although it remains 40.47% below its all-time high of $0.2099. Innovative Ecosystem AI Companions’ platform is powered by the $AIC token, enabling in-platform purchases and subscriptions. Upcoming catalysts like Tier 1 exchange listings and a $250,000 buyback event make it a promising investment. With bullish sentiment and a growing holder base, AI Companions is positioned for significant growth in 2025. Why AI Companions Matters In a world increasingly driven by AI, $AIC stands out by offering something deeply personal. It’s not just about financial gains; it’s about redefining how we interact with technology. For those seeking innovation and utility in a meme coin, AI Companions is a top pick.

According to a new announcement, Coinbase is officially supporting Toshi ( TOSHI ) starting today. “Coinbase will add support for Toshi (TOSHI) on the Base network. Do not send this asset over other networks or your funds may be lost. Transfers for this asset are available on Coinbase and Coinbase Exchange in the regions where trading is supported.” Coinbase is adding support for TOSHI on Base, an Ethereum ( ETH ) layer-2 network incubated by the exchange. The announcement was made yesterday around 4 p.m. EST. Immediately following the announcement, TOSHI leaped from $0.00036803 to $0.00048477, an over 27% gain. However, the dog-themed memecoin has since crashed to lower levels than before the announcement, trading for $0.0003579 at time of writing, down 5.6% overall in the last 24 hours. TOSHI is just one of a multitude of memecoins that have exploded onto the scene in recent months. Though TOSHI is built on Base, many of the trending tokens have been supported through Solana ( SOL ), which is gaining a reputation as a memecoin trading network. According to Armstrong , the surge of interest in SOL-based memecoins lately has caused operational issues for some Coinbase users. “Team is working hard on scaling our Solana infrastructure now – lots of Solana activity last few days, we were not anticipating this level of surge.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

SAB 121 directed banks and other public companies that they had to mark any customers' crypto assets on their own balance sheets. SAB 122 ""rescinds the interpretive guidance"" and instead directs firms to use Financial Accounting Standards Board rules or International Accounting Standard provisions. ""The staff reminds entities that they should continue to consider existing requirements to provide disclosures that allow investors to understand an entity’s obligation to safeguard crypto-assets held for others,"" Thursday's notice said. The guidance it rescinds, SAB 121, was supported by former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who said it would protect investors in the event of bankruptcies. ""What we have found actually in bankruptcy court, time and again, many times now, that indeed, bankruptcy courts have said that crypto assets are not bankruptcy remote,"" he told Reuters in 2023. However, SAB 121 drew ire from much of the crypto industry, and was the subject of a Congressional Review Act resolution passed by both the House and Senate, though that resolution was vetoed by former President Joe Biden. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who was recently named the head of a new crypto task force, has long opposed the guidance, saying after its adoption in 2022 that the guidance did not account for the SEC not issuing any guidance about how securities laws apply to crypto and that an accounting bulletin might not be the right vehicle for the type of guidance contained in SAB 121.

With new and advanced projects redefining possibilities, the race for the best cryptos for significant returns has never been more competitive. In this buzzing crypto ecosystem, three names are stealing the spotlight: Qubetics ($TICS), Hedera, and Astra. Qubetics has already stirred up excitement in the market with its presale success, selling over 435 million tokens and raising more than $10.4 million. Meanwhile, Hedera impresses with its lightning-fast and energy-efficient network, and Astra brings a unique twist to decentralized finance (DeFi). Each project offers something revolutionary, but is one better suited for your portfolio? Let’s break it down. Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining Blockchain Interoperability First up, let’s talk about Qubetics ($TICS). If you’re eyeing long-term growth and adaptability in the crypto world, Qubetics is a name to know. What sets it apart? Qubetics presale alone is proof of its potential. Over 435 million $TICS tokens have been snapped up by 15,700 eager holders, generating more than $10.4 million in funds. And it’s still in its 18th presale stage! Right now, you can grab $TICS at just $0.0551. But this isn’t just about numbers. Qubetics has a clear mission: to solve the real-world problems that earlier blockchains couldn’t. It’s about creating a connected, seamless ecosystem. For example, its QubeQode IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a game-changer, especially for businesses and professionals. Imagine developing blockchain-based apps or managing digital assets without drowning in complexity—QubeQode makes it all possible. What’s exciting is how approachable Qubetics is. It’s built to make blockchain solutions user-friendly for everyone, from seasoned developers to newcomers. Businesses can leverage it to streamline processes, and individuals can use it for everyday tasks, making it the kind of innovation that actually feels practical. Here’s the kicker: analysts are predicting a massive ROI for $TICS holders. Some project a token price of $0.25 by the end of the presale—a 353% return. And if you’re looking even further ahead, numbers like $10 or $15 after the mainnet launch have been tossed around. Think about what that could mean for your wallet. Hedera: The Green Blockchain That’s Speeding Ahead Hedera isn’t just another blockchain; it’s a statement of what the future of crypto could be. Built on a unique hashgraph consensus mechanism, Hedera is incredibly fast, secure, and eco-friendly. If you’re someone who cares about energy efficiency, this is a blockchain you can feel good about supporting. With transaction speeds that blow traditional blockchains out of the water and a governance model supported by top-tier organizations like Google and IBM, Hedera is the epitome of reliability. Its platform is perfect for everything from secure supply chain management to tokenizing assets. Hedera’s low-cost transactions and scalable solutions make it a go-to choice for developers and enterprises alike. It’s ideal for businesses looking to integrate blockchain without the usual headaches of high fees and slow processing times. Plus, its focus on sustainability means it’s paving the way for a greener crypto future. But what about its potential for returns? Hedera’s growth has been steady, and its utility across industries is expanding rapidly. It might not boast the same presale hype as Qubetics, but its solid infrastructure makes it a dependable long-term investment. Astra: Reinventing DeFi for the Masses Astra is all about making decentralized finance accessible and inclusive. It takes the complexity of DeFi and turns it into something that anyone can understand and use. If you’re a fan of earning passive income or maximizing the utility of your crypto assets, Astra is right up your alley. What sets Astra apart is its focus on simplifying liquidity provision and yield farming. These aren’t just buzzwords—they’re ways to make your crypto work harder for you. Astra’s user-friendly platform ensures that even beginners can dive into DeFi without feeling overwhelmed. The project’s transparency and community-driven approach make it particularly appealing in a space that often feels opaque. By prioritizing security and usability, Astra is carving out a niche for itself in the ever-growing DeFi sector. The Magic of QubeQode IDE Before we wrap up, let’s shine a spotlight on Qubetics’ QubeQode IDE . Why is this such a big deal? Because it’s about breaking down barriers. For too long, blockchain development has been a playground for tech elites, leaving everyone else in the dust. QubeQode changes that by offering an easy-to-use platform for creating and deploying decentralized applications. Whether you’re a solo developer, a small business, or a global enterprise, QubeQode has tools that simplify blockchain integration. It’s intuitive, it’s efficient, and it’s exactly what the blockchain world needs to reach its full potential. By focusing on real-world utility, QubeQode ensures that blockchain isn’t just a buzzword—it’s a practical solution to everyday problems. And that’s what makes Qubetics stand out in a crowded market. Conclusion: Your Move Choosing the best cryptos for significant returns isn’t just about chasing hype; it’s about understanding the real value behind the projects. Qubetics ($TICS), Hedera, and Astra each bring something unique to the table. Whether it’s Qubetics’ visionary QubeQode IDE, Hedera’s eco-friendly speed, or Astra’s accessible DeFi solutions, these projects are reshaping the future of crypto. But let’s be real—Qubetics is making waves right now, and its presale is your golden ticket to get in early. Don’t sit on the sidelines while others seize the opportunity.

The pre-approval indicates the company is successfully done with the regulator’s review process and is qualified for a full MiCA license. The OKX is planning to obtain a full MiCA license in Malta. There, it will provide localized crypto services to over 400 million Europeans through its European Economic Area (EEA) hub. OKX’s platforms will feature regional language options, euro-based trading pairs, and local-language customer support Upon receiving a full MiCA license, OKX will allow clients to access their regulated crypto exchange products, such as OTC trading, spot trading, and bot trading, for 240+ cryptocurrency tokens across 260+ trading pairs and 60+ Euro-based trading pairs. Besides, their website and mobile platform will be customized to the regional language, with a local currency layout and customer relations in the native language. OKX said the achievement fortifies their drive to deliver “secure, transparent, and innovative solutions, ensuring customers benefit from a trusted and compliant platform in Europe’s rapidly evolving crypto landscape.” The platform will allow clients to transact in euros for free via bank transfer and buy cryptos through local payment models. The Malta hub will be a gateway to the 30 EEA member states under MiCA’s unified administrative structure. The company intends to reinvent the crypto experience for individual and institutional clients, offering creative products such as its Advanced Exchange, Simple Exchange, and on-chain wallet solutions. More exchange platforms are planning for MiCA licenses Malta is attracting more exchanges, with Gemini being the latest to announce its intention to acquire a MiCA license there. Gemini said it is dedicated to providing its services in Europe through a local spot in Malta. Another popular global crypto exchange, Crypto.com, made its intention to obtain the MiCA license public on January 17. However, the platform didn’t mention where it had opted to secure its license. Since the European Union fully enacted MiCA, only a handful of crypto asset service providers have gotten the license. Crypto platform MoonPay was among the first CASPs to receive one from the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) on December 30, alongside other firms, including BitStaete, Zebedee Europe, and Zebedee Europe.

A spokesperson said Akhiadov had “moved all his relatives from his native Grozny, Chechnya, to Istanbul “in advance.” Akhiadov, police say, sent “his wife, two younger brothers, sister, and mother” to Turkey “at different times over the five months before committing the crime.” This was part of an attempt to ensure that law enforcement officers did not become “suspicious” about his movements, police claim. Officers did not say who they think sent the coins. But investigators have previously claimed that Akhiadov “swore an oath to the Islamic State [ISIS]” prior to his attack. However, they believe the fighter botched the attack, which was originally intended as a “mass shooting.” Moscow’s Zaryadye Park. (Source: Mos.ru [CC BY 4.0]) Mass Shooting Planned? Officers think that Akhiadov had intended to steal a police officer’s gun and start shooting civilians, possibly in the park. Instead, he attacked a Moscow Administrative Road Inspectorate (MADI) officer, mistaking the man for a police officer due to the latter’s “similar-looking uniform.” During the alleged attack, the fighter inflicted “at least 16 wounds” to the latter’s “vital organs,” police said. The MADI official died shortly after. Police officers say Akhiadov resisted arrest and attacked an officer with pepper spray. Akhiadov was born on August 11, 1994.

This move aligns with the company’s ongoing focus on expanding its Bitcoin strategy while addressing other corporate financial objectives. The offering also includes an option for initial purchasers to acquire an additional $15 million in notes. Semler Scientific Unveils $75M Private Offering to Advance Bitcoin Strategy In a recent press release , Semler Scientific revealed plans to raise $75 million through a private offering of convertible senior notes. The notes, set to mature in 2030, will accrue interest payable semiannually and will be senior unsecured obligations of the company. Investors can convert the notes into cash, shares of Semler Scientific stock, or a combination of both. The offering is designed to provide Semler Scientific with additional financial resources, specifically targeting its Bitcoin strategy. A portion of the proceeds will also support general corporate initiatives. The company has emphasized that the terms of the notes, including interest and conversion rates, will be finalized during the offering’s pricing stage. More so, this move comes days after the medical technology company achieved a 99.3% BTC Yield , reflecting the strength of its Bitcoin treasury strategy. The recent acquisition, supported by proceeds from its ATM offering, raised Semler Scientific’s BTC holdings. Capped Call Transactions To Mitigate Stock Dilution As part of the offering, Semler Scientific plans to engage in capped call transactions with financial institutions. These transactions will reduce the impact of dilution on the company’s common stock arising from note conversions. The capped call agreements are expected to cover the initial number of shares underlying the notes, with provisions for adjustment. To facilitate the capped call transactions, Semler Scientific and its counterparties may conduct various derivative transactions or purchase company stock shares. These activities could influence the market prices of the notes and the company’s stock. Additionally, the company expects these counterparties to adjust their hedging strategies during the note observation period. This activity, or any response to early note conversions, could potentially impact the stock’s value. Stock Declines Amid Announcement Following the announcement, Semler Scientific Inc (SMLR) stock experienced a 12.5% decline, reflecting market concerns over potential share dilution. Investors are reacting cautiously to the issuance of convertible senior notes despite the company’s BTC profits. Preliminary financial results for Q4 2024 indicate revenues between $12.1 million and $12.5 million, with operating income ranging from $3.4 million to $3.7 million. Semler Scientific also reported an unrealized Bitcoin gain of $28.9 million, showcasing the benefits of its treasury strategy. The company’s Bitcoin holdings total 2,321 Bitcoins, acquired at an average price of $82,689 per coin. As of December 31, 2024, Semler Scientific held approximately $9 million in cash and equivalents, signaling strong liquidity to support its future initiatives. Meanwhile, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao has confirmed the prospect of a strategic Bitcoin reserve through a recent X post. He expressed confidence in the initiative, stating, “US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, pretty much confirmed.” Adding a humorous note, Zhao remarked that “crypto is moving at crypto speed again,” reflecting optimism for growth.

Trump Bitcoin MAGA (MAGABTC), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MAGABTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump Bitcoin MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Bitcoin MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Bitcoin MAGA launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Bitcoin MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Bitcoin MAGA by entering its contract address – 3J7GkdTfz7sHdcKcMnD5fm1aDZZUktz7z8NqTdiacLTy – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MAGABTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|BTC|SOL|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-23 23:37:00

In the Jan. 23 letter, Warren proposed fully funding the IRS, closing the carried interest loophole, and implementing a capital gains tax on inherited estates. She emphasized that wealthier Americans should bear more responsibility, noting they are mentioned repeatedly in her proposal. Musk, whose net worth is estimated at $426 billion, would clearly be impacted. Warren raised concerns about DOGE’s policies, citing potential ethical conflicts. She stated, “It is not clear that you and other DOGE leaders are able to identify and mitigate your conflicts of interest and adhere to common-sense ethics standards. As a result, the committee appears to be a venue for corruption.” She also argued that changes to the tax code could generate significant revenue. Warren highlighted how increases to the estate tax exemption have reduced taxable estates. “The tax expenditures arising from the exclusion of capital gains on assets transferred at death totaled about $39 billion in 2019. DOGE should end this stepped-up basis for assets transferred at death, saving over $60 billion per year going forward,” she wrote. Different Visions for Government Spending Despite sharing an interest in efficiency, Warren and Musk remain unlikely allies. Warren has urged President Trump to fully fund the IRS, claiming it could increase enforcement and improve taxpayer services, yielding a 12:1 return on investment. However, President Trump and Musk have charted different paths. On his first day in office, Trump froze hiring across federal agencies. Musk, while initially targeting $2 trillion in cuts, recently acknowledged this figure might be unrealistic, suggesting $1 trillion as a more achievable goal. Given that mandatory spending accounts for two-thirds of the federal budget, including Social Security and Medicare, achieving such reductions remains a significant challenge.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today,EN,0,0,REGULATION|DOGE|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-23 23:37:57

A bill aiming to eliminate the guideline passed both the House and the Senate last year, but President Biden vetoed the bill. Although the issue is a top priority among crypto proponents, the removal of the rule was not a campaign promise. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan recently said American banks are ready to jump at the chance to custody crypto assets. “If the rules come in and make it a real thing that you can actually do business with, you’ll find that the banking system will come in hard on the transactional side of it.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Could the potential XRP futures launch kickoff a meteoric XRP surge to $15? Is CME Listing XRP Futures Contracts Soon? The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) stirred excitement in the crypto community earlier on Wednesday after the Chicago-based futures giant posted the futures page for Ripple’s XRP and Solana (SOL) to its staging subdomain. The price of both cryptocurrencies spiked following the leaked CME futures addition, which suggested that those investment vehicles would be listed on Feb. 10. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart corroborated the page’s existence. https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1882154205202567623 However, CME later clarified that the beta page was mistakenly made public, and that no official decisions regarding futures contracts based on both tokens had been made. “The beta version of the website, which is often used for mock-up drafts, was made public in error,” a spokesperson of the company told FOX Business . “No official decisions have yet been made about launching futures contracts for either token.” Crypto Investment Products Surge Amid Shifting Regulatory Winds Despite CME’s denial, investors are still hopeful that the XRP futures contracts will be eventually launched. Applications for crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and futures products have increased following the reelection of President Donald Trump and the departure of crypto nemesis Gary Gensler from the SEC. Asset managers have already submitted a slew of regulatory filings to list ETFs holdings altcoins, including XRP. This has led to heightened anticipation that an ETF that offers investors direct exposure to XRP could be approved soon following the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs last year. Trump, who has vowed to transform the U.S. into the “world’s crypto capital,” has tapped pro-crypto commissioner Mark Uyeda to serve as interim SEC Chair until Paul Atkins assumes the role under the new Trump administration. Regulatory hurdles must be cleared for XRP ETFs and futures products to be greenlighted. Pundits suggest that crypto advocate Atkins could facilitate this change. Earlier this month, a team of researchers at JP Morgan said that if approved, XRP ETFs could attract an eye-popping $8 billion worth of fresh cash from investors. XRP Headed For $15? Several crypto strategists have suggested that XRP could hit the $15 mark this year, citing the third-largest crypto’s adoption and bullish chart technicals, institutional demand, and a crypto-friendly Trump regime as the tailwinds. Popular analyst Mickybull Crypto, for instance, has previously shared a chart showing XRP trading closer to the upper boundary of a bull flag with an upside target of $15. As of press time, XRP was changing hands at $3.11, according to CoinGecko data.

By 2028, ENS could see significant growth, with predictions suggesting a potential maximum price of $157.81. ENS could achieve its highest price yet, reaching up to $256.44 by 2031. Ethereum Name Service is a network that allows crypto-enthusiasts to rename their crypto addresses into something simpler, making them easier to remember. Renaming crypto addresses through ENS will enable users to recollect and write them quickly. Even though Ethereum Name Service is based on the Ethereum blockchain, it uses its cryptocurrency, ENS. ENS is used for governance purposes on the blockchain network. Users can also send and receive any cryptocurrency with the system’s wallet. The price of ENS has experienced ups and downs since it launched on the market, dropping to as low as $6.7 and hitting an ATH of $85.69. As the adoption of decentralized identities and Web3 technology continues to grow, ENS continues to position itself as a key player in this transformative space. How will this affect investors’ perceptions of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) token? Will ENS go up? How high can ENS go? Will ENS recapture its ATH soon? Let’s get into the Ethereum Name Service price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Name Service Token ENS Price $35 Market Cap $1,263,055,467.93 Trading Volume $169,948,051.91 Circulating Supply 35,365,085.96 ENS All-time High $85.69, Nov 11, 2021 All-time Low $6.70, Oct 19, 2023 24-h High $35.96 24-h Low $32.70 Ethereum Name Service technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Volatility) 5.35% 50-Day SMA $36.06 14-Day RSI 51.92 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 75 (Greed) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $24.75 Ethereum Name Service price analysis: ENS sees slight gains TL;DR Breakdown Ethereum Name Service’s price analysis shows a slight bullish recovery. The resistance for ENS is present at $36.03. A breakout above the resistance could solidify buyer’s interest. The ENS price analysis for January 23 shows a slight price recovery, indicating a positive growth momentum. The resistance level is near $36.03, where selling pressure has been observed, while support is identified around $32.64, providing a potential rebound zone. The movement reflects a short-term uptrend, with traders watching for a breakout above resistance or further dips toward support to determine the next direction. Ethereum Name Service 1-day price chart: ENS is trading within a consolidation range According to the 1-day ENS chart, the price is within a consolidation range, holding between $32.64 and $36.03. The RSI at 52.11 suggests neutral momentum, which indicates a close balance between buyers and sellers. ENS The MACD is slowly but surely making its way toward bullish territory, but there simply is not the strong momentum to suggest an imminent breakout. A decisive breakout above the $36.03 resistance would open the door for an upswing to the next available resistance at $37.85. Should the $32.64 support not hold, we could be looking at a move down to $30.32. ENS/USD 4-hour price chart analysis: Indicators report a growing capital influx As shown on the 4-hour price chart, the coin is approaching the upper band at $35.70, which suggests a growing upward trend., albeit still weak. The Balance of Power indicator at 0.79 indicates increasing buying volume, which is consistent with the CMF indicator at 0.10, reporting a positive capital influx. Indicators report a growing capital influx Should the price breach the $35.70 mark, the positive momentum may strengthen further, targeting higher resistance. On the contrary, if the price struggles to maintain its value above $34.31, it is more likely to pull back to $32.93 or lower. From a short-term point of view, the outlook is mildly bullish, but the price is still trapped within a range. ENS technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $34.26 BUY SMA 5 $34.54 BUY SMA 10 $35.02 SELL SMA 21 $34.54 BUY SMA 50 $36.06 SELL SMA 100 $28.44 BUY SMA 200 $24.75 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $32.68 BUY EMA 5 $32.66 BUY EMA 10 $33.25 BUY EMA 21 $34.27 BUY EMA 50 $33.35 BUY EMA 100 $29.74 BUY EMA 200 $25.84 BUY What to expect from ENS? ENS shows mixed momentum, testing resistance at $35.70. Strong buying activity and positive capital inflow support bullish potential, but a failure to break $34.31 could lead to a pullback toward $32.93. A breakout above $35.70 may drive further gains. Is ENS a good investment? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) can be a good investment if you believe in the long-term potential of decentralized domain names and the growing adoption of blockchain technology. ENS offers a unique utility by allowing users to register human-readable names for Ethereum addresses, which simplifies transactions and interactions within the Ethereum ecosystem. Its value could increase as more users and businesses adopt decentralized web services. Will ENS recover? The ENS price has experienced a sharp drop followed by a gradual recovery, indicating some resilience in the market. While there has been a rebound from the low, whether ENS will fully recover depends on continued buying interest and broader market conditions. Will ENS reach $100? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years, with the price projected to reach $124.93 by 2027. This implies that reaching $100 is plausible within the next few years, driven by positive market trends and increasing adoption. Will ENS reach $500? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years. However, attaining $500, while attainable, might not happen anytime soon. Does ENS have a good long-term future? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) shows a strong long-term potential based on current predictions. The price is expected to increase significantly over the next several years, with forecasts extending up to $250 by 2031.

The study was conducted by Ipsos. It observes how crypto and blockchain technology are viewed in Argentina, Kenya, the Philippines, and Switzerland and how it impacts the lives of people in these countries. For most of the part, the study is based on surveys with 4,000 adults (not specifying the age rates) in Argentina, Kenya, the Philippines, and Switzerland conducted on behalf of Coinbase. The choice of countries aims to give an outlook of societies living in markedly different socioeconomic conditions in different parts of the world (none of these countries belong to the same continent, with the Philippines being an archipelago-based country). The similarities between these countries are the mostly Christian populations and the government systems revolving around the republic model. Nevertheless, the countries have strikingly different areas, positions on the map, historical experiences, cultures, languages, climates, economic states, etc. Coinbase, however, outlines another similarity between Argentina, Kenya, the Philippines, and Switzerland: according to the exchange team, the residents of these countries feel that the local financial systems need to be improved. More than that, generally, the polled residents see cryptocurrencies and blockchain as tools that may enhance their lives in terms of financial wealth and overall give more freedom and independence. The state of economy in these countries The report starts with the statistics demonstrating that in each country, less than a half of all respondents believe that the current financial direction in their country will make them live better than the previous generation. However, even fewer people believe that they will live worse than their parents in Argentina and the Philippines. So it’s fair to say that in Kenya and Switzerland, people don’t approve of the current financial politics in contrast to the past years, while Argentina and the Philippines rather dislike both the current and the previous efforts, believing that nowadays things are a bit better than before. Respondents in all these countries agree that the local financial system should be changed or overhauled completely. They refer to the financial systems of their countries as “slow,” “expensive,” and “unstable.” They also cited a lack of innovation as one of the problems. Top countries to change financial system | Source: Coinbase.com The study reveals four main concerns of the respondents named in the surveys: lack of fairness (discrimination), centralization, decreasing value of the national currency, and too much hard work to earn enough or save money. The distribution of concerns varies from country to country, with Kenya and the Philippines being most critical towards centralization, discrimination, and wage slavery. Switzerland is least concerned about many of these issues while being cautious towards the government’s dependency on banks. Argentinians have the biggest trust issues with their financial institutions and a problem with saving money. Crypto as a remedy Most people polled by Ipsos for the study want to be in charge of their financial state and gain more freedom and control over their money. 7 in 10 respondents see cryptocurrency and blockchain as the way to achieve these goals. More than that, both crypto owners and those who don’t have crypto agree that digital currencies can help them gain more freedom and control over their wealth. You might also like: Kenya preparing to legalize crypto: report Switzerlanders are markedly less interested in crypto than respondents from other countries. However, over 70% of crypto owners in Switzerland believe that crypto offers them more control and freedom. Less than half of the surveyed Switzerlanders with no crypto believe that they need it. Source: Coinbase.com Wider blockchain adoption is also viewed as a favorable factor that may improve the local financial systems and individual wealth. Most respondents believe that blockchain promotes innovation and facilitates control over individual finances. Respondents hope that blockchain will make the system faster and more accessible. In all polls, Switzerland is presented with lower numbers. It reflects the lower expectations associated with Bitcoin and blockchain and the lower level of dissatisfaction with the financial status quo. Looking into this study, you may notice a strong connection between the level of satisfaction with the country’s financial direction and the level of support for cryptocurrencies and blockchain. The residents of Switzerland and Argentina are less concerned with the current financial state of their countries, and they are less into crypto than Kenya and the Philippines. Probably, that’s one of the reasons why not only Kenya but Africa in general, where the population has little to no access to banking services but has smartphones, are usually seen as the driver of the mass adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain-based solutions as the substitute of traditional banks.

Jung, who previously served as Pham’s Counselor and Senior Policy Advisor, will lead the agency’s crypto and digital assets engagement and will build on his experience at Citigroup and prior regulatory roles. CFTC’s Crypto Engagement The appointment comes as part of broader leadership changes shortly after Pham’s interim appointment by President Donald Trump. Pham has been involved in several digital asset initiatives at the CFTC, including the creation of a Digital Asset Markets subcommittee. In 2023, she proposed the establishment of a regulatory sandbox to develop a framework for emerging technologies and outlined plans for a digital asset pilot program. The Trump administration has not yet named a permanent replacement for Rostin Behnam, who will leave the CFTC on February 7th. Former CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz is reportedly a top contender for the position. Throughout his four years at the CFTC, Behnam strongly advocated for the agency to lead the regulation of Bitcoin and other digital currencies. He emphasized the importance of robust oversight as the digital asset market grew rapidly. Under his leadership, the CFTC took major enforcement measures, such as reaching a $2.7 billion settlement with Binance. In its final push, the agency subpoenaed crypto exchange, Coinbase for customer information tied to Polymarket, a prediction market platform accused of regulatory violations. This last-ditch effort just before the Trump takeover came amidst allegations of market manipulation and gambling law breaches at Polymarket. SEC, FDIC Shuffle Besides Pham for CFTC, Mark Uyeda was appointed as the acting chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by President Donald Trump, replacing Gary Gensler. A vocal critic of Gensler’s crypto policies, Uyeda will serve in this role until the Senate confirms a permanent successor. The American attorney has a history of advocating for a more lenient regulatory approach to crypto, particularly against enforcement actions targeting non-fraudulent crypto firms. Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto figure, is Trump’s nominee for permanent SEC chair. At the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), on the other hand, Travis Hill has been named temporary chair following Marty Gruenberg’s resignation. The FDIC has faced criticism, including allegations from Senator Cynthia Lummis, over its handling of digital asset records tied to “Operation Choke Point 2.0.” The post Harry Jung Appointed to Guide CFTC’s Crypto and Digital Asset Strategy appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|CFTC|Donald Trump|SEC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB|BTC,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-01-23 23:58:04

As a pioneer in Oracle blockchain technology, Chainlink continues to cement its leadership in the Real-World Assets (RWA) sector. Its cutting-edge solutions, which enable seamless data integration between blockchains and traditional systems, have garnered widespread adoption and positioned Chainlink as an indispensable part of the decentralized finance ecosystem.

With both technical and fundamental indicators aligning, LINK is well-positioned to weather market volatility and lead the altcoin recovery. Investors are watching closely as Chainlink continues to set itself apart in the evolving crypto landscape, with its $50 target representing a potential milestone in its ongoing growth. LINK Holding Strong Above Key Level Chainlink (LINK) is currently trading at $24.26, a pivotal level that has transitioned from a stubborn resistance to a strong support zone. This shift marks a significant milestone for LINK, as the $24 level had acted as a supply zone for weeks. Now holding firmly as support, it signals that bulls have regained control, setting the stage for a potential surge. The price action suggests that LINK is building momentum to break above the $27 mark, a critical level that could trigger a more explosive rally. With the broader market facing uncertainty and heightened volatility, LINK’s ability to maintain key demand zones showcases its relative strength and investor confidence. This bullish setup positions Chainlink as a standout performer among altcoins, as it continues to weather market turbulence. If bulls can maintain control and push above $27 with conviction, the next rally could propel LINK into higher targets, potentially sparking renewed interest and activity in the altcoin market.

The SUI price is experiencing a notable rebound, with a 4.3% increase, targeting the $5.86 resistance level. Simultaneously, a positive Chainlink (LINK) price analysis signals a potential rise to $38, spurred by escalating institutional interest. Among these developments, BlockDAG ‘s recruitment of Marius Bock, the ex-Cardano project lead, stands out. Tasked with steering the upcoming mainnet launch, Bock’s leadership has propelled BlockDAG’s presale to raise over $183.5 million, offering an impressive 2,380% ROI to early adopters and establishing BDAG as the best long-term crypto asset. These market shifts are substantial and not to be underestimated by those monitoring industry trends. SUI Price Outlook: Bulls Target New Highs The SUI price reached an unprecedented high earlier this year, bolstered by steady gains from mid-2024 to January 2025. Despite a recent 10% drop, the SUI price is rallying, currently at $4.92, and has increased by 4.3% today. The market’s positive funding rates and increased trading volume indicate that another peak may soon be within reach. Current technical indicators position SUI well above crucial EMAs, suggesting that the bullish trend is likely to continue. With the RSI in a neutral zone, the path is open for the SUI price to approach the $5.86 R2 resistance level, provided that buying momentum persists. Market analysts are closely watching these indicators, anticipating potential new highs and ongoing market confidence. Chainlink Price Analysis: Is $38 on the Horizon? Recent Chainlink price analysis reveals that it is poised for a robust rebound, thanks to significant whale purchases totaling over $20 million. This analysis anticipates Chainlink’s price potentially hitting $38 by early February if the current buying trend continues. This outlook is strengthened by Chainlink’s collaborations with leading financial institutions. Chainlink’s recent 10% surge has exceeded the performance of both Bitcoin and Ethereum, drawing heightened attention. While market volatility could temper short-term expectations, the Chainlink price analysis remains optimistic, supported by high trading volumes and growing investor interest, highlighting LINK’s pivotal role in the decentralized finance sector, particularly in data sharing and tokenization. BlockDAG Enhances Global Presence with Marius Bock BlockDAG’s announcement of Marius Bock joining its team marks a significant commitment to scalability enhancements and user adoption expansion. Bock’s rich history with Cardano and his experience at Visa enrich BlockDAG’s team, poised to extend its influence globally. BlockDAG’s unique approach could provide a competitive edge over entities like Chainlink and SUI, especially as it enhances its system for quicker transactions and improved reliability. Currently, BDAG coins are priced at $0.0248, with robust demand as the presale progresses. To date, over $183.5 million has been raised, with 17.9 billion coins sold, delivering substantial returns to early adopters and heightening anticipation for the upcoming mainnet launch. Experts believe Bock’s involvement could position BlockDAG among the best long-term crypto choices for those exploring new opportunities. The team’s strategy of integrating elite talent is crucial for impacting both financial and large-scale enterprise applications. Predictions suggest swift adoption following the mainnet activation, potentially affirming the technology’s transformative impact on blockchain applications globally. Forward-thinking traders consider BlockDAG a vital addition to their financial portfolios. Stay Ahead: The Next Major Crypto Movement The cryptocurrency market is teeming with promising opportunities, with the current period being critical for engagement. The SUI price is steadily climbing, suggesting another record high might be imminent. Meanwhile, recent Chainlink price analysis forecasts a surge to $38, propelled by notable institutional backing. Yet, the strategic addition of Marius Bock to BlockDAG’s team underscores its sophisticated preparation for the mainnet launch. This key appointment is anticipated to significantly enhance the launch’s success. With BlockDAG’s mainnet on the horizon, the platform is poised to redefine blockchain adoption, confirming its status as the best long-term crypto asset. As the market anticipates BlockDAG’s next steps, both seasoned and new traders are advised to closely watch this evolving narrative.

These enhancements are setting the stage for both platforms, marking them as top contenders among this year’s bullish cryptos. Observers are keeping a keen eye on Cardano price predictions and Avalanche’s strategic partnerships, anticipating significant movements. Amid these developments, Web3Bay (3BAY) is emerging as a formidable force in decentralized e-commerce. This platform is transforming the shopping experience by integrating the reliability of traditional retail with the efficiency of blockchain technology, enabling consumers to easily access crypto-powered rewards and discounts. Web3Bay distinguishes itself by offering a fluid transition from conventional online shopping to a blockchain-enhanced marketplace, merging the best of both worlds. Web3Bay: Elevating Online Retail Through Blockchain Innovation Web3Bay is revolutionizing the e-commerce landscape by blending the comfort of familiar shopping experiences with the disruptive power of blockchain technology. While the thought of using cryptocurrencies for daily transactions might intimidate some, Web3Bay is demystifying this process, providing a user-friendly platform that invites consumers to engage with blockchain without a steep learning curve. The platform enhances the appeal of e-commerce with enticing discounts and crypto rewards, making digital commerce both accessible and engaging. A standout feature of Web3Bay is its 3BAY token, currently in the presale stage and offering significant growth potential. Starting at just $0.003, the token price is expected to climb to $0.1959 through successive stages, potentially yielding returns of over 6,430% for early investors. With $870,000 already raised, Web3Bay is affirming its position as a leader among 2025’s bullish cryptos. Web3Bay’s consumer-centric approach not only offers discounts but also empowers shoppers with blockchain-based loyalty rewards. This pioneering platform is not just bridging clicks with crypto; it is setting the stage for integrating NFTs and DeFi functionalities, pointing towards an ambitious future where e-commerce is seamlessly intertwined with blockchain. Cardano’s Plomin Hard Fork: Boosting Governance & Scalability Cardano is making significant strides with its upcoming Plomin hard fork, which will introduce Protocol Version 10, aimed at enhancing governance and scalability. This critical update requires the involvement of 51% of Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) for activation, highlighting the community’s role in Cardano’s evolution. These enhancements are injecting optimism into the market, spurring robust discussions around Cardano price predictions as stakeholders anticipate an upswing in ADA’s valuation. Cardano’s robust development roadmap and active community engagement are solidifying its stature in the blockchain domain. Recent updates aimed at improving transaction efficiency and network performance are foundational for its continued growth, keeping Cardano price predictions in focus as investors and analysts gauge the potential for substantial returns amidst fluctuating market conditions. Avalanche’s Enhanced Scalability & Strategic Partnerships Avalanche is bolstering its infrastructure and market appeal through a strategic partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS), aiming to position itself as a primary blockchain resource for AWS clients and encourage the broader adoption of decentralized applications. Supported by a substantial $250 million fundraise in late 2024, Avalanche is well-equipped to expand its ecosystem and drive future technological upgrades. The introduction of the Avalanche9000 upgrade is set to dramatically reduce Layer-1 deployment costs by 99.9% and cut C-Chain transaction costs by 25 times, crucial improvements that enhance scalability and user adoption. These advancements ensure that Avalanche remains at the forefront of bullish cryptos, with its technical and strategic enhancements paving the way for a more streamlined and accessible blockchain experience. Summing Up! As we look ahead, Cardano’s advancements with the Plomin hard fork and governance upgrades are drawing significant interest, with Cardano price predictions increasingly suggesting a promising growth trajectory. Likewise, Avalanche’s strategic initiatives and the ambitious Avalanche9000 upgrade are reinforcing its position among bullish cryptos , promising substantial improvements in scalability and cost efficiency. While these projects are advancing their networks, Web3Bay is redefining the e-commerce sphere. Its 3BAY token presale, promising exceptional returns, is effectively merging traditional e-commerce with blockchain innovation. Web3Bay’s approachable platform, which marries crypto rewards with familiar shopping experiences, is making blockchain technology accessible to all.

39350804,https://nulltx.com/?p=140510,1737676836,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,From $0.01 to $3 by March 2025: PCHAIN To Outrun Giants Dogecoin and Shiba Inu,https://nulltx.com/from-0-01-to-3-by-march-2025-pchain-to-outrun-giants-dogecoin-and-shiba-inu/,"Dogecoin captured hearts with its meme-fueled rise, and Shiba Inu turned early investors into overnight millionaires. But a new contender, PropiChain (PCHAIN), is stepping up with something more substantial: innovation. Priced at just $0.011 during its presale, PCHAIN is gaining traction as the next big thing, with predictions pointing to an impressive $3 price tag by March 2025. Let’s explore how this AI-powered altcoin is set to leave Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in the dust. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu: Legendary Yet Limited Dogecoin burst onto the scene with its fun, meme-driven appeal, while Shiba Inu followed with a community-focused ecosystem that turned small investments into life-changing gains. While both coins remain crypto favorites, they face challenges that hinder long-term growth. Dogecoin lacks practical use cases, relying largely on its community and celebrity endorsements. Shiba Inu has expanded its ecosystem, including token burns and Shibarium, but its utility remains limited. These limitations are why many investors are turning to utility-driven projects like PCHAIN , which combines blockchain with real-world applications to deliver substantial benefits. Propichain: Transforming Investment Through Innovation PCHAIN is more than just an altcoin; it’s a full-fledged ecosystem designed to address real-world problems. Its features are not only innovative but also practical, appealing to both beginner and experienced investors. Fractional Ownership: Owning High-Value Assets Without Breaking the Bank PCHAIN allows investors to buy fractions of luxury real estate assets. For instance, Propichain can divide a $2 million luxury apartment into 1,000 shares. Instead of needing millions to invest, you could buy a share for as little as $500. This makes high-value investments accessible to everyone, diversifying portfolios and opening wealth-building opportunities once reserved for the ultra-rich. AI-Powered Insights: Smarter, Data-Driven Decisions One of PCHAIN’s standout features is its use of artificial intelligence (AI). For example, the platform can analyze property trends to identify undervalued assets or forecast price trends in the metaverse. Imagine getting a notification about a high-growth neighborhood before prices surge. For investors, this AI-driven approach minimizes guesswork and maximizes potential returns, something Dogecoin and Shiba Inu can’t offer. Metaverse Integration: Invest in Virtual and Physical Real Estate With the metaverse booming, PCHAIN integrates virtual property investments into its ecosystem. Investors can purchase digital land or lease out virtual spaces for events, creating new revenue streams. For example, you could buy a virtual office space and lease it to a global company for hosting meetings in the metaverse. This integration bridges the gap between traditional real estate and emerging digital opportunities. DeFi Tools: Making Your Investment Work for You PCHAIN offers decentralized finance (DeFi) features like staking, lending, and borrowing. You could stake your tokens on the platform to earn passive income or lend them out for interest. Unlike Dogecoin, where returns depend solely on price fluctuations, PCHAIN enables your investments to generate additional earnings over time. Global Accessibility: Breaking Down Investment Barriers PCHAIN’s blockchain infrastructure ensures that anyone, anywhere, can participate in its ecosystem. Whether you’re in New York or Nairobi, you can invest in tokenized properties, trade NFTs, or stake tokens—all from your smartphone. Smart Contracts: Efficient and Transparent Transactions Blockchain-based smart contracts make transactions on PCHAIN fast, secure, and tamper-proof. For example, renting a property or transferring ownership is as simple as clicking a button, with no middlemen involved. Presale at $0.011: A Rare Opportunity Propichain’s presale is in stage 2, with tokens priced at just $0.011. This low entry point offers incredible potential for early investors to secure exponential returns. For example: • A $500 investment today would secure approximately 45,454 tokens. • If PCHAIN hits $3 by 2025, that $500 could grow to a remarkable $136,362. With over 37.5% of tokens already sold and over $2.5 million raised, the presale is quickly gaining momentum. The platform’s recent listing on CoinMarketCap and successful security audit also add to its credibility, ensuring investor confidence. Conclusion: Why PCHAIN Is the Smart Investor’s Choice Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have paved the way for millions to enter the crypto market, but their growth is largely limited to community hype. PCHAIN , on the other hand, delivers innovation and utility through features and DeFi tools. With its presale price of $0.011 and a forecasted $3 target by 2025, PCHAIN offers a rare chance to invest in a project that’s redefining crypto innovation. Don’t miss the opportunity to join this revolution. Act now; secure your tokens and position yourself for a brighter financial future with PCHAIN.

In his recent post, Buterin pointed out the possible adverse effects of such tokens particularly when they are linked to powerful politicians. “Now is the time to talk about the fact that large-scale political coins cross a further line…., whose harm is at most contained to mistakes.” Buterin raised concerns about political tokens such as the TRUMP and MELANIA tokens that emerged during Donald Trump’s inauguration. Based on the images of U.S. President Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, these tokens became popular first and then lost their value. According to Buterin, these tokens are not only fun to collect— they pose a threat of being used for political gain. He noted that foreign actors may use tokens of this kind to affect political processes and the ethical principles of governance. The risks include the risk of abuse, with Buterin arguing that political tokens could make political bribery unregulated and almost unrestricted. Regulation challenges in the crypto industry Buterin also shared his views on the legal environment of cryptocurrencies, including the actions of the former chairman of the SEC, Gary Gensler. He noted that Gensler’s policies have indirectly influenced the crypto market negatively because projects have started hiding their revenue structures. “@GaryGensler created a regime where tokens that give investors clear indication of what their rights are and where their revenue comes from is a “security”, but obfuscated “governance tokens” are potentially in the clear.” He noted that the regulators have put the industry in a position where there is compliance with some aspects of resistance, and this has shaped the industry in ways that were not anticipated. Buterin also criticized Gensler, noting that the actions of the SEC lead to legal risks and impair efficiency. He stated, ” it is a key reason why @GaryGensler must never be christened as a hero, even among crypto skeptics. “ Although political tokens and regulation are the concerns of the crypto market, Buterin still believes in the future of the industry. He said there is a need to go back to the drawing board and focus on long-term and transparent innovation and community-based projects. According to Buterin, the industry can solve the current problems by giving importance to privacy, security, and transparency. In the post, Buterin also explained how innovations in DeFi can be used responsibly and gave examples of the Infinex and True Markets projects. He called on the industry to create systems that support the principles of decentralization while embracing sustainability and equity. He ended the post by stating, “There is a bright future of capital allocation mechanisms that can be built. Acceleration is coming either way; it is our task to choose the brightest possible vector.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",News|Melania|TRUMP,EN,0,0,REGULATION|ETH|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-24 00:17:25

39351845,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=649553,1737678868,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39351845.jpeg,SEC officially rescinds anti-crypto SAB 121,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/sec-officially-rescinds-anti-crypto-sab-121/,"Today, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has pulled the plug on Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121), a rule that had tied crypto companies in regulatory kno ts since 2022. This decision, announced through Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 122 (SAB 122) on January 23, removes the controversial guidance that forced platforms to account for safeguarding crypto-assets as liabilities. The rescission directly affects how crypto companies report risks and obligations tied to safeguarding digital assets held on behalf of users. What SAB 122 changes for crypto The SEC’s new guidance removes the requirements imposed by Topic 5.FF under SAB 121. That bulletin forced crypto platforms to treat their obligation to safeguard users’ assets as liabilities, regardless of whether actual financial risks existed. With SAB 122, that specific directive is gone. The Commission made it clear that entities should now determine any liabilities related to safeguarding risks under broader accounting standards like FASB ASC Subtopic 450-20 or IAS 37. Under these standards, companies are expected to assess potential liabilities based on loss contingencies and provisions. FASB ASC Subtopic 450-20 covers how U.S.-based firms handle these risks, while IAS 37 applies to entities using IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards). “Entities should implement this change retroactively for annual periods starting after December 15, 2024,” the SEC said in its bulletin. Companies can also adopt the rescission earlier for interim or annual filings submitted after the announcement of SAB 122. How the SEC justifies the decisions According to the SEC’s official filing, Staff Accounting Bulletins are not formal rules or legally binding interpretations. Instead, they provide guidance that reflects practices followed by the Division of Corporation Finance and the Office of the Chief Accountant. Vanessa A. Countryman, Secretary of the SEC, confirmed that SAB 122 has officially replaced SAB 121 in the agency’s regulatory framework. The change has also been codified in Title 17 of the Code of Federal Regulations. While the text of SAB 122 will not appear directly in the Code of Federal Regulations, the SEC has made updates to its table of Staff Accounting Bulletins to reflect the change. The rescission of SAB 121 does not mean crypto companies can completely avoid disclosing risks tied to safeguarding users’ assets though. In its announcement, the SEC reminded companies of their existing obligations under broader regulatory requirements. These include Items 101, 105, and 303 of Regulation S-K, which mandate disclosures on business operations, risk factors, and management’s discussion and analysis, respectively. Companies must also follow accounting rules under FASB ASC Topic 275, which addresses risks and uncertainties in financial reporting. The SEC specifically mentioned that companies must disclose any material risks or uncertainties related to safeguarding crypto-assets. The agency also expects companies to provide enough information so investors can understand the financial and operational implications of their obligations.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $10.15 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $16.50. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. Can WIF attain new heights in 2025? Will Dogwifhat reach $10 soon? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $1.77 Market cap $1,429,627,931.13 Trading volume $302,922,358.59 Circulating supply 998,841,665.99 WIF All-time high $4.85 on March 31, 2024 All-time low $0.000023 on November 2023 24-hour high $1.45 24-hour low $1.35 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 14.68% 50-day SMA $2.46 14-Day RSI 44.39 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 75 (Greed) Green days 12/30 (40%) 200-Day SMA $2.24 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis: Buyers re-enter the market; more upsides? TL;DR Breakdown WIF’s price analysis suggests renewed buyer interest. Dogwifhat (WIF) resistance is present at around $1.642. WIF’s support level is present at $1.35. The Dogwifhat price analysis for January 24 shows price recovery and increasing buyer interest. WIF has seen a 0.59% gain in the past 24 hours but is still down by 19% gain in the last 7 days. Will the growing buying interest push WIF above $1.6? Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: WIF trades below 20-day SMA with bullish recovery in sight The 1-day chart shows WIF trading well below the 20-day SMA at $1.64, reflecting a bearish trend. The MACD suggests minimal bullish momentum, with the histogram near neutral and lines close to a crossover. WIF trades below 20-day SMA with a bullish recovery in sight The RSI at 37.12 indicates the asset is near oversold, hinting at potential consolidation or a mild recovery if buying volume increases. A break above $1.64 could signal further upside, while rejection risks revisiting lower support levels near $1.30. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart: WIF indicators show bullish bias, though weak The 4-hour WIF/USDT chart shows slight consolidation after recent volatility. The Bollinger Bands highlight narrowing activity and reduced price fluctuations—a potential buildup for a breakout in either direction. WIF indicators show bullish bias, though weak The Balance of Power (BOP) at 0.88 shows a sharp bullish bias, indicating buyer market dominance. But the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is at about 0.05, revealing that capital inflows are weak, limiting buying power in the market even while the market acts like it is heading upwards. If buyers keep up the momentum, they could take the price up to the next resistance at about $1.48. Otherwise, WIF could fall back to about $1.35. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $1.484 SELL SMA 5 $1.534 SELL SMA 10 $1.732 SELL SMA 21 $1.765 SELL SMA 50 $2.24 SELL SMA 100 $2.53 SELL SMA 200 $2.24 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $1.562 SELL EMA 5 $1.596 SELL EMA 10 $1.694 SELL EMA 21 $1.879 SELL EMA 50 $2.23 SELL EMA 100 $2.37 SELL EMA 200 $2.33 SELL What to expect from WIF price analysis? WIF is recovering at $1.425 with bullish signs. A clear breakout above $1.48 is needed to confirm a bullish recovery. If momentum holds, WIF could retest $1.64 or consolidate if it breaks support at $1.35. Is Dogwifhat a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain. Its value is driven by community interest and speculation. Projections indicate that by 2025, the price could rise to about $3. While it may have potential for short-term gains, it’s equally risky. Only invest after thorough research. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank and several others. Why is $WIF up? WIF is up 0.59% in the past 24 hours, trading around $1.44. The rise is driven by increased trading volume, market recovery, and speculative interest. However, it’s still far below its $4.85 all-time high. Dogwifhat (WIF) price chart | TradingView Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Will WIF reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and would require exceptional growth, widespread adoption, and wild market speculation. Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $3.5 by 2025 and $10 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

Inaugurated Trump (TRUMPINA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPINA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Inaugurated Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Inaugurated Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Inaugurated Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Inaugurated Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Inaugurated Trump by entering its contract address – 2F9Q7eZwdnfWUY6Pcqvb7KFDXVW2vcoLCDoTkzsHUvTF – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPINA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|DOGE|SOL|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-24 00:44:00

Interest rates should follow us all over.” While he didn’t explicitly name the Federal Reserve, the implication was clear, setting the stage for friction with Fed Chair Jay Powell, who has repeatedly said the institution’s independence from political interference. During his first term that started in 2016, Trump frequently criticized Powell, whom he appointed, calling him a “bonehead” and publicly mocking his decision-making. He even compared Powell to a golfer who can’t sink a putt once in 2017. The Fed’s current benchmark interest rate stands between 4.25% and 4.5%, after three cuts in late 2024. While markets are predicting no immediate rate adjustments during the meeting, traders anticipate a cut as early as June. CME Group data places the probability of another cut before the end of the year at 50%. Speaking to reporters later in the day, Trump doubled down, saying, “I expect the Fed to listen to me. They must. Powell and I will have that conversation at the right time.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose during his speech, while the two-year Treasury yield, which often reacts to policy signals, edged lower. Inflation, private capital, and economic uncertainties Trump also addressed the ongoing inflation crisis, blaming it squarely on the Biden administration. According to Trump, “wasteful deficit spending” under former President Joe Biden created what he called “the worst inflation crisis in modern history.” Food prices, along with nearly every other essential item, skyrocketed, he said, leaving American families to shoulder the burden. The Federal Reserve has faced its share of criticism over inflation as well. The central bank initially dismissed the 2021 inflation surge as “transitory,” a decision that led to aggressive interest rate hikes totaling 5.25% before the recent cuts. Inflation is still above the Fed’s 2% target. During his speech, Trump also touted a $100 billion joint venture between SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle, named Stargate, to develop artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.S. The project plans to eventually invest $500 billion, and is a part of Trump’s vision to unlock private capital and spur growth. Larry Fink, CEO and founder of BlackRock, weighed in during an interview with CNBC at the Davos event. “I’m cautiously optimistic,” he said. “But there are scenarios where this could be pretty bad. Unlocking private capital will drive growth, but it could also create new inflationary pressures.” Larry warned that these pressures could push interest rates higher, potentially destabilizing equity markets. He pointed to the bond market as an indicator of what could come next.

The pseudonymous analyst known as Pentoshi tells his 846,600 followers on the social media platform X that he’s bullish on PENGU , the utility token for the non-fungible token (NFT) project Pudgy Penguins, as well as the memecoin Fwog ( FWOG ). PENGU is trading at $0.0244 at time of writing. The 88th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 4% in the past 24 hours. FWOG is trading at $0.187 at time of writing. The 380th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down nearly 5% in the past day. Pentoshi also notes that crypto market sentiment is currently “extremely low.” “Here are the charts for the market and alts. What happened? Over-trading is likely a big one, getting chopped on low time frames and not respecting trends or larger ranges. Trading good coins/assets for bad ones, trying to make it overnight, taking too large of risk on low percentage plays, and obviously returns this cycle will diminish bigly in alts as this cycle will be the smallest by far in terms of percentage returns when it’s all said and done for a number of reasons we’ve already discussed. But if you look at the market as a whole, the sentiment and charts don’t align currently.” Source: Pentoshi/X Source: Pentoshi/X Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

This development follows the network’s recent upgrade to its consensus mechanism, adding new capabilities for participants. The staking rewards initiative is expected to increase engagement and strengthen the blockchain’s ecosystem, potentially influencing ALGO price. Algorand Launches Real-Time Staking Rewards for Validators The Algorand blockchain network has unveiled its new staking rewards program, which offers real-time payouts to validators. Validators proposing blocks on the network will earn a minimum of 10 ALGO per block, alongside 50% of transaction fees from the successfully proposed blocks. The rewards are set to decay by 1% for every one million blocks generated. More so, the program, introduced after the network’s recent consensus mechanism upgrade, eliminates measures such as slashing and token lockups. Unlike other proof-of-stake networks, Algorand allows validators to maintain full access to their tokens. This ensures a secure staking environment. Meanwhile, earlier this month, Algorand-linked Exodus Wallet became the first crypto firm to go public on the NYSE American after overcoming SEC rejection in May. Non-Inflationary Supply Supports ALGO’s Market Appeal One of the key features of Algorand’s staking program is its non-inflationary rewards system. The staking rewards are distributed without impacting the total supply of ALGO, maintaining the token’s scarcity. This differentiates Algorand from other networks like Ethereum and Solana, where staking rewards often result in inflationary pressures on the native token. The Algorand Foundation highlighted that the staking rewards program will boost network participation while preserving the blockchain’s long-term economic stability. Participants can engage in liquid staking through platforms like Folks Finance and Tinyman, or use delegated staking options on Pact and Valar. ALGO Price Action and Prediction Algorand’s new staking rewards program comes as its native token, ALGO, trades at $0.4106. The blockchain native token has seen a 1.24% increase over the past 24 hours, with a market capitalization of $3.44 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $275.63 million. Moreover, technical indicators suggest potential bullish momentum for ALGO price. The 7-day Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows a positive crossover, with the MACD line above the signal line. This alignment indicates growing bullish momentum. More so, increasing histogram bars support the bullish momentum, suggesting buyers are gaining control of the market. The gradual upward trend in the MACD signals a potential continuation of bullish activity. Source: TradingView Similarly, the symmetrical triangle pattern visible on the chart signals a bullish breakout as the price consolidates within narrowing trendlines. This formation often precedes significant price movements. With ALGO price trading near the upper boundary of the triangle, a breakout above $0.50 could confirm a strong upward move. The declining volume during consolidation further validates the pattern, hinting at an impending volatility surge.

Research is already underway, and a roadmap for development puts 2050 as the start of practical application. Regional media from Japan reports that investment and holdings powerhouse Softbank is looking to combine cultured cell tissue with artificial intelligence to create “next generation” AI capabilities and save on energy consumption. The story, which sounds like something out of a sci-fi thriller, details that the Softbank Research Institute of Advanced Technology is working with The University of Tokyo to “use brain tissue cultured from iPS cells to directly incorporate the energy-saving and flexible learning ability of the human brain into computing.” Whether this is something credible (if highly controversial) or just a clever way to spend grant money while creating a buzz, is really anyone’s guess. But with the focused, global push from politicians and technocratic corporations for integrating AI into everyday life, and the extreme push to implement AI governance in Japan , the development is noteworthy. Softbank’s vision for BPU (Brain Processing Units) The Friday morning (JST) Toyokeizai write-up explains that while large-scale AI operations currently use a lot of power for computation, the human brain typically requires only about 20 watts for everyday thinking and integration of new data. “We aim to realize it as a new accelerator that coexists with conventional CPUs, GPUs, and quantum computers,” Softbank researcher Sota Sugimura is quoted as saying. But, where do the cells come from? The so-called “brain cells” are created via iPS cells (induced pluripotent stem cells). Project researchers have created what they call “brain organoids” from these cells, which are spherical in shape and measure about o.5 – 1 centimeter in size, containing nerve cells and glial cells. Photo depicting “organoids,” which mimic brain tissue, in a combined state. Source : Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo. According to the report, the organoids have shown reactions to “reward” and “penalty” stimuli, and “a phenomenon that seems to be learning specific to brain cells” was observed. But project researchers note this experiment is still in its early stages, and there are ethical questions to be considered. Further, Toyokeizai’s Toru Ishii details that the cells often react differently to the same stimulus, as they are derived from living organisms with inherent differences. While Softbank R&D researcher Keisuke Asakura is quoted as comparing the organoids to a “baby’s brain” stage, that seems quite a stretch, as at present the experiment is basically electrifying tiny samples of tissue in the lab. Nothing akin to the ineffably rich cognition, feedback, and creativity of an actual human infant. As for a roadmap for the project, “SoftBank aims to apply it as a small, energy-saving sensor by around 2030, expand it to robot control and complex motor tasks around 2040, and further develop it into fields that require advanced judgment, such as autonomous driving and creative fields, from 2050 onwards,” the report explains.

This sharp rise in token burns indicates a growing interest in decreasing the overall supply of SHIB. Moreover, it has raised the possibility that the SHIB price could follow suit, as increased token burn often influences a cryptocurrency’s price movements. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Skyrockets Over 600% Shibburn, the official Shiba Inu token burn tracker, has just reported a dramatic increase in burn rate, with over 3.24 million SHIB tokens permanently removed from circulation. The tracking platform revealed that the SHIB token burn rate shot up by approximately 612.78% in less than 24 hours. This spike represents one of the most significant one-day increases in recent weeks. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Skyrockets 1,068% Amid Market Bleed, Can Bullishness Push Price Above $0.00003 Again? Typically, a surge in a token’s burn rate is largely attributed to community-led initiatives focused on reducing the cryptocurrency’s supply and potentially inducing scarcity. Considering the large size and strong dedication of the Shiba Inu community, it’s not uncommon to see occasional spikes in burn rates. The community has been a strong advocate for token burns, believing that a supply reduction could trigger a price surge for SHIB. Despite the latest burn and substantial decrease in SHIB’s circulating supply, the meme coin’s price has yet to demonstrate any significant upward movement. In fact, Shiba Inu appears to be on a downtrend, as CoinMarketCap reports a 1.6% decline in the last 24 hours and a previous 9.3% drop over the past week. Currently, the price of SHIB is trading at $0.00002, experiencing no recent increases, while its 24-hour trading volume has crashed by 46.33%. Nevertheless, this lack of immediate price action and present bearish conditions does not rule out the potential for a future rally in Shiba Inu. Supporting this possibility of a bull trend driven by heightened token burns, crypto analyst Rananjay Singh commented on the recent 612% spike in the Shiba Inu burn rate on X (formerly Twitter). Singh explained that when a cryptocurrency’s supply declines and demand stays strong, prices tend to increase significantly. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price To $0.000045? Here Are The Major Support And Resistances To Watch Out For The analyst suggests that increased token burns, upcoming updates in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, and the growing excitement among community members could potentially trigger substantial gains for the meme coin in 2025. What’s Next For The SHIB Price? ‘Shib Spain,’ a popular SHIB supporter on X, has predicted that a massive pump could be on the horizon for the meme coin. The analyst connects Ethereum’s price action with Shiba Inu’s, sharing a detailed chart that showed instances when ETH experienced a price reversal and underwent a significant rally. Although the meme coin was not indicated on the chart, the analyst’s mention likely ties his projected SHIB price pump to an increase in ETH. This suggests that if Ethereum experiences a price surge, altcoins like Shiba Inu could follow suit, potentially sparking a significant uptrend.

Fathom Holdings announced on January 23 that it can use up to 50% of its surplus cash reserve to nourish its Bitcoin reserve. The enterprise aims to grant up to $500,000 toward BTC or Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, they noted that they would adjust the allocation to align with the firm’s performance requirements and market circumstances. Bitcoin is critical as a hedge currency risk CFO Joanne Zach of Fathom Holdings is upbeat that the decision to establish a Bitcoin reserve shows their zeal to diversify their treasure holdings. Bitcoin is a decentralized store of value that has been highly adopted since 2023. Zach stated: The integration of Bitcoin into commercial and financial strategies has accelerated across financial markets, positioning it as both a hedge against inflation and a safeguard against economic and currency risks in the global economy . Joanne Zach The announcement did not trigger changes in Fathom’s stock price. It trades around $1.33 per share and has a market cap of approximately $30 million. Fathom CEO Marco Fregenal indicated that they have always been innovators in the digital economy, and having a Bitcoin reserve aligns with their mission. Moreover, the entity plans to enable Bitcoin as a payment option to drive real estate transactions through its software platforms. Corporations and institutions are rapidly adopting Bitcoin Zach said that Fathom chose to go with Bitcoin partly due to corporations’ and institutions’ rapid adoption of digital assets. In their first 11 months of trading, the US spot Bitcoin ETFs broke $100 billion in net assets, marking the most successful ETF launch ever. According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET , more than 70 publicly traded funds have acquired Bitcoin and jointly own more than $64 billion worth of BTC. However, MicroStrategy holds more than three-quarters of the BTC. Other famous tech companies have also submitted a proposal to establish a Bitcoin treasury. Meta and Microsoft are in the queue to create a reserve. However, Microsoft has already voted against the adoption of Bitcoin.

Trump Executive Order (TRUMPEO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPEO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Executive Order can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Executive Order could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Executive Order launched with over $25,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Executive Order on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Executive Order by entering its contract address – Guze7ScXTVo3JPwojxcVX5P7EEcC5ncAByrA47QJ6JzT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPEO.

The latest Polkadot price predictions indicate a wide span, from $5.82 to $23.45, highlighting the uncertainty in DOT’s short-term path. Meanwhile, major players acquiring over 250,000 LTC have sparked a Litecoin (LTC) rally, lifting its price past $120. In the meantime, BlockDAG’s LAUNCH300 promotion has ignited a purchasing spree among big players! They are seizing this opportunity, which offers a 300% bonus on BlockDAG (BDAG) coins, positioning it as the best crypto coin to buy. This boost in activity has propelled BlockDAG’s presale to $183.5 million, with batch 27 almost sold out. Polkadot Price Predictions for 2025 Polkadot price predictions for 2025 vary widely. Currently valued around $6.80 with a market cap of $11.92 billion, some analysts believe it might range between $5.82 and $18.01, with a high target of $23.45 if positive trends hold. Other sources, like DigitalCoinPrice, predict DOT could reach $16.00–$17.04 by the end of the year, possibly climbing to $28.04 by 2027. However, potential setbacks such as cyber-attacks could push its price down to $11.00. Market fluctuations and new developments will be crucial in determining DOT’s price trajectory. Litecoin (LTC) Rally: Exploring the 19% Jump Litecoin has seen a significant 19% jump in the last 24 hours, driving its price over $120. This notable rally distinguishes itself in the current market climate. A key factor for this Litecoin (LTC) rally is the increased involvement of major investors. Data from on-chain analytics provider Santiment shows these large stakeholders have been amassing Litecoin, with a total of 250,000 LTC (about $30 million) bought in the recent week. This surge in accumulation by major holders is likely powering the ongoing Litecoin (LTC) rally. The sustainability of this rally will hinge on the big players’ future actions. Big Rewards with BlockDAG’s LAUNCH300: Triple Your BDAG Instantly! BlockDAG’s LAUNCH300 promotion offers a substantial 300% bonus on each BDAG purchase, making it the most generous deal by BlockDAG to date, allowing participants to triple their stash at no additional cost. The promotion arrives at an opportune moment, with BlockDAG’s presale already amassing $183.5 million, signaling a surge in big purchases. With the presale nearing its $600 million goal, confidence in the project remains high. This robust presale performance and support from major participants suggest that BDAG could hit $1 by 2025. Priced at $0.0248 in batch 27, early entrants have the chance for a substantial 3932% gain if BDAG reaches $1. Those who got in early have seen returns of 2380%, solidifying its status as the best crypto coin to buy currently. The LAUNCH300 is also an excellent opportunity for participants to dive into the BDAG ecosystem and immediately enhance their holdings. For instance, purchasing 1,000 BDAG now would yield an additional 3,000 BDAG, totaling 4,000 coins. Many have quickly acted to secure BDAG at this price to optimize their gains. With batch 27 nearly sold out and prices set to increase in the next phase, acting now is crucial. The 300% bonus offer is limited, and buying now could lead to significant growth by 2025. Wrapping Up the Top Crypto Pick for 2025 Polkadot price predictions range from $5.82 to $23.45, indicating market uncertainty and fluctuations. Meanwhile, the recent Litecoin (LTC) rally has pushed its price over $120, though its future remains uncertain. Yet, BlockDAG’s potential outshines others, with predictions setting a $1 price by the 2025 mainnet launch. Strong backing by big purchasers has pushed the crypto presale towards its $600 million goal. For those seeking the highest returns for the least expense, BlockDAG’s LAUNCH300 bonus positions it as the best crypto coin to buy for 2025. But with the window closing soon, swift action is advised to secure a possible 3932% return if BDAG reaches $1.

Among those most affected could be Tether (USDT), a cornerstone of the crypto economy known for its role in providing liquidity and stability. Recent legislative proposals in the United States aim to enforce strict reserve requirements for stablecoins, sparking concerns that Tether, known for its opaque reserve disclosures, could face delisting from major exchanges. This regulatory uncertainty makes it a precarious time for Tether investors. However, as one door may be closing, another opens with Web3Bay (3BAY), a rising blockchain-based e-commerce platform, which is not only navigating these turbulent waters but is also projected to offer a staggering 10,000% ROI by the end of 2025, according to its current presale momentum and market predictions. Regulatory Challenges Faced By Tether Tether, the dominant player in the stablecoin market, is under severe scrutiny due to its reserve management practices. Proposed U.S. legislation that requires stablecoins to have full reserve backing could severely impact Tether’s listing on major exchanges. This legislation comes amid longstanding concerns about Tether’s transparency and the true backing of its USDT tokens. Historically, Tether claimed that each token was backed one-to-one by U.S. dollars, but revelations have shown that its reserves are also held in other assets, which may not always be as liquid or stable as U.S. dollars. The potential for Tether to be delisted stems from these regulatory pressures, compounded by investigations and criticisms from financial authorities that question the adequacy of its reserve holdings. These issues not only risk Tether’s ability to operate under new regulations but also undermine user and investor confidence. Web3Bay: An Emerging Giant with Promising Prospects In contrast to Tether’s regulatory woes, Web3Bay presents a lucrative opportunity. This blockchain-driven e-commerce platform has swiftly gained traction by capitalizing on the need for more secure and transparent online transactions. Recently, Web3Bay announced a significant milestone for its ongoing presale, raising $870,000 in just under 4 stages, which solidifies its market position and underscores strong investor confidence. If you were to invest $1,000 in Web3Bay tokens at the current price of $0.004562, you could purchase approximately 219,211 tokens. Looking ahead, if Web3Bay’s token price reaches the expected launch price of $0.10 by the end of 2025, the value of your investment would soar. Specifically, your 219,211 tokens would then be worth $21,921.10. This represents a substantial increase, turning your initial $1,000 investment into over $21,921.10—an impressive return on investment of about 2,092%, which is a significant gain for any investor looking for opportunities within the emerging blockchain technology market. However, given the current momentum of its presale and the optimistic market sentiment surrounding it, there’s potential for the price to climb even higher, possibly reaching up to $0.50 per token. Should this happen, your initial investment could soar to $109,605.50, delivering an ROI of approximately 10,000%. Key Takeaways the cryptocurrency sector is approaching a critical juncture, particularly for stablecoins like Tether, which are bracing for potential upheavals due to upcoming U.S. regulatory changes. These changes, aimed at enforcing strict reserve requirements, could significantly disrupt Tether’s operations, potentially leading to its delisting from major exchanges. This regulatory uncertainty casts a shadow over Tether’s stability and reliability as a safe haven within the crypto market. In contrast, this period of uncertainty for Tether highlights a significant opportunity for investors to pivot towards more promising and innovative cryptocurrencies. Web3Bay, a blockchain-based e-commerce platform, is emerging as a particularly attractive alternative. With its robust presale performance suggesting a potential for up to 10,000% ROI by the end of 2025, Web3Bay stands out not just for its impressive financial prospects but also for its strategic positioning at the intersection of blockchain technology and digital commerce. This platform exemplifies how the integration of blockchain can revolutionize traditional industries, making it a beacon for potential growth and substantial returns. For investors and market participants, the current scenario underscores the importance of adaptability and strategic foresight. While Tether faces challenges, the rise of platforms like Web3Bay showcases the dynamic nature of the crypto market and the continuous evolution of blockchain applications.

John E. Deaton, a prominent attorney known for advocating on behalf of XRP, has shared insights into what it would take to establish such a reserve. Deaton emphasized that the legal and regulatory framework will play a critical role in determining the future of a national digital asset stockpile. John Deaton Stance on Strategic Bitcoin Reserve In a bid to clear the air on the “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” term, Pro XRP lawyer John E. Deaton weighed in on the matter. To him, the meaning of an SBR differ depending on the context in which it is being used. Deaton also noted that an SBR can simply consist in keeping the seized Bitcoin and other digital currencies in a virtual vault instead of selling them. In addition, he said this could be done under the overseeing of the president through the issuance of an executive order. John Deaton said, “If you want to call that a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, then I am sure that we will get one.” However, he noted that in case of an SBR where government is directly buying Bitcoin, this would require a law. He mentioned the bill proposed by Senator Cynthia Lummis as an example of how such a policy could be implemented. Moreover, with Senator Cynthia Lummis’ new role as chair in the Senate’s Digital Assets Subcommittee, experts including Binance founder CZ have shown optimism for the strategic Bitcoin reserve. Trump’s Executive Order and “Stockpile” Terminology President Donald Trump has recently issued an executive order which is aimed at the creation of a national digital asset reserve. The order created a working group that was to study the possibility of developing and maintaining such a stockpile. The language of the order only indicated the term “stockpile” not “reserve.” According to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, there was a difference between these two terms: “Trump was very particular even as far back as this summer at the Bitcoin conference to say ‘Stockpile’ and not ‘Reserve.’” This points more towards the administration not being in the market to buy Bitcoin but rather to keep certain assets within the government. The working group is expected to recommend guidelines for the stockpile control, which may involve assets acquired in accordance with the law enforcement activities. During these speculations, Pierre Rochard, the Vice President of Research at Riot Platforms, stated that Ripple Labs has been against the formation of a Bitcoin-centric reserve. Rochard alleged that the company was using its power to advance its own digital currency, XRP, over Bitcoin, which is something that the CEO of Ripple has dismissed . Status of U.S. Government Crypto Holdings Concurrrently, data from Arkham Intelligence reveals the extent of cryptocurrency holdings currently under U.S. government control. These holdings are mainly the property acquired through the police operations. Currently, the government’s digital asset portfolio consists of 198,109 BTC with a market capitalization of about $20 billion and lesser amounts of Ethereum, stablecoins, and other tokens.. The executive order as a result does not impose on the government to keep all these assets for an unspecified period. Instead, it prescribes the need to develop guidelines that can be used to determine which assets should be kept. Analyst Alex Thorn highlighted that the language of the order suggests that not all the seized assets would be permanently retained. Similarly, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart has also noted the feasibility of this approach, saying, “Honestly a very logical and measured approach to this, in my opinion.” The post Pro XRP Lawyer Reveals Requirement To Create Strategic Bitcoin Reserve appeared first on CoinGape .",Uncategorized|Bitcoin Reserve|Donald Trump Crypto|John Deaton,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|XRP|REGULATION|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-01-24 02:12:06

Think about Cardano’s journey—it started at mere pennies, and by 2021, it skyrocketed to an all-time high of $3.101. Stories like these are a harsh reminder of missed opportunities that could’ve changed your life. But while regret doesn’t pay the bills, learning from it might. The good news? A new crypto gem is making waves, and you still have a chance to join early. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) —the next big crypto to explode, according to analysts. Unlike its predecessors, which focused on singular functionalities, Qubetics is revolutionizing the space by solving real-world problems, uniting blockchains, and creating tools that businesses and individuals can actually use. With its presale currently in the 18th stage, this could be your golden opportunity to secure a spot before it’s too late. Qubetics Could Be the Opportunity You’ve Been Waiting For If you’re feeling the sting of missing out on Cardano or other early crypto opportunities, Qubetics is here to turn that around. Let’s be real: you might’ve missed the exclusive Qubetics whitelist, where early birds got a chance to sign up with no upfront investment. Back then, tokens were offered at an incredibly low $0.01 for those lucky enough to get notified early. Fast forward to today, and the project is in its 18th presale stage, now priced at $0.0551. If you think you’ve missed your chance again, think twice—it’s still affordable and packed with massive potential. Every presale stage for Qubetics lasts only seven days and ends with a 10% price increase. That means waiting too long could push it out of your budget faster than you think. With over $10.4 million already raised, more than 435 million tokens sold, and 15,700+ holders backing it, the momentum is undeniable. Analysts are already predicting that $TICS could hit $1 after the presale ends, offering a potential ROI of 1713.57%. But that’s not all—Qubetics isn’t just another crypto. It’s the world’s first Web3 aggregator, uniting leading blockchains under one ecosystem. Its QubeQode IDE , a cutting-edge development platform, is a game-changer. Imagine a drag-and-drop interface allowing businesses to integrate blockchain functionalities like token management and user authentication into their apps seamlessly. For example, a small e-commerce store can integrate blockchain-based loyalty programs without needing a team of developers. A freelance creator could set up smart contracts for secure payments in minutes. And enterprises? They can scale operations with tokenized assets and decentralized apps, cutting costs and complexity. Missed opportunities like Cardano don’t come back. But with Qubetics presale still live, you can make the right call today. Investing $750 at the current price of $0.0551 could get you approximately 13,614 $TICS tokens. If Qubetics hits $1 after the presale, that’s a cool $13,614. And if it soars to $10 after the mainnet launch in Q2 2025, you’re looking at $136,140. You don’t want to regret missing this one. Toncoin’s ICO Success and Current Growth Toncoin, originally launched as part of Telegram’s blockchain initiative, is another example of an ICO success story that’s hard to ignore. Its ICO price was a modest $0.10, offering early investors a rare opportunity to get in on the ground floor. However, after legal troubles with the SEC, Telegram had to step away from the project, and the community took over. Despite the initial hiccups, Toncoin has made a remarkable comeback. As of today, Toncoin trades at around $5.20, showcasing impressive growth since its initial offering. The coin now powers the TON blockchain, a highly scalable and efficient network optimized for dApps and cross-chain transactions. The ecosystem has drawn attention for its user-friendly integration with Telegram, allowing seamless crypto transactions for millions of users globally. For example, a small business using Telegram could integrate Toncoin payments to accept crypto seamlessly from its customers. This streamlined approach has made Toncoin a favorite for utility-focused use cases. And with its growing adoption, the project continues to gain momentum. The takeaway? Early investment in ICOs like Toncoin can lead to significant returns, as its current price is 52 times its initial offering. If you missed out on Toncoin back in the day, Qubetics might just be your second shot at life-changing gains. Don’t Let Regret Define Your Future Missing out on projects like Cardano and Toncoin is tough, but it’s also a wake-up call. Cryptos like Qubetics don’t come around every day, and the potential ROI here is hard to ignore. With its presale currently at $0.0551 and predictions of hitting $1 or even $10 post-mainnet launch, this could be your opportunity to turn the tables. So why wait? The clock is ticking on Qubetics’ presale, and with each stage lasting only seven days and ending with a 10% price hike, time is literally money. Join the Qubetics presale now and secure your spot in what analysts are calling the next big crypto to explode . Your future self might just thank you for it.

US SEC Withdraws Controversial SAB 121 The U.S. SEC has posted a notice on its website that SAB 121 that was released in 2022 was withdrawn with the release of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 122 . SAB 121 stated that companies that have custody of cryptocurrencies for their clients must recognize these crypto-assets as liabilities in their financial statements. The guidance had come under much criticism from the crypto industry and lawmakers, stating that the rule raised compliance costs and deterred banks from offering digital asset custody services. Meanwhile, the SEC noted that instead of following the guidance provided in the statement, entities should continue to use the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or International Accounting Standards (IAS) to account for the crypto assets. Hester Peirce, a SEC commissioner and now the head of the agency’s recently created crypto unit, expressed support for the move. “Bye, bye SAB 121! It’s not been fun,” Peirce shared on X (previously Twitter) on Thursday. She had earlier described it as a rather rigid policy that is disadvantageous to the growth of innovation. Criticism and Legal Challenges Surrounding SAB 121 Since its introduction, SAB 121 has been criticized by the crypto industry and members of both parties in Congress. Critics had complained that the rule was introduced in the absence of a proper public consultation process and that it was aimed at firms in the digital asset industry specifically. The banking industry also voiced out its concern, saying that the rule hampers their capacity to give out custodial services for the digital assets. The US SEC’s former chairman Gary Gensler, who backed the rule, said it was needed to safeguard investors in case of bankruptcies. Gensler provided examples of bankruptcy courts claims that customer cryptocurrency was not shielded from creditors, and, therefore, the need to put more measures in place. Nonetheless, in 2024, Congress tried to repeal SAB 121 through a bipartisan resolution by passing it in both the House and the Senate. However, the resolution was vetoed by then President Joe Biden. It remained effective up to the Thursday announcement in light of leadership switch at the SEC as well as beginning of a new administration under pro-crypto President Donald Trump who has affirmed his intention to make US a home for crypto. Leadership Change Marks New Direction for the US SEC Gary Gensler has stepped down as the US SEC Chair this week, and Mark Uyeda, the Republican Commissioner, has taken over as the acting chair. On Tuesday, Uyeda released members of the crypto task force led by Hester Peirce to tackle the crypto asset regulation. “The SEC has primarily relied on enforcement actions to regulate crypto, which has created uncertainty,” the SEC said in a statement. “Clarity and practical solutions for those seeking compliance have been elusive.” The task force wants to introduce a clearer and more predictable approach to regulating cryptocurrencies. This change has been made after a long time of criticism that Gensler has taken a reactive and punitive approach while at the SEC. Industry and Lawmakers Welcome the Decision The crypto industry and banking sector have hailed the withdrawal of SAB 121 as a move towards promoting innovation and decreasing the regulatory burden. Paige Pidano Paridon, co-head of the Bank Policy Institute’s regulatory affairs, said that the decision would allow the banks to regain their capacity for being the secure guardians of digital assets. At the same time, the lawmakers who voted against SAB 121 also announced their support. Pro-crypto Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, the new digital assets subcommittee chair from Wyoming called the rule “disastrous” and celebrated its removal. Mike Flood, the representative who proposed a resolution to repeal SAB 121 in 2024, characterized the withdrawal as a positive sign of bipartisan support and shift in US crypto policy.

The Japanese crypto market lags behind other regions, with only 8% penetration and limited demand for altcoins beyond BTC, ETH, and XRP. Coincheck's valuation is high at 13 times book value, and I see too many risks in longing CNCK at this time. In early December, Coincheck Group N.V. ( CNCK ) became one of the latest Nasdaq-listed crypto-businesses through a SPAC merger with Thunder Bridge Capital Partners IV, Inc. ( THCP ). Following the completion of the deal, Coincheck is just the second company listed on the Nasdaq after Coinbase ( COIN ) to primarily operate a cryptocurrency exchange business. Though headquartered in the Netherlands, Coincheck operates a Japan-based exchange. In this article, we'll look at the company's past financial performance, balance sheet, and the cryptocurrency market in Japan. Coincheck Business Segments Revenue Segment Breakout FY24 (Coincheck) Coincheck Group N.V. primarily operates the Coincheck cryptocurrency exchange. Transaction revenue makes up 92.5% of the company's total revenue with the remaining 7.5% of revenue derived from products like NFTs, IEOs, wholesale services, subscriptions, and on/off ramp fees. In the transaction revenue segment, Coincheck's gross margins have generally been in decline for each of the last three years. For FY year ended March 2022, 2023, and 2024, Coincheck's margin between sales and COGS was 4.05%, 3.45%, and 3.45% respectively. That number is even slightly lower at 3.39% as of six months ended September: Coincheck The good news is Coincheck grew revenue by 130% year over year in the six months ended September and flipped from a net loss in the 2023 period to a $3.2 million gain through the first half of FY 2025. Coincheck While the company has flipped back to net profit to begin its fiscal year, top line revenue is well below the highs from fiscal years 2021 and 2022. Coincheck's exchange business operates only in Japan, and that market has historically under-performed other jurisdictions from a market penetration standpoint. The Japanese Crypto Market As I see it, Coincheck is a bet on the expansion of the Japanese cryptocurrency market. The company claims the top market position in the Japanese crypto consumer market with 20% share and 2.1 million accounts. This is a market that currently lags other jurisdictions from a crypto-holder penetration standpoint according to Coincheck's November investor deck. 17% of the United States population is estimated to hold cryptocurrencies in some form while less than 8% of Japan's population holds crypto. Coincheck This is in spite of a crypto-regulatory environment in Japan that is more established than the United States. Interestingly, US-headquartered crypto exchange businesses Coinbase and Kraken both left the Japan market due to softness in the broad crypto market several years ago. Kraken cited focused use of resources in other jurisdictions as one of the reasons for leaving Japan. There are two ways to look at that; on one hand, it could be a clear sign that market demand for crypto is limited in Japan. On the other hand, it's an indication that Coincheck has less competition in Japan if that consumer demand should ever return to previous highs. The company offers prospective shareholders solid insight on market expense and user acquisition costs. Coincheck Through the first half of 2024, market expenses have exceeded revenue generated from users who have completed the know-your-customer on-boarding process. Cost per user increased to $46 during the April-June 2024 quarter. Each of these signals - customer acquisition costs exceeding revenue from new users and cost of acquisition approaching/exceeding $50 - were signs of exhaustion in the crypto market during the 2021 bull run. Balance Sheet The overwhelming majority of assets on Coincheck's balance sheet are customer assets: Assets (Coincheck) As of the end of September 2024, Coincheck had total assets of 690.4 billion yen, 85% of which are safeguarded assets with an additional 7% made up of segregated deposits. The company has 10.6 billion yen in cash and equivalents against 1.4 billion in total non-current liabilities: Liabilities as of Sept 2024 (Coincheck) Coincheck also operates a lending and borrowing service with customers and discloses 35.6 billion yen in crypto assets held against the 35.5 billion yen in crypto borrowings. The safeguard assets are mainly Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) with the two coins accounting for 83% of safeguard assets: Safeguard assets breakout (Coincheck) XRP ( XRP-USD ) makes up another 10% of total safeguard assets. Meaning just 7% of the customer crypto assets that are held through Coincheck are assets other than BTC, ETH, and XRP. This says to me that in addition to lagging the broad crypto penetration observed in other jurisdictions, the Japan market seems to have very little appetite for cryptocurrencies outside of those that are near the top of the market capitalization list. Risks Observing CNCK through some basic valuation multiples, it's hard to make the argument that the company is 'cheap' at a $1.2 billion valuation. Coincheck's truest peer in the market is Coinbase. I've made no bones about my view that COIN stock is overvalued fundamentally in past SA articles. I still hold that view on COIN and CNCK is arguably even more expensive : Data by YCharts At 13 times book value, CNCK is trading at nearly double the valuation of COIN. At about a $1 billion in first half FY 2025 top line revenue, CNCK is trading at an annualized sales multiple of 6 - this is actually a bit cheaper than COIN but well beyond the 3x financial sector median. It's important to point out that since Coincheck operates in just one country, there is a considerable amount of jurisdiction risk at play in longing CNCK. First, there is currency risk in the yen. While the BOJ is expected to increase rates by 25 bps on January 24th, a 0.5% interest rate would be the highest short term rate in Japan since 2007. Higher rates from the BOJ could pose a risk to the broader market as well if last summer was any indication . Second, global insurgents could theoretically take share from Coincheck if the Japanese market were to ever sniff the interest in cryptocurrencies that it had back in 2021. Finally, Coincheck's user base is primarily buying BTC and ETH through the platform. If spot ETFs are approved in Japan, it could potentially diminish the need for Coincheck in the eyes of the company's user base. Closing Summary I think there are too many risks in longing CNCK. There is valuation risk, single jurisdiction risk, and market risk. Demand for crypto assets in Japan simply has not been as robust as it is in the rest of the world. Furthermore, the market demand for altcoins in Japan doesn't appear to be existent at all judging by Coincheck's balance sheet. With 93% of safeguard assets sitting in BTC, ETH, and XRP - Coincheck's customer does not go very far down the market cap list for digital asset exposure. I see very little switching cost for the consumer if BTC, ETH, and XRP are the only assets that have real market demand. And given the fact that Coincheck's marketing spend through the first half of 2024 was already outpacing revenue from on-boarded customers, I just don't have a lot of confidence in CNCK position at this point in time.",CNCK,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|ASIA|EXCHANGE|BTC,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-24 02:55:40

Crypto Exchange Phemex Suspends Withdrawals After Suspicious Transactions,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/30-million-hack-alert-crypto-exchange-phemex-suspends-withdrawals-after-suspicious-transactions/,"Crypto exchange Phemex appears to have been the victim of a multi-million exploit on Thursday, according to online reports. Millions worth of USDT, USDC, Ethereum (ETH), and other crypto assets were stolen from the exchange’s hot wallets, resulting in a temporary half of withdrawals. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) To $300 This Month? ‘All Bets Are Off’ Once It Reclaims This Level Phemex Suffers First Crypto Exchange Hack Of 2025 On Thursday morning, the first crypto exchange hack of the year hit the industry. Multiple reports revealed suspicious activity involving Phemex’s hot wallets was taking place over several chains. Blockchain security firm Cyvvers shared on X it had detected multiple transactions to several suspicious wallets on different chains, “including BNB, ETH, OP, POL, BASE, and ARB.” The security firm’s initial report stated that over $29 million worth of crypto had been transferred to the suspicious addresses, later raising the sum. “Upon deeper analysis, it has come to light that both BTC and TRON blockchains have also been impacted, with the estimated total loss now reaching approximately $37 million,” the update read. Cyvvers seemingly identified around 125 suspicious transactions spread across the different blockchains and noted that the attackers had started swapping the tokens to Ethereum (ETH) to avoid potential freezing measures. Meanwhile, on-chain data analysis firm Lookonchain broke down the crypto heist, stating that the hack had taken around $31 million worth of crypto assets. According to the analysis, 3.48 million USDC, 3.42 million USDT, and 841 ETH, worth $2.7 million were drained from the exchange’s hot wallet. Additionally, the attackers took 110,701 LINK, 142 billion PEPE, 1.19 million FET, and 29,509 AVAX, valued at around $7.3 million combined. Lookonchain also listed ONDO, TRX, CRV, JASMY, AAVE, SHIB, GRT, and BRETT, as part of the stolen crypto assets. Compensation Plan In The Works After the news, Phemex CEO Federico Variola confirmed the attack on one of the crypto exchange’s hot wallets. Variola assured users that Phemex’s cold wallets remained safe and that they were investigating the reports. The exchange then announced on X the temporary halt of withdrawals due to the emergency inspection and strengthening of the security measures but did not offer further details about the incident. To ensure security, withdrawals have been temporarily suspended while we conduct an emergency inspection and strengthen wallet services. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. Withdrawals will be restored soon. Phemex and the development team apologize for the disruption. Our mission to provide a seamless and trusted trading environment remains firm. Nonetheless, the post stated that ongoing business operations were fine and that trading services continued as usual. Phemex’s team also revealed they are working on a compensation plan, which will be announced soon. It’s worth noting that, in 2024, the number of hacks and total value lost increased from the year prior. According to Chainalysis data, 2024 was the fourth consecutive year in which the funds stolen from crypto hacks exceeded the billion-dollar mark. Related Reading: Number Of New Trump-Themed Malicious Tokens Spike 206% After Official Memecoin Launch Additionally, the total value stolen surged to $2.2 billion last year, and it became the year with the most individual hacks, reaching 303 incidents by December. Centralized exchanges (CEXs) were the most targeted platforms in Q2 and Q3, recording some of the largest incidents in the industry’s history, while Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms accounted for the largest share of stolen assets in Q1, like most quarters between 2021 and 2023.

In 2028, JASMY will range between $0.109 and $0.125, with an average price of $0.117. In 2031, JASMY will range between $0.188 and $0.204, with an average price of $0.196. JASMY aims to use the Internet of Things (IoT) platforms created to store data in a decentralized format. JasmyCoin (JASMY-USD) has quickly gained momentum in 2024, tripling in value and attracting significant interest from investors. Developed by former Sony executives, JasmyCoin offers a unique proposition allowing users to monetize their data. This innovative approach has resonated with investors seeking alternatives to traditional cryptocurrencies. Japanese law strictly governs cryptocurrency transactions subject to Financial Services Agency inspections. There are no restrictions on owning and investing in cryptocurrencies. Some crypto influencers also criticize the project. According to Jerry Banfield’s review on YouTube, red flags include a poor website and zero mentions of the coin utility on the website.

These community-driven projects have taken the world by storm, transforming from internet jokes to billion-dollar assets. For adventurous investors, meme coins represent both high-risk and high-reward opportunities, making them one of the most exciting niches in the crypto ecosystem. This week, one meme coin is rising above the noise: BTFD Coin . With its promising features like staking rewards and a strong community, it’s emerging as a serious contender in the crypto space. As we dive deeper, we’ll also take a look at two iconic players in the meme coin world—Dogecoin and Shiba Inu—to see how they compare to this up-and-coming gem. BTFD Coin: The Staking Dynamo with 90% APY BTFD Coin, short for “Buy The Dip,” is grabbing headlines as one of the top meme coins to invest in right now. It’s not just the name that’s catchy; the coin brings serious features to the table, making it a standout in a crowded market. With a focus on passive income through staking, BTFD Coin offers investors an unparalleled opportunity to grow their portfolio while holding their coins. What truly sets BTFD Coin apart is its staking feature, which boasts a jaw-dropping 90% annual percentage yield (APY). For those new to staking, this means your coins earn you additional rewards just for holding them in the network. It’s the kind of innovative approach that appeals to both seasoned investors and crypto newcomers looking for long-term returns. The project doesn’t stop there. BTFD Coin also boasts a vibrant community, complete with unique characters like Baby Bull and Raging Bull that add a playful yet engaging twist to the project. The coin’s Play-to-Earn (P2E) game further deepens its ecosystem, rewarding players while promoting a fun and interactive environment. Now, let’s talk numbers. BTFD Coin is in its 14th presale stage, with over $5.5 million raised and more than 66 billion coins sold. With a presale price of $0.00016, early investors stand to gain significantly once the coin launches. If BTFD Coin achieves its post-launch target of $0.0006, a $1,000 investment today could turn into $3,750. And if it reaches $0.006 in the long run, you’d be looking at a staggering $37,500—truly cementing its place among the top meme coins to invest in. Dogecoin: The OG Meme Coin That Keeps Delivering When it comes to meme coins, Dogecoin is the undeniable pioneer. What started as a lighthearted joke in 2013 has since evolved into a household name, supported by a devoted community and endorsements from influential figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin’s simplicity and accessibility have always been its strength. It’s widely used for tipping, donations, and even as a payment method at select retailers. While its use cases might not be as expansive as newer tokens, its reputation as the “original” meme coin keeps it relevant in the ever-changing crypto world. In recent months, Dogecoin has seen renewed interest, partly due to institutional support and its potential use in real-world applications like Tesla’s rumored payment integrations. For investors, its long history and strong market capitalization make it a relatively stable choice in the volatile meme coin market. Though it may lack the explosive growth potential of newer coins like BTFD, Dogecoin remains a must-have for anyone exploring the top meme coins to invest in. Shiba Inu: From Meme to Multi-Utility Powerhouse Shiba Inu, often dubbed the “Dogecoin killer,” has built a reputation as one of the most ambitious meme coins in the market. Launched in 2020, Shiba Inu has evolved from being a simple meme token to an ecosystem that includes decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, a native decentralized exchange (ShibaSwap), and its very own metaverse project. One of Shiba Inu’s biggest draws is its robust tokenomics, including a deflationary burn mechanism that reduces the supply over time. This strategy not only supports price growth but also aligns with long-term investor interests. Its ever-growing community, known as the Shib Army, has been instrumental in driving adoption and building excitement around the project. Recent developments, like the launch of the Shibarium Layer-2 solution, aim to lower transaction costs and make the network more scalable. These advancements put Shiba Inu in a unique position to compete with larger blockchain platforms while maintaining its meme coin charm. If you’re searching for a meme coin with utility and growth potential, Shiba Inu deserves a spot in your portfolio of top meme coins to invest in. Conclusion: BTFD Coin Leads the Pack Meme coins offer a thrilling mix of innovation, community, and potential returns, and this week’s lineup is no exception. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu hold their own as industry heavyweights, BTFD Coin emerges as the top pick for investors seeking something fresh and rewarding. Its 90% APY staking feature, engaging ecosystem, and impressive presale performance make it a standout choice among the top meme coins to invest in this week . With the clock ticking on its presale, now is the perfect time to secure your position in BTFD Coin before the price climbs higher. Whether you’re looking for a stable veteran like Dogecoin, a multi-utility project like Shiba Inu, or the next big thing in meme coins, the opportunities are endless. Happy investing!

There are ongoing discussions among crypto traders about the possibility that the Nollars Network will play a significant role in the upcoming payment system called “Money,” which is being developed for the X social media platform (formerly known as Twitter) by Elon Musk. When will the X payment system ‘MONEY’ Launch? The launch of the MONEY application is anticipated to take place sometime in 2025, and it is expected that Dogecoin (DOGE), the original memecoin, will be a primary cryptocurrency option within this system. Analysts predict that Dogecoin’s value could rise significantly, potentially exceeding $1 from its current price of 36 cents by the time “MONEY” launches. Speculation suggests that the upcoming Nollars Network IES Layer-2 blockchain may influence how Dogecoin is utilized within the X platform. There are several reasons behind this speculation, largely tied to Elon Musk’s rationale for choosing Dogecoin. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin is not a deflationary currency, and its larger token supply makes it psychologically more appealing for transactions. Additionally, Dogecoin operates on its own blockchain, which facilitates fast transactions and app development. However, one limitation of Dogecoin is its lack of cross-chain capabilities. This is where the Nollars Network (NOLA) is thought to make a significant contribution. How Nollars will help The upcoming blockchain aims to address this gap by providing a solution through its IES (Ineffable Exchange System) Layer 2 technology. This will serve as the foundational layer for a future project designed to enable multi-blockchain swaps of memecoins. The Nollars Network’s mainnet is expected to be the core of various decentralized applications, facilitating quicker and more cost-effective transactions for Dogecoin compared to traditional crypto exchanges. The $NOLA token is critical in facilitating these transactions and has seen increasing interest during its presale phase. Notably, large investors in the crypto space have been acquiring substantial amounts of NOLA tokens, suggesting that these informed investors may anticipate significant news forthcoming about the project. So far, 11 investors have purchased sizable amounts of NOLA, reflecting strong support for the ecosystem. Additionally, smaller investors, often referred to as “crypto shrimp and crabs,” have been consistently dollar cost averaging (DCA) into the project. The presale currently offers the $NOLA token at a discounted price of $0.50, presenting a potential profit opportunity for investors. The token is confirmed to launch on crypto exchanges in May at a listing price that is projected to be 66% higher than its initial offering, at 83 cents. The Money application on X is rumored to go live within the second to third quarters of this year, further contributing to speculation that Dogecoin will be the primary choice for peer-to-peer payments within this new ecosystem.",Information,EN,0,0,DOGE|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-24 03:39:04

The bulletin, which mandated that companies holding cryptocurrencies on behalf of clients record these assets as liabilities, was replaced with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 122, signalling a shift in regulatory policy.

It’s not been fun: SEC.gov | Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 122 4:26 am · 24 Jan 2025 10.4K Reply Copy link Read 772 replies Under the updated framework, companies will assess their obligations to safeguard crypto-assets using broader accounting standards, including US GAAP contingency rules and IFRS guidelines. The revisions apply retroactively to fiscal years starting after December 15, 2024, with provisions for early adoption. The withdrawal of SAB 121 comes amid several leadership changes at the SEC. Republican Commissioner Mark Uyeda has assumed the role of acting chair, while a new crypto task force led by Hester Peirce has been established to develop clearer regulatory frameworks. In a statement, the SEC acknowledged the criticisms of its prior enforcement-heavy approach to crypto regulation, describing it as a source of uncertainty. The new task force aims to introduce clarity and practical compliance solutions for the industry. Criticism of the SAB 121 Since its release, SAB 121 faced widespread criticism from the crypto industry, lawmakers, and financial institutions. Opponents argued that the guidance increased compliance costs, deterred banks from offering digital asset custody services, and lacked adequate public consultation. The banking sector voiced concerns that SAB 121 impeded their ability to act as custodians for digital assets, while crypto advocates and lawmakers saw it as a move specifically targeting the digital asset industry. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce described the rule as overly rigid and an obstacle to innovation. Gary Gensler, the former SEC chair who supported the rule, defended it as a necessary measure to protect investors in bankruptcy scenarios, citing cases where customer cryptocurrency assets were not shielded from creditors. However, efforts to repeal SAB 121 in 2024, including a bipartisan resolution passed by Congress, were vetoed by then-President Joe Biden. Reactions to the repeal of SAB 121 The removal of SAB 121 has been welcomed by the crypto industry and financial institutions as a step toward reducing regulatory burdens and fostering innovation. Paige Pidano Paridon, co-head of the Bank Policy Institute’s regulatory affairs, praised the decision, noting that it would enable banks to securely manage digital assets. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a pro-crypto Republican and chair of the Senate’s digital assets subcommittee, called the rule “disastrous” and celebrated its repeal.

Musk Buys XRP (MUSKXRP), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKXRP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Buys XRP can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Buys XRP could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Buys XRP launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Buys XRP on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Buys XRP by entering its contract address – FVAvgfVYwkgDkDhuKZ4Js41d64LHUsbMRoVzCyJUExtq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKXRP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|XRP|BUSINESS|DOGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-24 03:49:08

Tokens like TON and Kaspa have shown strong performance in their respective niches, but Web3Bay (3BAY) is emerging as the utility token with the most potential to dominate the market in 2025. With a presale that has already raised over $870,000 and sold more than 225 million tokens, Web3Bay offers a compelling mix of utility, scalability, and ROI potential that makes it stand out.Let’s dive into how utility coins have fared well in the past, why TON and Kaspa are impressive but limited in scope, and why Web3Bay is the token smart investors should be focusing on now. Utility Coins: Proven Winners in Crypto History shows that utility tokens tied to platforms with real-world use cases often see exponential growth in market capitalization. Take Binance Coin (BNB) as an example. Initially launched as a utility token for discounted trading fees on the Binance exchange, BNB expanded its ecosystem to include staking, payments, and even NFTs. This broad utility turned BNB into a top cryptocurrency, with a market cap in the hundreds of billions. Similarly, Ethereum (ETH) transitioned from being a speculative investment to a cornerstone of decentralized applications and smart contracts, driving its value to historic highs. These examples prove that utility tokens offering practical solutions tend to outperform speculative coins over the long term. Web3Bay is poised to follow this trajectory, combining blockchain technology with a decentralized e-commerce platform to create tangible value for users. TON: Telegram’s Token Makes Waves, But With Limits TON (The Open Network) has made headlines as the cryptocurrency associated with Telegram. Its focus on speed and scalability has earned it a loyal following, with features designed to support payments, decentralized applications, and financial services within the Telegram ecosystem. TON’s integration with a massive user base gives it a unique advantage, but its use case remains tightly linked to Telegram, limiting its broader applicability. For investors, this raises a concern: can TON’s utility grow beyond Telegram’s ecosystem? While TON excels at what it does, its reliance on a single platform could restrict its growth in comparison to more versatile tokens like Web3Bay. Web3Bay’s utility extends far beyond a single ecosystem. It addresses global challenges in e-commerce by providing a decentralized marketplace where buyers and sellers can transact without high fees or centralized intermediaries. Kaspa: Fast and Secure, but Niche Kaspa (KAS) has gained attention for its innovative BlockDAG technology, which enables fast and secure transactions with high throughput. It’s particularly appealing to blockchain purists who value efficiency and decentralization. Over the past year, Kaspa has seen significant price growth, reflecting strong market interest in its unique technical approach. However, Kaspa’s utility is primarily focused on being a fast transactional layer, making it highly niche. While Kaspa excels in its core functionality, it lacks the multi-faceted utility that platforms like Web3Bay bring to the table. Web3Bay’s roadmap includes an NFT marketplace, staking rewards, cross-chain compatibility, and decentralized governance. Web3Bay: The Utility Token with Massive ROI Potential Web3Bay combines utility with profitability, making it the ultimate utility token for 2025. Currently priced at $0.004562625 in its fourth presale stage, 3BAY tokens are projected to launch at $0.1959, offering early investors an astounding 6,430% ROI. Compare this to the performance of TON or Kaspa, which have seen gains but lack the scalability and market scope of Web3Bay. Web3Bay’s decentralized e-commerce platform eliminates high fees, enables borderless transactions, and provides users with governance rights through its DAO. For small businesses in developing regions, this is a game-changer, allowing them to reach global markets without the barriers imposed by centralized systems. Let’s consider a scenario: An early investor purchases $1,000 worth of 3BAY tokens at the current presale price. By the time the token hits its launch price, that investment could grow to $42,939. This isn’t just speculation—it’s backed by the platform’s real-world utility and growing adoption. Best Utility Tokens To Keep In Your Watchlist Smart investors know that best utility tokens with broad applications and growing ecosystems are the long-term bets. While TON and Kaspa have their merits, Web3Bay offers unmatched potential for growth and profitability. With $870,000 raised in its presale and a 6,430% ROI on the horizon, Web3Bay is the kind of investment opportunity that doesn’t come around often. Don’t miss your chance to secure 3BAY tokens and be part of a platform that’s reshaping the global economy.

Among the standout contenders is PropiChain , a project rapidly gaining recognition for its real-world applications and massive growth potential. PropiChain and two other emerging AI altcoins are set to redefine blockchain innovation. These tokens aren’t just buzzworthy; they’re built to solve real-world problems while offering investors unprecedented opportunities. In this article, we uncover the top three best AI altcoins for 2025, that could offer explosive 50,000% returns as they break into the mainstream market. Why Dogecoin and Solana Are Facing Stiff Competition from the Best AI Altcoins in 2025 Dogecoin and Solana have dominated the crypto space, but the AI altcoin revolution is quickly changing the game. While Dogecoin’s meme-driven appeal and Solana’s scalability have earned them loyal followings, they’re no match for the potential of the best AI altcoins. These AI tokens integrate blockchain with intelligent solutions, opening up new frontiers that Dogecoin and Solana can’t compete with. As the best AI altcoins market explodes in 2025, investors are focusing on these innovative projects, expecting up to 50,000% returns that far surpass anything Dogecoin or Solana can offer. PropiChain and How Its AI Features Make It Stand Out Among The Best AI Altcoins in 2025 PropiChain stands out as one of the best AI altcoins, transforming the real estate sector through its innovative use of AI and DeFi technologies. The platform aims to address critical issues like inefficiencies, high transaction costs, and fraud, setting a new standard for property investments. One of PropiChain’s key features is its smart contract architecture, which is designed to streamline complex real estate transactions. These smart contracts securely manage legal agreements, KYC processes, and sensitive information, ensuring transparency and legal compliance. AI is central to PropiChain’s capabilities. Through its Automated Valuation Model, PropiChain offers predictive market insights and accurate property valuations.

Additionally, PropiChain embraces the metaverse to enhance property exploration, allowing users to virtually tour, stage, and meet in the digital space. This removes geographical barriers, making international property transactions easier and more efficient without needing physical realtors. Through these features, PropiChain is poised to reshape the future of real estate investments, distinguishing itself as a powerful force among the best AI altcoins in the market. NeuroNet AI: Merging AI with Decentralized Data on the Blockchain NeuroNet AI is rapidly emerging as one of the best AI altcoins. It integrates artificial intelligence with decentralized data to create a platform that disrupts industries like healthcare and finance. Like other best AI altcoins, NeuroNet AI is engineered to provide real-time data insights while maintaining user privacy, a key advantage in today’s data-driven world. As investors eye Solana’s potential, NeuroNet AI stands out as a prime contender, thanks to its upcoming partnerships and significant advancements in AI technology. These developments solidify its place as one of the best AI altcoins to watch for in 2025. Given its innovative approach to AI and blockchain, NeuroNet AI is positioned to reshape the landscape of decentralized applications, making it one of the most promising AI altcoins on the market. Synapse Intelligence: Enhancing Smart Contracts for Decentralized Applications with AI Synapse Intelligence is quickly rising as one of the best AI altcoins, making waves in the crypto world ahead of the anticipated Solana bull run. This decentralized platform uses AI to elevate the functionality of smart contracts, offering a unique edge over other altcoins like Dogecoin. What sets Synapse Intelligence apart from other AI altcoins is its ability to integrate real-time data inputs into self-executing contracts, optimizing outcomes across various decentralized applications. Crypto analysts are confident that Synapse Intelligence will gain significant momentum, particularly before the expected Trump-backed Solana bull run in 2025, positioning early investors for substantial rewards. Why PropiChain Presale is Taking The Lead as the Best AI Altcoin for 2025 PropiChain is emerging as one of the best AI altcoins for 2025 and beyond. As its presale moves from round 2, the altcoin is expected to surge by 108.9%. Currently priced at an all-time low of $0.011, PropiChain is forecasted to rise by 800% at the listing, with analysts predicting a $3 valuation by Q1 2025. The project is also safe to trade on as its smart contracts have been audited by BlockAudit , a security blockchain firm.

Deaton Explores Three Possible Outcomes of SEC Legal Battle appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The ongoing legal battle between the SEC and Ripple Labs has been one of the most closely watched cases in the cryptocurrency world. As the case continues to develop, experts and industry insiders are speculating about the possible outcomes and their broader implications for the future of crypto regulation in the United States. In an interview with Thinking Crypto, Crypto supporter, attorney and founder of Crypto Law John Deaton weighed in on this matter and opened up about three scenarios The Appeal Continues One of the paths for the SEC vs Ripple case is that the appeal process could continue. This would involve the SEC pressing on with its stance that XRP is a security, a position they have long maintained. While Ripple has repeatedly contested this view, an extended appeal could result in a drawn-out legal battle that would keep uncertainty hanging over the crypto industry. The SEC Dismisses the Appeal and Ripple Settles A more plausible scenario is that the SEC ultimately dismisses the appeal and Ripple settles the case by paying the $125 million fine that was issued by the court. This outcome would bring some closure to the case and provide clearer guidance on the status of XRP. This is the most likely scenario, especially considering the current political climate, with President Trump announcing his vision of making the U.S. the “crypto capital of the world.” The SEC Drops the Appeal and Shifts Focus Another possibility is that the SEC drops the appeal entirely and does not enforce the $125 million fine. In this case, Ripple would be free to continue its operations without the looming threat of legal action. With leaders like David Sacks serving as the White House’s AI and Crypto Czar, the U.S. government might seek to create a more favorable regulatory environment that encourages innovation rather than stifling it.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-24 04:03:39

The price is now correcting gains and might find bids near the $3.00 level. XRP price started a downside correction from the $3.250 zone. The price is now trading below $3.150 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3.10 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start a fresh increase if it stays above the $3.00 support. XRP Price Dips To Support XRP price managed to start a fresh increase from the $3.050 support zone, but upsides were limited compared to Bitcoin . The price was able to surpass the $3.150 level before the bears appeared. A high was formed at $3.25 and the price corrected all gains. A low was formed at $3.035 and the price is now consolidating below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.285 swing high to the $3.035 low. The price is now trading below $3.15 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $3.10 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3.10 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $3.160 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.285 swing high to the $3.035 low. The next resistance is $3.20. A clear move above the $3.20 resistance might send the price toward the $3.250 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.350 resistance or even $3.3650 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $3.450. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $3.10 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3.050 level. The next major support is near the $3.00 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $3.00 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.880 support. The next major support sits near the $2.750 zone.

Analyzing Justin Sun’s Confidence Through $TRUMP,https://square.htx.com/trade-new-cryptos-only-on-htx-analyzing-justin-suns-confidence-through-trump/,"On January 17, a tweet by Justin Sun generated significant buzz within the crypto community. “Trade new cryptos only on HTX!” This bold claim in the highly competitive centralized exchange industry, was swiftly validated by HTX’s actions. Just one day later, on January 18, the launch of the official meme coin of U.S. President Donald Trump, $TRUMP, ignited the crypto market. Demonstrating its agility, HTX quickly listed $TRUMP for spot and grid trading in around seven hours after the coin’s release, outpacing most major exchanges. This early mover advantage allowed HTX users capitalize on the coin’s surge – $TRUMP experienced a staggering 1,250% increase within an hour, catapulting it into the limelight and dominating social media discourse. As a result, user interest in HTX soared, with many inquiring about download and sign up processes. HTX undeniably became the epicenter of the $TRUMP frenzy. HTX immediately expanded its $TRUMP offerings, introducing margin and perpetual futures trading after spot trading. A series of $TRUMP trading contests, including a Futures Trading Carnival with doubled rewards, were launched to maximize user benefits and enhance their trading experience. The rapid listing of $TRUMP exemplifies HTX’s consistent approach. Throughout 2024, a period marked by the rise of diverse sectors and countless success stories, HTX consistently positioned itself at the forefront. Solana meme coins, the RWA sector, election-themed coins, TRON-based meme coins, the expanding TON ecosystem, revived NFT projects, and emerging DeSci and AI Agent sectors all witnessed early HTX listings. Crypto gems like $WIF, $BOME, $SUNDOG, $NEIROCTO, and $ACTSOL, initially listed on HTX, stand testament to the platform’s ability to identify and list high-quality projects. For trending cryptos, HTX offers a comprehensive suite of services beyond spot, futures, and margin trading. High-return Earn products, mining events, and rewarding trading contests further enhance user profitability. At the same time, HTX Live, HTX Learn, and HTX Square provide valuable educational resources to deepen user understanding of market dynamics and refine investment strategies. By combining early trading opportunities, diverse activities, and robust educational support, HTX empowers users to maximize their returns when trading new cryptos. This comprehensive approach substantiates Justin Sun’s claim that “Trade new cryptos only on HTX,” a sentiment echoed by user comments such as, “HTX’s been impressive lately, and almost every new crypto is multiplying in value” and “HTX is definitely the best at meeting user needs.” Justin Sun’s enduring dedication to cryptocurrency innovation, coupled with HTX’s 11-year operational history and proven ability to navigate both bull and bear markets, sets them apart in the industry. HTX has garnered a stellar reputation for its user-centric approach. As we enter 2025, HTX’s asset listing team continues its momentum. Recent additions like $BIO, $XTER, $AVAAI, and $BUZZ have already demonstrated significant growth potential. Under Justin Sun’s leadership and driven by a sharp eye for crypto selection, rapid listings, and a top-notch user experience, HTX is well on its way to making “Trade new cryptos only on HTX” a reality for a growing number of traders.

The organization argues that a prior decision by the District Court for the Southern District of New York undermines investor protections. Ripple’s Victory Under Scrutiny In its brief , Better Markets claims that XRP qualifies as a security. The non-profit also asserted that the district court’s ruling weakened the Howey test, a cornerstone of U.S. securities laws, by narrowing the definition of “investment contracts.” According to the organization, the court excluded many crypto transactions from regulations, potentially exposing investors to fraud. It claims that retail traders are at risk since the SEC now has a diminished capacity to protect less sophisticated investors from fraudulent schemes because of the court’s interpretation of the law. Ripple won a partial victory against the SEC in a case the regulator brought against it, alleging the payments platform conducted an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP. In that ruling, District Judge Analisa Torres declared the token was not a security when sold to retail investors on crypto exchanges. However, she found it violated securities laws when offered to institutional investors. Legal Expert Dismisses Better Markets’ Action Better Markets’ move comes just a week after the SEC formally appealed against Judge Torres’ ruling, asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to overturn it. While the agency called the judge’s decision “factually and legally” wrong, Ripple’s top attorney, Stuart Alderoty, described the appeal as “a rehash of already failed arguments.” The brief has sparked reactions from legal experts and the crypto community at large. Some have pointed out ties between the Better Markets CEO Denis Kelleher and the Biden administration, where he was part of the transition team, alleging bias. Lawyer Jeremy Hogan has criticized the organization’s argument as lacking substance and failing to engage with the court’s finding. “Better Market’s Amicus Brief was hard to read. Not because I don’t think this case will ever be ruled on by the appellate court, but because it COMPLETELY misses (or misconstrues?) what the Trial Judge ruled,” he said.

While Bitcoin (BTC) price traded above the $104K level on Friday, leading altcoins have shown mixed actions. Notably, Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) traded in the green zone, whereas XRP and meme coins like DOGE traded in the red. Simultaneously, the global crypto market cap witnessed a marginal 0.11% fall over the past day, reaching $3.54 trillion as of press time. However, the total market volume witnessed a notable 40% uptick from yesterday, reaching $202.98 billion. Here’s a brief report on some of the most renowned cryptocurrencies and their price action on January 24. Crypto Prices Today: Bitcoin & Altcoins Flag Mixed Signals Notably, BTC and top alts such as Ether and SOL have traded in the green, gaining 1%-3% intraday. However, XRP and meme coins such as DOGE and Shiba Inu have lost nearly 2% in value. Overall, the mixed price movements underscored a highly volatile trend currently prevailing across the broader crypto sector, with market watchers cautious over future price movements. Bitcoin Price Today At $104K BTC price recorded gains worth 1% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $104,088. The flagship crypto’s 24-hour low and high were $101,257.80 and $106,820.33, respectively. Notably, BTC price traded in the green alongside soaring optimism in light of heightened market interest in the asset. CoinGape reported that Semler Scientific revealed a $75M convertible notes offering in an effort to expand its Bitcoin strategy. However, top crypto analyst Ali Martinez has recently posted on X , spotlighting immense greed taking over the Bitcoin market. Altogether, the current market stats have sparked uncertain speculations over the asset’s future trajectory. Ethereum Price Today Up 2% ETH price chart illustrated a 2% surge in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $3,299. The cryptocurrency’s intraday low and high were registered as $3,184.07 and $3,347.66, respectively. A recent ETH price analysis by CoinGape reveals that the token struggles to surpass the $3,500 mark amid severe market concerns prevailing in light of the Ethereum Foundation’s selloffs. Market watchers continue to eye short-term volatility amid these selloffs, driven by uncertain investor sentiments. XRP Price Today Slips 1% XRP price also showcased a waning movement, falling nearly 1% in the past 24 hours to $3.12. The token’s broader chart showcases a period of sideways trading, with the intraday low and high being $3.04 and $3.17, respectively. Despite the recent slumping action, a recent XRP price analysis by CoinGape revealed that the crypto eyes a $5 price target in the wake of bullish market dynamics. Intriguingly, the coin’s potential upside includes a stockpile of catalysts, encompassing a potential Ripple ETF approval, XRP futures launch by CME, and RLUSD adoption. Solna Price Today Rides Rollercoaster SOL price chart indicated a highly turbulent movement, with the asset hovering in both red and green territories intraday. As of press time, SOL price gained nearly 1.5% and is sitting at $252.63. The coin’s intraday low and high were $242.50 and $257.43, respectively. A recent SOL price analysis by CoinGape revealed that the token could potentially rally to $300 ahead, given the market sees a Solana ETF approval. Meme Crypto Prices Today Simultaneously, DOGE price waned by 1% in the past 24 hours to reach $0.3483. Further, even SHIB price tanked nearly 2% intraday, reaching $0.00001978. The TRUMP token also followed, crashing 11% and standing at $33.09. Overall, the broader meme coin sector has seen remarkable volatility in the past 24 hours. Top Crypto Gainer Prices Today Mantle (MNT) Price: $1.17 24-hour Gain: +10% Ethereum Classic (ETC) Price: $27.14 24-hour Gain: +3% Jupiter (JUP) Price: $0.7976 24-hour Gain: +3% KuCoin Token (KCS) Price: $12.16 24-hour Gain: +6% Top Crypto Loser Prices Today ai16z (AI16Z) Price: $0.8148 24-hour Loss: -14% Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) Price: $1.23 24-hour Loss: -14% THORChain (RUNE) Price: $2.78 24-hour Loss: -11% XDC Network (XDC) Price: $0.1112 24-hour Loss: -10% Despite the current price turbulence, broader sentiments surrounding crypto prices’ future appear to be optimistic. MicroStrategy lead Michael Saylor has recently posted on X , stating, “The Crypto Renaissance has officially begun.” This statement has sparked considerable bullishness, coming against the backdrop of Donald Trump’s recent pro-crypto movers, including the recent rescinding of SAB 121 .

Trump Bitcoin MAGA (MAGABTC), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MAGABTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump Bitcoin MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Bitcoin MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Bitcoin MAGA launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Bitcoin MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Bitcoin MAGA by entering its contract address – 3J7GkdTfz7sHdcKcMnD5fm1aDZZUktz7z8NqTdiacLTy – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MAGABTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|BTC|SOL|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-24 04:46:00

This move is being hailed as incredibly bullish, as it opens the door for banks to offer crypto custody, buy and sell digital assets, and provide related services to clients. SAB 121 had required banks to treat crypto as a liability on their balance sheets, making it difficult for them to engage with crypto assets. With the rescindment, banks are now free to offer a range of crypto services, including custody and trading, without the same restrictions. This decision comes after growing pressure from major financial institutions, with CEOs from Bank of America, State Street, and other banks calling for clearer regulations to allow them to enter the crypto space. Many view this as a step towards making the U.S. a global leader in digital assets. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a strong advocate for crypto innovation, celebrated the repeal of SAB 121, calling it a victory for American innovation and the digital asset industry. With new leadership like Lummis heading the Senate’s Digital Asset Subcommittee, there is hope that further pro-crypto legislation will follow.

In a bulletin issued on Jan. 23, the SEC announced that Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 122 officially rescinds SAB 121, a policy introduced in March 2022 that faced significant pushback from the crypto industry. SAB 121 had drawn criticism for its cumbersome reporting requirements, with industry leaders arguing it made custody of digital assets unnecessarily complicated. The rule’s removal was met with relief, as highlighted by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce’s celebratory Jan. 23 post on X: “Bye, bye SAB 121! It’s not been fun.” Bye, bye SAB 121!

A day after Donald Trump signed into his second term as President, he appointed SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda as interim SEC chair . Uyeda commented last October on how SEC’s take under Gary Gensler was nothing short of a disaster . Interestingly, Cornerstone Research reported on Jan. 23 that the SEC under Gary Gensler initiated just 33 actions involving cryptocurrencies in his final year as SEC chairman — down from 47 in the year prior, which saw the largest amount of enforcement activity. Last year, the SEC sued 90 bitcoin defendants or respondents, comprising 57 persons and 33 companies. What SAB 121 repeal means for the crypto community ? SAB 121 revocation by the SEC will serve the common by enabling custodians for Bitcoin ( BTC ) through regulated banks and financial institutions. This shift could also improve security and trust, providing a more secure alternative for those new to self-custody or cryptocurrency wallets. It could also spur greater adoption, as users may find it easier to interface with crypto through trusted institutions. Some people, like children and the elderly, need custodians. Others want smooth inheritance transfers and others want loans using their BTC in custody as collateral. BTC is freedom money and you can interact with it anyway you want. — Carl Horton (@Carl_W_Horton) January 24, 2025 Moreover, institutional custody also helps mitigate the risk of losing private keys and provides improved financial inclusion for people who are not able to create secure digital wallets. This revocation can instill confidence and even greater participation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem as regulatory clarity born from it continues.

He adds that the BTC community is homing in on the news that banks can now hold BTC, even though SAB 121 doesn’t actually mention BTC at all. Satoshi Nakamoto stated at the time that the goal of the original BTC protocol was to eliminate the need for third-party control, says Jacob.

The Explosive Rise of TRUMP Coin vs. Doge Uprising— Why Doge Uprising is the One You Need to Watch appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, it’s easy to get swept up in the latest hype wave. And boy, did TRUMP Coin make a splash. The meme coin with a rather… Unmistakable branding stormed into the market like a proverbial wrecking ball, sending some crypto wallets into an overdrive of excitement. TRUMP Coin shot up faster than an impromptu tweet from the man himself, creating a tidal wave of short-term gains. But before you get too cozy in your newly minted TRUMP Coin positions, let’s talk about the next big contender for meme coin supremacy— Doge Uprising TRUMP Coin: Short-Term Spark, Long-Term Questions It’s no secret that the crypto market thrives on headlines, and what better way to grab attention than with the most talked-about figure in global politics? Enter TRUMP Coin, a meme coin launched under the banner of nostalgia, hype, and—let’s be honest—pure marketing genius. From a modest start, the coin surged by more than 300% in a matter of hours, creating waves across crypto forums and social media feeds. And while the price action looks promising on paper (or in this case, digital wallets) the long-term viability of TRUMP Coin is still in question. Sure, it might make for a fun speculative asset in the short term, but when the dust settles, the real question is whether the hype will fizzle out as quickly as it arrived. Doge Uprising: A Presale Worth Watching Now, let’s talk about the coin that’s quietly making waves and could be the real heavyweight in the meme coin ring: Doge Uprising. Unlike TRUMP Coin, which is, let’s face it, more about name recognition than substance, Doge Uprising is building something that could outlast the latest viral trends. With the third presale stage underway, investors are flocking to Doge Uprising at an increasing pace, and for good reason: the price is skyrocketing, and it’s not showing signs of slowing down anytime soon. Why Doge Uprising Is Gaining Traction Doge Uprising brings a fresh perspective to the meme coin market. Sure, it has the meme factor—who doesn’t love a good dog-themed coin?—but Doge Uprising is also positioning itself to be more than just a fleeting trend. The ongoing presale has created a sense of urgency among early investors, as the price continues to rise with each stage of the presale. This isn’t a coin that’s going to fizzle out after a quick burst of hype. But the key factor? The opportunity to get in early. With the presale currently on fire, the next few weeks could be a pivotal moment for Doge Uprising. If you’re waiting to get in, you might find yourself paying a lot more for a piece of the action down the road. If you’ve learned anything from the explosive rise of TRUMP Coin, you know that timing is everything. Why Doge Uprising Could Be the Better Bet While TRUMP Coin has capitalized on short-term attention, Doge Uprising has quietly been making moves that signal its ability to outperform the competition. Unlike TRUMP Coin, which is reliant on its political branding, Doge Uprising is building momentum on its community-first mentality and ongoing presale hype. Doge Uprising could easily make it the next big thing in the crypto market. If you’re serious about making a smart investment, Doge Uprising’s presale is a no-brainer. You’ll be part of a growing community and the upward trajectory of the price is already a clear indicator that this coin is ready to take off. The Bottom Line Sure, TRUMP Coin might have made an explosive entrance into the market, but the real money might be in Doge Uprising. With its presale gaining momentum and a clear focus on community and long-term viability, Doge Uprising is set to become one of the meme coin giants of 2025 and beyond.

Many are pointing to the creators of Baby Doge , one of the most successful meme coins, as the masterminds behind DogevsPepe. The theory isn’t baseless.

It raises questions about just how far-reaching DogevsPepe’s plans could be and how prepared the team is to deliver a breakout success. The Crypto Community Is Talking Across Telegram, Discord, and online forums, DogevsPepe has become a hot topic. Crypto enthusiasts are speculating about the project’s potential mechanics, with some theorizing that it could involve a competitive rivalry between Doge and Pepe fans.

It delivered record-breaking performance across key metrics, saw $TRX hit all-time highs, and experienced a surge in ecosystem activity driven by memecoin launches. Let’s break it all down. Key Highlights TRON led in the Price-to-Revenue ratio , maintaining a top-three position throughout the period. Fundamental blockchain metrics demonstrated TRON’s strength and competitiveness. A successful “vampire attack” on Solana drew significant attention to the TRON ecosystem. $TRX Reaches a New All-Time High The native token of the TRON blockchain achieved remarkable growth in early December, setting a new all-time high at $0.416. As of early 2025, the token’s price has adjusted to $0.225. At this price level, 94% of wallets holding $TRX are in profit. Historically, $TRX has displayed consistent upward price momentum. The token’s value generally increases over time, with major price drops occurring only after exponential growth cycles, which generally happens every four years.

Highlighting Ripple’s support for President Donald Trump’s administration, King suggests that Ripple’s actions are part of a broader effort to secure regulatory clarity and position XRP as a key player in global finance. Trump's inauguration raised over $200,000,000 breaking all prior records. Ripple donated 500% more than crypto industry peers like Coinbase and Kraken. As a former Ripple employee, here is my take on their strategy and how it will affect $XRP : pic.twitter.com/Oh3EPFRpoQ — Austin King (@0xASK) January 21, 2025 Ripple’s Support for Trump King noted Ripple’s significant financial contributions to Trump’s record-breaking inauguration, surpassing industry peers like Coinbase and Kraken. This financial backing highlights Ripple’s strategic alignment with the Trump administration, with King emphasizing that Ripple’s primary goal is regulatory clarity, not favoritism. King shared a clip of an interview where Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse echoed this sentiment. Garlinghouse listed regulatory clarity as one of three things the crypto market needs to thrive. Ripple has repeatedly called for updated regulatory frameworks to replace outdated laws like the existing securities laws from the 1940s which former SEC Chair Gary Gensler tried to enforce on cryptocurrencies. As Garlinghouse noted in another interview, “One of the biggest problems the crypto industry has had isn’t the idea there’s too much regulation. It’s just the regulation is not even clear.” Ripple’s Vision for XRP King highlighted the ambitious vision of Ripple’s founders, particularly Chris Larsen , who has a history of pioneering large-scale financial innovations. Larsen’s earlier ventures, such as E-Loan and Prosper, illustrate his long-standing focus on transforming financial systems. According to King, Ripple’s current payment focus is just the beginning. The ultimate objective is for Ripple to become a global settlement network capable of facilitating trillions of dollars in transactions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 King suggests that this vision is increasingly attainable under a regulatory framework supported by the Trump administration. This framework could position XRP as a core asset for banks and fintech, enabling them to manage assets and conduct transactions on the XRP Ledger. Additionally, King anticipates that competing blockchain networks, such as Ethereum and Solana, may need to adapt as XRP’s utility grows. Potential Growth for XRP King outlined several potential benefits for XRP if Ripple’s regulatory goals are achieved. First, he anticipates increased adoption of XRP by financial institutions to enhance asset management and transaction efficiency. Second, the XRP Ledger’s revenue model could expand significantly, shifting from a payments-centric focus to broader financial applications. King projects this could result in a 400x increase in revenue. Furthermore, King believes Ripple’s proactive regulatory efforts could cement the United States as a leader in the crypto industry. Garlinghouse previously noted that getting regulatory clarity will help the U.S. lead the crypto market, and this aligns with Trump’s goal to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world.

Here’s why experts predict astonishing 50x returns this year, based on Rollblock’s recent surge in adoption. Rollblock (RBLK) Holders Will See Community Rewards And Huge Growth Rollblock ( RBLK ) brings a completely new casino experience to the Web3 generation. Rollblock’s platform offers a massive selection of 7,000 table games, slot machines, and a sports betting mode that enables live betting across thousands of international sporting events. Recently, the platform has been witnessing extraordinary growth, as in December alone, Rollblock took in more than $1.75 million in wagered bets. This looks set to double in January as momentum remains high. Rollblock brings incredible levels of transparency to its user base by recording all transactions onto the Ethereum blockchain, allowing its gamers to verify that all transactions have been faithfully recorded. This alone is a massive game changer for this $500 billion industry and will help Rollblock to scale to enormous heights this year. Being fully Web3-based, all payouts are made in the native RBLK token. This offers huge benefits to its holders, including free spins, VIP access, and the potential to stake holdings for up to 30% in staking yield. This is thanks to the profit-sharing scheme that takes up to 30% of its operating profits to buy up RBLK on the open market. 60% of these tokens are immediately destroyed to bring down the circulating supply, while the remaining 40% fund the staking APY. With stage nine tokens already more than 70% sold, the current price of $0.047 will be heading upwards fast in the coming months, and many analysts predict a run to $1. Shiba Inu (SHIB) TREAT Launch Cannot Stem The Losses Shiba Inu developers recently launched the TREAT token, which aims to incentivize the use of the chain through on-chain rewards. It also aims to improve liquidity for the upcoming stablecoin SHI. TREAT launched on exchanges this week and has seen promising interest from Shiba Inu token holders. Despite this, Shiba Inu has fallen by 10% today to hit $0.00002. In the past month Shiba Inu holders are down by 12% as selling pressure has been especially fierce. Pepe (PEPE) In A Rut Following Musk Pump Pepe has fallen by 2.8% over the last day of trading to reach $0.0000152. Pepe rallied hard earlier this month when the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, adopted a Pepe meme as his X profile picture. Pepe was the talk of TradFi, and its token price surged by more than 30%. However, since then, the Pepe rally has stalled, and Pepe holders have watched in dismay as their portfolios have dropped by 16% in just a week. Pepe now needs buyers to step in with size in order to reclaim its former bullish momentum. Rollblock On Its Way To A Dollar In 2025 The volatility of meme coins such as Pepe and Shiba Inu has led many holders to jump ship into projects with more utility. Rollblock ($RBLK) is seen by many as a safe haven thanks to its massive potential to disrupt the gaming space. December’s growth is just the start—many analysts have set their sights on a $1 RBLK price this year, making the current price of $0.047 an opportunity not to be missed.

She urged federal regulators to investigate potential ethics violations, underscoring the need for accountability. Last week, just ahead of his inauguration as the 47th US President, Trump launched the $TRUMP memecoin , making the announcement on Truth Social. Shortly after, Melania Trump unveiled the $MELANIA coin through her social media channels, with distribution handled by MKT World, a company connected to her. Warren and Rep. Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts drafted a letter to the US Office of Government Ethics, the SEC, the Treasury and the CFTC, outlining their concerns. They argued that the launch has personally enriched Trump, created a pathway for the crypto industry to channel funds to him, and introduced a volatile financial asset allowing people worldwide to speculate on his political future. Additionally, they posed questions to the regulators, expecting answers by Feb. 4. Trump’s Memecoins Spark Fears of Unregulated Global Influence and Investor Risks They added that Trump and his wife’s net worth skyrocketed to $58b overnight. They raised concerns that anyone, including leaders from hostile nations, could secretly purchase these coins, potentially enabling unregulated and untraceable foreign influence over the US President. At the same time, they said that Trump’s supporters shoulder the financial risks tied to $TRUMP and $MELANIA. Additionally, they cautioned that these memecoins could ultimately harm the very people Trump claims to support. They alleged that Trump and his businesses, which control 80% of $TRUMP, could sell their holdings after three years, reaping enormous profits while triggering a sharp decline in the coin’s value, leaving his supporters to bear the financial losses. Chainalysis Reveals Trump’s Memecoins Dominated by 40 Crypto Whales Warren and Auchincloss raised concerns about the Trump family’s substantial ownership of the tokens and the conflicts of interest it creates. They pointed out that Trump’s companies, on average, could release 24m tokens into the market each month. With current prices fluctuating, this would translate to a monthly income of around $1.73b, totaling about $20.7b annually. This week, Chainalysis revealed that the majority of Donald Trump’s Official Trump ($TRUMP) token and Melania Trump’s Melania Meme ($MELANIA) token are largely controlled by just 40 crypto whales . These whales, each holding $10 million or more in tokens, account for 94% of the total token supply. Meanwhile, Chainalysis noted that smaller holders make up only a tiny fraction of the market.

A close above the $0.3720 resistance might send the price toward the $0.3860 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.40 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.420. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.3550 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.3420 level. The next major support is near the $0.3380 level. The main support sits at $0.3250. If there is a downside break below the $0.3250 support, the price could decline further.

Per Simin Ilbo , the city, a satellite of Seoul, announced it had taken the coins from crypto wallets belonging to 157 Goyang residents. Goyang Seizes Coins from 157 Citizens The city, in the affluent Gyeonggi Province, is a short commute away from central Seoul. A lake in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. (Source: hyolee2 [CC BY-SA 3.0]) The move is a departure for local governments and provincial tax offices in South Korea. In recent years, South Korean cities and provinces have made use of new powers to force domestic crypto firms to hand over crypto wallet data pertaining to their residents. However, they have mainly used these powers to recover unpaid local tax bills. In many instances, they have liquidated citizens’ Bitcoin (BTC) and other tokens. In other cases, they have given residents an ultimatum. They have warned: “Pay your fines or we will sell your crypto.” Goyang’s move indicates that cities are now willing to go further. They now seem set to use their powers to seize coins from citizens who fail to pay a range of council-imposed fines.

On Jan. 24, Ross Ulbricht made his appearance on X for the first time after 11 years in prison. Ross Ulbricht took to X to thank President Donald Trump, who fully pardoned his sentencing of life without parole and called the sentencing ‘Ridiculous.’ In the X post, Ulbricht emphasized the importance of ‘second chances’ and thanked all his supporters, saying “it is a victory, and it is your victory too.” pic.twitter.com/pbqRh9spnk — Ross Ulbricht (@RealRossU) January 24, 2025 Ulbricht was the founder of the Silk Road darknet marketplace. Silk Road operated as a secret service on the Tor network and facilitated the anonymous buying and selling of illegal drugs as well as other goods using Bitcoin ( BTC ). He was sentenced to life in 2015 after being convicted in a federal trial on multiple counts, including conspiracy to engage in a racketeering enterprise, money laundering, and hacking of computers. Ulbricht, whose X account was run by his wife until now, previously tweeted that he was not associated with any meme coin bearing his name. However, a cryptocurrency of a similar name was launched in Jun. 2024, which soared as high as $0.04243 on Jan. 22, 2025, the day Ulbricht was fully pardoned by the President. The ROSS token has now seen a dip in its price after almost three months of being bullish, as per CoinMarketCap. The Ross Ulbricht token’s price chart shows a bearish phase until late 2024, followed by a significant surge and a steep drop in early 2025. Sourced from CoinMarketCap by crypto.news Does Ross Ulbricht have any crypto holdings to his name? As reported by Fortune Crypto , Ross Ulbricht had over 144,000 BTCs when he got arrested. After his arrest, nearly $184 million was forfeited by the court, resulting in government auctions of the BTCs. The U.S. Marshals Service disposed of its BTCs in 2014 when the asset’s price crashed to $300. The auctions raised $48 million, a small percentage of the $14 billion they would be worth today. The FBI wallet that sold Ulbricht’s crypto now has a balance of nearly $129,000 .

From Kansas lawmakers proposing a bold move to allow Bitcoin-backed ETFs in public employee retirement funds to supporters rallying behind Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht's reintegration with significant crypto donations, these developments show the expanding role of digital assets in shaping public policy and individual financial transitions. Ross Ulbricht’s Post-Prison Transition Fund Receives Over $270K in Crypto Donations Supporters of Ross Ulbricht , the founder of the infamous Silk Road darknet marketplace, have rallied to help him reintegrate into society after more than 11 years behind bars. Following his pardon by former US President Donald Trump on Jan. 21, blockchain data shows that the Free Ross campaign has raised over $270,000 in cryptocurrency donations to support Ulbricht’s transition to his new life. The Free Ross campaign, a long-standing initiative advocating for Ulbricht’s freedom and criminal justice reform, has seen a significant influx of donations in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A wallet operated by the campaign has received more than $270,000 worth of Bitcoin (BTC) since Ulbricht’s release. Major contributions include a $111,111 donation from cryptocurrency exchange Kraken. Additionally, an Ethereum (ETH) wallet associated with the campaign has accumulated roughly $2,400 in ETH, alongside smaller donations in Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Binance Coin (BNB), and Dogecoin (DOGE). While the campaign previously focused on raising funds to secure Ulbricht’s release and advocate for criminal justice reform, the current purpose of the donations appears to be supporting his reintegration into society. However, details about how these funds will be allocated remain unclear. The Free Ross campaign has not publicly disclosed how much money was raised prior to Jan. 21 or provided specifics on its plans for future use. Ross Ulbricht, originally from Austin, Texas, created and operated the Silk Road marketplace from 2011 until his arrest in San Francisco in 2013. The platform, accessible only via the Tor network, allowed users to conduct anonymous transactions using Bitcoin. While many of the transactions were legitimate, the marketplace became notorious for enabling the sale of illicit goods and services, including drugs. In 2015, Ulbricht was convicted on multiple charges, including money laundering, conspiracy to traffic narcotics, and computer hacking. He was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. His case became a focal point in debates about online privacy, the role of cryptocurrency in illicit activities, and the ethics of harsh sentencing in the digital age. Ulbricht’s family, particularly his mother, Lyn Ulbricht, became vocal advocates for his release, arguing that the sentence was disproportionate and that he was unfairly punished as a scapegoat for broader issues in the darknet and cryptocurrency worlds. Their advocacy eventually reached the White House, culminating in a presidential pardon by Donald Trump. Life After Prison: Unanswered Questions Since his release, Ulbricht has maintained a low public profile. He has not made any statements to the media or posted on social media platforms. However, filmmakers Blake J. Harris and Jonah Tulis have revealed plans to release a documentary based on interviews with Ulbricht, scheduled for release in 2025. The film is expected to delve into his life, the rise and fall of Silk Road, and his journey through the criminal justice system. Ulbricht’s financial status also remains a topic of speculation. According to Conor Grogan, a director at Coinbase, Ulbricht may have access to as much as $47 million in Bitcoin, potentially linked to wallets associated with the Silk Road platform. Much of the cryptocurrency tied to Silk Road has already been seized by US authorities, with some assets auctioned off by the government. Ulbricht’s future remains uncertain. His release marks a significant turning point, but reintegrating into society after more than a decade in prison presents its own set of challenges. Support from the cryptocurrency community demonstrates that he still has a dedicated base of advocates willing to assist him during this transition. The funds raised for Ulbricht show the growing use of cryptocurrency as a means of supporting causes and individuals. For Ulbricht, these donations may offer a financial safety net as he navigates life outside prison walls. However, with many unanswered questions about his plans, financial resources, and public role moving forward, his story continues to captivate and divide opinions within the crypto and broader communities. Kansas Senator Proposes Bitcoin ETF Investment for Public Employee Retirement Funds In other crypto news, Kansas State Senator Craig Bowser has introduced a bill to allow the state’s public employee retirement funds to invest in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Senate Bill 34, presented on Jan. 16, proposes allocating up to 10% of the Kansas Public Employees Retirement System (KPERS) funds into Bitcoin-backed ETFs, potentially marking a significant shift in state investment policy. Senate Bill 34 seeks to grant the KPERS board of trustees the authority to invest and reinvest up to 10% of the fund’s money in Bitcoin-backed ETFs. According to the bill, these ETFs must be issued by an investment company registered in Kansas. The proposal explicitly aims to provide exposure to Bitcoin within a regulated framework while maintaining safeguards for beneficiaries. The bill includes several notable provisions: Investment Cap: The KPERS board may invest up to 10% of the retirement fund in Bitcoin ETFs. However, if the value of the ETFs exceeds the 10% threshold, the board is not required to sell unless doing so would serve the best interests of the fund's beneficiaries. Performance Oversight: The board is mandated to conduct an annual examination of the investment program, ensuring that the performance and risk management of the Bitcoin ETF investments are closely monitored. Regulated Framework: The bill stipulates that only Bitcoin ETFs issued by Kansas-registered investment companies would qualify, providing an added layer of regulatory oversight. While the proposal represents a significant step for Bitcoin advocates in Kansas, it must undergo the legislative process before becoming law. After being introduced on Jan. 16, Senate Bill 34 was referred to the Committee on Financial Institutions and Insurance on Jan. 17. From there, it must pass several additional legislative stages before being sent to the Kansas House of Representatives for consideration. If approved by both chambers, the bill would then require the governor’s signature to become law. The legislative process in Kansas is rigorous, and the bill will likely face scrutiny from lawmakers weighing the risks and benefits of cryptocurrency investments in state-managed retirement funds. Supporters argue that Bitcoin’s historical performance and its growing adoption as a store of value make it a compelling addition to investment portfolios. Critics, however, may raise concerns about the volatility and regulatory uncertainties surrounding cryptocurrencies. The introduction of Senate Bill 34 marks a potential turning point in Kansas lawmakers’ attitude toward cryptocurrency investments. Historically, the state has been cautious about digital assets. In 2023, lawmakers in the Kansas House of Representatives introduced a bill to cap political donations made in cryptocurrency at $100. The proposed cap was based on the “fair market value” of the digital assets at the time of receipt and would have required the immediate conversion of crypto donations into US dollars. The bill, however, failed to advance due to procedural issues and missed deadlines. Senator Bowser’s proposal stands in stark contrast to the restrictive approach of the 2023 bill, signaling a growing recognition of cryptocurrency’s potential role in mainstream finance. By focusing on Bitcoin ETFs—a regulated and widely accepted investment product—the new bill aims to balance innovation with fiduciary responsibility. Bitcoin ETF Exposure for Retirement Funds: A National Trend? Kansas’ consideration of Bitcoin-backed ETFs for public retirement funds mirrors a broader trend of increasing institutional interest in cryptocurrency investments. Bitcoin ETFs have gained traction as a gateway for traditional investors to access cryptocurrency markets without directly holding or managing digital assets. These products are regulated by financial authorities, providing a layer of security and oversight that appeals to institutional and retail investors alike. If Senate Bill 34 becomes law, Kansas would join a growing list of jurisdictions exploring cryptocurrency as an investment option for public funds. The move could pave the way for other states to consider similar measures, particularly as Bitcoin’s role in global finance continues to expand. While the potential benefits of Bitcoin ETF investments include diversification and exposure to an emerging asset class, the proposal is not without risks. Bitcoin’s price volatility and regulatory uncertainties could impact the performance of the ETFs, potentially affecting the stability of the retirement fund. The annual examination mandated by the bill is a critical measure to mitigate these risks and ensure that investments align with the fund’s fiduciary responsibilities. Supporters of the bill argue that Bitcoin’s limited supply and increasing adoption make it an attractive long-term investment, particularly in the face of inflation and economic uncertainty. Opponents, however, may question whether it is appropriate to expose retirement funds to an asset class known for its price swings. As Senate Bill 34 progresses through the legislative process, it will undoubtedly spark debate about the role of cryptocurrency in public finance. The proposal reflects a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s legitimacy as an investment asset while highlighting the need for careful oversight and regulation.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|ETH|ADA,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-24 05:30:00

Trump Executive Order (TRUMPEO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPEO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Executive Order can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Executive Order could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Executive Order launched with over $25,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Executive Order on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Executive Order by entering its contract address – Guze7ScXTVo3JPwojxcVX5P7EEcC5ncAByrA47QJ6JzT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPEO.

There is also around $1.7 billion in OI at the $110,000 strike price, as derivatives traders remain bullish. The anticipated announcements and crypto executive orders following US President Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday did not materialize, causing cryptocurrency market indicators to stabilize, reported Deribit this week. While Bitcoin options markets still show some unusual trading patterns, overall market excitement has subsided, it added. Bitcoin OI by expiry. Source: Deribit In addition to today’s batch of Bitcoin options, around 168,000 Ethereum contracts are expiring as well. These have a notional value of $543 million and a put/call ratio of 0.47. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $3.5 billion. Crypto Market Outlook Spot markets have remained relatively stable over the past 24 hours, with total capitalization at $3.7 trillion following a volatile week . The market cap is exactly where it was last week, so the Trump pump following the US president’s inauguration on Monday was very short-lived. Bitcoin has dropped 4% from this week’s all-time high, which was almost revisited on Thursday. The asset was trading up 3% on the day at $105,000 at the time of writing, having held above six figures for most of this week. Ethereum is up 5% on the day at $3,370, but it remains deflated following dissent and infighting at the Ethereum Foundation. Altcoins remain mixed with minor gains and losses across the board during the Friday morning Asian trading session. Nevertheless, market sentiment is strengthening as the first crypto-related executive order gets the approval signature from President Trump.

As per a report by Cornerstone Research , the agency initiated only 33 crypto-related actions in its last year under Gensler, down from 47 actions the previous year, which marked its peak enforcement period. Gensler’s $5B penalties mark aggressive enforcement in 2024 Though the number of actions was down, the money penalties in the crypto sector reached a record $5 billion in 2024, mainly because of the SEC’s $4.5 billion settlement with Terraform Labs. In total, the agency charged 90 defendants in crypto enforcement actions last year, including 33 firms and 57 individuals. Gensler, Biden’s pick in 2021, stepped down as SEC chairman on Jan. 20, 2025, after Trump’s return to the White House. Under Gensler’s leadership, the SEC took nearly 80% more crypto-related enforcement actions than his predecessor, Jay Clayton, who was SEC chairman from 2017 until 2020. Cornerstone said over half of the SEC’s enforcement actions in 2024 were in September and October, with only four actions initiated after the US elections in November. Cornerstone’s analysis found that the most common allegations in crypto-related cases were fraud and unregistered securities, at 73% and 58%, respectively. The report also found rising charges of market manipulation and failure to register as a broker-dealer. Of the 207 crypto enforcement actions brought by the SEC since 2013, 47% have been related to initial coin offerings and non-fungible tokens. Mark Uyeda shifts SEC priorities by repealing controversial crypto rule Under acting chair Mark Uyeda, Trump’s appointee to lead the SEC, the agency has already begun shifting its priorities. On Jan. 23, just days after Gensler’s departure, the SEC repealed Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, a controversial rule that required banks and other financial institutions that hold cryptos to treat them as liabilities on their balance sheets. The new administration has interpreted this as a shift in regulatory priorities. Commenting on the developments, Lauren Compere, head of stewardship and engagement at Boston Common Asset Management, said: “While we anticipated that the Trump administration’s appointed SEC chair, interim or permanent, would oversee a fundamental shift in priorities, Uyeda’s past suggestion that companies could go around established SEC rules, which is cause for significant concern.” – Lauren Compere Uyeda will temporarily head the SEC while Trump’s nominee, Paul Atkins, undergoes the approval process, which is expected to take several months. He has previously been critical of the shareholder filing process, saying that companies should be able to bypass the SEC’s no-action process and set their own standards for shareholder resolutions.

As a revolutionary PayFi token, Remittix transforms cross-border payments by combining blockchain technology with traditional banking. With over 6,000 record-holders and over $5.4 million raised in record time, Remittix is capturing attention as a high-potential investment opportunity poised for explosive growth. Why Remittix Will Unlock A New Level of Liquidity in 2025 International payments have always been costly, slow and full of hidden charges. Today with cross-border payments space projected to top $250 trillion by 2027, better solutions are required. Remittix (RTX) is rising to the call by combining blockchain and conventional banking, allowing users to send money internationally without the typical hassles. Remittix allows crypto holders to instantly convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat, sending transfers directly to any bank account. Businesses and individuals benefit from faster transactions without high costs or complicated processes. Unlike traditional banks that impose hidden fees, Remittix uses flat and transparent rates. Recipients get the amount of money the sender sends, giving users better rates than major banks. The platform simplifies crypto payments by making them as easy and familiar as standard bank transfers while providing true financial flexibility. Platforms like Stripe, Wise and Coinbase currently dominate the digital payments market. Remittix, however, introduces an innovative approach to cross-border transactions with its crypto-fiat feature. Remittix eliminating intermediaries reduces time and fees, making it appealing to businesses and individuals. Remittix also provides businesses with a Pay API to accept cryptocurrency payments and settle them into fiat bank accounts. This integration simplifies engaging in the crypto market without the need to manage multiple currencies.

Initially trading around the $9.50 level on January 22, the token skyrocketed 140% to break beyond $25 as speculators reacted to the news. At press time, the asset has lost some value and is down to $17. Victory for Tornado Cash Tornado Cash’s legal woes started in August 2022 when OFAC designated it as a sanctioned entity, claiming the Lazarus Group, a criminal organization linked to the North Korean regime, had used the platform to launder stolen cryptocurrencies worth more than $455 million. Subsequently, one of its developers, Alex Pertsev, was arrested in The Netherlands, charged with money laundering, found guilty , and sentenced to five years in prison. The mixer’s co-founder, Roman Storm, was also arrested in August 2023 and charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. With his trial scheduled for April 14, 2025, he has publicly defended himself, claiming he is being prosecuted for writing open-source code. However, following the judgment against Tornado Cash, six individuals led by crypto advocate Joseph van Loon sued the U.S. Treasury, OFAC, then-Secretary Janet Yellen, and OFAC Director Andrea Gacki, accusing them of overreach. Loon and his fellow plaintiffs argued that there were no grounds for sanctioning the crypto mixer because it was software rather than a person or entity. Their view was supported by an appellate court in November 2024. It ruled that the immutable nature of the service’s smart contracts meant it could not be defined as “property,” a concept in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) that OFAC had used to justify its sanctioning of Tornado Cash. According to the court, the lines of codes making up the smart contracts could not be subjected to ownership or control since they operated autonomously without human intervention, thus falling outside the purview of the IEEPA. The latest determination upholds the November judgment, which the government agencies had sought to be reheard. However, it does not impact the criminal case against Storm and fellow co-founder Roman Semenov, who remains at large. Market Reacts While the value of the TORN token skyrocketed in the aftermath of the court’s decision, it has since cooled down, going from a high of $25.28, per data from CoinGecko to $17.00. However, its current price is still 122% higher than a week ago and an 88% improvement over 30 days. The coin has a market capitalization north of $68 million, and its recent performance puts it vastly ahead of the broader crypto market, which is up a mere 1.8%.

While some tokens gain instant popularity through hype, others struggle to build long-term value. Among the fleeting memes, a new contender is rising to the top: $PEPETO—the “God of Frogs.” Unlike other meme coins that have been driven by short-lived political or celebrity-driven hype, $PEPETO is proving that memes can be both fun and meaningful. But what makes $PEPETO different from the rest of the pack? The Shortcomings of Political Tokens: $TRUMP and $MELANIA In the world of meme coins, political tokens like $TRUMP and $MELANIA have stirred interest due to their affiliations with high-profile figures. $TRUMP, for instance, hit an eye-popping $36.15 billion in trading volume within just 24 hours of its launch. Meanwhile, $MELANIA leveraged the fame of Melania Trump to capture attention. However, these tokens face significant challenges. For starters, $TRUMP is highly centralized, with a staggering 80% of tokens controlled by Trump-affiliated entities, raising concerns about transparency and fairness. In contrast, $MELANIA suffers from a lack of real-world utility—relying heavily on celebrity branding, which could easily fade over time. $PEPETO: A Meme Coin with Real Potential Enter $PEPETO, a meme coin that’s breaking away from the mold. Unlike $TRUMP and $MELANIA, $PEPETO is not just another trend—it’s built for long-term growth. During its presale, $PEPETO raised over $3.7 million and has already garnered a community of over 55,000 supporters. What’s truly exciting about $PEPETO is that it combines humor with functionality—proving that meme coins can be both entertaining and valuable. What Makes $PEPETO Stand Out? Unbeatable Staking Rewards With an impressive 387% annual return, $PEPETO offers one of the highest staking yields in the market, attracting investors who want to earn passive income while supporting a promising project. Cross-Chain Bridge $PEPETO’s 30-second cross-chain bridge allows users to easily transfer tokens between different blockchains, cutting down on transaction fees and delays—common pain points for many cryptocurrency investors. PepetoSwap Exchange $PEPETO is launching its own exchange—PepetoSwap—which will allow users to trade with zero-fee transactions. This platform is set to resolve the issues of high fees and liquidity fragmentation that have plagued other meme coin exchanges. Decentralized Governance Through a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) model, $PEPETO empowers its community to make decisions, ensuring the token evolves transparently and remains true to the values of its supporters. Affordable Entry At just $0.000000105 during its presale, $PEPETO offers a rare opportunity for early investors to get in at an incredibly low price before it hits major exchanges. The Power of the Pepeto Army One of the driving forces behind $PEPETO’s success is its growing community—the Pepeto Army. This dedicated group of supporters is spreading the word and engaging with the project across platforms like Twitter, Telegram, and YouTube. The Pepeto Army not only amplifies the token’s cultural impact but also strengthens its financial foundation by creating a network effect that drives both adoption and loyalty. The Day of Judgment aligns with Trump’s inauguration, timing is key, and $Pepeto ’s strategy is unmatched. Unlike competitors like Lucifer, aka Pepe, who missed the mark, $Pepeto waits for the perfect moment to rise as the crypto space turns bullish. : https://t.co/RyI7SlT0Mh pic.twitter.com/EBgBrGy3D7 — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) January 12, 2025 While other meme coins may rely on political or celebrity hype, $PEPETO is focused on sustainable growth and real-world utility. The growing interest from whale investors is a clear sign that major players are confident in the long-term potential of $PEPETO. As the project gears up for its exchange listings and the launch of PepetoSwap, its momentum is only expected to increase. The Road Ahead: $PEPETO’s Future As the presale winds down, the opportunity to secure $PEPETO at a discounted rate is fast closing. Once listed on major exchanges, $PEPETO’s market presence is set to soar. The upcoming launch of PepetoSwap will further cement $PEPETO’s position as a leader in the meme coin space. How to Join the $PEPETO Revolution If you’re looking to be part of the $PEPETO movement, here’s how to get started: Set Up Your Wallet: Download an Ethereum-compatible wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Fund Your Wallet: Add ETH, USDT, or BNB to your wallet. Purchase Tokens: Head over to pepeto.io and secure your $PEPETO tokens during the presale. Start Staking: After purchasing your tokens, you can begin staking them immediately to earn passive rewards. Final Thoughts: $PEPETO is Changing the Meme Coin Landscape $PEPETO is proving that meme coins don’t have to be driven solely by hype. By combining cutting-edge blockchain technology, decentralized governance, and a strong, passionate community, $PEPETO is setting new standards for what meme coins can achieve. For investors looking to join a long-term, utility-driven project, $PEPETO offers a rare opportunity to get in on the ground floor. Don’t miss out—$PEPETO is not just another meme coin; it’s reshaping the future of cryptocurrency. This new structure focuses on comparisons, breaking down the differences between $PEPETO and other tokens, while placing emphasis on the unique qualities and potential of $PEPETO. It also provides actionable steps for readers to get involved. What do you think of this version?

39360510,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=123589,1737698962,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,An Interview With Mantle Network,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/an-interview-with-mantle-network/,"In an exclusive interview with BitcoinWorld , we got the chance to speak with Joshua Cheong, Product Lead at Mantle What is the main goal of Mantle Network, and how does it benefit users in the blockchain world? To give some background, Mantle Network is an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution that fully supports Ethereum smart contracts and tooling – delivering the same functionality as Ethereum but with much cheaper transaction fees. Since our mainnet launch, we have grown to support over 260 decentralised applications (dApps) across all verticals, creating a diverse and thriving Web3 ecosystem. Mantle’s goal is to bridge the gap between traditional finance and DeFi by building institutional-grade infrastructure. Having witnessed firsthand how traditional banking infrastructure struggles with the rapid pace of digital innovation, we’re building a platform that combines the best of both — the security and familiarity of TradFi with the efficiency and accessibility of blockchain technology. Our focus is to become the premier liquidity chain for institutional-grade settlement and value transfer. In doing so, we aim to pave the way for next-generation banking in tandem with broader blockchain adoption. Can you explain what zero-knowledge rollups are and why they are important for Mantle Network? Zero-knowledge rollups (ZK rollups) represent a significant advancement in L2 technology, particularly for institutional use cases. It enhances scalability and efficiency by bundling multiple transactions off-chain and verifying them with cryptographic proofs to ensure maximum security. For Mantle Network, this technology is transformative. By transitioning to a ZK validity rollup through Succinct’s SP1, Mantle is able to achieve chain finality in one hour — a 168x improvement over traditional optimistic rollup builds. This is particularly crucial for institutional users requiring fast, secure settlement. The combination of rapid finality and capital efficiencies available through the Mantle Ecosystem creates a conducive environment for large-scale asset movements. Why did Mantle Network decide to switch from optimistic to zero-knowledge architecture? While an optimistic rollup build served us well initially as a tried-and-tested scaling solution, the lengthy 7-day withdrawal period created friction for users who require rapid settlement capabilities. Shortening withdrawals would previously require third-party bridges that are much more capital inefficient as they require liquidity pools and high slippage. This is sufficient for retail use cases over small amounts of token value but for a real-world institution that is bringing in large amounts of capital, the architecture reaches a bottleneck as the cost of idle capital for 7 days is not acceptable for any traditional financial institution. Enter ZK scaling architecture, a pivotal upgrade in scaling technologies that use cryptographic proofs to instantly verify transactions, drastically reducing chain finality and improving user experience. Fast finality through ZK validity proofs, while maintaining the cost efficiency inherent to rollups and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence, allows developers to seamlessly leverage existing Ethereum tooling with transaction costs remaining at fractions of a cent. More importantly, the switch synergistically aligns with Mantle’s vision of creating a liquidity chain tailored for institutional-grade asset settlement and value transfer. Institutions can move capital more efficiently and take advantage of market opportunities as they happen. With our proven expertise in invigorating promising web3 projects and enabling commercial success via extensive resources and support, Mantle’s collaboration with Succinct positions us to set a new benchmark for institutional-grade Ethereum scalability. How does reducing transaction finality time to one hour make things better for users and developers? For users, the reduced transaction finality time would mean that they are now able to move their assets between Mantle Network and Ethereum much faster — making trading more efficient, with improved market dynamics thanks to tighter spreads, lower slippage and optimised gas fees. This further broadens asset accessibility across the Mantle Ecosystem, giving users more options and access to Mantle-based assets such as mETH, cmETH and FBTC (valued over $3.7Bn) to proliferate across the wider decentralised finance (DeFi) domain. As for developers, this translates to a smoother and more reliable operating environment for them to build and iterate their applications on Mantle Network. Improved interoperability opens up opportunities for cross-rollup and multi-chain initiatives, enhancing business economics and scale for sophisticated financial applications. What role does Succinct’s SP1 technology play in Mantle Network’s upgrade? Succinct’s SP1 is an open-source technology that creates efficient ZK proofs using programmer-friendly language (Rust language) and instruction set architecture (RISC-V). It is so performant such that upon release, it was multiple magnitudes more performant over the next best solution. Prior to the introduction of SP1, the use of ZK technology for scaling the Ethereum Virtual Machine was both extremely expensive and difficult to work with in-development. It required many compromises either by limiting the scope of the Ethereum Virtual Machine used or accepting a high level of operational costs. SP1 represents a “tipping point” in the industry that makes it possible to operate ZK provers efficiently at scale. If we assume Moore’s law to continue and that GPU/CPU hardware continues to cheapen, it will be likely that the rest of the industry will follow in our footsteps. How will this upgrade make using Mantle Network faster, cheaper, and more secure? At Mantle, we believe that continuous innovation is essential to driving the future of decentralized finance and creating a thriving ecosystem for builders and users. As we transition to a zero-knowledge (ZK) validity rollup, this upgrade will significantly enhance Mantle Network’s capabilities, achieving chain finality within one hour — a 168x improvement over existing bridging capabilities. Moreover, with secure 1-hour withdrawals, Mantle Network will enable better swap market spreads, lower slippage, better money markets, improved interest rates, and broader asset availability. By integrating Mantle Network’s modular architecture, Eigen-DA powered data availability solution, and ZK proofs via SP1, the culmination of advanced scaling technologies keep transaction costs at fractions of a cent, even for complex institutional operations. This further creates a solid foundation for robust security via cryptographic proofs, ensuring institutional-grade security guarantees without compromising performance and efficiency gains. What does this change mean for developers who want to build on Mantle Network? For developers, this upgrade creates an optimal environment for building institutional-grade applications. The integration of SP1 technology reduces the complexity and cost of deploying and scaling highly-performant decentralized applications (dApps) while ensuring a seamless developer experience. Moreover, developers stand to benefit from Mantle’s extensive ecosystem support, including our $200M EcoFund, grants and robust technical infrastructure. With faster transaction finality, lower gas fees, and enhanced security, developers can focus on innovation and functionality rather than operational limitations. Additionally, the network’s adherence to EVM standards ensures full compatibility with existing Ethereum tools and frameworks, enabling developers to leverage their expertise while accessing the advanced capabilities of Mantle Network. How do you see Mantle Network’s innovations impacting the future of Ethereum and blockchain technology? Mantle Network’s innovations, particularly through the integration of technologies like SP1, exemplify the transformative potential of Layer 2 solutions in advancing Ethereum’s ecosystem without compromising its core principles. By addressing scalability, cost-efficiency, and security, Mantle accelerates Ethereum’s adoption as the backbone of dApps and financial systems — proving that institutional-scale throughput is indeed possible on ETH-aligned Layer 2s. These advancements set a benchmark for the broader blockchain industry, supporting Ethereum’s roadmap through applied research for proposals like the Beam chain. Beam chain would be an upgrade to Ethereum’s core protocol and uses ZK technology for validators and staking services. By being the largest early-mover of ZK for scalability, we remain future-relevant in the long-term Ethereum roadmap while developing expertise to offer thought leadership for innovation across the broader Web3 industry.

While there’s some short-term uncertainty, the overall market sentiment remains bullish, suggesting that XRP could be gearing up for a bullish rally if key levels hold. XRP has erased the gains made in the last seven days and is currently down by more than four percent on the weekly chart. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.17 and is aiming to rise above the $3.20 levels. Price Targets and Bullish Outlook XRP is currently moving through a complex correction , but long-term bullish expectations remain in place. If XRP can break above the critical level of $3.40, it could target $4.20 next, with $5 and $6.60 also in play as potential future price levels. These targets align with key Fibonacci extensions and are seen as crucial milestones in the coming weeks. The immediate focus will be on the breakout above $3.40, which would signal further upside potential for the token. Support Levels and Potential Pullbacks In the short-term, XRP faces important support levels. The $2.52 to $2.94 range is critical for the price to stay above in order to maintain bullish expectations. If the price dips below $2.52, the chances for further upward momentum may diminish. A break below $2.32 would weaken the bullish case, signaling a possible larger correction. What to Watch for in the Coming Days The key levels to focus on are the $2.52 and $3.40 ranges. A sustained movement above $3.40 could confirm the start of a bullish rally, pushing XRP toward $4.20 and eventually higher targets. On the flip side, if XRP struggles to hold above the critical support levels, further consolidation or a short-term pullback could occur.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-24 06:11:23

In the same light, Cardano (ADA) investors are relieved by the new predictions that have emerged for the next month. Amid all these, Remittix (RTX) has investors excited about big profits that could make many millionaires in 2025. Let’s look at what’s happening with these coins and why people think Remittix could be the best coin to buy. Solana Rises Despite Network Challenges Solana has added new features to make it even better. More DeFi projects and NFTs are popping up on its network, which is helping it stay relevant. However, some investors are displeased by Solana’s recent network issues. Notably, Solana-based apps including the decentralized exchange Jupiter and the digital wallet Phantom experienced poor performance on January 19, 2025. Users reported troubles shortly after First Lady Melania Trump’s own meme coin caused the price of $TRUMP to plunge. Even with these problems, Solana has bounced back. Its price has surged 22% over the past week, making it a good choice for those who want a reliable option in their portfolio. People who like to stick with what they know still see Solana as a top pick. Major Surge on the Horizon For Cardano Cardano investors have heaved a sigh of relief following major predictions for ADA. Despite its recent struggles, Cardano’s price is expected to increase by 111.06% to $ 2.05 by February 22. This is double the current price and definitely positions ADA among the best coins to buy. The team behind Cardano focuses on security and making the network more efficient. These have been regarded as some of the major factors behind the positive outlook. Cardano’s price is low compared to its past highs but if the predictions go right, it could rise further to reclaim previous highs. For long-term investors, Cardano is worth keeping an eye on. It has a great history and with the right upgrades, it can reach for the moon. That said, many are starting to believe that other coins offer better chances for much bigger returns. Why Remittix Is Grabbing Attention Remittix is the coin everyone is talking about. It’s part of the PayFi sector, focusing on making international money transfers cheaper and faster. This coin is not just another project—it solves a real problem. The presale for RTX has been a huge success. At a current price of $0.0282 per token, it’s affordable, and many think its value will skyrocket. Experts believe it could go up 20 times in 2025. This is why it’s being called one of the best coins to buy right now. Unlike Solana and Cardano, which are already well-known, Remittix feels fresh. It’s gaining popularity online, especially among younger investors looking for something new. People love its focus on making money transfers simple and cost-effective. Remittix has made over $5.7 million so far in its ICO from the sale of RTX tokens. This reflects the adoption level and investment appeal of RTX. The success of the presale shows that people are beginning to see the huge prospects it offers. New coins often have lower prices, making them easier for anyone to buy. If the project does well, these coins can bring much bigger returns than more established options. It’s a risk, but for some, it’s worth it. If you’re looking for a safe bet, Solana might still be a good choice. It has a strong track record and continues to grow. Cardano is more of a long-term option, but it might not bring the quick profits some investors want. For those looking to take a chance on something new, Remittix could be the answer. Its low DeFi coin price and potential for massive growth make it one of the best cryptos to buy. Predictions of 20x returns are hard to ignore. Crypto investing is always about finding the right balance. Solana offers reliability, Cardano provides stability, and Remittix delivers excitement. The key is to pick what fits your goals. Whether you play it safe or go for the big win, the crypto market always has opportunities. Right now, Remittix is making a strong case for being the top pick for anyone wanting a fresh start in crypto. Act now to avoid regrets. You are still early and can win big from this ICO.

The trading platform airdropped 700 million JUP coins, worth approximately $500 million, to over 2 million wallets. Jupiter 🪐 @JupiterExchange · Follow omg the largest user airdrop in history is today 🤯 12:50 pm · 22 Jan 2025 13.4K Reply Copy link Read 1.5K replies As of January 24, 61% of qualified participants, 578,657 wallets, had claimed their assets. Meanwhile, trader attention switched to the exchange’s native token amid the ecosystem developments. JUP witnessed fluctuations following the events, with some participants profit-taking after the distribution. However, the trend has shifted as the alt displays robust momentum amidst the prevailing broad market recoveries . JUP maintained bullishness on its daily chart, gaining over 10% within the past day to trade above $0.8560. The over $350 million in 24-hour trading volume signals impressive trader activity. The latest airdrop event likely renewed trader optimism on JUP. Despite earlier profit-taking tendencies, the “Jupuary” airdrop magnified trading activities while boosting liquidity. These elements remain crucial in stabilizing the market. Reduced liquidations and increased open interest signal recoveries Coinalyze data shows JUP experienced massive volatility last weekend, with long liquidations surpassing 1.2 million and shorts above 800,000 on January 18. The stats confirmed magnified trading pressure, possibly from market speculations of sharp price movements. Jupiter has seen reduced liquidations since January 19. The altcoin saw liquidations amounting to $916K in the past day, with $502K longs and $414K shorts rekt in the past 24 hours. Source – Coinalyze That reflects a significant cooldown from weekend figures, suggesting a stabilising JUP ecosystem. Meanwhile, the calmer environment matches the prevailing increase in open interest. JUP’s open interest increased by 22% over the past 24 hours to surpass $227 million, according to Coinglass . That indicates notable recoveries from the intense fluctuations between January 18 and 19. The Open Interest maintained gains above $110 million this week, signaling market stability after the latest airdrop-driven sell-offs. Furthermore, Jupiter’s total value locked (TVL) on the Solana blockchain has thrived over the past sessions. According to DeFillama, the metric stands at $2.87 billion at press time, a significant jump from $2.36 ten days ago. The latest airdrop contributes to the increased activity, which has attracted massive user participation. JUP price outlook The native token exhibited a bullish stance today, displaying bull dominance on the daily timeframe. Chart by Coinmarketcap While broad market recoveries drove JUP’s latest gains, increased activity following the “Jupuary” airdrop fueled the asset’s upside trajectory. JUP appears to boost adequate steam for continued gains in the near term. Decisive buyer resurgence could propel the alt past the $0.81 resistance. Overcoming this hurdle will catalyze more surges to $0.95 – a 10% increase from current prices. The 1H Chaikin Money Flow supports the upward narrative. The indicator has climbed from yesterday’s -0.34 to 0.02 at press time. Jupiter chart price , source: TradingView . Such trends confirm increased cash flowing into JUP’s ecosystem amid investor comeback. Also, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence is on the verge of a bullish crossover, indicating waning seller activity. However, an abrupt bearish wave might plunge JUP towards July 2024 lows of $0.63 – approximately 27% from current prices.

The occurrence has elicited concern across the crypto space, with strong indications pointing to North Korean hackers per usual. The hack started by first compromising one of Phemex’s hot wallets, limping off with $30 million; worse was still to come. But it went on and worsened, and more tokens fell in the process, such as: $USDC, $USDT, $ETH, $LINK, $PEPE, $FET, and $AVAX. Cyvers and Lookonchain security firms reported the activities by observing that there were misleading transactions that pointed towards a breach. Notable amounts stolen include 3.48 million USDC,841 ETH ($2.7 million),110,701 LINK ($2.69 million) and 142 billion PEPE ($2.12 million). Phemex’s Response and Assurances The hack led to withdrawal suspension at Phemex as a measure to mitigate the problem. CEO Federico Variola discussed the issue on X outlining it with a statement that the funds, having been taken from a hot wallet which the exchange is currently investigating, the cold wallets are nevertheless fully auditable at any given time given the platform’s proof-of-reserves. “As for cold wallets, they are protected, and everyone can verify that,” Variola said. The exchange also said that trading services and other operations are on as planned. Phemex came as one of the first platforms to disclose its proof-of-reserves and proof-of-solvency. In a statement, the exchange said it is willing to compensate the users. Right now, the company is working on the compensation plan, and more details will be out shortly. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Scam Alert: Why You Should Avoid $TRUMP and $MELANIA Tokens , North Korean Connection This hack has led to a focus on North Korean cybercrime communities that are active in crypto attacks.

Don’t Let Best Crypto Presale to Buy Now Be Your Second Regret in 2025!,https://thecoinrise.com/regret-missing-the-notcoin-initial-boom-dont-let-best-crypto-presale-to-buy-now-be-your-second-regret-in-2025/,"Let’s face it—crypto is a game of timing. Remember when Notcoin made headlines, and early investors laughed their way to the bank? If you’re reading this and kicking yourself for missing that ride, you’re not alone. But guess what? You’ve got a second shot at making it big. Enter BTFD Coin (BTFD) , the best crypto presale to buy right now, which has already raised over $5.5 million. With its presale in the 14th stage and over 66 billion coins sold to 9,200+ holders, BTFD is offering you an open door to the crypto elite. Now, let’s dive deeper into why BTFD Coin is the talk of the town and how it’s stepping into the spotlight after Notcoin paved the way. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolution You Can’t Ignore BTFD Coin (short for “Buy The Dip”) is the next big thing in the crypto world. Unlike most meme coins, BTFD isn’t just a trend—it’s a movement. Its presale is setting records, currently priced at $0.00016, and analysts are buzzing with predictions of a massive ROI post-listing. The coin is projected to hit $0.0006 after the presale ends, offering a whopping 275% return on investment. Imagine this: a $2,500 investment at the current presale price could turn into $9,375 once the coin hits its listing price. That’s the kind of math that gets hearts racing! But what makes BTFD stand out from other meme coins? Play-to-Earn Game: Launching on January 1, 2025, BTFD’s P2E game combines fun and financial rewards. Users can earn BTFD tokens while enjoying a thrilling gaming experience. Staking Rewards: With an incredible 90% APY, staking your BTFD tokens isn’t just profitable; it’s a ticket to passive income. Community Power: Dubbed the Bulls Squad, BTFD’s vibrant community is more than just holders—they’re investors, gamers, and die-hard enthusiasts. The presale performance speaks volumes about its potential. Over 66 billion coins sold, $5.5 million raised, and 9,200+ investors already on board. If you’re still hesitating, remember, that the train doesn’t wait forever. Referral Rewards: Multiply Your Gains Want to make even more money? BTFD’s referral program is as juicy as it gets. Here’s the breakdown: Share your unique referral code with your network. Earn 10% of every BTFD purchase made using your code if you rank in the top 20 on the leaderboard. Your referrals also get a 10% bonus for purchases above $50. The leaderboard resets monthly, so there’s always a new chance to win. With rewards tracked in real-time, you can watch your earnings stack up. Why just buy when you can help others join in and get paid for it? This is the beauty of this best crypto presale ! Notcoin: A Missed Opportunity That Still Haunts Notcoin made waves when it launched, proving that even a meme coin can deliver staggering returns if timed right. Launched with a playful theme and minimal hype, Notcoin became a sleeper hit, turning early $100 investments into tens of thousands of dollars within months. But as the price soared, the window of opportunity slammed shut for many. Notcoin’s history is a stark reminder of how quickly the crypto market can shift. From its humble beginnings to its peak price, Notcoin created millionaires almost overnight. Yet, not all news about Notcoin has been rosy. Its later stages saw diminished returns, with the market oversaturated and newer projects stealing the limelight. Fast forward to today, and Notcoin remains a reminder of what could have been. Analysts argue that its success was due to its early positioning in the meme coin space, coupled with a community-driven push that gave it its meteoric rise. However, those who got in late saw minimal gains—a lesson in why getting in early is crucial. With BTFD Coin following a similar trajectory but with far more utility and community engagement, it’s clear that history is repeating itself. The question is, will you seize this opportunity or let it pass you by again? Why Analysts Predict Big Things for BTFD Coin Crypto analysts are abuzz about BTFD’s potential. Its presale success alone sets it apart, but it’s the features and roadmap that have experts predicting a breakout year for the coin. The P2E game is already making headlines, with gamers excited to earn while they play. Plus, the staking rewards program—offering a jaw-dropping 90% APY —is expected to attract long-term holders, stabilizing the coin’s value. Analysts believe BTFD’s community-first approach, combined with its real-world utility, sets it apart from other meme coins. Unlike projects that rely solely on hype, BTFD is building an ecosystem where every participant benefits. Whether it’s through staking, gaming, or referrals, BTFD ensures there’s more than one way to earn. And let’s not forget the listing price of $0.0006. At that valuation, early investors are poised for returns that could rival Notcoin’s early success. If you’ve ever dreamed of turning a modest investment into a small fortune, BTFD’s presale is your golden ticket. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on the Best Crypto Presale to Buy If Notcoin taught us anything, it’s that early opportunities don’t wait. The best crypto presale to buy right now is undoubtedly BTFD Coin , with its stellar presale performance, engaging P2E game, and sky-high staking rewards. With $5.5 million already raised and the 14th presale stage underway, the clock is ticking. This isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a movement. Don’t let another golden opportunity slip through your fingers. Join the BTFD Coin presale today, and ride the wave of crypto’s next big thing. Sign up now before the dip turns into a peak!

Technical sentiments highlight increased positive action, suggesting a sustained bullish sentiment. The resistance and support trendline of Mantle are $1.40 and $1.00. U.S. President Donald Trump signs an executive order promoting cryptocurrencies. This has resulted in the market experiencing a strong bullish recovery. Moreover, the Mantle token records a double-digit surge, resulting in it bagging the highest 24-hour gains among the top 100 cryptos.

Bitcoin dropped from its all-time high of $108K and was exchanging hands at $104K at the time of publication. Despite the market correction, the Trump family project World Liberty Foundation has accumulated cryptocurrencies worth $49M in the past six hours. On-chain data showed that WLF bought an additional $9.8 million worth of wrapped bitcoin (WBTC) yesterday. The decentralized finance (DeFi) project also purchased another $2.6 million worth of TRX. Arkham showed that World Liberty Financial now held $370 million worth of cryptocurrencies. WLF holds $183.95 million worth of ETH, $57.29M worth of WBTC, $43.91M USDC, $10.28M TRX, and $8.42M worth of USDT. WLF purchases came as sales of the project’s own tokens headed into the final stage, with 2.4 billion WLFI tokens, a total of 25 billion, still available. Since the sale of WLFI went live in September, the project has raised a total of $1.1 billion. WLF also announced on Tuesday that it purchased several cryptocurrencies to commemorate Trump’s inauguration as the 47th President of the U.S. The project purchased $47 million worth of ETH and WBTC each. WLF also bought $4.7M worth of Aave, LINK, TRX, and ENA each. The cryptocurrency project also invested $32.8 million in 7,022 SETI, $14.7 million in 5,037 MENA, and $18.8 million in 7,413 SWEAT. Spot On Chain revealed the purchases were part of a broader strategy to expand WLF’s market footprint and capitalize on opportunities across the crypto space. Since its launch, Trump’s family has promoted the project, and DT Marks DEFI, LLC, a company associated with the President, is expected to receive 75% of the WLF’s revenue. The Arkham analytic platform also indicated Donald Trump’s Liberty Financial (WLFI) had become a top 0.1% holder of staked Ethereum (stETH) after accumulating $33 million stETH. The timing of these investments coincided with renewed interest in the platform, fueled by Trump and Melania’s launch of TRUMP and MELANIA memecoins on the Solana blockchain. WLF heightens interest in the crypto industry World Liberty Financial’s recent purchases came amid the changing landscape of the U.S. crypto regulation. The new Trump administration will embrace more pro-crypto policies after the expected departure of Gary Gensler as SEC chair. Tron founder Justin Sun, who invested $30 million in WLFI tokens in November, revealed he was optimistic about the future of crypto under the Trump administration’s anticipated stance. Sun also revealed on Monday another investment of $45 million in WLFI tokens, which pushed TRON DAO’s total portfolio in WLFI to $75M. “In my view, if I have made any money in cryptocurrency, all credit goes to President Trump. Both Trump Coin and World Liberty Financial are bound to perform exceptionally well.” – Justin Sun , founder of Tron Sun also emphasized that he was looking forward to seeing the Trump administration’s pro-crypto stance inspire and develop policies and initiatives to drive innovation and promote financial inclusion. WLF announced on Monday that it had successfully completed its 20% token supply sale. The cryptocurrency project also revealed an additional 5% token supply due to increased demand and interest across the crypto industry. World Liberty Financial is also actively building its digital presence as it expands its cryptocurrency portfolio. On January 19, the cryptocurrency project purchased four Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains through a multi-signature address: the world liberty.eth, trump coin.eth, eric trump.eth, and barrontrump.eth ENS domains.

Digital Asset Investor, a prominent crypto figure on X, shared a clip of Yusko’s appearance on the Good Morning Crypto Show, which sparked discussions about the evolving role of cryptocurrencies in national policy. Yusko suggested that the upcoming Donald Trump administration might consider expanding its crypto reserve strategy beyond Bitcoin to include other U.S.-developed cryptocurrencies, such as XRP, Cardano, and Hedera. He pointed to the efforts of these projects’ founders to build connections with influential figures, including Eric Trump, as a potential factor in their inclusion. There’s some talk.

He speculated that it might even be designated as the foundational layer for central bank digital currency (CBDC) projects or broader banking infrastructure. Such a move, if implemented, could signify a major shift in the U.S. approach to integrating blockchain technology into its financial systems. Highlighting XRP’s potential, Yusko contrasted its utility with Bitcoin’s status as digital gold. While Bitcoin’s primary role is widely recognized as a store of value, Yusko argued that cryptocurrencies like XRP could fulfill different purposes within a diverse financial ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Trump Administration and Digital Asset Reserves Discussions around the Trump administration’s crypto policy have intensified lately, particularly following a report that Trump plans to establish a national reserve in U.S.-made digital assets, including XRP and Solana . This initiative would prioritize these two assets and similar blockchain projects developed in the U.S. Trump’s idea could bolster the country’s leadership in the global crypto economy. Ripple has been prominently mentioned in these discussions. Its ongoing dialogue with the Trump team members, including recent meetings between Ripple executives and Trump , and a subsequent meeting with Vice President J. D. Vance, shows the company’s potential significance in this initiative. Although this move could impact Bitcoin’s global dominance, the idea of a U.S.-based crypto reserve appears to be gaining traction. While Yusko acknowledged that the implementation of such policies might not occur immediately, he emphasized the transformative potential of leveraging XRP as part of a national financial strategy. He highlighted that if XRP is integrated into a CBDC framework or banking infrastructure, it could redefine its role within the cryptocurrency market and legitimize blockchain technology in the country.

Reveals Whether He Bought Memecoins!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/binance-former-ceo-cz-talks-about-memecoins-through-trump-reveals-whether-he-bought-memecoins/,"CZ, the former CEO of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, spoke about memecoins. Speaking about the memecoin industry through Donald Trump's own memecoin TRUMP, which has been on the agenda recently, CZ said that memecoins have pros and cons. Emphasizing that investors should decide for themselves whether to invest in memecoins, considering all the pros and cons, CZ explained that he had never bought memecoins before. CZ responded to concerns about memecoins in a post on his X account, acknowledging that they have both benefits and drawbacks. CZ stated that memecoins can introduce new users to the cryptocurrency industry and validate the industry. CZ said that at this point, especially the issuance of memecoins by high-profile names such as the US President validates and supports crypto. But the celebrity also acknowledged concerns about the lack of intrinsic value associated with memecoins and the potential for short-term speculation. CZ emphasized the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, stating that individuals have the freedom to choose not to purchase crypto. He explained that as a founder, he does not personally invest in memecoins or NFTs, but respects the choices of others. “Possible pros of memecoins: Crypto is not a zero-sum game. Some of the people who bought TRUMP were probably not in crypto before. So, to some extent, it helped grow the space. Also, the fact that the US President has issued a meme coin also validates crypto. Possible cons to this: No dividends or long-term value. No intrinsic value, etc. (I've heard this about Bitcoin too.) Given these pros and cons, I guess the main point is that in a decentralized world, no one is forcing anyone to buy or not buy memes or any cryptocurrency. You don't have to mess with memecoins if you don't want to. But other people should have their own choices too. “I'm a builder myself. I haven't bought any Memecoins or NFTs. But just because I don't know how to appreciate something doesn't mean I'm against it.” https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1882512298352292344 *This is not investment advice.

But will BTC reach $120,000 in the next seven days of January 2025 as US President Donald Trump signs an executive order to stockpile Bitcoin and other crypto assets? Bitcoin Price Today Bitcoin price today hit a daily high of No data found for bitcoin on 30 minutes ago and is up No data found for bitcoin on 30 minutes ago%. This development comes after President Donald Trump announced via executive order to create a national digital asset stockpile. Hence, the chances of BTC hitting $120K before January 2025 ends are high . While many expected a Bitcoin reserve, the president took a generalist route, hinting that the US could accumulate Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as well. *TRUMP ORDER ON CRYPTO TO DEVELOP NATIONAL DIGITAL ASSET STOCKPILE: FOX — db (@tier10k) January 23, 2025 *bitcoin price updated as of No data found for bitcoin on 30 minutes ago. Despite this bullish announcement, the crypto markets remain unchanged except for the short-term volatility. However, technicals suggest that BTC hovers above the $100K psychological level and is primed for a bounce. Many analysts speculate that the news of a national crypto stockpile is not priced in and expect a massive rally. As noted above, the chances are high, but will Bitcoin price rise to $120K in the next seven days? Let’s find out. Will Bitcoin Price Hit $120K in Next 7 Days? From a technical standpoint, BTC price firmly stands above the $100K psychological level , despite recent market volatility. This signals strength and hints buyers could be defending this key support , hinting at a bounce. The key support levels include $100K, $98,638 and $96,800 . Even if BTC slides below $100K, the $99K to $96K is a buy zone , as noted in a previous article. The 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) hovers inside this buy zone at $98,638, making it a good place to accumulate BTC. On the contrary, the ATH at $110K, $115K and $120K are key resistance levels that could cause friction for the uptrend and where investors should consider booking profits . BTC/USDT 4-hour chart Technicals Indicate Clear Skies The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been bouncing off 50 for the past few days, adding credence to the idea that buyers are defending $100K support . A rebound off the mean level will signal a bullish momentum comeback and support Bitcoin revisiting its $110K ATH. The Awesome Oscillator (AO) shows no clear signal due to the recent chop. However, the recent descent in histogram bars coupled with consolidation reveals reduced bullish momentum. BTC Open Interest Recovers to ATH Levels On December 18, 2024, Bitcoin price hit an all-time high of $106K. Interestingly, the Open Interest (OI) also hit a new high of $71.85 billion. As a result of market uncertainty and profit-taking, the OI dropped to a low of $58.87 billion on January 12. The recent optimism surrounding the US President’s inauguration and approval of the national crypto stockpile has caught investors’ attention, which also explains the surge in OI back to the ATH levels. Currently, the OI sits at $67.52 billion. BTC Open Interest To summarize, Bitcoin price prediction is bullish. Technicals and other data points suggest that a bounce from $100K is likely . The next logical take-profit level for BTC is $120K. With only seven days left for the first month of 2025 to end, it is likely the month-end dynamics could trigger a volatile move to $120K.

39362986,https://invezz.com/?p=2468279,1737704287,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Explained: Trump’s executive order to support the growth of cryptocurrency,https://invezz.com/news/2025/01/24/explained-trumps-executive-order-to-support-the-growth-of-cryptocurrency/,"On Thursday, President Donald Trump signed an executive action that addresses key promises he made to the cryptocurrency industry during his 2024 campaign. “The digital asset industry plays a crucial role in innovation and economic development in the United States, as well as our nation’s international leadership,” the order said. “It is therefore the policy of my administration to support the responsible growth and use of digital assets.” Here’s a breakdown of what the order does and doesn’t do, and its implications for the crypto world. Creation of a presidential working group on digital assets The executive order establishes a task force to coordinate the development of clear regulations for the digital asset industry. This group, chaired by White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks, will include high-ranking officials like the Treasury Secretary and the SEC Chair. Key tasks for the group include identifying all existing regulations and policies affecting crypto within 30 days as well as submitting recommendations on these policies within 60 days. The task force will also be required to deliver a comprehensive report with legislative and regulatory proposals within 180 days. Anchorage Digital CEO Nathan McCauley praised the move, stating it marks a “significant first step” toward consistent and transparent regulation. Evaluation of a national digital asset stockpile While Trump stopped short of authorizing the immediate creation of a “strategic national bitcoin stockpile,” the order directs the working group to assess its feasibility. This evaluation includes exploring the potential use of cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the federal government as well as proposing criteria for managing and expanding such a reserve. The scope of this proposed stockpile could extend beyond Bitcoin, encompassing other digital assets seized through law enforcement actions. Prohibition of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) Trump delivered on his campaign promise to outlaw the creation of CBDCs, which are government-controlled cryptocurrencies. As per the order, CBDC has been defined as “a form of digital money or monetary value, denominated in the national unit of account, that is a direct liability of the central bank.” According to Trump’s order, agencies are prohibited from undertaking any action to establish, issue, or promote CBDCs within the jurisdiction of the United States or abroad. They can only do so if they are required by law. “Except to the extent required by law, any ongoing plans or initiatives at any agency related to the creation of a CBDC within the jurisdiction of the United States shall be immediately terminated, and no further actions may be taken to develop or implement such plans or initiatives,” read the order. While this prohibition resonates with crypto enthusiasts wary of state oversight, critics, like crypto researcher Molly White, argue it is largely symbolic, as no federal agency had seriously pursued a CBDC initiative. Rescinding Biden’s 2022 crypto Executive Order Trump revoked an earlier directive from President Joe Biden, which focused on studying digital assets and addressing their potential risks. This signals a departure from Biden’s cautious approach to crypto and a move toward more industry-friendly policies. Crypto industry reactions Bitcoin (BTC) experienced volatility following the announcement, initially rising and then falling, before settling slightly higher over a 24-hour period. The mixed market response reflects uncertainty about the order’s immediate impact. Sean Farrell, head of digital assets at Fundstrat, remarked in a Yahoo Finance report that the action had been “priced in” by the market. However, he noted that Trump’s pro-crypto stance is “huge” for the long-term future of the industry. Other developments already underway reflect the administration’s influence. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently rescinded accounting guidance (SAB 121) , which had hindered banks and broker-dealers from offering crypto custody services.

Ethereum ( ETH ) co-founder Vitalik Buterin warns that profit-driven models, like those in Solana ( SOL ), could mess with Ethereum’s principles, stressing how important it is to keep the network decentralized and socially grounded, calling it a contrast to what he calls the “Wall Street greed-is-good mentality.” In a blog post on Jan. 23, Buterin highlighted Ethereum’s decade-long mission to create a “global, censorship-resistant permissionless blockchain” and how it’s rooted in open-source values, much like projects like Linux and Mozilla. “The goal of Ethereum is the same as what it has been from day 1: building a global, censorship-resistant permissionless blockchain,” Buterin says. He also points out that the network’s scaling strategy, which focuses on layer-2 solutions, is key to keeping its decentralized social and technical foundation intact. You might also like: Bitcoin.com CEO: Ethereum may be skipped in this cycle due to having a “wokie energy.” Having what? The Ethereum co-founder also seems to be not buying into calls for a shift toward high-gas-limit layer-1 scaling, something some rivals are pushing. He argues that “this approach compromises too much of the benefits of Ethereum’s current social structure.” “One possible shortcut for scaling is to give up on L2s, and do everything through L1 with a much higher gas limit (either across many shards, or on one shard). However, this approach compromises too much of the benefits of Ethereum’s current social structure, which has been so effective at getting the benefits of different forms of research, development and ecosystem-building culture at the same time.” Vitalik Buterin Instead, he’s pushing the community to double down on accelerating layer-2 improvements, like scaling blobs, boosting interoperability, and upping security. Buterin’s warning comes on the heels of the Ethereum Foundation catching some heat for constantly selling off ETH to cover costs. As crypto.news reported earlier, a lot of people in the community are questioning whether that’s in line with Ethereum’s original vision.

Bears are increasing pressure as buyers struggle to hold the price above $120. This creates a plunge in the price chart. Will Litecoin reach $100?

The platform owes nearly $200 million in ecosystem debt. In DeFi, ecosystem debt occurs when a blockchain owes more tokens than it holds, as seen with THORChain’s current situation. This often results from overambitious promises or mismanagement, leading to financial imbalances. On the other hand, leverage risk comes when users are using their crypto assets as collateral to borrow against to improve their positions. Leverage risks can magnify profits but also come with massive losses if the market falls short, possibly resulting in liquidations. THORChain network temporarily halts operations to address financial instability and implement a restructuring plan. Sourced from X by crypto.news According to Blockbeats , THORChain has $97 million in borrowing liability and $102 million in depositor and synthetic asset liabilities. This financial imbalance has pushed the blockchain to the brink of bankruptcy.

These risks have, in turn, affected the native token of THORChain RUNE ( RUNE ) token, resulting in price volatility where the token tanked over 40% in the last 24 hours, as of Jan 24. This situation has also led to a loss of confidence in the protocol, and the THORChain validators are currently voting on a restructuring plan.

According to a THORChain core investor, TCB, risky lending and leverage features such as ThorFi were highlighted as primary cause of instability and has subsequently been removed from the blockchain. Without ThorFI's features, @THORChain would probably be a top 10 protocol. It's been a series of good news since streaming swaps launched that didn't even get noticed, it was an uninvestible asset and smart capital couldn't even touch it because of the complexity. — TCB (@1984_is_today) January 24, 2025 Additionally, the restructuring plan also includes efforts to regain users’ trust. As of now, integrations with wallets such as Trust Wallet and Coinbase are allowing users to connect to THORChain, and liquidity providers would be ensuring liquidity, helping the blockchain get back on its feet. Risks associated with DeFi lending While many within the crypto community earn passive income through DeFi lending, they are not devoid of risks. In Mar. 2020, MakerDAO went into an ecosystem debt of $6.65 million. The platform had to mint and sell MKR tokens to cover over $4.5 million as part of its debt repayment strategy. Overcomplicated features such as too much leverage can destabilize protocols, emphasizing the need for streamlined designs. Further, effective risk management systems also need to be in place to avoid ecosystem debt and protect users’ funds.

Two Factors That Say ‘No Way’,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/think-dogecoin-has-topped-out-two-factors-no-way/,"In an analysis provided by crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA), Dogecoin (DOGE) emerges as an altcoin defying current market skepticism, with technical indicators suggesting a bullish continuation rather than a peak. Dogecoin Is Still Bullish Kevin’s latest post on X highlights Dogecoin’s performance against its 50 and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA). “Dogecoin is still seeing fast expansion on the 50 and 200 simple moving averages after its weekly golden cross occurred,” he noted. This golden cross, a bullish indicator where the 50-day SMA crosses above the 200-day SMA, suggests sustained upward momentum. Related Reading: Dogecoin ETFs Will Skyrocket Price To $15, Forecasts Analyst Further examining the Fibonacci retracement levels, Kevin pointed out that Dogecoin is “above the macro golden pocket at .26 cents and is battling the macro .786.” The ‘golden pocket’—typically located between the 0.618 and 0.65 Fibonacci levels—is often considered a crucial support zone. Kevin argues that maintaining a price above this level is bullish. “If you think this chart is bearish in its current spot then you need some help. Not gonna focus on individual altcoins very much because BTC will determine the next move in the market no matter what your altcoin chart looks like but needed to remind people who are bad mouthing how crazy they look when we’re at the same price we were at in November when the market was rallying hard. Nothing has changed and cycle tops don’t occur when everyone is bearish,” Kevin expounded. Kevin further illustrated the erratic nature of crypto market sentiment, contrasting reactions from November and January. “When Dogecoin was hitting .35 cents in November, everyone was screaming to the hills that they were so bullish. DOGE at .35 cents in January, everyone is screaming that Doge sucks, I should have sold this thing a long time ago. Do you see how market psychology works? Pretty interesting,” he detailed. Bitcoin Needs To Move First Kevin also discussed Bitcoin’s influence on the broader crypto market, emphasizing its role as a leading indicator for altcoins like Dogecoin. He labeled yesterday’s market reaction to the crypto executive order by US President Donald Trump as a non-impactful in the long run. Related Reading: Dogecoin ETF Filing Takes Market By Storm, Can Positive Sentiment Trigger 200% Rise To $1 ATH? “BTC time and time again has failed to break the 1.703 FIB at 106.8K. Even though we broke out of this bullish falling channel on the daily time frame, we have failed to see any real money flow come into the asset if anything it has been decreasing over the last 48 hours. The Trump executive order was an obvious buy the rumor, sell the news event like all events are, so to me, that was always a nothing burger,” he elaborated. Despite these challenges, Kevin remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s potential for recovery. “I still think we’re experiencing seasonality in BTC as January’s are always really bad months, especially in the post halving year. I believe the goal should be to demoralize and anger as many investors as possible before starting the next leg higher, which should come within the next 1-3 weeks. Stay tuned!” he predicts. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.35.

Recent data provided by the token’s burn tracker indicated that over 6 million coins were permanently removed from the asset’s market supply. In turn, traders and investors anticipate a bullish impact on SHIB price, with their optimism further supported by the latest community developments. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Blows Up 1000% As Over 6M Coins Destroyed As per an X post by the burn tracker Shibburn on January 24, the intraday Shiba Inu burn rate spiraled 1041%, propelling market optimism surrounding the meme crypto. Primarily, as 6.7 million tokens were removed from the circulating supply, traders and investors anticipated price gains ahead, mirroring the law of supply and demand. For context, the meme coin’s burn mechanism sends SHIB tokens to a null address, thereby permanently removing them from the supply. In light of the abovementioned blow, market watchers expect a potential upswing despite the demand remaining the same. Latest Community Developments Inject Additional Optimism Simultaneously, it’s worth mentioning that the leading meme coin ‘s community has also secured a landmark achievement recently. The introduction of ShibOS, a blockchain-based operating system, has emerged as a revolutionary action in the Web3 space. Notably, the SHIB community introduced ShibOS , offering users seamless Web2 to Web3 transition opportunities for various use cases. This advancement, coupled with the Shiba Inu burn rate surge, has birthed noteworthy bullishness over the meme-themed asset’s long-term forecast. What’s Ahead For SHIB? At the time of reporting, SHIB price witnessed a gain of slightly over 1% and is trading at $0.00002028. The cryptocurrency’s 24-hour low and high were $0.00001954 and $0.00002047, flagging a highly turbulent intraday action. Notably, the broader price chart for the meme coin shows a period of sideways trading, underscoring a consolidation. However, the abovementioned Shiba Inu burn rate surge and recent developments can push the asset to witness remarkable gains ahead. Intriguingly, a recent SHIB price analysis by CoinGape reveals that it remains vital for the coin to break the key resistance at the $0.00002 level to embark upon a bullish movement. Traders and Investors continue to keep the token on their radars, awaiting bolstered price actions ahead.

The network has paused THORFI services, probably due to its financial uncertainty, which has circulated shock waves across the markets. The functions like swaps remain active while the lending operations are on hold. Although a ‘90-day’ restrictive initiative has been enforced, financial instability amid the rising speculation of a bull run and a strong altseason raises concern. All it started when Bitcoin borrowings increased when prices were lower, which required the minting of additional RUNE. Meanwhile, the lack of liquidity within the network added up more fire and as a result, the RUNE price underwent a massive drop of over 30%. As per the report, a pause has been imposed to prevent panic selling that could destabilize the platform. While some believe the Thorchain network is functional, the decentralised cross-chain protocol is working perfectly fine. As it generates huge amounts of fees, the platform cannot be insolvent, and adding an additional feature, lending, did not go in favour of the platform. However, the losses are said to be minimal, which could be overcome soon. Meanwhile, some believe Thorchain is following in the footsteps of Terra (LUNA) and hence could easily go to their levels. The platform is believed to be insolvent in a death spiral to death as the developers are alleged to have rugged their own network. Besides, the RUNE/BTC has headed back to the 2020 levels, experiencing a 96% drop from the peak in 2021, which is a major bearish flag for THORFI. As the borrowers may start repaying their loans, Thorchain has to realise losses by minting and selling RUNE. As per some reports, only a minimum amount of BTC & ETH in the Bitcoin and Ethereum pools are left on Thorchain. Hence, the next few hours could be extremely important for the Thorchain & RUNE price as well as the entire crypto space. If the market manages to absorb the shock waves, the FUD could be squashed effectively, but if RUNE/BTC continues to drop, Thorchain is feared to be the next LUNA.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,RUNE|TRADING|LUNA|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-24 07:46:06

Renowned crypto analyst James Check states that there is a lot of resemblance between the price action of the current cycle and that of the 2016 to 2017 cycle. Moreover, he predicts that the market could reach a top of $150,000 soon. Is $150K Top Possible? Let’s examine! Bitcoin’s Path to $150K: Analyst’s View At the start of this month, the BTC price stood at $93,600.90. On January 6, it broke above $100K. Between January 7 and 9, the market faced a correction of 9.45%. On January 17, the market recovered from the correction. On January 20, the market touched a monthly peak of $109,538.17. Currently, the market stands at $104,814.63 – around 4.31% below the aforementioned peak. Check forecasts that the market could reach the range of $120,000 and $150,000 soon. He terms the range as the “topping cloud.” He also warns that if the market rises above the range, it may not hold. Potential Profits for Bitcoin Holders According to Bitbo data, a short-term BTC holder has paid an average price of $90,349 per BTC, and a long-term BTC holder has paid an average price of $24,627. This implies that if the market hits $150,000, a short-term holder will get an average profit of 66.0229%, and a long-term holder an average profit of 509.088%. Comparing 2025 to the 2016-2017 BTC Cycle In the first quarter of 2016, the Bitcoin market recorded a change of -3.25%; in the second, around +61.6%; in the third, -9.34%; and the fourth, +58%. In the first quarter of 2017, the market registered a change of +11.2%; in the second, +131.5%; in the third, +74.1%; and in the fourth, +226.1%. Check states that there are a lot of similarities between the present cycle and the 2016-2017 cycle. In both 2017 and 2016, the market showed impressive performance in the second and the third quarters of the year and expressed weakness in the first quarter. This indicates that the market may experience consolidation until May and a massive surge in the late 2025. Trader’s 2025 Bitcoin Predictions Traders expect strong price movements in 2025, but predictions differ on timing and magnitude. A crypto trader, identified as Bitquant, opines that claims of Bitcoin topping out now are premature. He expresses confidence in the market to gain further. Meanwhile, crypto trader Braver forecasts that the BTC market will demonstrate strong bullish momentum in the first quarter of 2025. Indirectly accepting the argument regarding the similarities between the current cycle and the 2016-2017 cycle, Braver acknowledges the possibility of the market reaching a macro top in the final quarter of the year. However, contrary to this assumption, cryptocurrency trader Mags asserts that the Bitcoin market will reach an all-time high between July and October. As Bitcoin mirrors patterns from the 2016-2017 cycle, analysts and traders forecast significant price movements in 2025.

His comments come amid rising criticism of the Ethereum Foundation, the grant-giving nonprofit that helps support Ethereum, as the asset loses market cap and mindshare to competitors. The widely watched ether-bitcoin ratio is down to 2021 levels. Bitcoin touched a record high above $109,000 earlier Monday and has returned 160% to investors over the past year. Ether, in the meantime, has gained just 40% in the period and is hovering some 30% below its 2021 peak, as a CoinDesk analysis showed. Another call-out was to increase Ethereum’s blob count while setting a minimum price for blobs, viewing them as “another possible revenue generator.” “If you take the average blob fee of the last 30 days, and suppose it stays the same (due to induced demand) while blob count increases to 128, Ethereum would burn 713,000 ETH per year,” Buterin noted, adding that such a favorable demand curve was “not guaranteed” and hence not an isolated strategy to bump ETH’s value. Blobs are like regular transactions with an extra piece of transaction data attached. However, unlike traditional transactions, blob-carrying transactions do not permanently occupy the mainnet space and are only available for 18 days. Since November, the daily tally of blobs averaged a record 21,000, with just two Layer 2s – Coinbase's BASE and World Chain – accounting for 55% of the daily activity. Sustained demand for Layer 2s could quickly deplete available capacity, as a CoinDesk analysis noted earlier in the week.",Markets,EN,0,0,ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BUSINESS|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-24 07:53:08

Success here comes from knowing where to look for information and how to evaluate new opportunities. Key Considerations Before Investing Before getting into new cryptocurrencies, consider these questions: Where does cryptocurrency fit into the bigger picture of your portfolio? Is cryptocurrency a good long-term investment? Should you invest in Initial Coin Offerings? Is it worth investing in NFTs? What is DeFi, and are there investment opportunities there? The crypto market is confusing. Scams and a lack of standardized valuation criteria send investors running for cover. Adding cryptocurrencies to a portfolio, however, can add diversity and high growth potential. Where to Find New Cryptocurrencies You can explore various platforms and tools to discover emerging cryptocurrencies: Cryptocurrency Exchanges Platforms like Binance , Coinbase , Crypto.com , and Kraken are great starting points. Most major exchanges list new coins as they launch. Some exchanges, like Coinbase, require an account to access detailed information about new cryptocurrencies. Data Aggregators Data aggregators provide up-to-date crypto information: CoinMarketCap : Lists new coins along with prices, market caps, and trading volumes. CoinGecko : Offers similar features to help you analyze coins. Social Media Social platforms provide real-time updates on crypto trends: X (formerly Twitter) : Follow developers and projects for updates on new coins. Telegram : Join crypto-related groups for direct communication with project teams. Discord : Many projects maintain servers for announcements and discussions. Specialized Tools Use tools to analyze and verify cryptocurrencies: KryptView : Research tokens by name or address. TokenSniffer : Provides audits of coins, highlighting potential risks. BSCCheck : Examines tokens on the Binance Smart Chain. Websites Explore reputable websites for crypto news and insights: Trading View Top ICO List DEX Screener Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Platforms DeFi platforms like Uniswap , Aave , and Maker allow users to engage in peer-to-peer transactions, lending, and borrowing. Many have native tokens that power their ecosystems. NFT Marketplaces NFTs are digital ownership of assets. New NFTs are listed on platforms such as OpenSea and Rarible. Specialized marketplaces like NBA TopShot sell to niche audiences. Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) ICOs raise funds for new projects. While fewer exist today due to stricter regulations, some opportunities remain. Always check if the ICO is registered with regulatory agencies. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) ETFs offer indirect exposure to cryptocurrencies. For instance, the Bitcoin Spot ETFs approved in 2024 allow investors to purchase shares in funds that hold cryptocurrencies. Evaluating New Cryptocurrencies Once you identify potential investments, analyze them carefully. Here are some factors to consider: Use Cases What purpose does cryptocurrency serve? Coins with strong use cases, like Ethereum (ETH) for smart contracts , often have higher potential. Market Metrics Review these key metrics: Price : Current value per coin. Market Cap : Total value of all circulating coins. Trading Volume : Amount traded in the last 24 hours. Community and Social Sentiment A strong community often supports a coin’s growth. Check forums, social media, and project updates to gauge sentiment. Regulations and Legal Status Ensure the cryptocurrency complies with local laws. Avoid coins involved in legal disputes or regulatory issues. Whitepapers A project’s whitepaper explains its purpose and technology. Analyze its clarity and feasibility. Tools for Analysis Here’s a quick comparison of popular tools: Tool Function Key Features CoinMarketCap Tracks new cryptocurrencies Prices, market cap, trading volumes TokenSniffer Analyzes token legitimacy Contract audits, risk flags, holder analysis KryptView Provides token research Holder data, transaction details Trading View Offers technical analysis tools Charts, price trends Common Red Flags Watch out for these warning signs to avoid scams: Exaggerated Promises : Claims of guaranteed returns. Lack of Transparency : Incomplete or vague whitepapers. High Concentration : Large token supplies held by few wallets. Unverified Contracts : Missing or unverified contract details. Staying Informed The crypto market changes rapidly. To stay ahead, regularly monitor: New listings on exchanges. Social media updates from project teams. Trends in DeFi platforms and NFT marketplaces. Investing in new cryptocurrencies can be exciting and profitable. Use reliable sources, conduct thorough research, and stay vigilant against scams. By following this guide, you can explore opportunities while minimizing risks.

Dog-themed Dogcoin (DCOIN), a memecoin project launched on the Ethereum (ETH) network, has registered palpable gains in the past 24 hours backed by a robust online community of investors. According to the latest market data, DCOIN price was up around 500 percent to trade about $0.00455 on Friday, during the early London session. The small-cap memecoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $4.5 million, had a 24-hour average traded volume of about $12.3 million, up over 13x. Top Reasons Why Dogcoin (DCOIN) Has Gained Significant Organic Traction Already listed on the Biconomy Exchange, the DCOIN memecoin has attracted more than 1.5k on-chain holders. Furthermore, the DCOIN developers did not participate in presale nor team allocations but provided the entire supply of the memecoin to the liquidity pool. According to market data from Dexscreener, nearly 40 Ethereum (ETH), worth about $130k, has been locked in the liquidity pool on the Uniswap protocol to ensure seamless DeFi trading. Consequently, crypto traders can seamlessly access DCOIN memecoin via top wallets – such as MetaMask and Trust Walley – without any hidden fees. “Dogcoin offers a chance to be part of a truly community-powered project.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Rekt Capital tells his 105,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin may be about to exit a corrective phase and enter another price discovery phase based on a historical pattern. Crypto traders and analysts refer to price discovery as a situation where a coin trades at levels never seen before in its history. “We’re already seeing this U-shaped reversal. So what is the confirmation signal that we need to see before we transition into the second price discovery uptrend? Because this corrective period is pretty much over. We haven’t really broken to new highs sustainably. We have made new all-time highs, but I’d like to see candle body new all-time highs just to showcase that this is a sustainable breakout and that we’re going to continue rallying higher. We need to see confirmation of breaking those old all-time highs and that final major resistance on the weekly time frame.” Rekt Capital/YouTube The analyst says that price discovery may ignite once Bitcoin overcomes the $104,671 level on the weekly chart. “The takeaway is very very simple: weekly close above this final major resistance and we might very well be off to the races.” Bitcoin is trading for $103,621 at time of writing. ?

Solana shows promise with its fast blockchain, Ripple remains a top choice for global payments and Remittix is making waves with its affordable and quick cross-border solutions. These projects are catching investors attention, offering potential for growth and making them some of the best coins to watch this year. Solana’s Price Drops but Hopes for a Rebound Stay Strong From its all-time high of $295.83 which it attained on January 19, Solana (SOL) has fallen 14%. Though the price has dropped, many investors still think Solana might recover and soar shortly. More people purchasing Solana once more is one encouraging indication. Solana’s spot market witnessed a lot of money streaming in over the previous day, indicating rising curiosity in the cryptocurrency. This is a significant departure from only one day before, when $137 million left Solana’s market the most in thirty days. Solana’s price has increased by 15% throughout the last 7 days in response to this revived interest. More people buying than selling drives the price up. This indicates that, looking for another significant price increase, investors are beginning to purchase once again and are convinced in Solana’s future. Although Solana’s price has suffered, its demand and purchasing activities may assist in recovery. Many feel it might not only hit its all-time high but even surpass it. XRP Price Might Drop Soon, But Don’t Worry! The price of XRP could somewhat decline during the next twelve hours. However, there is no need to worry, this is really normal! Calculations based on how bitcoin behaved throughout the last 24 hours may affect prices including XRP. This indicates just how the system operates, not because anything negative occurred. Many analysts believe XRP’s price will get stronger between January 19th and 20th, so long-term things seem favorable. Those who do not observe daily percentage-based pricing adjustments would notably benefit from this information. If you have been concerned, keep in mind that cryptocurrencies operate with these little fluctuations. People who are already aware of crypto movements most likely realize this is not very significant. Thus, simply be patient if you see XRP’s price declining momentarily. After these little adjustments, prices usually recover and even strengthen. Here’s Why Remittix Could Be the Next Big Thing in Crypto Remittix is changing how we send money worldwide by combining blockchain technology with regular money systems. It allows people to make fast and affordable cross-border payments. With support for over 40 cryptocurrencies, like Cardano, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin and Ethereum, Remittix can instantly convert these digital currencies into regular money, like USD or GBP. This means your money can be sent straight to a recipient’s bank account quickly and easily. Unlike traditional payment services like Stripe, Wise or even crypto-only platforms like Coinbase Wallet, Remittix stands out. It supports over 30 fiat currencies and 50 crypto pairs, making it one of the best coins to buy now if you’re looking for a platform with versatility and convenience. What makes Remittix special is its flat-fee system. Instead of charging hidden costs like many banks, it ensures that the exact amount you send reaches the recipient. This feature makes it one of the best coins to invest today for people and businesses looking for a fair, cost-effective way to transfer money. Currently, in this presale phase, the price for this RTX presale token stage is available for just $0.0282, making it an attractive option for early investors. Experts predict it could grow 25 times during the presale phase and gain over 5,000% after launch. For those seeking the best coins to buy now or the best coin to invest today, RTX offers incredible potential. By providing solutions similar to XRP but with more inclusive and advanced technology, Remittix is paving the way for a new era of global payments.

In 2027, it will range between $2.47 and $2.80, with an average price of $2.54. In 2030, it will range between $7.94 and $9.64, with an average price of $8.17. Unlike the common sentiment of being a meme token, ApeCoin (APE) has utility. APE is an ERC-20 token that governs the ApeCoin DAO. The token also has utility within an affiliated company, Yuga Labs, the firm behind the Otherside metaverse, BAYC, and MAYC NFTs. Will APE reach $10? What will be its price in 2025? Let’s explore these and more in the Cryptopolitan Price Prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Apecoin Ticker APE Current price $1.02 Market cap $765.95M Trading volume $92.79M Circulating supply 752.65M All-time high $39.40 on Mar 17, 2022 All-time low $0.4826 on Aug 5, 2024 24-hour high $1.03 24-hour low $0.9757 APE price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 9.19% 50-day SMA $1.2963 200-day SMA $0.9811 Sentiment Bearish Fear and Greed Index 75 (Greed) Green days 14/30 (47%) APE price analysis As of the time of writing (January 24), APE’s price had dropped by 12.66% in one week but up 2.03% in the last 24 hours, trading at approximately $1.02. The cryptocurrency’s trading volume rose by 25.30% in 24 hours. APE/USD 1-day chart analysis APE/USD 1-day price chart APE rose above $2 in December, reaching a high of $2.57, after which it started correcting. It now trades below the $1.10 mark. The MACD histogram shows the price is experiencing little momentum as it continues to drop. The William Alligator trendlines show high market volatility. APE/USD 4-hour chart analysis APE/USD 4-hour price chart The 4-hour chart highlights APE’s drop after it peaked at $1.40 on January 6. It registered continuous red candles as it fell closer to $1. At current levels, the drop has slowed with waning volatility.

APE price analysis shows the market has been bearish despite registering little momentum in recent days, meaning the bears are still in control. Why is APE down? APE is correcting from highs registered in the last quarter of 2024. The rdro could be attributed to the wider market sentiment. Will APE reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, APE will break above $10 in 2030. At the time, APE should have bridged to ApeChain and grown much utility and applications such as in the metaverse. Will APE reach $100? It is unlikely that the APE price will be extended to $100 in the foreseeable future. At such a valuation, APE will be more valuable than the USDT stablecoin, which is more of a ‘household’ cryptocurrency. Will APE reach $1000? It is unlikely that the APE price will reach $1000 before 2030. Is APE a good investment? APE’s utility is growing, and the launch of ApeChain is anticipated to attract more projects that use the APE token either for governance or settling fees on the chain. Yuga Labs and other new firms will likely promote APE. Recent news/ updates With the launch of ApeChain, APE proceeded to pump by over 100% accompanied by the launch of new projects such as Donkey Dash, Ape Express, Battle Plan, and the Ape Portal.

Solana’s ETF Race and Hedera’s Enterprise Partnerships appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency landscape continues to thrive as groundbreaking projects redefine blockchain applications. Qubetics , Solana, and Hedera exemplify this innovation, offering compelling opportunities for growth in 2025. From revolutionizing asset markets to navigating ETF approval and providing enterprise-grade blockchain solutions, these cryptocurrencies stand out as the best cryptos to buy for January 2025. Qubetics: Transforming Asset Markets with Tokenization The Qubetics tokenized assets marketplace is set to revolutionize traditional asset markets by addressing limited liquidity and lack of transparency. Qubetics enables seamless trading and efficient holdings management by creating a secondary market for tokenized assets . This increased liquidity accelerates the appreciation of asset values and empowers investors with greater flexibility to realize their gains. At the core of Qubetics’ success is the $TICS token, which continues to generate significant interest during its 18th presale stage. Priced at $0.0551, the token has raised $10.4 million, attracting a robust community of 15,700 holders who have acquired 435 million tokens. With the best crypto presale’s conclusion set to raise the price to $0.25, early investors are positioned to achieve an impressive ROI of 354%. Experts further project the token to surge to $10–$15 post-mainnet launch, solidifying Qubetics as a transformative force in the blockchain ecosystem and one of the best cryptos to buy for January 2025. Solana: Navigating the ETF Approval Buzz Solana (SOL) remains in the spotlight as industry leaders and investors closely monitor the race for Solana ETF approval. At the time of writing, Solana is priced at $249.54, reflecting a 2.58% dip in the past 24 hours, with a market cap of $121.39 billion and a trading volume of $9.05 billion. The recent price decline is linked to concerns over network stability, particularly transaction delays on Coinbase. These challenges have raised questions about Solana’s reliability despite the excitement surrounding the potential Solana ETF approval date. However, Solana’s long-term prospects remain optimistic due to its robust ecosystem, innovative development, and increasing adoption. As the ETF approval process unfolds, Solana’s position as a leader in the blockchain space ensures its continued relevance, making it a strong contender for the best cryptos to buy for January 2025.

Meanwhile, Hedera’s enterprise-grade blockchain solutions, bolstered by partnerships with tech giants like Google and IBM, highlight its potential to lead the future of scalable, real-world applications. Together, these projects encapsulate the evolution of blockchain technology and why they are among the best cryptos to buy for January 2025, paving the way for a more interconnected and efficient digital economy.

Jake Auchincloss demand U.S. regulators investigate President Trump’s TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins. In a letter addressed to multiple federal agencies, including the US Office of Government Ethics, the SEC, the Treasury and the CFTC, Warren and Auchincloss outlined several concerns regarding the Trump family’s line of meme coins . One of the main concerns raised in the document is the potential ethics violation that comes with the mass token launch, as basically anyone in the world could purchase TRUMP ( TRUMP ) and boost the President’s net worth, including “secretive foreign buyers seeking to curry influence with the administration.” “Anyone, including the leaders of hostile nations, can covertly buy these coins, raising the specter of uninhibited and untraceable foreign influence over the President of the United States,” wrote Warren and Auchincloss in a joint letter. In the document, the pair noted that Trump and his wife’s combined net worth has surged to $58 billion overnight, thanks to the meme coins named after them which now represent nearly 90% of the 47th President’s net worth. They also claim the Trump organization has gained a profit of $58 million in trading fees alone by Jan. 20.

However, its value has since crashed by more than 50%, from $73 to $34. According to data from crypto.news, TRUMP’s market cap currently stands at $6.8 billion. Meanwhile, MELANIA ( MELANIA ) suffered an even greater loss. Despite bouncing to an all-time high of $13 on launch day, the token’s value has since fallen by 80% to only $2.56. Are TRUMP and MELANIA heading towards a rug-pull? In the letter, Warren and Auchincloss noted that the Trump meme coins came with a disclaimer that say the “Trump Memes” are only meant to be symbol of support for Trump’s ideals and beliefs and are not considered “the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any type.” “The terms and conditions of both TRUMP and MELANIA purport to indemnify the coins from any fraud-related claims and prevent purchasers from joining class action lawsuits against the coin or its issuers,” wrote Warren and Auchincloss in the letter. They questioned whether this disclaimer was enough to exempt the meme coins from federal law, deterring investors from filing complaints in the event of a major loss. However, they asked regulators if they would commit to investigating the tokens if investors did file complaints. The pair claimed that 80% of the TRUMP meme coins are reportedly held by CIC Digital and Fight Fight Fight LLC, two companies affiliated with the Trump Organization, citing a CNN report . They alleged that these organizations could easily sell their holdings and gain enormous profits, while simultaneously triggering a sharp decline in the coin’s value leading to major financial losses for other investors. As previously reported by crypto.news, Chainalysis found that around 60 wallets hold the majority of the funds generated by the TRUMP token. The firm also noted that over 77% of TRUMP-holding wallets made a profit worth less than $100.

DTX Exchange, a buzzworthy platform, facilitates the trading of various assets between fiat and cryptocurrencies. It's poised to deliver spectacular returns in 2025 and aims to be the standout DeFi project of that year. SHIB has dominated the meme coin space with a market cap of $13 billion. Significant capital is required for price increments, meaning Shiba Inu's price will likely remain volatile. Analysts aren't feeling optimistic, but with superior alternatives emerging, traders can lock in their profits and transition to DTX Exchange for improved returns. Analysts Forecast Shiba Inu Price Adjustment As the second most favored meme coin, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen renewed interest with the introduction of the TRUMP coin. The price of Shiba Inu was erratic last week, showing both losses and gains, leaving predictions less than hopeful. Currently, Shiba Inu's price stands at $0.00002092, and it's anticipated to increase at a modest 3.5% inflation rate. The token faces uncertainty, and a bullish path is necessary to enhance its long-term prospects. Presently, Shiba Inu's price is testing resistance levels, a crucial point that could determine its future. A breakthrough could eventually drive the price much higher. If met with rejection at this pivotal resistance, SHIB may retest support levels, negating any bullish potential and dropping easily to $0.00001946. Reaching the all-time high seems a distant dream, and garnering support and attracting more buyers is essential to push the price upward. The price of Shiba Inu has also been buoyed by network activity, with the SHIB community burning tokens. This scarcity naturally pushes prices up. DTX Exchange: A DeFi Project Worth Watching DTX Exchange sets itself apart with its offerings for traders and investors. As an innovative and disruptive force, it’s not only a promising investment but also a valuable addition to the blockchain ecosystem. DTX is set to revolutionize trading by integrating fiat assets and crypto derivatives on a single, seamless platform. The DTX token, powered by the DTX Exchange network, is on track to become a high-potential investment. Its practical applications and possible institutional acceptance suggest that its price could surpass $1 upon listing. Currently priced at an accessible $0.14, the presale has already amassed $11.8 million. DTX offers exceptional speed, 1000x leverage, AI trading tools, a profit-sharing scheme, and access to 120,000 assets. The Phoenix Wallet, downloaded 300,000 times, serves as an ideal noncustodial solution supporting over 10,000 assets. Important Points DTX is set to transform how global trade markets operate. It will bring transparency and trust to centralized markets, linking them with the digital asset industry.

Amid this, a recent report hints toward a potential BTC rally by 20% during the Chinese New Year, citing historical trends. Besides, it also comes amid soaring market optimism over a potential Bitcoin Strategic Reserve and pro-crypto regulations in the US, especially after Donald Trump’s inauguration. Bitcoin News: Why BTC Can Rally This Chinese New Year? The Chinese New Year has proven to be a bullish period for Bitcoin. In 11 out of the last 12 years, Bitcoin delivered positive returns during this festive season, achieving an 83% success rate, Matrixport reported . The report attributes this trend to heightened trading activity, as families and investors exchange gifts and funds, driving demand for Bitcoin. Meanwhile, the on-chain analytics firm highlights China’s dominance in Bitcoin’s early days. By 2014, the country controlled nearly 70% of global Bitcoin trading , fueled by strict capital controls, speculative investments, and large-scale mining operations. Besides, the Chinese tech sector played a pivotal role, in building mining rigs and increasing the number of validation nodes globally. In addition, the report noted that as more people learn about and buy Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency gains momentum. However, few events rival the Chinese New Year in amplifying this network effect. Source: Matrixport, X Major Technical, Macroeconomic, & Global Factors At Play Matrixport noted that Bitcoin’s current price is influenced by conflicting forces. On the technical side, oversold indicators suggest potential support, while weekly metrics point to overbought conditions. On the macroeconomic front, the Federal Reserve’s hawkish policies and tightening liquidity present challenges. However, expectations of the US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve under a pro-crypto Trump presidency offer bullish support. Meanwhile, Donald Trump made a flurry of pro-crypto promises during his election campaign, which bolstered market sentiment. Besides, the US SEC has also rescinded the SAB 121 crypto accounting rule, which has further fueled market sentiment. On the other hand, Trump has recently reiterated his stance on making the US the crypto capital. Besides, his pro-crypto focus is also evidenced by the recent executive order to create a national digital asset stockpile. Simultaneously, Matrixport noted that stablecoin minting remains subdued post-December’s FOMC meeting, signaling limited fiat inflows. However, funding rates for Bitcoin show early signs of recovery. This delicate balance has kept Bitcoin prices in a consolidation phase, poised for potential breakout opportunities. Can BTC Surge 20% This Chinese New Year? The Chinese New Year, starting January 29, marks a statistically significant period for Bitcoin. In 2022 and 2023, Bitcoin surged by 26% and 23%, respectively, reinforcing the reliability of this seasonal trend. Meanwhile, Matrixport analysts emphasize this period as the “most favorable 20-day window” for Bitcoin , offering promising opportunities for long positions. With daily reversal indicators signaling potential, many traders see the festive season as a unique catalyst for growth. Having said that, a BTC rally by 20% is likely if the history repeats this year. However, investors remained cautious, given some recent Bitcoin news that has dampened the market sentiment. For context, recent reports of China dumping its BTC holdings have added to concern this week amid a volatile market trend. What’s Next For Bitcoin Price? BTC price today delivered more than a 3% gain to trade at $105,489, with its trading volume soaring 65% to $99 billion. Notably, the crypto has touched an all-time high of $109K on Trump’s inauguration day, reflecting the market’s growing confidence. However, the current Relative Strength Index stands at 61, signaling a strong uptrend momentum for the crypto.

This move has coincided with a significant drop in Ripple’s XRP. Leading the charge, IntelMarkets is shaking up the trillion-dollar crypto landscape with its remarkable AI integration and deployment of automated trading robots, generating substantial gains. What’s Behind XRP’s Decline? Here’s the Scoop. Ripple’s XRP has taken a hit as several crypto markets experienced sell-offs today. The price plummeted over 5% amidst a broad crypto downturn affecting numerous major digital currencies. Ongoing regulatory uncertainties surrounding XRP have heightened investment risks, exacerbating market pressures. XRP's price edged near the $3 support level, surprising many traders. It is positioned close to the upper edge of the Bollinger Bands on both daily and weekly charts. Increased activity from short sellers has further driven the price downward. Various market analysts anticipate multiple potential outcomes for XRP's price in the immediate future. Even if current support levels hold, another 10% drop in value could occur. Some analyses suggest that if the selling doesn’t cease or slow down, XRP might lose roughly a third of its value. Major exchanges are reporting substantial sell-offs as the market downturn gathers momentum. Melania Trump Unveils Memecoin Amid Trump Presidency Ahead of her husband Donald Trump's inauguration as U.S. president, Melania Trump has introduced her own cryptocurrency named Melania. The token, hosted on the Solana blockchain, enters the market with a valuation of $1.7 billion, following the previous launch of $TRUMP, which currently holds a $12 billion valuation. She revealed the launch on social media platform X, inviting users to join the ‘Official Melania Meme’ movement. Both the $MELANIA and $TRUMP websites feature disclaimers stating that the tokens are not meant as investment vehicles or securities, adding a strategic note of caution to their marketing efforts. These developments reflect a complete turnaround in the Trump family's stance on digital currencies, with Donald Trump having previously dismissed crypto as a ‘scam.’ During his campaign, however, he embraced the sector, vowing to reduce regulatory obstacles and establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. His election victory also boosted market optimism, pushing BTC to a new all-time high of $107,000. AI-Powered Crypto Trading Platform Challenges Industry Leaders While the changing market sentiment has resulted in significant declines in XRP, a formidable competitor is quietly gearing up for a major launch. IntelMarkets , a dual-chain AI-based crypto trading platform, offers up to 1,000x leverage and advanced trading tools for its users. So far, INTL has become the year's hottest presale, with over $7 million already raised. With ongoing enhancements and practical product launches, IntelMarkets is poised to outshine major cryptocurrency players thanks to its widespread adoption among institutional investors and retail traders. The platform’s dual-functionality offers traders the flexibility to select their preferred blockchain based on their trading strategies. IntelMarkets’ Presale Stage 8 Sells Out Rapidly: Advances to Stage 9 IntelMarkets completed its presale rounds ahead of schedule, according to expert analysts. They claim that if the platform maintains its current momentum among investors, it could become the next XRP. With its strong statistics and bullish transactions, IntelMarkets is set to surpass projects like Ripple soon after its listing. As Ripple’s XRP faces resistance from investors, leading to significant sell-offs and ecosystem dips, IntelMarkets is receiving extraordinary support from the market. With over $1,610,000 raised from Fortune 500 investors and support from a Sovereign Wealth Fund, IntelMarkets is on the brink of emerging as the top altcoin of 2025. Join now!

Investors are keenly observing the evolving dynamics to predict the next big move. Trump's Inauguration Causes Crypto Turbulence: $XYZ Meme Coin Set for a Massive 99,900% Surge The upcoming inauguration of Donald Trump is shaking up the crypto market, paving the way for an unprecedented bull run. As the initial excitement wanes, major cryptocurrencies manage only modest double-digit gains, while meme coins are capturing the spotlight. Remember PNUT's 4,500% spike or FRED's 6,000% leap? Those are tales of the past, overshadowed by fleeting hype. These coins crumbled under the pressure of mass sell-offs, leaving hopeful investors with losses. But the crypto arena is ruthless — a new powerhouse is emerging, aiming to shatter profit records with an extraordinary 99,900% rise.

Solana's SOL: A Fast Track in the Crypto World Picture a world where digital transactions are nearly instantaneous. That's the promise of Solana. This innovative blockchain platform focuses on speed and scalability without relying on complex solutions to improve performance. Its unique architecture allows for rapid transaction processing, making it an ideal platform for decentralized applications, competing with giants like Ethereum and Cardano. The SOL coin fuels this ecosystem, enabling transactions, running applications, and rewarding network supporters. So, should SOL catch your eye now? With its speedy network and adaptable development options, Solana is drawing the attention of developers and investors. Its ability to handle high-demand projects without delays gives it an edge over some competitors. In today's market, where speed and scalability matter, SOL stands out. While Ethereum grapples with congestion and some platforms need additional layers to scale, Solana remains straightforward and efficient. This makes SOL a compelling choice for those interested in a cryptocurrency backed by solid technology and promising potential. Dogecoin: From Meme to Market Player Dogecoin started as a joke in 2013, created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer. They envisioned a fun alternative to Bitcoin, using a Shiba Inu meme as its emblem. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has an unlimited supply, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially viewed as a ""memecoin,"" its value surged in 2021, propelled by social media and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin entered the top ten cryptocurrencies, valued at over $50 billion, showcasing the influence of community and social media in financial markets. Dogecoin's strength lies in its community and brand recognition. Its technology, built on Litecoin, facilitates quick transactions with minimal fees. While other cryptocurrencies emphasize scarcity, Dogecoin's abundance promotes spending and tipping. In today's market, there's a demand for cryptocurrencies with practical uses and robust networks. Developments like potential payment adoption add to Dogecoin's allure. However, the crypto market's volatility means Dogecoin's price is influenced by social media. Compared to other coins, Dogecoin offers simplicity and fun. Whether it's appealing now depends on market conditions and investor interest, but its journey from a meme to a serious contender is remarkable. XRP: The Swift Crypto Revolutionizing Global Transactions XRP is a digital currency designed for fast, cost-effective transfers. Backed by the XRP Ledger, it aims to simplify moving money, much like sending an email. Developed by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP debuted with 100 billion coins, most of which were allocated to Ripple, a company enhancing the network and supporting its expansion. XRP operates independently of a central authority, ensuring secure and irreversible transactions across borders without the need for a bank account. The name XRP derives from ""ripple credits,"" underscoring its mission to streamline payments across currencies. XRP's appeal lies in its speed and affordability. Transactions are completed in seconds, significantly faster than Bitcoin or Ethereum, making it ideal for global money transfers without exorbitant fees or delays. In today's market, XRP distinguishes itself with a focus on real-world payments. As demand for efficient fund transfers grows, XRP's usage could increase. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, XRP emphasizes seamless transactions rather than merely being a store of value. With trends favoring faster, cheaper transactions, XRP appears well-positioned to make a notable impact. Conclusion While SOL, DOGE, and XRP are making strides, XYZVerse's unique sports meme platform and ambitious growth objectives set it apart as a prominent player in the current bullish market.

Its ability to capture attention is partly due to its commitment to making tangible positive impacts beyond just financial profits.

Its mascot, Pnut, resembles a playful squirrel akin to the Pepe meme, embodying a cheerful community vibe. Users can acquire PNUT on platforms like Jupiter Aggregator. Whether PNUT appeals in the present market depends on personal interests and trends, as its meme-centric nature sets it apart from conventional cryptocurrencies.

Pierre Rochard, a vice president at Riot Platforms , has accused Ripple of leading a major lobbying effort to derail the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, claiming the company is still throwing millions of dollars at politicians “desperately trying to derail it.” The biggest obstacle for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is not the Fed, Treasury, banks, or Elizabeth Warren.

Ethena (ENA) Aims for a Climb Amid Mixed Market Signals Ethena (ENA) is currently trading between $0.71 and $0.99, teetering around significant trends. The coin encounters resistance at $1.14 and has support at $0.58. Despite a recent 26% decline over the past month, it has shown promising growth of approximately 90% over the last six months. The momentum is mixed, with an RSI below 50 and a stochastic reading of 57.82, indicating potential for upward movement. Surpassing the resistance at $1.14 could pave the way for a new attempt at $1.42. Breaking through this level might result in noteworthy gains. However, maintaining above the 100-day moving average of $0.91 is critical for sustaining a positive trend. Worldcoin (WLD) Prepares for a Possible Comeback Worldcoin is striving for a recovery. Its current price fluctuates between $1.71 and $2.24, just below the 10-day simple moving average of $2.01. The nearest resistance is at $2.58, and overcoming it could push the price toward $3.12, representing a rise of more than 30% from its current high. The RSI is below 50, suggesting Worldcoin is not overbought. Weekly, it's down over 7%, and monthly, it's over 16% down. Bulls are optimistic that Worldcoin can reverse this trend. With the crypto market showing bullish signs, Worldcoin could see brighter days soon. Fantom's Ascent: Get Ready for a Major Move! Fantom (FTM) is showing potential with its current trading range between $0.20 and $0.30. It recently experienced a surge of over 5% in a week, indicating the start of an upward trend. The nearest resistance is at $0.35, and breaking this level could propel it toward $0.40 rapidly. The 10-day moving average points to bullish momentum, potentially leading to a 30% increase in the near future. Chart indicators like MACD and RSI are stable, suggesting room for growth. Strong support above $0.20 reduces downside risks. Brace yourself, as Fantom might be on the verge of a breakout. Solana Poised for a Potential Breakout Amid Market Optimism Solana's price is showing bullish tendencies, currently moving between $182 and $308. It has recently gained over 34% in a week and nearly 47% in six months. Its RSI suggests it's not overbought, leaving room for further growth. The closest barrier is at $365; breaking this could drive prices towards $491. The recent price increase and proximity to resistance levels indicate potential upward movement. Momentum indicators like the Stochastic also support a positive trend. The Solana network continues to attract attention for its speed and efficiency, further boosting investor interest. As altcoins gain traction, Solana may experience significant growth soon. Conclusion While ENA, WLD, FTM, and SOL show promise, their short-term gains might be limited. Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin champion, offering a path to financial freedom. With a 700% ROI potential during its presale (from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages) and triple utility—governance, incentives, staking—it unites enthusiasts to combat crypto villains.

Among these, Ripple (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and the new entrant, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) , are making considerable waves. These cryptocurrencies are showing potential, driven by market trends, technical indicators, and growing user adoption. XRP Update: Surge Driven by Market Optimism and Legal News Ripple’s XRP has recently seen an uptick in value, with its price reaching $3.37 on Coinmarketcap. This represents a 24.5% increase over the past week, positioning XRP among the top performers in the crypto space. Investor interest is largely fueled by Ripple's ongoing legal battle with the U.S. SEC. A court decision recently clarified that XRP is not considered a security for public sales, boosting investor confidence. With the SEC's appeal still underway, the market remains hopeful for a favorable outcome. Ripple continues to foster partnerships with financial institutions and remains vital for cross-border transactions. Analysts predict XRP might soon test new peaks, with targets around $4.40 based on technical analysis. Should regulatory clarity improve, XRP's price could reach between $5 and $7 by the end of 2025, making it a viable long-term investment option. Source X Dogecoin News: DOGE Regains Strength Amid Market Revival Dogecoin, the leading memecoin, has climbed 10% over the past week, with its price now standing at $0.40549 on Coinmarketcap. This surge coincides with a general rise in memecoin popularity and Bitcoin's trading above $100,000. The rise in DOGE is partially due to an increase in whale activity, with 200 million DOGE tokens accumulated in just two days. This heightened demand has fueled a bullish momentum, with technical patterns suggesting a potential climb to $1.75. The growing acceptance of DOGE is bolstered by strong community support and its integration into various payment platforms. Source X Cardano Forecast: ADA Nears Crucial Resistance Points Cardano (ADA) is off to a strong start in 2025, surging by 17% in the past week, with its price now at $1.13 on Coinmarketcap. This growth is supported by increased whale activity, with the number of wallets holding between one and ten million ADA steadily rising. ADA's technical outlook is promising, as indicated by upward-trending EMAs and a recent golden cross formation. The coin is poised to tackle the first major resistance at $1.15, with additional targets of $1.50 and $1.63. A key support level at $1.03 is crucial for maintaining this bullish trend. Long-term ADA holders remain optimistic, with noted trader Peter Brandt observing a double-bottom base that could signal the start of a significant bull run.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum managed to hold above $3,300 and closed this week with a 1% price increase. While this is not much, it does show that buyers are resilient at this key support level. The longer this happens, the more confidence the market will have in ETH moving higher. The current price action is also turning positive if we look at the momentum indicators on the daily timeframe. The MACD made a bullish cross recently and the RSI is making higher lows. These are early signals that Ethereum could soon wake up to challenge the resistance levels at $3,600 and $4,000 again. Looking ahead, Ethereum could surprise the market with a sharp move considering it did not do much in the past month while other altcoins like XRP and Solana made new price records. Eventually, profits will rotate and Ethereum is definitely one of the top candidates for market participants. Chart by Tradingview Ripple ( XRP ) XRP is down almost 5% on the weekly chart after it failed to rally above $3.4. The price is currently around $3.2 at the time of this writing and buyers seem absent or uninterested. Therefore, the cryptocurrency has been consolidating above the $3 key support level. As long as XRP stays above $3, there is a good shot at higher levels. But the longer buyers delay a clear breakout above $3.4 the more concerned holders will become. This is why it is critical for XRP to continue its rally. Looking ahead, the coin seems at a critical junction here. A failure to move higher could soon be interpreted as bearish and see the price break under $3. On the other hand, breaking above $3.4 would quickly see XRP move towards $4 next. Chart by Tradingview Cardano (ADA) ADA is down 11% on the weekly chart after sellers pushed the price down from $1.1 to $1 which acts as a key support. So far, buyers managed to keep this cryptocurrency above this level, but momentum is not really on their side. If we zoom out, ADA has been in a range since late November 2024 when it was rejected at $1.3 which also acts as an important resistance. The strongest support is found at 90 cents. As long as the price does not leave this range, the consolidation period continues. Looking ahead, Cardano seems to be in an impasse which reminds us of XRP’s price action. A clean breakout is required to resume the bullish trend, but until it happens, any delay could test the patience of ADA holders. Chart by Tradingview Binance Coin (BNB) Binance Coin closes the week with a 4% loss after it failed to stay above $700. But sellers don’t seem too interested in taking BNB lower at this time. Hence, the price has been hovering around the key support at $690. This lack of momentum has turned the action quite flat. What is worrying, however, is that the daily MACD has turned bearish this week. This could lead to additional selling pressure later on. Looking ahead, BNB could fall to $650 if sellers return or even to $600. These are the next key support levels should $690 break in the next few days. If so, that would likely indicate an overall market correction that could also see ADA and XRP make lower lows. Chart by Tradingview Solana (SOL) Solana continues to impress with a 22% rally in the past week and a new record price at $295. This is mainly due to the renewed attention to its chain after Trump launched its own meme token on Solana last Saturday. With liquidity fighting to reach Solana from all other competing chains, SOL saw a huge influx of liquidity and demand. This quickly pumped its price. Since then, the price entered a shallow correction that saw the price briefly drop to $230 before returning to $260 as of today. As long as the meme mania on Solana continues, this will sustain and push SOL’s price higher. Looking ahead, while the Trump meme FOMO subsided since last week, new meme tokens are being released daily that attract liquidity to Solana. This is bullish for SOL’s price and could see it make new price records in the future that could exceed $300.

As a result, analysts like Markus Thielen predict major growth for Ethereum. Meanwhile, the launch of Etherealize could also attract traditional finance players to Ethereum's ecosystem. Internal changes in the Ethereum Foundation, including calls for new leadership and a larger role for Consensys, are all signs that the ecosystem is more than ready to adapt to the much more favorable regulatory and market environment under President Donald Trump. Analysts Expect Ethereum to Rally Ethereum (ETH) may be on the verge of a major breakout after the pivotal decision by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to cancel a crypto accounting rule that previously prevented financial firms from offering cryptocurrency services. The SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 was introduced in March of 2022, and it required firms holding cryptocurrencies to record them as liabilities on their balance sheets. However, on Jan. 23, the SEC revoked this rule. Markus Thielen , head of research at 10x Research, pointed out the potential impact that this decision could have on Ethereum. He suggested that this regulatory shift could catalyze the expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi) services, of which Ethereum is a core infrastructure of the ecosystem. Thielen also mentioned that despite typically not being an avid advocate for Ethereum, its current price action presents a very compelling case for a low-risk, high-reward opportunity. At press time, ETH was trading hands at $3,373 after its price jumped by more than 4% over the past 24 hours of trading. Thielen suggested that there is a very real possibility of a breakout above the current triangle pattern on Ether’s chart. (Source: 10x Research ) The potential for Ethereum to reach new heights caused a lot of optimism among other crypto analysts as well. Titan of Crypto stated on social media that a $7,000 price for Ethereum is “inevitable.” Another trader called Crypto Caesar also predicted a surge for the asset. These bullish sentiments align with broader developments in the Ethereum ecosystem, including the anticipated approval of Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that allow staking, which was recently pointed out by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin. Lubin also revealed that the Trump family could soon expand its presence in the cryptocurrency space by building large-scale businesses on Ethereum. Ethereum Gets a Boost with New Institutional Marketing Arm ETH’s price could also receive a nice boost now that Etherealize , a new Ethereum-focused marketing firm, recently launched. Its main mission is to promote Ethereum and its token Ether to institutional investors. The project is backed by funding from the Ethereum Foundation and co-founder Vitalik Buterin, and debuted on Jan. 22. Overall, it plans to bridge the gap in institutional understanding of blockchain technology. Anthony Sassano, host of The Daily Gwei, praised the timing of the launch, and pointed to the pro-crypto stance of the Trump administration as an ideal backdrop for Etherealize to advocate for Ethereum's potential on Wall Street. Ethereum struggled to reclaim its all-time high of over $4,800 that was set in 2021, even after ETFs for ETH launched in the United States last July. On the other hand, Bitcoin soared to new peaks, driven by huge inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs and optimism surrounding President Trump’s crypto-friendly policies. The company is co-founded with TradFi veterans Vivek Raman and James Fickel, and it offers a suite of tools for institutions to tokenize real-world assets on Ethereum. This approach is very similar to efforts by other major financial players like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and Guggenheim, which have already started exploring tokenization on blockchain networks. Raman believes tokenization has the potential to transform industries like treasury markets, mutual funds, stocks, bonds, commodities, and real estate, by building on the early success of stablecoins. He pointed out that public blockchains like Ethereum can enable institutions to reduce costs and improve operational efficiency by using tokenized assets for trade and commerce. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently said something very similar by calling for the rapid approval of tokenization for bonds and stocks by the US SEC. BlackRock’s own tokenized money market fund on Ethereum attracted over $394 million, ranking as the third-largest tokenized treasury asset according to data from Dune Analytics . The Ethereum Foundation also recently announced plans to allocate 50,000 ETH, which is valued at close to $164 million, to support Ethereum’s decentralized finance ecosystem. Vitalik Buterin revealed that the nonprofit will undergo organizational changes to better support developers and enhance transparency in the community. Consensys Ready to Take Bigger Role in Ethereum Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin recently voiced his support for an overhaul of the Ethereum Foundation (EF) and shared that he is ready for his company, Consensys, to take on a bigger role in the ecosystem. During an interview , Lubin acknowledged that Consensys historically took more of a backseat to avoid perceptions of undue influence, but recent developments indicated that many people in the community still look to the company to champion Ethereum. The Ethereum community faced many internal tensions over the past few weeks, especially with criticism directed at EF’s perceived lack of leadership under Executive Director Aya Miyaguchi. Dissatisfaction also grew over the slow progress of Ethereum’s scaling roadmap and the stagnation of ETH’s price. This led to calls for Miyaguchi to be replaced with Ethereum researcher Danny Ryan. Despite the criticism, Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin still defended Miyaguchi. Lubin believes there is a call for a shift in EF’s approach, particularly as the pro-crypto stance of the current US administration and expected regulatory changes created an environment that is ripe for growth and innovation. He suggested that EF has to adopt a more high-energy and risk-taking mindset to align more with the evolving ecosystem. Buterin agrees with this, and recently hinted that there will be major changes to EF’s leadership structure. He also suggested that Consensys or a similar organization could take over greater responsibilities. Consensys was established as a for-profit entity in 2014 to develop Ethereum infrastructure and applications. However, it has been operating under scrutiny for a long time now due to concerns about corporate influence on the blockchain’s direction. Buterin’s recent statements signaled a shift which suggests that Consensys could play a larger role when it comes to helping Ethereum reach its goals. Lubin welcomed the suggestion, and stated that the company is very eager to actively compete and provide interfaces for businesses and governments. Community discussions mostly centered on replacing Miyaguchi, whose low-profile leadership attracted a lot of criticism. However, her understated approach may have been instrumental in shielding Ethereum from regulatory scrutiny, particularly during the SEC’s investigation into whether ETH qualifies as a security. Although Buterin shared that the Foundation is working hard to improve EF’s technical expertise and ecosystem engagement, he dismissed the idea of a drastic ideological pivot for the foundation. In other words, it seems like Ethereum is more focused on an evolution rather than a complete departure from its established principles.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|REGULATION|ZRX|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-24 09:32:31

Noones, a Bitcoin ( BTC ) peer-to-peer marketplace founded by Paxful’s ex-CEO Ray Youssef, appears to have suffered a big hack. In early January, suspicious outflows drained around $7.9 million from the platform’s hot wallets on Ethereum ( ETH ), TRON ( TRX ), Solana ( SOL ), and BNB Chain ( BNB ), on-chain sleuth ZachXBT wrote in a Telegram post on Jan. 24. The blockchain investigator revealed the incident, showing hundreds of transactions, each under $7,000, as the funds were siphoned off. The stolen funds were bridged between Ethereum and BNB Chain before being funneled into Tornado Cash, a crypto mixer often used to obscure the trail of stolen funds. You might also like: LastPass hackers drained $12.4m ETH from 100+ wallets: ZachXBT The timing also raised eyebrows. Noones had announced maintenance around the same time as the hack, but, as ZachXBT noted, “no official statement was made about any security incident.” As of press time, Noones made no public statements on the matter. Noones came onto the scene in 2023, launched by Ray Youssef, who previously co-founded Paxful, another name in peer-to-peer crypto trading. Youssef saw Noones as a more community-driven alternative to Paxful, designed to give users easier access to crypto and digital payments while steering clear of some of the challenges he seemed to face at Paxful.

The S&P 500 surged to an all-time high of 6,118.71, breaking its previous December record of 6,090.27. The surge followed his address at the World Economic Forum on Jan. 24. Bitcoin didn’t miss the party, climbing from $102,000 to $105,000 within hours of his executive order promoting crypto, as Cryptopolitan reported last night. U.S. crude oil prices dipped after Trump announced plans to “ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil.” Global benchmark Brent crude followed, dropping sharply. At the same time, he also said he was gonna force a cut to interest rates, causing the 2-year Treasury yield, which tracks short-term rates, to tick downward. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 0.92%, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.22%. This is the fourth consecutive session of gains across all three indexes. The Fed faces a Trump crisis With the Federal Reserve set to meet next week, Trump’s comments are likely to influence discussions. Chair Jay Powell’s upcoming press conference has investors expecting hyper volatility, with the chance of a rate cut being near zero, according to the CMEGroup’s FedWatch Tool. When asked if he thought the Fed would actually listen to him if he demands a rate cut, the president responded with a simple “yeah.” This is because there is a lot of tension between him and the central bank’s officials, though mainly Powell. Though they used to be close friends and it was even Trump who first nominated Powell for the job, the president has said he quickly realized that Powell had betrayed him by deliberately doing things that benefited the Democratic Party, while ruining the president’s reputation. Powell, for his part, said last year that he would sue Trump if he attempts to force his way into their decision-making. An action like that is powerful enough to crash both the economy and financial markets.

The flagship cryptocurrency has registered an increase of nearly 3% over the past 24 hours and is currently trading around $104,612, with bulls looking to push it beyond $105,000. Ethereum (ETH) also registered a substantial recovery, rising over 4% to reclaim $3,300 and move to its current level of $3,330. Markets have bounced back after a bearish and highly volatile couple of days, with most cryptocurrencies trading in the green. Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA) , Tron (TRX) , Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Toncoin (TON), Hedera (HBAR), and Polkadot (DOT) registered substantial gains. As a result, the crypto market cap recorded an increase of nearly 2% and currently sits at 3.57%. Trump Issues Executive Order Banning CBDCs In a move that could have significant ramifications, US President Donald Trump has issued an executive order banning the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the US. The executive order, titled “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Finance Technology” introduces several key provisions, including a ban on the creation and issuance of a CBDC in the US. It also establishes several measures to regulate digital assets like stablecoins and cryptocurrencies. The executive order defines a CBDC as a form of digital money or monetary value denominated in the national unit of account that is a direct liability of the central bank. The order states, “Except to the extent required by law, agencies are hereby prohibited from undertaking any action to establish, issue, or promote CBDCs both within the US and abroad. Additionally, any ongoing plans or initiatives related to CBDC creation will be immediately halted.” A Presidential Working Group US President Donald Trump has ordered the creation of a cryptocurrency working group tasked with developing new digital asset regulations and exploring the creation of a cryptocurrency stockpile. The highly anticipated order also ordered that banking services for crypto companies be protected, alluding to claims US lenders have directed lenders to cut crypto companies from banking services, a charge regulators have vehemently denied. The order was met with enthusiasm by the crypto industry, which has been pushing for the new administration to send a strong sign of support for the industry. Nathan McCauley, CEO and co-founder of Anchorage Digital, stated, “Today’s crypto executive order marks a sea change in U.S. digital asset policy. By taking a whole-of-government approach to crypto, the Administration is making a significant first step toward writing clear, consistent rules of the road.” If implemented, Trump’s executive order could bring crypto into the mainstream. Tim Scott, Republican Chair of the Senate Banking Committee, stated, “Just days into his administration, President Trump is delivering on his promises... to keep the United States a leader in digital assets innovation.” SEC Rescinds SAB 121 Requirement The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has withdrawn the controversial SAB 121 requirement for crypto accounting which outlined strict disclosure requirements for financial institutions holding crypto on their books. The SEC issued SAB 122, rescinding SAB 121, and allowing financial institutions that hold crypto on behalf of their customers to determine whether to declare the digital assets as a liability. SAB 121 required custody providers to treat crypto holdings as both an asset and a liability. However, this was a sticking point for crypto firms who opposed the requirement due to the complexity of account practices. The withdrawal of SAB 121 highlights the Trump administration’s crypto-friendly stance, which Trump had alluded to during campaigning. Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda had also publicly opposed SAB 121 during former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s term. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) faced significant volatility on Thursday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. As a result, BTC saw wild price swings before ultimately registering a marginal increase. Analysts believe further volatility lies ahead, and traders could capitalize on significant price swings. Indicators suggest BTC, currently trading around $104,500, is like a coiled spring that could go in either direction. The indicator analysts are referring to is the 60-day price range, which represents the maximum and minimum price ticks in percentage terms. A tiger range indicates stable market conditions. A Glassnode analysis shows BTC’s 60-day range is tighter than the current trading range. Historically, such conditions indicate significant volatility. Glassnode stated in its report, “All of these instances have occurred before a significant burst of volatility, with the majority being in early bull markets or prior to late-stage capitulations in bear cycles.” BTC has been trading in a steady upward trajectory since its collapse last week when it dipped to an intraday low of $89,397. It recovered over the next two sessions, rising above the 20 and 50-day SMAs and settling at $100,051 by Wednesday. However, it was back in the red on Thursday, dropping to an intraday low of $97,094 before settling at $99,798, registering only a marginal decline. Buyers returned to the market on Friday as BTC rose nearly 4% to surge past $100,000 and settle at $103,732. The price was back in the red on Saturday, dropping marginally on Saturday and then by 2.07% on Sunday to settle at $101,434. Source: TradingView BTC started the current week facing significant volatility as it surged to a new all-time high on Monday, reaching $109,312. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching this level and the price fell to an intraday low of $99,516 before reclaiming $100,000 and settling at $102,408. Sellers attempted to drive BTC below $100,000 on Tuesday as it fell to an intraday low of $100,161. However, it recovered from this level to register an increase of nearly 4% and settle at $106,054. Despite strong momentum, BTC was back in the red on Wednesday, dropping 2.21% and settling at $103,715. Volatility returned to the market on Thursday as buyers and sellers sought to establish control. As a result, BTC rose to an intraday high of $106,913, and dropped to an intraday low of $101,290, before ultimately registering a marginal increase and settling at $104,004. The current session sees BTC up nearly 1% and trading just above $105,000. If buyers can maintain momentum, we could see BTC test its all-time high and potentially move beyond $110,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is at the cusp of pushing above $3,400 after finally breaking past the 20-day SMA and a key resistance level.

Sellers returned to the market on Thursday as SOL dropped to an intraday low of $242 before recovering and settling at $253. The current session sees SOL up nearly 3% and trading around $260. Arbitrum (ARB) Price Analysis Arbitrum (ARB) is trading in a narrow range as it struggles to build momentum and push above the 20-day SMA, which acted as a dynamic resistance level. ARB crossed the 20-day SMA on Friday, rising nearly 8% and settling at $0.815. However, bearish sentiment returned on Saturday as the price fell below the 20-day SMA and settled at $0.766.

Mantle ( MNT ) bounded 17% to an intraday high of $1.28 on Jan. 24 while bringing its market to nearly $4.2 billion at press time. The price surge came along with a 60% jump in the altcoin’s daily trading volume which was hovering over $213 million. Notably, the altcoin began its price upswing on Jan. 20 and has gained 32% since then, while its gains over the past year have reached 104%. The altcoin currently stands as the 40th largest crypto asset per data from CoinGecko, with a circulating supply of over 3.36 billion tokens. What led the MNT rally? MNT rallied after its developers announced six key products the project is working on this year to expand its ecosystem. The Mantle ecosystem already includes the modular layer-2 blockchain Mantle Network, the mETH protocol—a liquid staking product—and its wrapped BTC product ‘Ignition FBC.’ However, the project has now introduced three new pillars to support its growth: a crypto fund called Enhanced Index Fund, a blockchain-based banking platform named Mantle Banking, and MantleX, a platform focused on creating AI agents. The rally was also supported by a surge in Mantle ’s daily active and new addresses involved in MNT transactions. On-chain data from IntoTheblock shows a 50% jump in the number of active addresses completing at least one MNT transaction over the past week. Additionally, the number of new addresses created has also increased by nearly 16% during the period. Source: IntoTheBlock An uptick in daily active addresses and new addresses is a sign of strong network health and indicates growing adoption of the network. Source: CoinGlass Buyer demand for MNT has also been on the rise, with data from CoinGlass showing increasing withdrawals from exchanges since the start of the year. Such exchange outflows suggest that these buyers intend to hold onto their investments, anticipating further potential gains over the long term.

MNT Aroon chart — Jan. 24 | Source: crypto.news Further, the Aroon indicator shows the Aroon Up at 92% while Aroon Down showed a reading of 71%, which means the strength of the uptrend is far higher which could help the rally extend further in the coming days. Based on these indicators, the MNT could likely continue its rally to test its Jan. 6 resistance level at $1.42, a break above which could push prices towards the next psychological resistance at $1.5. When writing, MNT’s price stood at $1.23, down a little over 19% from its all-time high.

As the crypto market quickly evolves, pinpointing the next big thing takes keen insight. With January 2025 upon us, let's look at the 4 best altcoins set for substantial growth. These pioneers are using advanced tech and strong ecosystems, setting them apart as the best altcoins for those looking to see significant growth. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): A New Era of Blockchain Efficiency BlockDAG (BDAG) leads in blockchain innovation by blending Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology with traditional blockchain. This fusion facilitates simultaneous transaction processing, tackling the scalability challenges that older blockchains face. Thanks to this, BlockDAG achieves greater throughput and stronger decentralization. During its presale, BlockDAG gathered a remarkable $183.5 million, with the BDAG coin's value jumping by 2,380% from $0.001 to $0.0248. This upsurge shows increasing confidence in its revolutionary capabilities. With its mainnet launch and upcoming listings on ten top exchanges slated for this year, further price increases are anticipated. Under the guidance of Marius Bock, a past Cardano executive, BlockDAG thrives with expert leadership committed to strategic expansion. Its partnership with HackerEarth also plans to attract over 10,000 developers via hackathons, emphasizing its dedication to continuous innovation. With such advanced technology and strategic market placement, BlockDAG is a prime candidate for enduring success in the cryptocurrency market. 2. Ethereum (ETH): Spearheading Web3 Innovation Ethereum is pivotal in the crypto market, fueling most decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. With the ongoing development of Ethereum 2.0, the platform is evolving to be more scalable, secure, and environmentally friendly. Ethereum is the foundation for over 70% of dApps and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, highlighting its critical role in the Web3 sphere. The upgrade to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) not only lessens the network's ecological footprint but also offers staking rewards, providing a way to earn while bolstering network security. To enhance its scalability, Ethereum is advancing with solutions like sharding and rollups. These improvements ensure it stays at the forefront of handling growing demand and continues to be a cornerstone for numerous projects and innovations within the Web3 domain. 3. Polkadot (DOT): Bridging Blockchain Domains Polkadot stands out as a unique platform that promotes interoperability among diverse blockchains, facilitating seamless data and value exchanges across previously isolated networks. Its parachain technology revolutionizes how blockchains coexist and interact, addressing longstanding industry barriers. With over 200 active projects, Polkadot's ecosystem is a hotbed of development, fueling demand for DOT. Polkadot's governance model is uniquely democratic, offering stakeholders significant influence over its development.

As talk of a US national Bitcoin Reserve grows, the topic has become a topic of discussion between Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Riot Platforms Vice President Pierre Rochard. Pierre Rochard, vice president of Bitcoin mining company Riot Platforms, claimed that Ripple is the biggest obstacle to the US Bitcoin strategic reserve. Pierre Rochard stated that Ripple (XRP) is the biggest obstacle to introducing Bitcoin as a strategic asset in the US. Accordingly, Rochard claimed that Ripple aggressively lobbied and spent millions of dollars to block the BTC reserve plan. Rochard also claimed that Ripple was prioritizing XRP over supporting Bitcoin. He added that the Ripple hurdle was potentially due to Ripple’s interest in introducing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) that could run on its infrastructure. Ripple CEO's Response Was Quick! In the face of these significant allegations, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also made a statement and denied the allegations that Ripple was lobbying against the Bitcoin reserve plan. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has denied allegations that the company is lobbying against a US Bitcoin reserve, stating that he supports a multi-token reserve. As the Bitcoin reserve debate continues, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao stated that the Bitcoin reserve has almost been approved following the appointment of Senator Cynthia Lummis to chair the Senate Digital Assets Subcommittee. https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1882513710616621442 *This is not investment advice.

Just hours before Trump’s inauguration, WLFI made headlines for acquiring over $109 million in digital assets across six cryptocurrencies in a single day. Among the standout transactions was the purchase of 177.26 Wrapped Bitcoin ( WBTC ), worth approximately $18.8 million. WBTC, a Bitcoin derivative token designed to operate natively on the Ethereum ( ETH ) blockchain, has become increasingly popular for bridging Bitcoin’s liquidity into decentralized finance ecosystems. The buying spree coincides with Trump’s broader initiative to establish a national digital asset stockpile, reflecting his administration’s commitment to bolstering the U.S.’s position in blockchain technology. As of January 2024 WLFI has continued to make aggressive moves in the market, including the acquisition of 3,079 ETH for approximately $10 million and 10.61 million TRX (TRON), valued at $2.65 million according to data retrieved by Finbold from Arkham Intelligence.

Wrapped Bitcoin’s inclusion further demonstrates WLFI’s focus on leveraging Ethereum’s ecosystem for Bitcoin’s liquidity. This strategic alignment is echoed by WLFI’s increasing interest in TRON, a blockchain designed for high-throughput decentralized applications, signaling potential integration into scalable infrastructure for payments or dApps.

Multiple DeFi and traditional finance companies have looked into tokenization, setting up the sector for doubling its size in 2025. Tokenized real world assets (RWA) grew to $7.9B with more diversity in 2024. The issuance of tokens based on bonds or money markets reflected demand from DeFi projects, as well as traditional finance testing out the potential for tokenization. The value of tokenized assets peaked at $8.52B in early 2025, later sliding due to users flowing out of Usual Protocol. The value of tokenized real-world assets rose close to an all-time peak, led by legacy DeFi protocols like Maker and Tether Gold. BlackRock’s BUIDL token is still growing more conservatively, carrying $589.36M in tokenized money market instruments. Demand for BUIDL comes from Ondo and other DeFi protocols that are seeking a predictable and secure collateral. RWA is usually tied to blue-chip DeFi, and is used as a collateral for loans, which are then used for riskier trading activities. With the expectations of a bull market in 2025, the main prediction is for the current tokenization sector to double its value locked. Currently, the main use case for tokenized assets is increased security for DeFi protocols. Tokenized RWA are also more often tied to highly liquid assets, so far bypassing the tokenization of real estate or stocks, with some niche exceptions. Despite the relatively conservative approach, tokenized real-world assets \tripled their value in 2024, with more diverse issuers. The biggest factor for growth was the inflow of new protocols, which quickly added more value locked. One of the biggest effects was due to Usual Protocol, which claims $1.24B in assets under management. Most of the tokenized RWA end up as the basis for new types of stablecoins, or support older instruments. Gold is also a part of the well-established infrastructure for tokenization. RWA tokenization still lacks a common standard Crypto projects have already established their position with different approaches to tokenization. Recently, BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink called for mass real-world asset tokenization, requesting the US Securities and Exchange Commission to approve of the mass tokenization for stocks and bonds. Fink spoke for the CNBC Squawk Box during the Davos World Economic Forum, explaining that tokenized assets would simplify share voting and ownership structures. Tokenization may be easy for crypto projects, and multiple startups have created informal tokens based on stocks or markets. However, official tokenization may be a challenge when selecting the right chain and infrastructure. Currently, most RWA tokenization still uses Ethereum (ETH), posing challenges for high-activity assets. Most tokenized RWA are held in treasuries, and have relatively small organic markets. In the case of mass tokenization, trading speed would be essential, testing the limit of even the fastest blockchains. Tokenization among crypto projects is still small compared to the $1.64 trillion in available assets. However, the constraints from the size of the crypto market may limit the growth. Expected new regulations from the USA may affect the RWA tokenization process and introduce standards and limitations. RWA narrative goes through market recovery Among crypto projects, RWA is still mostly a narrative grouping some of the most prominent DeFi projects. Recently, the whole RWA sector recovered, to over $38B in total market capitalization. The biggest winners were Chainlink (LINK) and Ondo Finance (ONDO), which aim to provide the infrastructure for reliable tokenization and data management. ONDO remains among the leading tokens on a 90-day time frame, along with other RWA assets. RWA assets outperformed on a 90-day time frame, and are emerging with a slight advantage after traders moved away from the AI agent narrative (Source: Dune Analytics ) RWA is one of the few narratives to get ahead of meme tokens on a weekly time frame. Currently, most altcoin narratives lag behind Bitcoin (BTC), but RWA comes ahead of other trends. Based on the relative strength metric, AI agents had the biggest weekly loss , while interest switched over to RWA, with small positive growth. RWA has always remained a staple narrative with positive growth for the last three months, though lagging behind the explosive development of AI agents.

It seems the new administration may be aiming to tackle both. President Donald Trump signs a ban on CBDC On Thursday, President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order “to establish regulatory clarity for digital financial technology and secure America’s position as the global leader in the digital asset economy.” A key point in the order is the long-anticipated ban on widely loathed – at least in crypto circles – central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The order, available on the White House’s website , states as follows: “The Executive Order prohibits agencies from undertaking any action to establish, issue, or promote central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).” Trump’s working group to evaluate the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve The executive order establishes a working group – referred to as the Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets – to develop regulations for digital assets, including cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. The team charged with the mission will be headed by David Sacks, the White House AI and Crypto Czar, and will include the Treasury secretary, attorney general, and the SEC’s chair. The group will explore the idea of a national Bitcoin reserve, similar to the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, to help stabilize the economy. The proposed crypto reserve would involve the US government holding a large amount of Bitcoin as a reserve asset. The idea has already been floated for at least several months. In August 2024, Senator Cynthia Lummis proposed legislation to purchase 200,000 Bitcoin annually for five years, aiming for a reserve of one million Bitcoin. The initiative was aimed at strengthening the US dollar and fighting inflation. Eliminating Biden’s administration overreach Last but not least, Donald Trump’s Executive Order overturns the previous administration’s approach to digital assets, which, it argues, hindered innovation and hurt the economic liberty of Americans. The order aims to position the US as a global leader in digital finance by eliminating excessive regulation and fostering a crypto-friendly environment free from government overreach. By banning CBDCs and pushing for a Bitcoin reserve, Trump and his team make good on their pre-electoral promises. However, challenges are plenty, and the final shape as well as the long-term impact of the proposed changes remain to be seen.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION|BTC|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-24 09:55:51

On one hand, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is seeing a trading volume surge of over 23.59%, even as it wrestles with a one-month dip of 16.26%. On the other hand, Dogecoin (DOGE) is buzzing with the news of a potential ETF, despite a 66.59% drop in trading volume. Amid all this excitement, a new player is charging ahead: BTFD Coin (BTFD), offering a jaw-dropping 90% APY staking opportunity. Meme coins are no longer just about jokes—they’re vehicles for serious profits and dedicated communities. For those looking for the top meme coins to invest in , BTFD Coin is rewriting the narrative with unmatched staking rewards, its play-to-earn (P2E) game, and a thriving community of bulls. Let’s break down why BTFD Coin stands out as a top meme coin to invest in, alongside the latest updates on DOGE and PENGU. Own the Dip: BTFD Coin’s 90% APY Staking Is a Game Changer If you’ve ever wanted to ride the bull wave, BTFD Coin is where you start. This isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a revolution. From its incredible P2E game, launched on January 1, to its skyrocketing presale performance—now in Stage 14 with over $5.5 million raised—BTFD is turning heads. At $0.00016 per coin, this is your chance to own the dip before it’s gone. The highlight? A staggering 90% APY staking reward. Imagine staking $BTFD tokens and watching your rewards grow like never before. This kind of return is unheard of in traditional markets and even among most cryptos. For those searching for the top meme coins to invest, here’s a simple scenario: if you invest $5,000 at the current price of $0.00016 per coin, you’ll get 31,250,000 tokens. When BTFD hits its projected price of $0.0006 at the end of the presale, your investment would balloon to $18,750. That’s nearly a 4x return—without factoring in staking rewards. And there’s more. Stage 13 tokens were burned, creating a tighter supply and boosting demand. Plus, the LAUNCH100 bonus code doubles your token count during Stage 14. Buy $1,000 worth of BTFD, and you’ll get $2,000 worth of tokens. It’s the ultimate bull run, and the presale is your ticket. So, how do you join the action? It’s simple: Set up your wallet with MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT. Visit the presale page , connect your wallet, and apply the LAUNCH100 code. Buy your tokens, stake them, and watch your rewards multiply. With BTFD’s focus on community, innovation, and unbeatable staking rewards, it’s clear why this coin is one of the top choices in this list of top meme coins to invest in right now. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): A Cultural Icon in Crypto Pudgy Penguins isn’t just a meme coin; it’s a phenomenon. Trading at $0.02592, PENGU has seen a 6.42% uptick in the last 24 hours, although it’s down 24.16% over the past week. Still, its trading volume is up 23.59%, a sign of growing interest. PENGU’s appeal lies in its story. It’s the official token of Pudgy Penguins, a brand that has taken the crypto and pop culture worlds by storm. From dominating social media with over 50 billion views to being featured in ETF commercials, Pudgy Penguins is more than a community—it’s a movement. While the coin’s price is far from its all-time high of $0.05738 last month, the community remains optimistic. The concept of “The Huddle” unites fans around memes, good vibes, and a shared belief in the prophecy of the Penguin. For those who believe in the long-term potential of cultural capital in crypto, PENGU is a coin to watch. And with its recent trading volume surge, it’s clear that the Penguin fanbase is as passionate as ever. Dogecoin (DOGE): ETF Buzz Sparks Fresh Optimism Dogecoin might be the original meme coin, but it’s far from being outdated. Trading at $0.3535, DOGE is showing signs of a bullish breakout despite a 3% dip in the last 24 hours. Its trading volume is down by 66.59%, but the buzz around a potential Dogecoin ETF is reigniting investor interest. On January 22, Bitwise Asset Management filed for a DOGE ETF, following similar filings by Rex Shares and Osprey Funds. If approved, a Dogecoin ETF could attract significant institutional investment, much like Bitcoin ETFs have done. Even a small fraction of those inflows could drive DOGE prices to new heights. DOGE also benefits from its enduring popularity and a strong community that embraces its playful nature. Its 10.02% one-month gain reflects renewed confidence, and with the ETF filing in progress, the coin could be poised for a major breakout. As always, Dogecoin remains a symbol of the unpredictable, meme-driven potential of the crypto market. The Bottom Line Based on our research and market trends, the meme coin landscape is as dynamic as ever. For those looking for the top meme coins to invest in, BTFD Coin is stealing the show with its 90% APY staking rewards and presale momentum, offering an unparalleled opportunity to own the dip and ride the bull run. Meanwhile, Pudgy Penguins continues to thrive as a cultural icon, and Dogecoin is making headlines with its ETF buzz. The choice is yours: join the BTFD presale now and claim your stake in one of the top meme coins to invest in today, or watch from the sidelines as the bulls charge ahead. Don’t wait—this is the perfect dip to invest.

That’s another big splash into the sea of cryptocurrency by traditional finance corporations, making the industry’s dream of institutional adoption a reality. Crypto’s Institutional Adoption Is Happening Institutional adoption has always been a key part of the overall industry’s broadest roadmap for the future. Major US banks like Morgan Stanley used to ignore Bitcoin and other crypto assets. Then they laughed at them and derided them as criminal, if not impractical and foolish. But now, major players in corporate finance, like investment management giant BlackRock and now Morgan Stanley, have entered the bustling scene. Jamie Dimon’s JP Morgan and company may still be a holdout on crypto, but its competitors are entering the field with rabid ambitions to remake the world using blockchain’s techniques and platforms. When Sorkin asked about his views on cryptocurrency, Pick said his bank was ready to act. But it wants to be sure to do so with regulatory approval: “For us, the equation is really around whether we, as a highly regulated financial institution, can act as transactors.” That would allow Morgan Stanley to utilize the blockchain and provide cryptocurrency services to its customers. “We’ll be working with Treasury and the other regulators to figure out how we can offer that in a safe way,” Pick said. Morgan Stanley Takes Lead on Bitcoin Morgan Stanley is a leviathan in the traditional finance world. But it has been quicker than its competitors to jump on the blockchain bandwagon with the moon boys. It was among the first U.S. banks to offer BTC custody services to wealthy clients in 2021. During 2024’s Bitcoin ETF rush, the Midtown Manhattan banking giant took the lead in buying BTC exchange-traded funds. The company revealed a $269 million investment in Bitcoin ETFs last year. Pick’s statements to CNBC weren’t the only good news out of Davos for crypto from the banking sector this week. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said if regulators give the go-ahead, “you will find the banking system will come in hard on the transactional side of it.” The post Morgan Stanley CEO: Bank Planning Big Move Into Crypto appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Bitcoin|Morgan Stanley,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-01-24 10:02:25

On the surface, that argument seems logical . Polymarket's inclusion of sports prediction markets makes it seem like a competitor to licensed sportsbooks around the world. After all, even prediction market's harshest critics acknowledge that there's some kind of value in an investment mechanism to hedge against events like an election, but the outcome of a sporting match just doesn't have the same material impact as an election or war. But, beneath the surface, the argument that prediction markets are simply a Web3 version of gambling falls short, argues New York-based crypto attorney Aaron Brogan. “If you are a state-licensed gambling product, then you are taking one side of the bet. You’re essentially betting against your users,"" Brogan said. ""You’re booking the bets…and offering certain odds to users. Whether you make money or not depends on the odds you set.” Prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi, in contrast, act as neutral intermediaries that match trades without taking a side, making money via transaction fees. ""You are not taking a side of the bet as the market in that case, which fundamentally changes the incentives involved and makes the product different in a holistic way,” Brogan said, pointing out that prediction market platforms don't ban their best users in the same way casinos boot out card counting pros as it kills the house's mathematical edge. “Prediction markets aren’t gambling because they’re not structured to be,” Brogan said. “They’re tools for understanding, hedging, and creating public goods. That’s what makes them fundamentally different.” Getting an online gambling license in the U.S. was a herculean effort, and one might wonder why the new players in the space, like Draft Kings or incumbents like MGM, which followed in opening up online sports betting operations, don't go after prediction markets at the state level where gambling is regulated. The key legal distinction, says Brogan, lies in the regulatory framework. In the U.S., prediction markets that are registered as Designated Contract Markets (DCMs) fall under federal regulation via the Commodity Exchange Act, which preempts state gambling laws. “Federal law in the United States preempts state law,” Brogan explained. “The Commodity Exchange Act includes a specific provision that precludes state regulation of federally registered derivatives. If you are federally registered, the states can’t regulate you."" Kalshi seems to feel confident in this argument, as the prediction market platform, which actively pursued registration with the Commodities Futures and Trading Commission – and fought its initial attempts to block election-related prediction markets – recently launched Super Bowl betting markets. But this might not work for its competitors. “Polymarket, for example, is not registered in the United States, so arguably, states could go to its founder and say, ‘You’ve been facilitating sports betting, which is a felony in this state,’ and bring legal action. Registered exchanges, however, don’t face this issue because of their federal status,” Brogan said. While Polymarket and Kalshi are the two most recognizable names in the space, there are plenty of other new entrants which are following in their footsteps. One of which is the crypto exchange Crypto.com, which recently launched Crypto.com sports after filing self-certification as a DCM with the CFTC. The key thing is, Brogan explained, is that if the CFTC does not take action within 24 hours after the self-certification papers are filed, then the applicant can treat that as a green light. “If these are able to proliferate, and if the CFTC doesn’t take action, which they haven’t done yet, they’re going to end up eating these sportsbooks’ lunch. This is a $21 billion industry, and this new product is going to be way better,” he concludes.",Policy,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|COMMODITY|EXCHANGE|ASIA,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-24 10:05:41

THORChain Halts Bitcoin, Ethereum Withdrawals Amid Solvency Concerns, RUNE Drops 30% According to messages from THORChain’s Telegram channels, network node operators proposed and implemented a 90-day withdrawal pause today. The move aims to prevent a possible liquidity crisis and allow time to develop a plan to resolve outstanding debts. THORChain’s lending program only supports BTC and ETH, but their savings vaults have a wider range of assets. The protocol risks bankruptcy if all loans and savings positions are closed at the same time, especially if market sentiment triggers a sharp decline in the price of RUNE. The protocol meets its lending obligations by minting RUNE and selling it to liquidity pools, a mechanism that has raised concerns in the past. In fact, THORChain had already disabled new deposits a year ago due to fears of increased risk. Some community members estimate that THORChain’s liabilities are around $200 million, with $107 million of them sitting in liquidity pools. If liquidity providers (LPs) or RUNE holders panic and begin to withdraw or sell their assets, this could further strain the stability of the protocol. Despite the turbulence, THORChain’s core service of cross-chain swaps has not been affected. Users can continue to swap and benefit from liquidity pools without interruption. *This is not investment advice.

SEC Lawsuit,https://cryptopotato.com/pro-xrp-attorney-outlines-3-possible-scenarios-for-the-ripple-v-sec-lawsuit/,"TL;DR John Deaton sees three possible outcomes for the Ripple case after Gensler’s resignation: continuing the appeal, settling with a $125M fine, or a full dismissal – though the last one is unlikely. Trump’s positive crypto stance and recent policy moves could improve Ripple’s chances, with Deaton believing a decisive victory for the company is just a matter of time. What Might Come Next? Gary Gensler’s tenure at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might be over, but the lawsuit against Ripple remains ongoing. The former Chairman resigned on January 20 (the day Donald Trump officially became America’s 47th President) and was replaced by Mark Uyeda. Gensler was considered an enemy of the cryptocurrency industry, while his successor stands in the opposite corner. Last year, Uyeda criticized the SEC’s previous leadership for its negative stance on the sector: “The Commission’s war on crypto must end, including crypto enforcement actions solely based on a failure to register with no allegation of fraud or harm.” The XRP Army has interpreted the changes as a positive factor that could lead to a faster and potentially favorable resolution in the Ripple case. Most recently, John Deaton (an American lawyer representing thousands of XRP investors in the lawsuit) also gave his two cents . He believes there are now three possible scenarios. The first involves continuing the SEC’s appeal. The securities regulator opposed a verdict from 2023 when Judge Torres ruled that XRP sales on public exchanges to retail investors did not constitute securities transactions. The second option is a dismissal of the appeal . According to him, this would require Ripple to pay the previously ordered $125 million penalty. Recall that Judge Torres ruled that the company should settle the amount due to violating certain rules. While the figure sounds substantial, it actually represents just a fraction of the $2 billion the watchdog initially asked for . Somewhat expected , many Ripple proponents viewed the decision as a major victory, while some of the company’s executives promised to respect the court’s ruling. The third scenario seems like the most favorable (and most unlikely) for Ripple. According to Deaton, this includes the SEC withdrawing its appeal and scrapping the firm’s $125 million fine. “I don’t see the SEC saying: “No, we’re going to deny a judge’s ruling.” So that’s why I think the middle one is the option.” The SEC Looks Like the Underdog Despite not outlining when the case might be officially over, Deaton believes Ripple’s victory is just a matter of time. He based his thesis on the fact that the current President of the USA – Donald Trump – has completely changed his stance on the digital asset sector, planning to make the country the crypto capital of the world. Last week, he doubled down on his supposed affection for the industry, launching a meme coin of his own. At first, the token, called Official Trump (TRUMP), experienced a spectacular price increase before heading south. Most recently, Trump signed an executive order to review the creation of a “National Digital Asset Stockpile.” His initial intention was to establish a strategic BTC reserve in the US, but now the effort’s scope seems to have expanded to other cryptocurrencies, too.

ThorChain founder JP Thorbjornsen and the development team have decided to pause THORFi services as part of a 90-day “restructuring” plan to reduce the problems associated with its “Savers and Lending” programs, which appear to have accumulated a lot of unserviceable debt. ThorChain is a decentralized liquidity protocol that facilitates cross-chain asset swaps while eliminating the need for wrapped tokens or centralized exchanges. The platform allows traders to exchange native assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others directly on one platform, using its native token, RUNE, to facilitate transactions and secure liquidity pools. Why THORChain paused THORFi services While trading functionalities like swaps remain accessible to users, lending operations under THORFi have been paused. The pause of lending operations is a proactive attempt to prevent mass exit, which could spell further doom for the platform. Haseeb Qureshi, Dragonfly’s managing partner, likened the situation to a “bankruptcy freeze,” highlighting a serious liquidity crunch. As a result, there are now concerns regarding THORChain’s ability to come through for creditors if there are sweeping redemptions due to a shortage of Bitcoin reserves in THORFi lending pools. The 90-day restructuring initiative was enforced via validator nodes, and in response, the price of RUNE has dropped more than 30% over the past 24 hours. RUNE’s market value is under siege RUNE’s market price is down for many reasons, but the latest is THORChain’s executive decision to pause lending operations. Another major reason is the inflation of the circulating supply. The inflation was caused by factors like block rewards distributed to validators since RUNE is minted to reward participants, which dilutes its value. In fact, there is a growing consensus that rewards need to be reduced, but the specifics are still being debated. Other mechanisms affecting the RUNE token include the Savers and Lending programs, which were just put on hold. The Savers program was originally designed to create buy pressure for RUNE. However, it has instead worsened the situation by creating substantial sell pressure when users withdraw their deposits. When users enter Savers , they need to purchase RUNE, but when they leave, they sell it. All is well as long as RUNE is not underperforming relative to Bitcoin. If it is, as users exit at lower prices, they trigger further declines in RUNE’s value, which creates a feedback loop. Another factor creating inflationary pressure on RUNE is lending. While it has already been paused, its lingering impact continues to affect the RUNE price because loans and collateral, primarily backed by BTC and ETH, have created liabilities that are hard to repay as the value of RUNE declines. The situation is exacerbated by current market conditions forcing more RUNE token mints to cover obligations and further dilute the token. It is also compounded by a lack of liquidations within the protocol, causing many to worry that this could potentially affect RUNE’s value and diminish THORChain’s spending ability, mirroring 2022’s Terra/Luna collapse. The threat of insolvency grows ThorChain-based synthetic assets, or synths, derivative tokens that mimic the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether, are also under scrutiny. They are assets collateralized by liquidity pools that balance the original asset and RUNE, THORChain’s native token. The protocol’s reliance on RUNE for collateralization and vulnerability to market fluctuations could exacerbate these risks. That’s why some community members are worried that the protocol could be insolvent. “In the event of any large debt redemption and/or savers and synths deleveraging, it is certain that TC cannot meet its bitcoin and eth-denominated obligations,” a community member, TCB, pointed out. In the meantime, the community is considering proposals for an economic redesign to help stabilize the network. The founder believes that things will smoothen out after restructuring. “The protocol makes a ton of money and can service the debt — once restructured,” said Thorbjornsen. He already anticipated community backlash but is prepared to make the tough calls if it guarantees the protocol’s long-term viability. Despite the multiple protocol hacks ThorChain has experienced in the past and the ongoing issues, the protocol has already made significant progress in decentralization and cross-chain liquidity. However, to ensure its survival, the ThorChain team is looking to confront these internal challenges head-on once and for all, despite the risks.

Litecoin’s price remains robust at $119.88 after hitting key milestones, such as its 300 millionth transaction, showcasing its resilience in a volatile market. Meanwhile, the Polkadot community is keenly analyzing DOT price predictions after the announcement of extended token sales by the Hyperbridge rollup, potentially impacting its growth trajectory. Both projects hold substantial sway in the market, yet another opportunity is capturing the spotlight. BlockDAG (BDAG) emerges as a presale powerhouse, having amassed over $184 million while rolling out its LAUNCH300 offer, which awards a 300% bonus on purchases. With an agenda to debut on 10 major centralized exchanges, predictions suggest a rally that could catapult BDAG’s value to unprecedented heights. Early participants are positioned at the forefront of a unique and time-sensitive holding window. BlockDAG’s CEX Listings & LAUNCH300 Offer: Charting a Course to Historic Surges BlockDAG is taking decisive action with its LAUNCH300 offer, enabling participants to secure a 300% bonus on each BDAG coin purchase. This strategic move in the presale has already garnered over $184 million, with a staggering 18 billion coins sold. With a current price of $0.0248 per batch, early backers are ideally poised for a potential financial windfall as BlockDAG approaches a major milestone—its listing on 10 major centralized exchanges. These upcoming listings are critical; cryptocurrencies that make it onto tier-1 exchanges typically witness substantial liquidity boosts, leading to sharp price escalations. The buzz around BlockDAG’s plans, coupled with the LAUNCH300 bonus, positions participants to significantly amplify their potential returns in anticipation of a projected price rally. Timing is paramount. As the presale advances, the available supply diminishes and demand spikes. The current presale price presents a rare opportunity for buyers to tap into early-stage growth. If predictions hold, early adopters may see gains exceeding 3,900% as BDAG transitions from presale to public trading. With BlockDAG’s mainnet debut enhancing transaction speeds and scalability, coupled with imminent exchange listings and the LAUNCH300 offer, buyers have a unique opportunity to secure coins before the market narrative shifts dramatically. This is a moment not to be missed—act quickly as this chance is fleeting. Litecoin Price Holds Steady Amid ETF Speculation Currently, Litecoin is priced at $119.88, demonstrating steadiness after significant milestones like its 300 millionth transaction. This achievement underscores the network’s capability to manage increased demand while maintaining decentralization. The recent release of Litecoin Core version 0.21.4 also boosts its security and performance, ensuring the blockchain remains robust and competitive. The excitement builds as Canary Capital files for a spot Litecoin ETF with the SEC. If approved, this could significantly widen Litecoin’s institutional appeal and potentially elevate its market value. These developments not only affirm Litecoin’s ongoing market relevance but also position it for potential growth in a competitive landscape. Traders are closely monitoring for any signs of momentum shifts, marking LTC as a cryptocurrency to watch in 2025. DOT Price Prediction Gains Traction with New Developments Polkadot’s ecosystem is experiencing steady expansion, with its price currently around $6.58. Notably, the extension of Hyperbridge’s Initial Relayer Offering (IRO) deadline to February 28, 2025, after the sale of over 52 million tokens, has ignited interest in its scalability and potential impact on DOT price predictions . The network remains a focal point as new proposals for cross-chain solutions are evaluated. Analysts are incorporating these developments into their DOT price predictions, hinting at possible upward trends if adoption expands. As Polkadot intensifies its focus on enhancing interoperability features, market watchers are vigilant for indications of sustained price movements and long-term impacts on the ecosystem. In Summary Litecoin’s consistent price of $119.88, supported by potential ETF approval, signals its enduring presence in the market. Meanwhile, Polkadot, with its Hyperbridge initiative and focus on interoperability, has market analysts revising their DOT price predictions upward. Both projects exemplify resilience and innovation, making them key assets to keep an eye on. However, BlockDAG stands out with its LAUNCH300 offer, providing a 300% bonus on BDAG coin purchases and having already raised over $184 million. With plans to list on 10 major CEXs and expectations of significant value surges, BlockDAG offers an unparalleled opportunity to engage in a project that could redefine the blockchain landscape. Time is of the essence—act now before this presale opportunity closes, as the next phase of growth promises substantial returns.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/ethereum-founder-vitalik-buterin-announces-ethereums-2025-roadmap-here-are-the-details/,"Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has outlined a detailed vision for the platform's growth and development through 2025. Vitalik Buterin Outlines Ethereum’s 2025 Strategy: Layer 2 Is at the Center of Expansion In his latest article, Buterin emphasized that Layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions will be the cornerstone of Ethereum’s path forward, ensuring the network remains scalable, secure, and adaptable in the face of increasing adoption. Emphasizing the importance of L2 technology, Buterin argued that this technology provides the best way to address Ethereum's scalability issues without compromising decentralization. As decentralized applications (dApps) and user demand continue to grow, Ethereum must prioritize robust infrastructure to handle the increased load. Beyond Layer 2, Buterin outlined several critical components of Ethereum’s 2025 roadmap: Increasing Data Block Capacity: To meet the demands of a growing ecosystem, Ethereum needs to increase the capacity of data blocks, improving efficiency and throughput. Optimizing L2 Security: Securing Layer 2 solutions is critical. Buterin emphasized the need to improve the proof systems used by L2 networks to strengthen trust and reliability. Accelerating Interoperability Standards: Seamless interaction between various Ethereum-based solutions and the broader blockchain ecosystem is essential. Buterin called for faster progress on interoperability standards to encourage collaboration and innovation. Strengthening ETH’s Core Position: As Ethereum’s native currency, ETH plays a crucial role in the ecosystem. Buterin emphasized the need to solidify ETH’s position as the economic backbone of Ethereum, ensuring its long-term value and utility. This strategic outline reflects Ethereum's commitment to evolving as a robust and user-centric platform. Prioritizing scalability, security, and interoperability, Ethereum aims to maintain its leading position in the blockchain space while meeting the growing demands of its global user base. *This is not investment advice.

Canadian investors are among the initial adopters taking out massive early positions in the rising GameFi giant, and for good reason—time is running out to get in early on the next 100x gem before the bull run kicks off in full. Dogizen’s ICO will end on 7th February 2025 . Dogizen is out for blood—and its direct access to the social messaging app’s user base of close to a billion users makes it the best ICO in the game this January. Dogizen launching at the perfect time Dogizen will be publicly available soon after the conclusion of its Telegram ICO on 7th February, several weeks after the Trump administration takes office. We’re talking about the first administration openly supportive of crypto—with no less than the biggest Dogecoin shill in his cabinet. That shill being Elon Musk, the new head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Rumors are circulating that Trump could lay out his plans to promote legislation as soon as the inauguration , setting up the perfect storm for unprecedented waves of retail and institutional capital to flow into crypto. We may witness the mother of all bull runs in 2025, making right now the best time to invest in narratives like GameFi and dog coins underpinning the bullish backdrop. You had best believe the smart money will be looking at micro-cap plays that will maximize their gains, and investors old and new will be all over the dog coins that have always been a gateway drug to crypto. Dogizen is at the intersection of both GameFi and dog coins, which positions its native token, DOGIZ, for a parabolic pump. Telegram gaming sector looking bullish in 2025 Telegram gaming is dominated by four major projects: Hamster Kombat, Catizen, DOGS, and Notcoin. All of these pioneering projects surged between $100 million and up to $2.5 billion in market cap at their respective peaks—and all four were listed on Binance rapidly in the summer of ‘24. The fact that the world’s largest exchange listed each one before the market turned bullish after Trump’s election in November means Binance has earmarked the sector for future growth. Telegram gaming’s market cap​​ grew from $0 to $1 billion within 6 months since the first projects airdropped their tokens to the Telegram community. Binance definitely knows a promising sector when it sees one. How Dogizen improves on its rivals Dogizen’s competitors—the same four projects responsible for most of the sector’s value—made the mistake of airdropping their tokens to Telegram users instead of running an ICO. This led to massive sell-offs from users who cashed out when they got their tokens, tanking token prices. Dogizen, meanwhile, has raised a whopping $2.9m via its ICO by promoting organic community growth and incentivizing long-term holders. Dogizen is the next big crypto in the GameFi sector—and with its pioneering status as the first Telegram ICO, listings on tier-1 exchanges, and a nine-figure capitalization within easy reach, early adopters will be in for eye-watering gains this year. With token prices at $0.000081, Dogizen is a legitimate 100x candidate hiding in plain sight.

His inauguration took place on January 20, 2025, during which he and his wife, Melania Trump, launched their own meme coins — TRUMP and MELANIA. What you need to know about TRUMP and MELANIA — the cryptocurrency of Trump's family Trump Family Cryptocurrency Cryptocurrencies tied to a specific individual function like stocks. When positive news about the person emerges, these coins often rise in value; negative news can cause their prices to plummet. Now Donald and Melania Trump have such ”stocks.” Here’s what you need to know. Official Trump (TRUMP) U.S. President Donald Trump released the OFFICIAL TRUMP (TRUMP) cryptocurrency. It is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain. The meme coin launched on the night of January 17-18, 2025. It took just one day for the cryptocurrency to enter the top 20 by market capitalization. The official project website states that OFFICIAL TRUMP is the only official Trump meme coin. This clarification is not coincidental; prior to OFFICIAL TRUMP's appearance, there were many Trump coins in circulation, such as MAGA (TRUMP) and MAGA Hat (MAGA), created by members of the crypto community unrelated to the politician. The president's meme coin began ”sucking” liquidity from its predecessors. ”Trump meme coins serve as an expression of support and engagement with the ideals and beliefs embodied by the symbol '$TRUMP' and corresponding artworks. The coins should not be viewed as an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any kind,” warn the developers. The emission of Trump's coin is limited to 1 billion tokens. At launch, 200 million tokens were unlocked for sale. The remainder will be released over 36 months. Here’s how the emission schedule for Trump's cryptocurrency looks: There are eight groups designated for distributing TRUMP. The distribution is as follows: 36% (360 million) goes to the first group *creators & cic digital; 18% (180 million) to the second group creators & cic digital; another 18% (180 million) to the third group creators & cic digital; 10% (100 million) is allocated for liquidity; another 10% (100 million) for public sale; 4% (40 million) goes to the fourth group creators & cic digital; 2% (20 million) to the fifth group creators & cic digital; and the remaining 2% (20 million) to the sixth group creators & cic digital. *Creators & cic digital is a team of developers and partners responsible for creating and developing the project. As of this writing, Trump's cryptocurrency ranks 25th in market capitalization on CoinMarketCap with a price of $34.53. On January 19, 2025, at its peak, Trump's coin reached $75.35. Trump's cryptocurrency is traded on many popular exchanges including Binance, OKX, Bybit, Bitget, Kraken, and KuCoin. Melania Meme (MELANIA) Melania Trump announced her own meme coin Melania Meme (MELANIA) on January 20, 2025, coinciding with Trump's inauguration day. Her coin also quickly entered the top rankings but at a more modest position — within the top 70. Melania's cryptocurrency is also built on Solana. ”Melania meme coins represent digital collectibles designed to express support and engagement with values embodied by the symbol MELANIA and corresponding artwork. Tokens should not be viewed as an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any type,” states the project website. The project site presents a token distribution scheme for Melania Trump’s tokens. There are five categories: 15% is allocated for public distribution; 10% for maintaining liquidity; 20% for community engagement; another 20% goes to treasury; and the remaining 35% is reserved for the project team. Tokens allocated for the project team will be unlocked over a period of 13 months. As of this writing, MELANIA ranks 150th in market capitalization on CoinMarketCap with a trading price of $2.68. The maximum price for MELANIA was recorded at $13.73 on January 20. Melania's cryptocurrency is traded on several major exchanges: KuCoin, Bitget, Kraken, and HTX. Coins from Other Trump Family Members Following Donald and Melania Trump's cryptocurrency launch, rumors circulated within the crypto community that other family members might soon launch their own coins as well. Scammers took advantage of this situation; for instance, an unknown party executed a pump-and-dump scheme with a meme coin allegedly created by Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump. There was also information circulating that Trump's son Barron wants to launch his own coin. This information was similarly exploited by fraudsters. Why Trump Tokens Are Criticized Not all members of the crypto community are pleased that the president launched his meme coin. The coin has been criticized for excessive centralization since 80% of TRUMP tokens are locked in a wallet accessible only to project creators. This structure could open opportunities for manipulating the price of Trump’s coin. MELANIA has also faced criticism over unfair token distribution that weakens its market position and makes investors vulnerable. Speculation has arisen that insiders could profit from launching Trump's cryptocurrency. Some believe that TRUMP is a genuine scam. However, there are optimists as well. Some members of the crypto community think that thanks to Trump's cryptocurrency launch, new investors — those who previously knew nothing about digital assets — have flooded into the market. This ”new blood” could support growth in the crypto industry and increase prices. Reaction of the Crypto Community The reaction of the crypto community has been notable, as users have pointed out unusual transaction statistics related to Trump's cryptocurrency, which may indicate insider trading. If these assumptions are correct, Trump's coin risks facing regulatory scrutiny. Not all members of the crypto community have rushed to invest in Donald and Melania Trump's cryptocurrency. For instance, Anthony Pompliano, founder of Pomp Investments, declined to purchase the coins, stating on X that he does not hold any TRUMP or Melania tokens. He emphasized that the launch of the Trump tokens signifies ”the beginning of a new era.” Charles Hoskinson, founder of the blockchain project Cardano, views these tokens as ”a new type of asset,” describing Trump's coin as a political marker of approval that measures his current popularity, power, and reach. Many in the crypto space believe that the Trump family's attempts to enter the cryptocurrency market through their projects are detrimental to the industry. Some even label the couple's meme coins as scams. Community members joke that since there are many people in the Trump family, those who missed out on TRUMP and Melania tokens might still have opportunities to profit from meme coins launched by other family members.",News|Explained,EN,0,0,MARKET|EXCHANGE|TRADING|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-24 11:30:06

The move signals progress on some key commitments, such as halting federal efforts toward CBDCs and granting high-profile pardons. However, certain elements, like the promised creation of a “strategic national Bitcoin stockpile,” remain notably absent or vague, leaving questions about the full scope and direction. Trump Advances Digital Finance Agenda According to Fox reporter Eleanor Terrett’s latest update , the working group, if established, is tasked with developing a Federal regulatory framework for digital assets, including stablecoins, and assessing the creation of a strategic national digital assets stockpile. This stockpile in question, however, does not mention Bitcoin despite Trump’s campaign promise at a Nashville BTC conference in July to create a “strategic national Bitcoin stockpile” using the over $20 billion worth of BTC seized by the Justice Department. Several Bitcoin maximalists pointed this out, with some suggesting that the stockpile should only consist of BTC. Meanwhile, the working group, chaired by White House AI & Crypto Czar David Sacks, will include top officials such as the Treasury Secretary, SEC Chairman, and leaders from other key agencies. The AI & Crypto Czar will consult leading industry experts to ensure informed decision-making. Crypto Campaign Promises The executive order also directs federal departments and agencies to identify and recommend modifications or rescissions of existing regulations affecting the digital assets sector. It also revokes the Biden administration’s Digital Assets Executive Order and the Treasury’s international engagement framework, citing their negative impact on innovation and US economic leadership. Interestingly, the order prohibits any federal action to establish or promote central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). As part of his campaign promises to the crypto industry, Trump had previously pledged to order federal agencies to cease any efforts toward developing CBDC. He also fulfilled his promise to grant a full and unconditional pardon to Ross Ulbricht, who operated the dark web marketplace Silk Road. While Trump’s executive order represents significant steps toward his digital finance goals, the authority of U.S. presidents to enact certain laws and policies through executive orders remains contentious. For example, Trump previously issued an order to revoke birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment, which Judge Coughenour, a Reagan appointee, declared “blatantly unconstitutional.” The judge criticized the Justice Department’s defense and expressed disbelief that legal professionals could support such a directive.

Blockbeats highlights that the site owes about $200 million in debt, $102 million in synthetic and savers, and $97 million in lending liabilities. The significant financial imbalance has the DeFi platform staring at bankruptcy. In that context, ecosystem debt happens when a DeFi network owes more coins than it has, similar to THORChain’s current issue. The financial imbalance often results from fund mismanagement and exaggerated promises to depositors. Meanwhile, leverage risks emerge when investors use their tokens as collateral when borrowing to enhance their positions. While this can increase returns, leverages can attract massive losses, triggering liquidations. Platforms like Traze offer trading capabilities, enabling users to explore DeFi opportunities, though risk management remains essential in volatile markets. THORFI challenges began when Bitcoin and Ethereum borrowings soared while BTC and ETH prices were lower. That forced the blockchain to mint more RUNE tokens. However, faded liquidity on the platform magnified the woes, triggering significant price dips. Reports show THORChain has suspended the lending network to thwart panic selling that might destabilize the blockchain. Also, validators might have imposed the operations halt to discuss a restructuring plan. While the platform has enforced a three-month restrictive initiative, prevailing financial instability has triggered concerns about THORChain’s future. While some market players remain optimistic as “only THORFI is paused,” some trust THORChain is on Terra’s (LUNA) path, heading for a massive disaster. THORChain mirrors Terra (LUNA) THORChain faces bankruptcy allegations, with some believing the blockchain is on a deathbed. RUNE/BTC has plunged 97% from 2021 highs, signaling a massive bearish wave. THORChain will have to mint and sell RUNE at a loss when borrowers begin repaying loans. Analysts highlight that the blockchain has less BTC and ETH in its pools. Source – X Thus, the upcoming sessions remain vital for THORChain, RUNE, and their entire cryptocurrency market. Continued RUNE/BTC dips could see THORChain facing a LUNA-like crisis. That will mean massive price dips for the native coin RUNE. RUNE price outlook The altcoin trades at $2.32, with a 24-hour high and low of $3.1478 and $1.997.

His comments have come after the governor of South Africa scoffed at the idea of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve at the World Economic Forum. BTC critic Peter Schiff has sided with the governor; however, the Coinbase CEO is confident that Bitcoin will gain broader recognition in the future. Coinbase CEO On Bitcoin Vs Gold Debate In a recent Bitcoin Vs Gold debate, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong stated that Bitcoin is a better form of money than Gold as it is provably scarce, more portable, and has a higher utility. He later detailed this comparison through an X post by adding that Bitcoin also has the advantage of being decentralized, fungible, and censorship-resistant. The CEO did underline that Bitcoin has a lower established history but, he said that the market cap of Bitcoin could surpass that of Gold in the next 5-10 years. The market cap of Bitcoin is $2.08 trillion which roughly reflects 11% of Gold’s market cap which is just over $18 trillion, he noted. More Opinions on Bitcoin Vs Gold Lesetja Kganyago, the Governor of South Africa, triggered this Bitcoin Vs Gold argument by calling out the idea of having a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. He said during a panel discussion that he has a significant problem with anyone saying that the government should hold a particular asset. The Governor of South Africa added that suggestions should not be made without understanding the strategic intent of the government. Finally, he said that Gold still has an established history whereas Bitcoin does not have it. Notably, Peter Schiff has backed his opinion by saying that gold is still a true measure of dollar weakness. Schiff said this while talking about controlling inflation in the US, also highlighting that Gold has always recorded gains against the US Dollar. In a separate X post, the BTC critic said that Gold is only 1% below its record high in dollars but, has bagged a record-high value in terms of every other major currency. Nevertheless, the crypto community is bullish about Bitcoin along with the overall rally across the crypto market. BTC Price Rally BTC price is up by 3.60% in the last 24 hours, exchanging hands at $105,418.92. It is now expected that BTC might rally 20% during the Chinese New Year as it has recorded upticks in eleven out of the last twelve times. Another factor that would help BTC register a higher rally is Donald Trump signing an executive order to develop a National Digital Asset stockpile. Having said that, a flurry of experts are confident that BTC will emerge as a key contender and eventually surpass Gold in the coming years.

According to the article, Ethereum will remain committed to building a global censorship-free and permissionless blockchain. Crypto pioneer and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has rolled out plans for Ethereum to expand L1 and L2 solutions as the ecosystem’s long-term goals and scaling strategies. In the blog post , Vitalik detailed that Ethereum’s commitment to creating a global, censorship-resistant, and permissionless blockchain will remain. Buterin referenced Ethereum’s evolution in the last decade, saying that the smart contracting platform has grown its cryptography, economics, and social technology innovation. Vitalik Buterin says L2 solutions have achieved key decentralized milestones L2s have made great progress, and this is a testament to Ethereum's ecosystem and development philosophy working in action. pic.twitter.com/CGVwBYUemj — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 24, 2025 Vitalik Buterin explained that the ecosystem has shifted its scaling trajectory to focus on layer 2 protocols (L2s). According to the article, the L2s of 2025 are miles ahead of early experiments conducted in 2019. Buterin explained that today’s L2s have achieved key decentralized milestones, including securing billions of dollars. Buterin also mentioned that the modern L2s have scaled Ethereum’s capacity by 17X and have dropped fees similarly. Vitalik mentioned that the rise of successful projects such as Worldchain (with more than 10 million users) has made crucial contributions to the underlying ecosystem, helping Ethereum grow further. The crypto pioneer explained that L2 solutions face scalability and heterogeneity as the two main challenges. According to the Ethereum co-founder, the Ethereum blob space barely covers the L2s and the use cases of today. Buterin wrote that the first challenge is easy to understand but possesses difficulties during implementations. Buterin proposed a technical solution of giving the Ethereum network more blobs and moderate L1 scaling amounts in the short term. Buterin added that improvements to proof of stake, stateless and light verification, storage, the EVM, and cryptography could also help overcome the challenge. While referencing the second challenge, Buterin explained that the difficulty is a coordination problem because of the greater magnitude and diversity of actors and goals. He proposed giving up on L2s and doing everything through L1 with a higher gas limit, either across one shard or many shards. However, Buterin noted that the approach compromises on a lot of merits of the existing Ethereum social structure. With the shortcomings of the proposed solutions, Vitalik stuck with the notion of staying on course and continuing to scale primarily through Layer 2 solutions making sure the platforms meet their promises. Vitalik Buterin: L1 needs to accelerate scaling blobs According to Buterin, L1 needs to accelerate scaling blobs. L1 also needs to moderate the scaling of the EVM and increase the gas limit to handle activities in an L2-dominated realm. Buterin also emphasized that L2 solutions need to improve their security. Vitalik also wrote that L2s and wallets need to improve their interoperability including chain-specific addresses as well as message-passing and bridge standards. He highlighted that L2 deposit and withdrawal durations need to become much faster. Vitalik also suggested that the Ethereum ecosystem needs to have an increased blob count over time. According to the computer programmer, Ethereum could exceed 128 blobs per slot, bringing its TPS to 100,000. He suggested that the ecosystem should be more willing to explicitly deprioritize features that are not blobs. Vitalik also explained that blobs are the goal, but rather p2p R&D talent acquisition should be made a priority. Native rollups on the Ethereum ecosystem are still in the early stages of development. According to Vitalik, the rollups require substantial active thought, particularly on maximizing the flexibility of native rollup precompiled. Buterin concluded the article by stating that now is the time to double down on efforts. The Ethereum co-founder acknowledged that many areas still require active thinking and brainstorming. He also said that the future of Ethereum depends on the active participation of everyone involved.

The token, which is seen as a proxy for the Pi project, rose to $44 on Friday, a few points above this week’s low of $38. So, is it safe to buy Pi Coin now? Pi Network Price Rises Ahead of Grace Period Date Pi Coin, which is only listed on HTX, rose as the countdown to the end of the KYC grace period neared. The KYC is a process where the millions of pioneers who joined the network verified their identity. Its goal is to remove bots, which are common in many tap-to-earn networks. The grace period ends on January 31st after being postponed twice in the past few months. Why This Grace Period Matters January 31 will be a key day because it will provide more information about whether the Pi Network mainnet launch will happen. The developers aim that as many pioneers verify their identity as possible. In the last update, over 13 million of them had verified their identity, but only 8 million had migrated their coins to the mainnet. When will the Pi Network mainnet launch happen? The mainnet launch will be an important event because it will allow pioneers to monetize their coins. Some of these users will hold their coins and hope for the price to surge. Others will many of them will likely sell and take a profit. The KYC verification is a key part of the mainnet launch. The other two are a conducive external environment and at least 100 mainnet-ready applications. As such, there is a possibility that the mainnet launch may be delayed since there are fewer than 100 apps. If all goes well, the mainnet launch will happen in Q1 . Pi Network Price Analysis As A Double-Bottom Forms The chart shows that the PI Coin price has risen this week. This rebound happened after crashing to the key support at $38.07. This was a key price because it coincided with the lowest swing in October last year. It could be a sign that it has formed a double-bottom pattern whose neckline is at $91. A double-bottom is a highly popular bullish reversal pattern. Pi Network Price Pi Price Targets Therefore, the value of Pi may rebound if the developers confirm that the grace period will be on January 31 and crash if it is delayed again. A bullish breakout may see it jump to as high as $90 or $100 as it did in November. On the other hand, another delay will see the Pi Network price crash below $36 to the next key support at $30, its lowest level in September last year.

The monthly percentage growth of the bitcoin holdings of large investors has accelerated from -0.25% on January 14 to +2% on January 17, the highest monthly rate since mid-December. Such growth comes on the back of Donald Trump becoming U.S. president, where traders expect him to introduce pro-crypto policies and build a strategic bitcoin reserve, both events that may fuel institutional capital into the asset in the near term.Large bitcoin holders are a key driver of BTC demand and price. Prominent recent buyers include Bitcoin development company MicroStrategy and energy management systems firm KULR . As such, selling pressure for Bitcoin has been reduced greatly after realizing daily profits as high as $10 billion as the asset approached $100,000 in December. Long-term bitcoin holders, seen as ""smart money,"" have sold more than 1 million BTC since September, and the behavior appears to have bottomed, as a CoinDesk analysis noted on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the unrealized profit margins for traders are now close to zero. In crypto terms, this often acts like a price floor during a bull market, suggesting we might be at a stable point before the next move. However, retail spot demand for bitcoin appears to be cooling off, per CryptoQuant. “Bitcoin’s apparent demand has continued in expansion territory (green area in the chart to the left). However, the rate of expansion has declined from 279K Bitcoin in early December 2024 to 75K Bitcoin today,” the firm said in its Friday report. Apparent demand is an on-chain metric used to gauge the balance between Bitcoin's production (newly minted coins through mining) and changes in its inventory (coins that have been inactive for over a year). “Demand growth must accelerate again for prices to rally significantly,” it added.",Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-24 11:53:26

Ulbricht, who had been serving a double life sentence without parole since 2015, shared his thoughts in a heartfelt video posted on X on January 23. “Last night, Donald Trump granted me a full pardon,” Ulbricht stated. “I was doing life without parole, locked up for over 11 years. But he let me out. I’m a free man now. So let it be known that Donald Trump is a man of his word.” Calling the pardon “an amazing blessing,” Ulbricht thanked Trump for restoring his life and future. His family echoed his gratitude, with the Free Ross campaign sharing emotional updates about their reunion. “Ross got to hug his wife, mom, dad, and sister outside the prison walls. The past 36 hours have been a whirlwind, and we keep pinching ourselves to make sure we’re not dreaming,” they wrote. Support Pours In After Release Ulbricht, known for creating Silk Road—a darknet marketplace that facilitated the trade of illicit goods using Bitcoin—has received overwhelming support since his release. A cryptocurrency wallet linked to the Free Ross campaign has received over $270,000 in donations, including a notable contribution of $111,111 from crypto exchange Kraken . Additional donations include $2,400 in Ether, $900 in Solana, and smaller contributions in other cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin. “It feels amazing to be free, to say the least,” Ulbricht said, sharing plans to spend time with his family and heal from his years of incarceration. “This is a victory for everyone who values freedom and believes in second chances.” Untouched Bitcoin Worth Millions Amid the celebrations, questions linger about Ulbricht’s dormant Bitcoin holdings. Conor Grogan, a director at Coinbase, revealed that approximately 430 BTC, valued at $47 million, remain untouched in wallets linked to Ulbricht. These wallets, dormant for over 13 years, were not seized by authorities during his conviction. Arkham Intelligence supported Grogan’s claims, identifying 14 Bitcoin addresses associated with Silk Road. One of these wallets alone holds more than $9 million in BTC. While supporters rally around Ulbricht, his unspent Bitcoin could further bolster his transition into life after prison.

Still, it managed to stay above the psychological $100,000 level and is is currently around $105,000. President Trump's rhetoric is continuing to help weaken the dollar, which generally boosts risk assets such as cryptocurrencies. The DXY index, a measure of the U.S. currency against a basket of major trade partners, has dropped to the lowest since Dec. 17, so that should give risk-on assets a feel-good boost. U.S. bond yields and WTI crude oil are also heading down, with oil below $75 a barrel, the lowest in two weeks. On the other side of the world, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) delivered on its promise with another interest-rate increase , taking the policy rate to 0.50%, the highest in more than 16 years. That followed a very hot inflation print, with headline inflation of 3.6% from the previous year, the fastest since January 2023. The question is whether we will get a second iteration of the yen carry trade unwind that occurred in August of last year. Time will tell. Stay alert!

This price point has become a pivotal battleground since it could pave the way for a potential recovery or signal further bearish momentum. The recent price action highlights growing buyer interest at this level, suggesting that market sentiment may be tilting cautiously in favor of the bulls. If the bulls succeed in maintaining this support, UNI could gain the momentum needed to test higher resistance levels, potentially setting the stage for a broader upward move. The coming sessions will be pivotal in shaping Uniswap’s trajectory as traders closely monitor this key level. Price Action And Technical Indicators Highlight Rebound Potential Uniswap’s price action at the $12.3 support level is gaining significant attention from traders and market analysts as it approaches a crucial technical juncture. The $12.3 mark has held as support in recent price cycles, and its ability to continue doing so will be key to determining whether the bulls can regain control. Related Reading: Uniswap Consolidates At $17: A Calm Before The Bullish Storm? Currently, UNI is moving toward the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a widely followed indicator that tends to act as both support and resistance during trend transitions. Adding to the positive outlook, the Composite Trend Oscillator’s recent move toward oversold territory signals a possible market correction or reversal. As the indicator shows signs of improvement, it suggests that negative strength may be weakening, allowing buying pressure to take over. A rise from oversold levels would indicate a shift toward a more favorable market for buyers, reinforcing the likelihood of a price rebound. Collectively, the 100-day SMA and the Composite Trend Oscillator provide a strong technical case for recovery at the $12.3 level. However, this bullish outlook is contingent on the ability of the price to move above the 100-day SMA and for the RSI to continue showing signs of strength. Market Momentum Shifts: Will Uniswap Bulls Prevail? Market momentum for Uniswap is showing early signs of a shift, with recent price action showing that bulls may be regaining control. If the bulls can sustain this strength, UNI’s price could break above the 4-hour SMA, which would cause a rally toward the $15.7 resistance level and beyond. Related Reading: Uniswap Processes Over $2 Trillion On Ethereum: UNI Bull Run Inevitable? However, the market remains cautious as failing to defend the $12.3 level hints at increased selling pressure, pushing prices lower toward the $10 support mark. Furthermore, a decisive break below this key level might trigger further losses, bringing additional support levels into focus as the bearish momentum continues.

The group’s main goal is to develop a federal regulatory framework for digital assets and consider the creation of a national “digital assets stockpile,” as reported by FOX Business’ Eleanor Terrett. US To Accumulate XRP? While the conversation around Donald Trump potentially creating a Bitcoin reserve continues to make waves, now there’s an intriguing new development. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has added a fresh perspective, suggesting that the U.S. government might one day choose to accumulate XRP tokens. This could significantly enhance Ripple’s adoption, and more importantly, it could drive a positive surge in XRP’s price. Although Garlinghouse hasn’t specifically connected XRP to the reserve topic, speculation continues to grow. Could the current situation pave the way for XRP to reach a $100 price target? Ripple CEO Garlinghouse has highlighted the need for clearer crypto regulations, saying Ripple’s work could help make that happen. This has led to higher expectations for the Ripple token’s price. The Ripple team also met with Donald Trump before, suggesting they may have been lobbying. Recently, Trump decided to create a digital asset stockpile instead of a Bitcoin reserve, which could be a result of this lobbying. However, the involvement in political donations has raised some concerns among investors. The Biggest Obstacle For Bitcoin Reserve In a recent X post, Pierre Rochard, shared that “the biggest obstacle for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is not the Fed, Treasury, banks, or Elizabeth Warren. It’s Ripple/XRP. They are aggressively lobbying against the SBR by throwing around $millions at politicians, desperately trying to derail it.” The biggest obstacle for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is not the Fed, Treasury, banks, or Elizabeth Warren. It’s Ripple/XRP. They are aggressively lobbying against the SBR by throwing around $millions at politicians, desperately trying to derail it. They did the same to… — Pierre Rochard (@BitcoinPierre) January 23, 2025 He noted that under the Biden administration, similar efforts were made to target Bitcoin mining and added that Ripple and others are focused on protecting their own narratives, while pushing for CBDCs built on their platform. Garlinghouse Denies However, Garlinghouse denied the accusations and stated that Ripple is working towards the same goal as the rest of the crypto community: creating a crypto strategic reserve, including Bitcoin. “Unless you are choosing to ignore the core tenants of the POTUS campaign (which aggressively supports American companies and technologies), our efforts are actually INCREASING the likelihood of a crypto strategic reserve (which includes bitcoin).” Focus On American Founded Crypto Interestingly, a previous report from the New York Post suggested that the Trump administration was looking to set up a system that would prioritize American-founded crypto assets, which would include XRP, Solana and USDC. While his past comments suggest a crypto reserve might be possible, he hasn’t specifically mentioned Bitcoin or XRP. The buzz around XRP is increasing, especially with the focus on American-founded digital assets like Ripple. This could boost the XRP price to new highs amid rising hype. XRP is currently trading at $3.14, in consolidation despite strong demand. While speculation about XRP accumulation is positive, there is no confirmation about the news yet. A more realistic target for XRP would be $5 to $20 by the end of Q1 2025, based on past trends and current market conditions.",News|Bitcoin|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|BTC|FIAT|TRADING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-24 12:03:36

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/total-stablecoin-supply-on-solana-blockchain-reaches-all-time-high-here-are-the-details/,"The total supply of stablecoins on the Solana blockchain has exceeded $10 billion for the first time, reaching an all-time high. Solana’s Stablecoin Supply Hits $10 Billion Record, Driven by USDC Growth and Memecoin Craze According to DeFiLlama data, the value of the stablecoin in Solana has increased by nearly 110% since the beginning of January, from $5.1 billion to $10.8 billion. This milestone highlights Solana’s rapid expansion into the stablecoin market. In comparison, Ethereum remains the dominant network with $116 billion in stablecoins, while BNB Chain holds $7 billion, Base $3.8 billion, and Arbitrum $3.1 billion. The growth of stablecoins on Solana has been driven primarily by Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) issuance, which currently accounts for approximately 80% of Solana’s stablecoin supply. USDC holdings on Solana have nearly doubled this month alone, from $4.2 billion to $8.2 billion. Meanwhile, Tether’s USDT supply on Solana stands at $1.96 billion. This sharp increase in stablecoin supply coincides with an increase in trading volume on Solana’s DeFi protocols and a boom in memecoin activity. Over the past year, the network has seen a surge of speculative interest, particularly with the recent launch of Trump-themed memecoins. The memecoin craze has had a broader impact on the Solana ecosystem, with Solana’s native token SOL hitting an all-time high above $260. At the same time, Solana’s daily transaction fees reached $33 million last week, reflecting the high trading activity surrounding memecoins. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin is riding high above $105,000, and the altcoins are starting to break out. Is this the beginning of the final parabolic stage for crypto? Total3 breakout about to happen? Source: TradingView Total3 is the chart of the combined market capitalisation of all cryptocurrencies, excluding $BTC and $ETH, so is a good guide to moves from the altcoins. As can be seen in the chart, the combined market cap looks as though it is about to break out. The 0.786 Fibonacci for this latest move has been surpassed, and the price has consolidated above this, as well as above the wedge, which began to form in early December 2024. A breakout of the pennant, plus an eventual confirmation above the $1.13 trillion resistance is all that remains before Total3 can move into price discovery. 40-year descending trendline rejects the US dollar Source: TradingView One chart that signals the inverse of a bullish case for crypto is the Dollar Index (DXY). If the dollar is strong, this makes things more difficult for crypto, and vice versa. When Donald Trump came into office he said that he wanted to see interest rates fall, and a weaker dollar. The chart above shows a rejection of the DXY from a downtrend that is 40 years in the making. Combine this with strong horizontal resistance, and you have an almost impenetrable wall.

Bitcoin is soaring past $105,000, and altcoins are beginning to gain momentum. Could this be the start of the final parabolic phase for cryptocurrency? Is Total3 on the verge of a breakout? Source: TradingView Total3 represents the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, excluding $BTC and $ETH. This chart serves as an excellent indicator of altcoin movements. Observing the chart, it seems the overall market cap is on the brink of a breakout. The recent move has surpassed the 0.786 Fibonacci level, with the price stabilizing above it and the wedge that began forming in early December 2024. For Total3 to enter price discovery, it needs to break out of the pennant and then confirm above the $1.13 trillion resistance. US Dollar faces resistance from a 40-year downtrend line Source: TradingView The Dollar Index (DXY) chart suggests the opposite of a bullish scenario for crypto. A strong dollar often poses challenges for cryptocurrencies, and the reverse is also true. When Donald Trump became president, he expressed a desire for lower interest rates and a weaker dollar. The chart indicates a rejection of the DXY from a 40-year descending trendline. This, combined with strong horizontal resistance, creates a formidable barrier. As the dollar continues to decline in the Trump era, the crypto market is likely to thrive. Solana ($SOL) leads altcoins into price discovery Source: TradingView Among major altcoins, Solana (SOL) is at the forefront, leading the charge into what may be the final thrilling stage of the bull run. Currently, it's holding above a significant resistance level at $252. Bulls are eager to see the price remain above this threshold by week's end. If Solana maintains this momentum, with the Stochastic RSI at the chart's bottom indicating strong upward pressure, price discovery is on the horizon.

Notably, Lido DAO has gained significant attention from a flurry of investors lately, as evidenced by the recent accumulation trend of the token. So, here we explore the latest buying of the whale and see if the crypto could maintain its run towards the north in the coming days. Pepe Coin Whale Buys Lido DAO A renowned Pepe Coin whale, identified by the alias “0x373,” recently made waves in the crypto community. According to transaction tracking platform Spot On Chain report , the whale spent 664.5 ETH, valued at around $2.38 million, to buy 1.167 million LDO tokens. The average purchase price was approximately $2.036 per token. Notably, this substantial purchase demonstrates growing confidence in Lido DAO, a decentralized staking solution that has been gaining traction among investors. The whale’s wallet still holds 750 WETH, valued at $2.56 million, suggesting that the trader may continue accumulating LDO. Source: Spot On Chain, X Meanwhile, earlier this week, another on-chain whale “0x655” swapped 1,512 ETH and 10.5K FXS for 2.72 million LDO. This whale currently holds 5.765 million LDO tokens. This accumulation trend reflects broader market sentiment, as LDO gains popularity as a staking powerhouse. Notably, the Pepe Coin whale’s move has further fueled LDO’s upward momentum, sparking optimism about sustained growth. Source: Spot On Chain, X A Look Into The Pepe Coin Whale’s Diversified Holdings The Pepe Coin whale’s diversified crypto portfolio has gained notable traction. In addition to the recent LDO acquisition, their holdings include 2.987 trillion Pepe Coin, valued at $46.4 million. Notably, this whale has profited $55.4 million from Pepe Coin investments alone, especially amid the recent surge in Pepe Coin price. Besides, the wallet also contains 10.24 million ENA tokens, worth $9.12 million, with a recorded profit of $3.82 million. This diversified portfolio highlights the whale’s strategic approach to high-potential assets. On the other hand, such calculated investments often act as indicators for other investors, drawing attention to projects like Lido DAO and potentially driving demand. LDO Price Rally To Sustain? Lido DAO price surged nearly 19% today and exchanged hands at $2.09, while its trading volume jumped 32% to $292 million. The crypto has witnessed volatile trading lately, as evidenced by its 24-hour high and low of $2.10 and $1.72, respectively. Besides, the Lido DAO RSI currently hovers near the 56 mark, indicating further positive momentum ahead. Lido DAO (LDO) Price Meanwhile, Lido DAO’s recent price rally aligns with growing interest in liquid staking solutions, particularly as the crypto market continues to recover. The platform’s innovation in Ethereum staking and DeFi integrations positions it as a market leader. With increased whale activity and accumulation trends, LDO could maintain its bullish trajectory. However, market volatility remains a factor, and future price action will likely depend on broader crypto trends and network developments. How ENA & Pepe Coin Prices Are Performing? Pepe price has surged nearly 6% today, pushing the profit percentage of the whale further higher. The top meme coin’s trading volume also surged 50% to $1.29 billion. Besides, Pepe Futures Open Interest also surged 3%, indicating more gains ahead for the crypto. Having said that, if the meme coin continues its upward run, it could significantly increase the profit of the Pepe Coin whale. On the other hand, Ethena or ENA price surged about 8% to $0.9008, and its trading volume rocketed 82% to $712 million. The crypto has touched a one-day high and low of $0.9229 and $0.8049, respectively.

BREAKING: 🇺🇸 SEC OFFICIALLY RESCINDS SAB 121, WHICH PREVENTED BANKS FROM CUSTODYING #BITCOIN pic.twitter.com/VCnggkCGmL — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) January 23, 2025 Introduced in March 2022 under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler , SAB 121 required institutions holding bitcoin and crypto assets for customers to record those holdings as liabilities on their balance sheets. This accounting standard created significant operational and financial burdens for banks and custodians, effectively discouraging them from providing bitcoin-related services. The rule was widely criticized by the crypto industry and lawmakers, with SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce famously calling it a ""pernicious weed"" in April 2023. ""Bye, bye SAB 121! It's not been fun,"" Peirce wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Thursday, following the SEC's issuance of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 122, which formally rescinds the guidance. The SEC's move to rescind SAB 121 comes just days after Gensler's resignation and marks the start of a new era under Republican leadership. Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda, who assumed the role on Monday, quickly announced the formation of a crypto task force led by Peirce to craft clearer and more practical regulatory frameworks for the industry. ""To date, the SEC has relied primarily on enforcement actions to regulate crypto retroactively and reactively, often adopting novel and untested legal interpretations along the way,"" the agency acknowledged in a statement on Tuesday. With the removal of SAB 121, major banks are now expected to move swiftly to integrate bitcoin and crypto custody services into their offerings.

As noted by Sean McBride, a former Ripple official, this is likely to happen because a settlement is more effective. He claimed that “Ripple, Garlinghouse, and Larsen are entitled to be paid” and suggested that Ripple has outsmarted the SEC.

Vitalik Buterin’s Scaling Plan Could Burn 713k ETH Annually,https://coingape.com/markets/ethereum-price-surge-ahead-vitalik-buterins-scaling-plan-could-burn-713k-eth-annually/,"Ethereum price is on the rise again and trades around No data found for ethereum on 5 minutes ago as of No data found for ethereum on 5 minutes ago on January 24, 2025, but a new proposal from Vitalik Buterin could significantly impact its future trajectory. The co-founder’s recent proposal for accelerating Ethereum’s scalability — targeting 100,000 transactions per second (TPS) — has the ability to potentially reshape ETH’s tokenomics. This vision proposes scaling upgrades and Ethereum’s burn mechanism, which could remove 713,000 ETH annually from circulation, according to Buterin’s estimates. Let’s explore how this could impact Ethereum’s future and short-term impact on the price. Ethereum Price Today Ethereum price today trades around No data found for ethereum on 5 minutes ago as of No data found for ethereum on 5 minutes ago. From a daily high of No data found for ethereum on 5 minutes ago ETH’s value is down No data found for ethereum on 5 minutes ago% on January 24. While the short-term performance has been uninspiring, the outlook is likely to change if Vitalik’s suggested plan comes to fruition. eth price today *Ethereum price updated as of No data found for ethereum on 5 minutes ago. Vitalik Buterin’s Scaling Proposal & ETH Burn Impact Vitalik’s recent blog that outlines the “Surge” roadmap aims to scale Ethereum to 100,000 TPS by 2026. This plan aims to achieve its goal via Layer-2 rollups (e.g., Optimism, zkSync) and sharding, which parallelizes transaction processing. To facilitate these, the blog outlines some key burn mechanisms: Ethereum’s EIP-1559, which was introduced in 2021, plays a crucial role in this plan. Buterin notes that scaling would mean higher TPS and, hence, higher fees burned. Buterin specifically targets Layer-2 chains to make changes or be left behind. As a result, Vitalik projects 713,000 ETH burned annually if adoption aligns with scaling targets. This would create a deflationary feedback loop of reduced supply and rising demand and would have a bullish impact on the price of ETH , propelling it higher. Impact on Ethereum Price As noted above, Vitalik’s plan for Ethereum will create the deflationary feedback loop and could have a profound impact on the price of ETH. If the plan were to be implemented successfully, it could end the token’s lackluster performance witnessed in the past year and potentially kickstart an uptrend. In such a case, ETH could revisit $4,000, followed by an attempt to retest the all-time high of $4,877. Analysts predict Ethereum price could hit targets between $6,000 and $10,000. Market Sentiment and Investor Outlook Ethereum’s 2024 price performance was uninspiring and has caused investors to be impatient. The recent sale from the Ethereum Foundation pushes traders and critics, leading to a massive community uproar. As a result, Vitalik Buterin has is taking a closer look at the foundation’s structure and is considering alternatives like staking or DeFi services instead of swapping ETH for stablecoins. Suffice to say, investors are frustrated and are bearish on the Ethereum price performance. However, this outlook might be changing, a few data points indicate. Ethereum ETF Flows But the outlook could change for long-term and institutional investors as seen in the spot Ethereum ETF flows data provided by SoSo Value. These instruments saw an outflow of $14.93 million on January 23, ending its four-day inflow streak. However, with the approval of a national crypto stockpile, it is likely Ethereum (ETH) will also be included along with Bitcoin (BTC). Hence, ETF flows for the second-largest crypto market capitalization should become positive in the coming days. Spot ETH ETF Flows With this positive outlook, let’s explore what the ETH’s technical analysis is indicating. Ethereum Price Analysis & Forecasts The daily Ethereum price chart shows a falling wedge formation that forecasts a 17% rally on successful breakout. This technical formation predicts an Ethereum price target of $4,000, which is obtained by adding the height of the wedge to the breakout point of roughly $3,400. The key support levels include $3,132 and $3,057. A drop into this zone will be a good place to buy the dips. If ETH breaks the falling wedge’s upper trend line it will face $3,592 resistance level, beyond which it will approach the $4,000 psychological level. If buyers are persistent, Ethereum price will attempt to revisit the ATH at $4,877. But the target that investors are looking for is the $5,000 psychological level. An ambitious target will be the 161.8% Fibonacci extension level of $5,863 or the $6,000 psychological level. While $6,000 might seem like an exaggerated target, analysts have forecasted ETH could head as high as $10,000 in this cycle. ETH/USDT 1-day chart A breakdown of the $3,000 support floor will invalidate the bullish thesis and potentially trigger a 13% crash to $2,657. In a dire case, Ethereum price could drop as low as $2,341. The post Ethereum Price Surge Ahead?

After reaching a multi-year high last Friday, HBAR experienced a sharp correction, dropping over 22%. Despite this pullback, the price action suggests that Hedera is gearing up for its next major move, keeping investors optimistic about its bullish potential. Related Reading: Chainlink Is In The Middle Of A Bullish Breakout – Analyst Sets $50 Target Renowned analyst Carl Runefelt has shared a detailed technical analysis on X, shedding light on HBAR’s current position. According to Runefelt, Hedera has successfully tested a key demand level following its recent drop, indicating that the cryptocurrency is preparing for a significant upward move. This successful retest of support is seen as a bullish signal, especially in a market marked by heightened volatility. As Hedera continues to consolidate its position among market leaders, its ability to hold critical levels and rebound with strength is a testament to its growing adoption and investor confidence. With market conditions still uncertain, HBAR’s performance in the coming days will be pivotal in determining whether it can sustain its bullish momentum and lead the way in the altcoin market. All eyes are on Hedera as it prepares for what could be another explosive rally. Hedera Prepares For A Breakout Hedera has been navigating the volatile crypto market with remarkable resilience, positioning itself as a strong contender to lead this bullish cycle. As the broader market enters a bullish phase, HBAR’s price action reflects its potential, having been in a sideways consolidation since early December. This prolonged phase of accumulation suggests that Hedera may be primed for a breakout. Market analysts have been increasingly optimistic about HBAR’s performance, with many pointing to its strong fundamentals and growing adoption as reasons for its bullish outlook. Notably, Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting key developments in HBAR’s price action. According to Runefelt, HBAR has successfully retested a critical demand zone that previously acted as resistance. This successful retest is a bullish signal, indicating that the price is building a solid foundation for its next upward move. Runefelt further emphasized that if HBAR continues to hold this key level, the next logical step would be to set new yearly highs. He has set an ambitious price target of $4.20, which he believes is achievable once HBAR breaks above Friday’s price peak. Related Reading: Solana Compresses Near Previous ATH – Gearing Up For The Next Leg Higher? With the market sentiment turning positive and Hedera’s strong technical setup, the coming weeks could be pivotal for HBAR. A breakout above its current consolidation range could catapult it into new territory, reaffirming its position as a market leader in this cycle. Investors are closely watching for signs of this anticipated rally as Hedera continues to demonstrate its potential to outperform in the evolving crypto landscape. HBAR Price Action: Key Levels To Hold Hedera is currently trading at $0.33, following a sharp decline since last Friday’s highs. Despite the pullback, the price remains within a critical range, and bulls must act decisively to reclaim momentum and re-establish a bullish outlook. Holding above the $0.315 support level is essential to prevent further downside and maintain a stable foundation for recovery. The immediate target for bulls is to push the price above the $0.35 resistance level, which has acted as a barrier in recent sessions. A successful reclaim of this level would signal renewed strength and spark optimism among investors. Breaking through $0.35 could set the stage for a broader rally, with the next key milestone at the $0.40 mark. A move above $0.40 would reinforce confidence in HBAR’s bullish potential, likely attracting fresh buying interest and solidifying its position in the ongoing market recovery. However, failure to hold above $0.315 could result in further consolidation or even a deeper correction, challenging the positive sentiment around HBAR.

This enormous, half-trillion-dollar project, set up to ensure that the U.S. remains on top of the artificial intelligence food chain, is a partnership of OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and other leading firms in technology. Their goal is to set up a brand-new, cutting-edge AI infrastructure that, as benefits under a national security program, promises the creation of 100,000 new jobs. Not only has the tech industry been excited by the announcement, but the cryptocurrency market is seeing an unexpected surge. In the hours following the announcement, the memecoin $STARGATE emerged, shot to a market cap of $12 million, and achieved an astounding $138 million in trading volume. Stargate: Transforming AI Infrastructure and National Security The Stargate initiative, driven by SoftBank and OpenAI, represents a monumental step in the U.S. technological evolution. The four-year project plans to invest $500 billion in the U.S. AI infrastructure, with $100 billion set to roll out almost immediately. The effort, described by some as a “moonshot” for reindustrialization, aims not just to grow the economy but also to shore up national security against an increasingly competitive global landscape. Announcing The Stargate Project The Stargate Project is a new company which intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States. We will begin deploying $100 billion immediately. This infrastructure will secure… — OpenAI (@OpenAI) January 21, 2025 The statement said that the project is not just about the technological advancement of the Stargate project. It is also about creating a tremendous number of economic opportunities and about generating widespread economic benefits. They expect the Stargate project to generate “hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country”—not just the few that are sometimes created when something new and high-tech comes along. Prominent figures in the tech and investment world will head up the initiative. SoftBank, a global leader in technology investments, will manage the project’s financial aspects. OpenAI will oversee its operational execution. The head of SoftBank, visionary leader Masayoshi Son, has been named chairman of the Stargate project, which furthers emphasizes the significance of this collaboration. Key Players and Partnerships The achievements of Stargate will depend on the work of its leading technology partners—Arm, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Oracle, and OpenAI. Currently, the initiatory phases of the project are unfolding in Texas, with anticipation of broadening into other states within the U.S., as additional accords are secured. Stargate’s execution is primarily the collaboration of three companies: Oracle, NVIDIA, and OpenAI. Together, these companies will design and execute the advanced computing systems that are needed to power the initiative. This partnership builds on the long-standing relationship between OpenAI and NVIDIA, going back to 2016, and a more recent collaboration of OpenAI and Oracle. The project is also crucially supported by Microsoft. OpenAI will keep using Microsoft Azure as its main cloud computing platform. OpenAI will take advantage of the extra computational power from Stargate to train its new models and bring to market its latest products and services. These associations aim to hasten the movement toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) and to utilize AI in ways that enhance human life. “AGI is the kind of intelligence that can do anything that a human can do,” said Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO. He further defined AGI as not just “kinda doing it” or “doing it some of the time.” OpenAI believes that AGI will be achieved and that its partnership with Microsoft will help improve the chances of the AI being beneficial and widely avoidable. The $STARGATE Memecoin Craze Although the Stargate AI initiative has taken technologists and policymakers by storm, it has also given birth to an unanticipated development: a hot new investment opportunity in the world of cryptocurrencies. Shortly after the initiative’s announcement, a memecoin called $STARGATE was launched in the cryptocurrency marketplace. And to say it has been well received is an understatement. The market cap of the memecoin jumped to $12 million in a few hours, with a trading volume of more than $138 million. This rapid growth shows how the crypto community takes the events of the day and leverages them to create speculative tokens with almost no real connection to the initiatives they claim to reference. $STARGATE’s ascent has been meteoric, but it is yet unknown whether it has the prospects to hang around for a while. Memecoins are notoriously volatile and depend more on market sentiment than on any underlying value. Still, the token’s newfound popularity speaks to just how jazzed people are about the Stargate project and the potential dent it—or any AI project—could make in the overall crypto landscape. A Vision for the Future The Stargate initiative is a significant step for the United States in reclaiming its global leadership in technology and innovation. The project’s substantial investments in AI infrastructure and partnerships with top-tier tech firms are designed to produce three key outcomes: robust economic growth, markedly improved national security, and, just as important, an assurance that the economic and technological juggernaut that is artificial intelligence brings benefits to all humankind. The unexpected rise of the $STARGATE memecoin serves as a reminder of just how unpredictable the effects of technological advancement can be. When the Stargate project was first announced, nobody could have guessed that its eventual rollout would also give birth to a memecoin. In the age of Web3, we must be careful not to take such developments for granted. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Meanwhile Whale Activity Tracked In Yeti Ouro Presale,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/meanwhile-whale-activity-tracked-in-yeti-ouro-presale/,"The post XRP News: Over $58 Million Worth Of XRP At Risk? Meanwhile Whale Activity Tracked In Yeti Ouro Presale appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple has recently come under legal questions and scrutiny that caused speculation to arise that $58 million worth of XRP is currently at risk. This amount of XRP raises questions considering bear activity surrounding the token. One more piece of fascinating news that is emerging concerns the ERC-20 ecosystem and relates to the presale of Yeti Ouro (YETIO) . There is increased whale activity with this new utility meme coin that aims to truly combine meme culture with a Play-to-Earn (P2E) system. XRP News Legal analysts state that the XRP community is buzzing concerning conflicts of litigation in the past and in the present. In the case that millions worth tokens are put at risk, litigation is sure to shake multi million dollar funds. Some reports estimate that a combination of frozen funds, potential settlement claims, and a lengthy investigation process might place approximately $58 million in XRP at risk. This has fueled a debate in the community as to whether or not that swift resolution is sufficient to provide certainty that the tokens will in fact have a long term promise. XRP price is currently trading at $3.12 on Coinmarketcap. Exacerbating the friction, former officials and stakeholders have expressed that any negative findings within the regulatory scope could stall any prospective XRP-powered ETFs. For now, XRP price is still able to power through consolidation within the $3 price range which is a couple of notches above defined levels of support, but overshadowed by these uncertainties. Whale Interest In Yeti Ouro Presale While the scrutiny of XRP’s regulatory issues is receiving plenty of media attention, other watchers of the market have noted that larger addresses seem to be showing interest in Yeti Ouro (YETIO) – a novel token on the Ethereum blockchain that blends meme coin culture with a serious Play-to-Earn (P2E) model. Yeti Ouro markets itself as the next Dogecoin or 100x memecoin and aims to reward the community through a token burn mechanism of 5% of its total supply of 1 billion tokens. By auditing with SolidProof , the project further boosts investor confidence regarding its safety and transparency. Tokenomics And Presale Overview The project, currently in Presale Stage 2, has sold more than 132 million tokens. Each token is priced at $0.017 per YETIO, with a further bonus of 10% on purchases. Among other features, the highlighted attraction is Yeti Go, an actively being developed P2E racing game made on Unreal Engine. Not to mention, YETIO will also have direct control over the soon coming P2E racing game Yeti Go which is built with an unreal engine, and Dolby Atmos powered spatial audio. Players are able to knock opponents off platforms, maneuver around various obstacles, and use their weapons in the melee PvP races. The team recently finished the second iteration of the game mechanics alongside the level’s design with one of the best asset development companies that have worked on the Call of Duty, Spiderman, The Witcher and Dead Sapce franchises. The dev team recently released a video showcasing glimpses of the level 1 map of Yeti Go game. According to Newzoo , global gaming revenue grew from $70.6 billion in 2012 to $187.7 billion in 2024. Conclusion Although the prospects of XRP owners seem rather dubious with the regulatory hurdles that can jeopardize their investments well into the millions, whale movement is continuously transitioning towards newer endeavors such as Yeti Ouro. Yeti Ouro’s presale success highlights its demand, by the end of 2025, YETIO could exceed $10. Its focus on combining utility and meme coin culture offers a clear path for growth making it one of the best investment opportunities of 2025.

Suspicious Activity Across Multiple Chains Phemex preliminary alert flagged transactions coming from its hot wallets that seemed suspicious. The hot wallets in question are supposed to hold only a limited amount of assets, but they carry around $29 million worth of digital assets inside them. The alert was for not just one blockchain but several major ones: Binance Smart Chain (BNB), Ethereum (ETH), Optimism (OP), Polygon (POL), Base (BASE), and Arbitrum (ARB). The transactions involved were just too big in amount and number and too fast for what should be normal operating procedures for any exchange’s hot wallets. ALERT Hey @Phemex_official , Our systems have detected multiple suspicious transactions involving your hot wallets across several chains. Over $29M worth of digital assets have been transferred by suspicious addresses on chains including $BNB , $ETH , $OP , $POL , $BASE , and $ARB .… pic.twitter.com/1bFlRmlLUz — Cyvers Alerts (@CyversAlerts) January 23, 2025 Further review has uncovered that the assailants did not limit themselves to just these chains. The Bitcoin (BTC) and TRON blockchains were also targeted, substantially raising the total estimated losses to about $37 million. It’s a worrying trend that these dubious locations have started to turn the pilfered properties into Ethereum (ETH), a typical tactic employed by hackers to cover their tracks. And that they’re using Ethereum isn’t incidental—because Ethereum is a public blockchain, the stolen assets could be further obscured by using mixing services that operate on Ethereum. Official Response and Assurance from Phemex With increasing worries, Phemex’s chief executive has taken it upon himself to address the matter directly with users. In a declaration issued to the public, the head of the company made it very clear that they are on top of the investigation. He also made a point to emphasize, so as to relieve any tension among users, that the cold wallet system used by Phemex—which, loosely put, is a system designed to keep a large portion of user funds in a very secure, offline environment—remains untouched and secure. UPDATE CEO of @Phemex_official has confirmed that they are investigating recent incident and their cold wallets are remains safe!

But just how secure are they? The cry from Phemex, a Singapore-based trading platform, that its hot wallets had been breached showed that even online storage solutions in the crypto space have serious vulnerabilities. Industry-Wide Concerns and Implications This incident emphasizes the increasing deftness of cybercriminals who are after the cryptocurrency industry. The breach not only puts the spotlight on Phemex’s internal security but also serves as a reminder of the threat to any company that manages digital assets. The situation is especially alarming for Phemex users because the attackers seem to have struck with precision. They targeted multiple chains and quickly moved the stolen funds. What stands out in this attack is that the stolen assets were swiftly converted into Ethereum, seeming to suggest a well-thought-out attempt to obfuscate the trail and make recovery efforts all the more difficult. Although the company’s cold wallet safety assurances may provide some relief, the breach’s massive scale has irrevocably dented user confidence in the platform. It may also, however, shed new light on the cryptocurrency community’s ongoing hot wallet security debate, with the balance between convenience and security being the key topic of concern. The Road Ahead for Phemex As the inquiry progresses, Phemex comes under increasing pressure to furnish clarity and take immediate steps to rectify the breach. Reestablishing trust with users will, in all likelihood, entail putting in place several improved safeguards and maybe even making good with some users who lost funds. The event also acts as a catalyst for other cryptocurrency exchanges to reassess the security of their frameworks. It is a $300 billion industry, with a significant amount of its currency traded daily. So, the importance of putting effective cybersecurity measures in place cannot be overstated. At this point, the crypto community will be meticulously observing Phemex’s reactions to this predicament and any developments that concern the retrieval of the misappropriated assets. This unfortunate episode stands as a stark reminder of the ongoing obstacles and dangers that come with the fast-changing realm of digital finance. While probes are ongoing, the larger industry must contemplate the teachings from this breach to avert comparable occurrences down the road. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Three promising contenders under $1 — Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Ozak AI (OZ) — starting to get some serious attention for their appeal and potential to skyrocket in 2025. These affordable yet impactful digital assets each bring something unique to the table: PEPE is still a topical memecoin, DOGE is an ever-popular meme, and OZ, powered by AI innovation, becomes a promising player for the future. Could these underdogs be the ones that lead the next big rally? Let’s explore. Pepe (PEPE) Over the past year, PEPE has risen tremendously, with gains of over 1,242%, and has captured the interest of many in the crypto community. However, the coin has established stability in some aspects, showing a positive trend and a $7.5 billion market capitalization. Even though the trading volume has not become very high, it still stays steady, which indicates that people still support the project. The price chart also shows some major breakdowns, especially in the middle of 2024, due to market popping and memes. Due to its social support and possibility of expansion, PEPE can be considered one of the most promising projects under $1. By 2025, this momentum could lead PEPE to new heights and therefore it will be of interest to monitor. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) experienced a 297% surge in price, surpassing $0.40 by the end of 2024 due to increased user interest and usage. Nevertheless, DOGE has consistently traded upwards, thanks to its strong ecosystem and celebrity support. Thanks to the ever-growing utility and strong support, Dogecoin may experience a new wave of growth in 2025, which should interest investors.

The platform has a great community, and meme-driven appeal, DOGE continues to benefit from its fans and adoption. Meanwhile, Ozak AI has innovative AI-powered financial tools and a secure data management system. All of these under $1 cryptos give distinct utility and make substantial profits possible.

Extremist groups worldwide are increasingly relying on crypto, with Europe seeing a concerning rise in activity, U.S.-based blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis warns. While North America still leads in overall contributions, amounting to over $20 million, Europe’s share has also grown sharply, especially since 2017, according to a Jan. 23 research report . “Between 2022 and 2024, Europe’s share rose dramatically, commanding as much as nearly 50% of total inflows,” the report said. Chainalysis, which used including public sanctions lists and research from “organizations specializing in extremism and terrorism financing,” says the surge has been fueled by nationalist, anti-Semitic, and white supremacist groups, often tied to polarized political events like elections in France and the U.K. “A concerning trend among ideological groups is the deliberate blending of ideologies to broaden appeal. For example, movements might combine homophobic rhetoric with white supremacist or pro-Russia themes, strategically attracting wider audiences by capitalizing on overlapping grievances and similar narratives.” Chainalysis You might also like: Chainalysis: Over 77% of wallets that hold TRUMP meme coin earned less than $100 Although the total inflows are growing, the average donation size has stayed relatively small, usually a few hundred dollars. However, the report notes that donor intensity is increasing, especially in Europe. Larger contributions often coincide with major political events, with donors either celebrating wins or reacting to losses. Amid the growth, privacy coins such as Monero ( XMR ) are becoming a preferred method for some groups to avoid scrutiny in regions with strict hate speech laws, like Germany and Austria, Chainalysis warned, highlighting a growing challenge in tackling extremist funding globally.

The Winner Might Be A Surprising Altcoin,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/can-cardano-ada-surpass-xrp-in-90-days-the-winner-might-be-a-surprising-altcoin,"The year kicked up with high competition among cryptocurrencies, especially from top contenders like Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP). However, the bullish rallies of the XRP price has investors wondering if Cardano's ADA can surpass Ripple by March. Amidst this debate, analysts have highlighted a trending presale altcoin that they believe could outshine both cryptocurrencies following its launch in February. In this article, we’ll delve into why this investment opportunity is worth seizing! XRP Price On Bullish Trajectory, Poised To Hit $4 In 3 Months Ripple (XRP) has been witnessing significant price increases since climbing above $3 for the first time since 2018. As at press time, the XRP price is trading around $3.11, reflecting a 1.25% increase in market cap and a notable 19.54% rise in trading volume. Many analysts attribute this XRP price rally to be mirroring the surge of Ripple's stablecoin RLUSD. They also highlight the conclusion of the U.S SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple as a major contribution. In the past few days, the XRP price has risen over 22%, having recorded 18 green days in the last 30 days. With the XRP price trading above the 200-day simple moving average, experts predict that the Ripple token may experience a minor correction before potentially rising by 40% to $4.33. Analysts Note That Cardano Stands A Chance To Challenge Ripple in 90 Days The crypto market is on a bull run as evidenced by the Fear and Greed index at 60, highlighting strong investor interest. Despite this, the Cardano's ADA price sentiment is currently bearish. However, the start of a new week came with more price volatility which has seen the price of Cardano's ADA drop by 9.6% to its current $0.99 level. Nevertheless, Cardano has implemented the Chang hard fork aimed at developing decentralized governance. This development will enhance user engagement in decision-making processes, solidifying Cardano’s position in the crypto market and ultimately push its price over 126% to $2. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether Cardano's ADA will be able to outperform the XRP price in the next 90 days. INTL Projected To Outperform Rivals In February While the likelihood of Cardano (ADA) surpassing Ripple (XRP) in performance remains uncertain, analysts are pointing towards the emerging altcoin INTL as one to watch. This viral presale token has successfully captured the attention of investors, having raised over $7.3 million in its ongoing presale . INTL plays a crucial role in the ecosystem of the AI-driven dual-chain trading platform, IntelMarkets. This platform is the first of its kind to combine next-generation analytics with blockchain technology, empowering users to buy, sell, and trade advanced AI agents.

The token has achieved significant attention from investors, rising to nearly $30 in December 2024. Though the price had dropped past that, the Chainlink price recovered quickly. Interestingly, a crypto analyst called its current performance within the breakout zone, gaining investor attention. Let’s discuss whether LINK could break out soon or not. Chainlink Price Enters Accumulation Zone, Ideal For Rally Popular crypto analyst Rose Premium signals that the Chainlink price has been consolidating below the key resistance level of $28 for nearly 13 days now. This zone acts as the accumulation zone, which sees strong buying activity. At present, LINK is trading at $26.03 and has been under consolidation for days. Still, the experts see it as the perfect buying opportunity, as the momentum is building for a complete uptrend. According to Rose X post , the breakout zone sits right below the current accumulation zone, where the Fibonacci retracement and resistance-turned-support act as the bullish rally’s foundation. As a result, if the LINK price drops to the breakout level between $18-$20, this will act as another buying opportunity, as this could especially lead to a bullish rally. Interestingly, many similar analysts have predicted a LINK price rally in January, increasing its credibility. Nevertheless, investors must watch the key level to make the right trading decisions. Breakout & Price Target To Watch The Chainlink price chart reveals the formation of the bullish triangle, which represents the bullish trajectory of the token. LINK currently trades at $26.03 and has surged 6% In the last 24 hours, confirming the breakout potential. With that, the key resistance levels to watch are $28.46, $34.11, and $39.48. However, the token must cross the short resistance at $28.46 to enter the rally. Once this happened, this could support the breakout further, eventually pushing the LINK price to $40 What’s Next For Chainlink Price? The LINK token has gained significant attention from the market for the past few weeks. Even at present, it has surged 6% with high investor interest, as the trading volume is up by 117%. Considering the positive outlook, analysts believe in a LINK price rally. More importantly, this could easily test $40 amid strong fundamental and increasing adoption, claims Rose. Moreover, Rose highlighted that $28 is a key resistance and the accumulation zone below this. If the price dropped to $18-$20, this could lead to a breakout due to a bullish triangle pattern formation. However, due to the volatility and unpredictability of the cryptocurrency market, investors must do further research before taking any risks.

Retired Biden (RETBIDE), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 12,000% in price in the coming days. This is because RETBIDE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Retired Biden can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Retired Biden could become the next viral memecoin. Retired Biden launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Retired Biden on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Retired Biden by entering its contract address (CA) – AXqay9FRCDDJXjtAQdHEmhiVArQgiNkrWteWsKbS4uKG – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like RETBIDE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-24 13:44:37

The price action has been astonishing: its RBLK token has surged 360%, the presale raise went past $9.2m, and analysts are predicting another surge before the presale ends. Rollblock’s laser focus is on innovating the $540 billion online gambling market with blockchain-based AI-driven cutting-edge GambleFi solutions. Even capturing a fraction of this massive market could propel RBLK into billion-dollar territory, potentially delivering exponential returns. However, what resonated with many market participants is its revenue-sharing model and deflationary mechanics. Each week, holders get a share of generated revenue, in addition to lucrative staking opportunities already mapped out. Its deflationary tokenomics creates a shrinking supply that drives scarcity and boosts the token’s value.

If CME’s XRP and Solana futures gain regulatory clearance, the SEC could be compelled to greenlight futures ETFs for these tokens. Meanwhile, XRP consolidates near $3, with bullish momentum building amid the appointment of Mark Uyeda as acting SEC Chair. Uyeda’s pro-crypto stance signals a potential end to the SEC’s aggressive enforcement era and a favorable resolution for the Ripple-SEC tussle. XRP’s price now eyes a breakout above its all-time high of $3.55, potentially reaching $4.20. PEPE: Whale accumulation hints at big gains ahead Pepe is poised for another explosive year in 2025. The meme coin shows clear signs of accumulation by whales and a potential breakout that could propel it to a new ATH. Recent blockchain data reveals that major investors strategically buy PEPE during the dip. Adding to the buzz, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s recent purchase of 508.6 million PEPE tokens has fueled market speculation. His endorsement, combined with rising social media mentions and increased active addresses, reflects growing retail and institutional interest. The technical outlook is getting better, too. PEPE’s double bottom formation at a critical support level and its bullish falling wedge pattern are key signals of an imminent rally. Conclusion While XRP and PEPE offer exciting potential, Rollblock’s momentum and disruptive market approach make it the standout investment opportunity of this bull run. This new GambleFi platform is transforming the $540 billion iGaming market with its cutting-edge blockchain and AI-driven solution. There’s no doubt these altcoins are primed for explosive growth.

This renewed interest comes from a combination of fundamental developments and technical indicators, and even promises small-time investors the potential for sizable gains. Perhaps the most intriguing of these developments is the announcement that a Dogecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has been proposed. BITWISE FILES FOR FIRST-EVER DOGECOIN ETF WITH U.S. SEC – Crypto fund manager Bitwise Asset Management recently filed for a Dogecoin $DOGE exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) through a Delaware Trust. Key Highlights: – Delaware… https://t.co/62sycV1dsp pic.twitter.com/Vjjk3jWkIH — BSCN (@BSCNews) January 23, 2025 Dogecoin ETF Proposal Could Change the Game In a major turn for Dogecoin, a top crypto fund manager, Bitwise Asset Management, has filed for a Dogecoin ETF with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The filing—done through a Delaware Trust—recently made its way to the public and represents a significant step toward bringing institutional-grade investment products to the often light-hearted meme coin. A potential new investment vehicle for Dogecoin is the $DOGE ETF, which could attract significant new investment from both retail and institutional investors. Dogecoin has a pretty impressive record of price increases when positive news breaks about it, like when it gets endorsed by Elon Musk or is listed on a new cryptocurrency exchange. If the $DOGE ETF becomes a reality, it could put Dogecoin in front of even more new investors. This could lead to some serious price action—possibly even propelling the price toward that elusive $1 mark. BREAKING NEWS: Bitwise Files for #Dogecoin ETF in Delaware How $DOGE is going to $1? 1⃣Historically, #DOGE has shown its ability to rally sharply on the back of positive trends, such as Elon Musk’s tweets and listings on major exchanges. 2⃣If the Dogecoin #ETF gets… pic.twitter.com/K6d8brwrfw — Coinpedia Markets (@MarketCoinpedia) January 23, 2025 Moreover, the official Dogecoin website is a very credible place to see the Dogecoin logo, in no uncertain terms, designating it as a widely recognized digital asset. This upsurge in visibility and attention is something we’re no longer used to seeing in just the hinterlands of the internet. Now, it’s something that has begun to take shape in the very real world of financial institutions. Technical Analysis: Bullish Momentum and Key Price Targets Looking at Dogecoin from a technical angle suggests it might be on the verge of a breakout. Right now, $DOGE is changing hands around $0.40 and forming a bullish “flag” pattern— a technical formation that often acts as a precursor to some impressive price action. Should Dogecoin close above $0.36226, we could very well see the next leg up in this Doge bull run. Dogecoin’s key short-term price targets include $0.43521, with the next potential target in the next few months set at $1. If the latter is achieved, it would mean a significant (185%) rise for Doge from its current price level—a level that, by the looks of recent gains and positive indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), is much more likely to be tested sooner than later. #Dogecoin is back in the spotlight as the DOGE Department gains traction and Bitwise files for a $DOGE ETF. Yet the price still remains stubborn. Will $DOGE see $1.0 before the end of 2025? NO YES — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) January 23, 2025 Renowned analyst Ali Martinez states that if a Dogecoin ETF were to be approved, the token might skyrocket to $15. His work aligns well with the TD Sequential indicator, which has seemingly presented a buy signal on Dogecoin’s four-hour chart. This tool is often used to anticipate price rebounds and is currently reinforcing the narrative that Dogecoin is building bullish momentum. #Dogecoin $DOGE ETF will send it to $15! https://t.co/4peKi93NZX pic.twitter.com/gRqDdoXhob — Ali (@ali_charts) January 22, 2025 Why the Dogecoin ETF Matters The Dogecoin ETF’s importance cannot be overstated. ETFs are considered by many to be a bridge that links the conventional financial markets with the crypto sector. By allowing investors to access Dogecoin in a format that is both regulated and user-friendly, an ETF could greatly enhance the token’s penetration and arrive in its legitimacy. Furthermore, if a Dogecoin ETF were to be approved, it might send a ripple across the entire cryptocurrency market and boost interest in other alternative cryptocurrencies. For Dogecoin, however, such an event might bring in enough institutional capital to make Dogecoin seem like a normal cryptocurrency with potential. Challenges and the Road Ahead Although the Dogecoin journey is exciting and seemingly headed for a worthwhile destination, it has its share of challenges. The SEC has been (and continues to be) cautious about approving new investment vehicles that are as-yet poorly understood. When the SEC approves cryptocurrency ETFs, it’s generally because the staff believes that investor protection is assured—and that market manipulation is unlikely, if not impossible. Whether these concerns can be assuaged with Dogecoin in particular remains to be seen. Dogecoin must keep going in the direction it is headed and must keep building its community success. It is entirely reliant on that, as Wall Street has mostly written off the asset class with a “meme” label. Even when key technical indicators hint at a bullish trend, the sheer volatility in the overall cryptocurrency market presents a constant risk of an 80% collapse. Conclusion The engagement that Dogecoin commands in the crypto community is unmatched. That much is evident from the proposed Dogecoin ETF, which could put the much-loved token on a more serious path into traditional financial markets. Coupled with the kind of momentum it has garnered recently, that could lead to something even more unprecedented for Dogecoin: a financialized crypto asset that retains its goofy charm while unleashing on the world, presumably, a wave of bullish price action. While the market waits for the SEC to make its decision, everyone is watching Dogecoin’s price action. Can it break resistance and achieve new highs? We don’t know yet. But the combo of institutional interest plus community support makes us think that perhaps the best is yet to come for $DOGE. Some analysts have even given price targets as high as $15, which would obviously make this one of the most exciting chapters in Dogecoin history if it played out.

As a result, the long-running XRP lawsuit gets extended further than the earlier anticipated end date in April or May. Ripple to File Its Appeal Brief in SEC Case by Mid-April In a court filing on January 24, Ripple Labs writes a letter to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit requesting the due date of its brief. The company proposed a due date of April 16 to file a brief related to the appeal and cross-appeal. Furthermore, the letter states that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and executive chairman Chris Larsen have agreed and requested the same date. Under this Court’s Rule 31.2(a)(1)(B), Ripple requests a due date of April 16, 2025 for its brief. I am authorized to state that Appellees Bradley Garlinghouse and Christian A. Larsen join in this request. Source: CourtListener Lawyers Anticipate Dismissal of Ripple SEC Case XRP community and lawyers closely following the case believed a settlement or dismissal of the Ripple SEC case. Gary Gensler’s exit and pro-crypto US SEC under President Donald Trump are the motivation for the XRP lawsuit’s end. Lawyer Jeremy Hogan said that the due date request from Ripple is very standard. Whereas, the US SEC had 90 days to draft its initial brief. “The only question here is – will the brief need to be filed at all?” Jeremy Hogan earlier estimated the end of XRP lawsuit by April or May. Pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan believes the Ripple SEC case will be over by proposed due date as SEC Chair Paul Atkins may decide not to pursue the appeal. He added that its is just a strategy to “buy time to negotiate and formalize the SEC’s abject surrender.” US SEC Argued XRP Is Security in its Opening Brief Last week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed its opening brief in the XRP lawsuit , challenging Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling on XRP sales by Ripple Labs. The regulator argued that Judge Torres made a mistake in the ruling issued in July 2023 that XRP is not a security in itself. Ripple’s chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty called the SEC’s appeal “a rehash of already failed arguments.” Ripple executives are upbeat on abandoning the lawsuit by the Trump administration. Earlier this week, Better Markets filed Amicus brief in support of the US SEC arguing that the sales of XRP by Ripple Labs constitutes an investment contract.

While XRP and Cardano bring established networks and growing ecosystems, Lightchain AI is turning heads with its revolutionary integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Currently in its presale phase at $0.005625 per token, Lightchain AI has already raised $12.7 million, reflecting strong investor confidence. Its cutting-edge innovation positions it as a potential leader in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. XRP’s Potential to Surpass Solana in 2025 As of January 23, 2025, XRP is trading at $3.16, while Solana (SOL) is at $255.67. XRP's market capitalization has reached $182.46 billion, surpassing Solana's $118.18 billion. This shift is attributed to XRP's recent price surge, driven by favorable legal outcomes and the approval of Ripple's stablecoin, RLUSD. Analysts predict XRP could reach $5 to $7 in the first half of 2025, further solidifying its position ahead of Solana. However, both assets remain subject to market volatility, and their rankings may change as the year progresses. Cardano’s Steady Growth and Competitive Edge Over Solana As of January 23, 2025, Cardano (ADA) is trading at $0.974252, while Solana (SOL) is at $255.75.

As both platforms evolve, Cardano's emphasis on security and scalability may offer a competitive edge over Solana, particularly for applications prioritizing reliability and academic rigor. Lightchain AI is Set to Outshine Solana as Top Contender Lightchain AI is positioning itself to surpass Solana by delivering robust technology and sustainable growth. Its well-structured tokenomics ensures long-term ecosystem health, with 40% allocated to presale, 28.5% for staking rewards, 15% for liquidity, and smaller portions for marketing, treasury, and team incentives. This thoughtful distribution supports both immediate and future development. Lightchain AI’s focus on developer accessibility through comprehensive APIs and SDKs fosters innovation, making it easier to build decentralized applications and interact with its ecosystem. Additionally, its low-latency infrastructure enables real-time transaction processing and efficient AI workload execution, ensuring seamless performance even under heavy network demand.

Analysts expect XRP could rise to between $5 and $7 in the first half of 2025, reinforcing its lead over Solana. Nonetheless, both cryptocurrencies are still influenced by market volatility, and their standings might change as the year unfolds. Cardano’s Consistent Growth and Advantage Over Solana As of January 23, 2025, Cardano (ADA) is valued at $0.974252, while Solana (SOL) is at $255.75. Cardano's deliberate, research-focused strategy prioritizes security and sustainability, attracting developers looking for a solid foundation for decentralized applications. On the other hand, Solana's ability to process high volumes quickly and affordably has attracted projects needing fast transaction speeds.

However, that is rarely the case for many crypto investors, so between Tezos, Iota and 1FUEL , let’s determine which one should get your $10,000 investment. Tezos (XTZ): A beacon of energy-efficient decentralized transactions From sponsoring Formula One and English Premier League teams to upgrading block time and staking mechanisms, Tezos is doing everything possible to keep growing. Tezos stakeholders understand that having good fundamentals and solid technology isn’t enough. You need to make people aware, explain why these things matter and do all this in a fun, engaging manner. Tezos has done a good job at showing how the recent Quebec upgrade effected on 20 th January 2025 is a step in the right direction. This upgrade will allow those who stake on behalf of others to accept up to nine times their stake (the previous limit was five times). It will also make direct stakers get rewarded three times more than those who delegate. Tezos stakeholders will enjoy a time-to-finality of 16 seconds, which is pretty impressive. Tezos’s Quebec upgrade also improves the Adaptive Issuance mechanism, enabling a better balance between staking rewards and chain security. Finding a way to keep an on-chain economy thriving while offering more secure, decentralized technology will always draw in investors. Therefore, 2025 could be a standout year in Tezos’s history. Iota (IOTA): A determined blockchain transaction subsidizer Iota has achieved two major goals that will set it on a path to outstanding gains in 2025. Firstly, Iota has figured out how to make transactions free. Secondly, Iota developments include an infrastructural setup that seamlessly incorporates Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In a world where more products and services increasingly rely on IoT sensors and decentralized data, such a platform is a treasure. From self-driving cars using GPS to robots managing data centres, Iota developments could bring the benefits of democratization to many trailblazing technology sectors. 1FUEL (OFT): A budding decentralized trading disruptor 1FUEL will roll out innovations that reimagine what a satisfying trading experience should feel like. 1FUEL will enable users to move assets smoothly between hot wallets and military-grade cold storage. This is ideal for those specializing in long-term strategies but often desire to take advantage of sudden and brief market shifts. 1FUEL will also offer inbuilt mixing capabilities to enable users to avoid having their transactions tracked by malicious actors and competitors. 1FUEL users will even enjoy AI-powered features that allow them to lean back and watch the money make itself. Why you should join the 1FUEL presale 1FUEL has sound tokenomics that prioritize long-term platform development over short-term marketing hype and quick exits for team members. 1FUEL is also going for only $0.017 per coin, with a 20% bonus on each purchase, so now is the time to fill up your bags. Conclusion: Tezos, Iota and 1FUEL, which one should get the $10,000? Ideally, the goal is to maximize gains from each of these projects. And while they all have advancements relevant to user demands in 2025, 1FUEL stands out. This is because it packs more capabilities within its field than many other projects. Let’s show 1FUEL some love by buying as many presale tokens as possible.

Some forecasts suggest a potential 100x increase, though such optimistic predictions should be approached with caution. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) , on the other hand, could enhance Bitcoin’s functionality by introducing smart contracts and decentralized applications. This development could bridge Ethereum’s adaptability with Bitcoin’s security, potentially making PlutoChain an interesting project to keep an eye on. Let’s take a more detailed look below! 100X Potential? Analysts Break Down Pepe Coin’s Chances This Bull Run The evaluations of Pepe Coin’s potential for a 100x surge in the upcoming bull run are starting to emerge. PEPE trades at approximately $0.00001461 per token, with a market capitalization of around $6,14 billion and a 24-hour trading volume near $870 million. Recent data indicates increased activity among Ethereum whales, with two significant investors acquiring a total of 480 billion PEPE tokens, valued at approximately $8.7 million. This substantial accumulation suggests growing confidence in Pepe Coin’s long-term prospects. Some Binance analysts predict a 100x return by 2025, citing growing hype and market buzz. However, CoinCodex forecasts a 228% rise by early 2025, significant but short of a 100x increase. Achieving a 100x increase would require PEPE to reach approximately $0.0019, implying a market cap of about $785 billion, surpassing Bitcoin’s current market cap. This scenario would necessitate unprecedented adoption and market dynamics. On that note, forecasters at Changelly seem to be the most optimistic ones predicting a potential price of $0,0032 – a 200x increase! In summary, while the enthusiasm surrounding Pepe Coin is palpable, analysts emphasize the importance of a cautious and informed approach. The potential for substantial returns exists, but it is contingent upon a confluence of market dynamics and strategic developments within the cryptocurrency landscape. PlutoChain Could Expand Bitcoin’s Overall Utility in Areas Such as DeFi and Beyond Bitcoin’s evolution might be reaching an exciting new chapter with PlutoChain ($PLUTO) – the first hybrid Layer-2 solution that could unlock vast potential for Bitcoin. Traditionally seen as a store of value, Bitcoin is now on the verge of supporting decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and innovations like DeFi, NFTs, and AI. PlutoChain could offer a solution for Bitcoin’s block time of 10 minutes. Through its innovative Layer-2 technology, PlutoChain offers a block time of just 2 seconds, potentially improving scalability and cost-efficiency, and bringing Ethereum-like functionality to Bitcoin. The project could stand apart with its compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) , potentially enabling developers to seamlessly transfer Ethereum-based DeFi applications to Bitcoin. This bridge between Ethereum and Bitcoin could pave the way for a new decentralized ecosystem anchored on Bitcoin’s established security. Furthermore, the hybrid network may reduce reliance on Ethereum, Solana, and other Layer-1 platforms, making Bitcoin the core of a fast, low-cost ecosystem for innovations. Moreover, its governance system could give users a direct say in the project’s future direction. With over 43,200 daily transactions on its testnet, PlutoChain has demonstrated real-world readiness. Combined with a robust security structure bolstered by independent audits from SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi , this project could tap into the underdeveloped DeFi market in Bitcoin, potentially driving a wave of innovation. Final Words Pepe Coin’s ambitious growth projections show excitement, with some analysts predicting up to a 200x increase in value this bull run. However, this optimistic outlook is tempered by the need for extraordinary market dynamics.

With recent developments like the DOGE-1 mission, the launch of new tech initiatives, and high-profile endorsements, Dogecoin keeps evolving beyond its meme origins. Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) is coming up as a next-gen potential solution to Bitcoin’s speed and scalability challenges thanks to the introduction of a hybrid Layer-2 blockchain. Here’s all you need to know. Can Dogecoin Hit $1? Experts Weigh In As of January 23, 2025, Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading at approximately $0.3547, with a 24-hour trading volume of around $2.96 billion. The circulating supply stands at about 150 billion DOGE, resulting in a market capitalization of approximately $52.09 billion. Over the past 24 hours, DOGE has experienced a price decline of 2.50%, and over the past 7 days, a decline of 8.27%. The immediate resistance is at the 0.5 Fibonacci level of $0.3943 with immediate support at around $0.345 and $0.330. The RSI is at 44 right now, which puts DOGE in a slightly bearish zone. One standout moment for DOGE came on November 14, 2024, when President-elect Donald Trump announced the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), with Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy at the helm. Unsurprisingly, this news caused DOGE’s price to jump nearly 20%, proving once again how closely tied the token is to big headlines. On the legal front, a lawsuit accusing Elon Musk of manipulating Dogecoin’s value was dismissed on November 15, 2024, due to lack of evidence. This outcome helped remove some uncertainty and likely reassured many investors about the token’s stability. From a tech perspective, the Dogecoin Foundation rolled out its roadmap for 2024, focusing on projects like GigaWallet, LibDogecoin, and RadioDoge. Then there’s the DOGE-1 mission, a collaboration with SpaceX to launch a satellite funded entirely by Dogecoin. This project is a fun yet meaningful way of showcasing DOGE’s potential for real-world applications. Bark , a crypto analyst on X, predicts a major breakout for $DOGE and says it will reach $1. Another analyst, Alice Crypto , says that Dogecoin has recently broken out of a bullish pennant and is showing a strong recovery from a critical support level. She forecasts an impressive rally of over 80%, with a projected target price ranging from $0.70 to $0.80. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Is The Next-Generation Solution that Could Improve Bitcoin with Speed, Security, and Smart Capabilities Bitcoin’s legacy as the most famous digital asset is undeniable, but it has its shortcomings. Frequent network congestion, sluggish transaction speeds, and steep fees often leave users frustrated, particularly during peak activity. These limitations stem from Bitcoin’s foundational design, which caps its transaction capacity at just a few per second. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) is a hybrid Layer-2 solution that could complement Bitcoin’s main blockchain. This project aims to alleviate congestion, minimize fees, and enhance scalability, which could make Bitcoin more accessible and efficient. One of Bitcoin’s longstanding challenges is its 10-minute block time, which slows down transaction processing significantly. Using Layer-2 technology PlutoChain offers block times of just 2 seconds, which could rival the speeds of advanced blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. PlutoChain also brings smart contract functionality to Bitcoin, which could elevate it from a digital store of value to a dynamic platform capable of supporting DeFi, NFTs, and AI-driven applications. Thanks to its built-in EVM compatibility , PlutoChain could make it seamless for developers to migrate their Ethereum-based projects to the Bitcoin ecosystem. During its testnet phase, PlutoChain showcased remarkable scalability by processing an impressive 43,200 transactions daily without delays. Security is at the forefront of PlutoChain’s vision. It has passed rigorous audits conducted by SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi and complies with global regulatory standards. A standout feature of PlutoChain is its community-driven governance model. This approach empowers users to propose and vote on crucial decisions, from new features to partnerships. The Bottom Line Dogecoin is slowly but surely evolving beyond a meme coin, and its developments, such as the DOGE-1 mission and tech advancements, confirm it. Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could set the stage to potentially revolutionize Bitcoin by addressing its scalability and speed limitations. With its blend of speed, security, and community-focused governance, this project could be the key to unlocking Bitcoin’s full potential. ———— Please remember that this article is purely informational and not financial advice.

39371432,426cec55-0efd-4541-bd25-7b62eafabe05,1737727200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/39371432.jpeg,Real Estate Firm Propy Is Rolling Out Crypto-Backed Loans to Buy Houses,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/01/24/real-estate-firm-propy-is-rolling-out-crypto-backed-loans-to-buy-houses,"What if you could put up your bitcoin ( BTC ) or ether ( ETH ) as collateral to buy a house? That’s essentially the idea behind real estate firm Propy’s upcoming sale, a condominium located in Honolulu, Hawaii, which is being sold at a starting price of $250,000. If they so choose, the prospective buyer will be able to take out a loan from Propy to acquire the property — as long as they provide 100% collateral in bitcoin or ether, and pledge the property as well. “It's a great proposition for bitcoin holders,” Natalia Karayaneva, CEO of Propy, told CoinDesk in an interview. “It's not a taxable event. They get a loan and buy real estate with it, instead of exiting bitcoin, paying taxes, and then buying real estate.” It’s a two-year loan, and it comes with 10% yearly interest. If the given cryptocurrency’s value drops more than 50%, the buyer will face a margin call; in a worst-case scenario, the crypto holdings may end up getting liquidated, and the real estate resold at an auction. However, if the cryptocurrency doubles in price, the buyer could end up paying the loan back simply through their gains. The interest payments, and loan itself, can be paid back in bitcoin, ether or USDC. Another important aspect of the deal is that the property has been tokenized. Launched in 2017, Propy aims to bring real estate transactions on-chain, thus speeding up settlement times and liquidity. In the case of the Hawaiian property sale, slated for January 29, a potential loan would be processed immediately, and upon completing repayment, a buyer would automatically be able to reclaim their crypto. “This isn’t just a milestone; it’s a glimpse into the future of real estate,” Karayaneva said. “We’re demonstrating how blockchain technology can simplify home buying, replacing the traditionally lengthy loan approval process with an instant, efficient solution.” Buying real estate on-chain Based on Ethereum layer 2 solution Base, Propy hasn't tokenized properties on a regular basis, at least as of yet. More often that not, the firm simply uses smart contracts to make real estate purchases quicker and reduce attorney fees. “The main business is coming from normal consumers. They even don't know that we use smart contracts on the back-end, but they love how quickly and transparent the whole process is,” Karayaneva said. When it tokenizes a property, the firm sets up an LLC for the property in the county register and then creates a token, a process that takes roughly two weeks. Upon acquisition, the LLC is amended to reflect the change of ownership, and the property’s token is transferred to its new owner. As of right now, pure crypto native deals only account for roughly 5% of the company’s volume, according to Karayaneva. One of these deals, for example, involved TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington turning his apartment into an NFT. Propy also auctioned a 17th-century Italian mansion on the blockchain back in 2017. “We haven’t done many of those transactions yet because we needed the loan product in order for us to scale,” she said. “People need a mortgage or a loan to get real estate exposure.” Propy also provides escrow services in collaboration with Coinbase, the goal being to support the crypto community in making real estate purchases in crypto. For example, the escrow service helps bitcoin holders avoid wrapping their holdings in ERC-20 tokens like wBTC. Once a property has been tokenized, nothing prevents the buyer from eventually selling it to another crypto native without necessarily going through Propy. If the token is sent to a new wallet, the buyer will automatically be given a link to provide Know-Your-Customer (KYC) information; their name will subsequently appear in the LLC as the property owner. And the buyer can also unwrap the property from the LLC and own it the traditional way — a process that Karayaneva called “un-chaining.” “Our premier goal is really to on-chain as many real estate assets as possible,” Karayaneva said. “Imagine making an on-chain swap between a real estate on-chain asset and bitcoin asset, or another crypto asset. … It's a $300 trillion market. Imagine if it becomes liquid.”Read More: Propy Teams With Abra to Offer Property Purchases Backed by Crypto",Finance|Real Estate|Propy|Bitcoin|Ether|Tokenization|Exclusive,EN,0,0,BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-24 14:00:00

Is Ethereum dead? Table of Contents Ethereum’s fight for relevance The Ethereum Foundation’s identity crisis The Second Foundation: A competing vision for Ethereum’s future? Prominent figures take aim at Ethereum’s path forward Community and developers turn their back on Ethereum Ethereum’s fight for relevance From being celebrated as a pioneer in smart contracts to now facing relentless competition and internal discord, Ethereum’s ( ETH ) journey has started to look less like a steady climb and more like a rocky descent. To understand Ethereum’s predicament, let’s rewind to November 2021, when its total value locked hit an all-time high of $107 billion, riding a wave of optimism as ETH’s price surged to a lifetime high of $4,890. Ethereum lifetime TVL chart | Source: DeFi Llama Fast forward to the end of 2023, and that number had dwindled to just $30 billion — a staggering decline. Although 2024 offered a glimmer of recovery, with TVL climbing to $66 billion by mid-year, as of January 2025, Ethereum remains stuck at $64.5 billion. Meanwhile, its closest competitor, Solana ( SOL ), has scripted a far more compelling comeback story. After plunging from a TVL of $10 billion in late 2021 to a mere $210 million in early 2023, Solana roared back to life, hitting an all-time high of over $12 billion this month — outpacing Ethereum’s recovery in both speed and scale. Solana lifetime TVL chart | Source: DeFi Llama Beyond TVL, Ethereum appears to be losing ground on critical metrics like transaction volume and user fees. While Ethereum processes an average of 1-1.2 million daily transactions as of early 2025, Solana dwarfs this with a jaw-dropping 60-65 million transactions per day. Solana daily transaction count chart (2025) | Source: DeFi Llama Ethereum daily transaction count chart (2025) | Source: DeFi Llama And despite Ethereum charging higher fees per transaction, Solana’s daily fee volume is consistently higher, averaging $5-6 million this month and peaking at $35 million during the buzz surrounding the inauguration of Donald Trump as the 47th U.S. president. In comparison, Ethereum’s fee volume hovered around $3-4 million on average, with a modest spike to $15 million on the day Trump was inaugurated. Solana daily fees chart (2025) | Source: DeFi Llama Ethereum daily fees chart (2025) | Source: DeFi Llama Let’s dive deeper into the concerns surrounding Ethereum and how this once-blockchain pioneer is having a run for its life. The Ethereum Foundation’s identity crisis Ethereum’s struggles are not limited to technological hurdles. The Ethereum Foundation (EF), a nonprofit organization long viewed as the backbone of Ethereum’s development, is itself in a state of upheaval. Internal discontent, growing competition, and questions about the foundation’s vision have left the EF grappling with its identity at a time when Ethereum’s future has never been more precarious. The pressure has led Ethereum’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, to step in with sweeping plans to overhaul the EF’s leadership structure. For over a year, Buterin has been quietly working on a restructuring initiative aimed at addressing inefficiencies and improving communication between the EF and Ethereum’s developers. “We are in the process of large changes to EF leadership structure,” Buterin revealed in a recent X post, adding that the ultimate goal is to establish a “proper board” to guide the foundation. We are indeed currently in the process of large changes to EF leadership structure, which has been ongoing for close to a year. Some of this has already been executed on and made public, and some is still in progress. What we're trying to achieve is primarily the following… — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 18, 2025 Yet, this effort has not been without controversy. Critics argue that Buterin’s central role in the process undermines Ethereum’s ethos of decentralization. Others see it as a necessary intervention to salvage the EF’s declining reputation. One of the EF’s most polarizing strategies is its reliance on a “rollup-centric” roadmap, which prioritizes scaling Ethereum through layer-2 solutions. While these rollups have improved transaction speeds and reduced costs, they’ve also introduced new risks, such as diminished security guarantees and declining base fee revenues for Ethereum’s core network. Critics argue that these trade-offs highlight the EF’s inability to deliver a long-term scaling solution that rivals like Solana have already achieved . Solana’s ability to handle millions of transactions per day with near-zero fees has become a glaring benchmark, leaving Ethereum struggling to keep pace. Adding to the turbulence is the controversy surrounding Aya Miyaguchi, the EF’s executive director since 2018. Accusations of inefficiency and conflict-of-interest scandals have dogged her leadership, leading to a wave of online criticism and even a social media campaign calling for her resignation. While Miyaguchi remains in her role, the backlash has grown toxic, with some critics resorting to personal attacks and threats. Buterin, visibly frustrated, took to X to condemn these actions as “pure evil,” warning that they are driving top developers away from Ethereum. Pure evil. pic.twitter.com/mzCmOteu5r — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 21, 2025 “Some of Ethereum’s best devs have been messaging me recently, expressing their disgust with the toxic social media environment,” Vitalik tweeted recently, pushing back against calls for leadership changes at the EF. No. This is not how this game works. The person deciding the new EF leadership team is me. One of the goals of the ongoing reform is to give the EF a ""proper board"", but until that happens it's me. If you ""keep the pressure on"", then you are creating an environment that is… — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 21, 2025 He sharply critiqued, “YOU ARE MAKING MY JOB HARDER,” slamming the social media trollers and disgruntled users, as frustrations over stalled innovations and a hostile online community take center stage. The Second Foundation: A competing vision for Ethereum’s future? In December 2024, Konstantin Lomashuk, the founder of Lido — a protocol managing over 28% of Ethereum’s staked ETH — dropped a hint on X about plans to reshape Ethereum’s ecosystem. On your comment about Lido: I really believe it’s possible to build a true DAO that keeps Ethereum decentralized, censorship-resistant, and without introducing new downsides. That’s why Lido is planning to launch dual governance in Q1 2025, a solution that mitigates LDO… https://t.co/stuyQfRaVr — Konstantin Lomashuk cyber/acc (@Lomashuk) December 10, 2024 The idea, which he called the “Second Foundation,” was initially teased as a way to introduce competition to Ethereum’s leadership and decision-making processes. On Jan. 22, Lomashuk doubled down on this vision, sharing an official page for the Second Foundation on X, signalling that this wasn’t just an idea. 👀 https://t.co/o1pgQ8J3mC — Konstantin Lomashuk cyber/acc (@Lomashuk) January 22, 2025 The Second Foundation is designed to decentralize power within Ethereum by creating a parallel entity that challenges the Ethereum Foundation. Lomashuk has been critical of the EF’s insular structure, describing it as “super deep” and inaccessible to outsiders without years of research expertise. “Without competition, we risk losing the right path,” he wrote in a December post. The Second Foundation, he believes, will bring fresh perspectives and faster innovation to Ethereum. One of the foundational principles of the Second Foundation is to preserve Ethereum’s decentralization and censorship resistance while introducing more robust governance mechanisms. Lomashuk has highlighted plans to implement dual governance within Lido, starting in Q1 2025, as an example of the kind of innovation the Second Foundation would champion. The Second Foundation’s vision also includes addressing Ethereum’s staking mechanism, a critical component of its proof-of-stake security model. Lomashuk has proposed that Ethereum aim for at least 66% of its total supply to be staked, arguing that this threshold is vital to prevent validators from being concentrated in centralized custodians. “If there needs to be a limit, it should come from the Ethereum protocol itself and apply uniformly to all liquid staking protocols,” he said in response to ongoing debates about Lido’s staking dominance. Prominent figures take aim at Ethereum’s path forward While the EF works to reform its leadership and scale its ecosystem, critics argue that the platform lacks urgency, vision, and a coherent strategy to maintain its dominance. Two key figures in the crypto world — Kyle Samani, Managing Partner at Multicoin Capital, and Justin Sun, founder of Tron — have taken to social media to highlight Ethereum’s shortcomings and suggest bold, if polarizing, strategies for its revival. As the founder of Multicoin Capital, an investment firm deeply focused on blockchain, Samani credits Ethereum for igniting his passion for crypto. “ETH was my first meaningful source of wealth,” he tweeted. Ethereum was my entry into crypto in 2016. I fell in love with the vision for permissionless finance and smart contracts. ETH was my first meaningful source of wealth In 2017 Ethereum was the center of crypto. Up 100x in a year. ICOs. Future of finance. Gas fees spiking.… — Kyle Samani (@KyleSamani) January 21, 2025 Despite its early promise, his optimism has soured. The breaking point, he revealed, was Devcon 3, Ethereum’s annual developer conference held in November 2017. Despite obvious scaling challenges — skyrocketing gas fees and increasing network congestion — Samani was stunned that scaling wasn’t even a focus of Buterin’s keynote. “How can you not recognize what’s going on around you and set forth a credible plan with concrete and aggressive timelines?” he wrote. That moment, Samani explained, was when he “lost faith in Ethereum.” Seven years later, Samani believes little has changed. He points to what he calls Ethereum’s “total lack of urgency” and its failure to align leadership with the needs of its core constituents. Without a clear “North Star,” as he puts it, Ethereum risks being overtaken by competitors that prioritize speed, scalability, and user experience. Meanwhile, Sun, known for his provocative style, went a step further by offering a radical five-point plan for Ethereum’s revival, claiming his leadership could push ETH to $10,000. If EF and Ethereum Were Under My Leadership “ #ETH to $10,000” My First Week Plan 1. Halt ETH Sales immediately and Optimize Revenue EF will immediately cease selling ETH for at least three years. Operational costs will be covered through AAVE lending, staking yields, and… — H.E. Justin Sun 🍌 (@justinsuntron) January 22, 2025 The plan includes halting all ETH sales for three years, taxing Layer-2 solutions to generate $5 billion annually, and drastically downsizing the EF staff to create a merit-based, high-performance organization. Sun’s plan also emphasizes increasing fee burns and reducing node rewards to strengthen Ethereum’s deflationary tokenomics while abandoning layer-2 rollups to focus exclusively on layer-1 scalability. While Sun’s ideas may seem radical, they tap into genuine frustrations about Ethereum’s inefficiencies. The EF has long been criticized for its slow decision-making and perceived detachment from community concerns. Yet, the feasibility of Sun’s vision is questionable. Taxing layer-2 solutions risks undermining Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap, a key scaling strategy, while downsizing the EF could strip it of the resources needed to maintain its innovation pipeline. Community and developers turn their back on Ethereum Ethereum’s challenges are no longer confined to leadership controversies or competitor attacks — its very community is fracturing. Beanie, a well-known crypto venture capitalist, recently critiqued, “Ethereum Foundation is run by a high school teacher from Japan that hates competition, believes in equality of outcome over opportunity, and doesn’t recognize blockchain consensus as a means of governance.” Ethereum Foundation is run by a high school teacher from Japan that hates competition, believes in equality of outcome over opportunity and doesn’t recognize blockchain consensus as a means of governance. Ethereum has a woke culture problem. And because of that Solana is winning. pic.twitter.com/BAbwv0V1d5 — Beanie (@beaniemaxi) January 21, 2025 His critique of EF’s leadership culture as “woke” and overly ideological has resonated with those who feel the foundation is prioritizing philosophical ideals over practical innovation. The calls for leadership reforms have also reached a boiling point. “If Aya Miyaguchi does not step down, I will re-evaluate my investment thesis on $ETH,” declared Hedgex, a crypto investor, while publicly removing the “.eth” from his username — reflecting a growing disillusionment within the community. If @AyaMiyagotchi does not step down I will re-evaluate my investment thesis on $ETH the asset. In the meantime, I have removed .eth from my name. The people want change. It’s time for change. — Hedgex (🔥,🔥) (@hedge__x) January 20, 2025 His sentiment was echoed by Eric Conner, a former Ethereum maximalist, who lamented, “I am no longer a dot eth. Perhaps someday those in leadership roles will realign with the community, but for now, I am out.” I am no longer a dot eth Perhaps some day those in leadership roles will realign with the community but for now, I am out Deep down, I truly hope Ethereum succeeds Good luck — Eric Conner (@econoar) January 21, 2025 The seeds of discontent were planted well before 2025. In October 2023, Mike Alfred, a value investor, said, “Ethereum looks sick. The world computer and ultrasound money narratives have failed. DeFi and NFTs have largely been abandoned. Vitalik and other insiders are looting the protocol. Ethereum looks sick. The world computer and ultrasound money narratives have failed. Defi and NFTs have largely been abandoned. Vitalik and other insiders are looting the protocol and transactions are easily censored by governments. It’s a disaster. Today I am selling my ETH. — Mike Alfred (@mikealfred) October 9, 2023 The sentiment has only worsened over time, with John E. Deaton, a crypto lawyer and longtime observer of the space, stating, “I’ve never witnessed ETH sentiment so low. Post after post shows people who used to be ETH’s biggest supporters moving on.” I’ve been in crypto for almost 9 years. I’ve never witnessed ETH sentiment so low. I’m not just talking about Kyle’s post alone.

With innovations like the On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product and the launch of the US dollar-pegged stablecoin RLUSD, XRP keeps proving its role in cross-border payments. But can it reach $11 in the next few months? Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) is emerging as a potential solution for Bitcoin’s speed and scalability issues. With its hybrid Layer-2 blockchain, it could expand Bitcoin’s case uses and ecosystem. Let’s talk about the details. Will XRP Hit $11? Breaking Down Ripple’s Path to a Major Breakout At the time of writing, XRP is trading at approximately $3.08. Over the past 24 hours, its trading volume has reached an impressive $4.8 billion. With a market capitalization of around $165 billion, XRP remains one of the leading cryptocurrencies. XRP’s price movements have been relatively stable recently, with a 24-hour low of $3.05 and a high of $3.23. XRP is currently seeing strong market activity, with a 24-hour trading volume of $7.55 billion and a circulating supply of 57.56 billion tokens. Its fully diluted valuation stands at an impressive $308 billion. At $3.13, XRP is just 10.6% below its all-time high of $3.40. Key support levels are holding steady around $3.00, while resistance is positioned near $3.15 and $3.20. With the RSI sitting at 50, XRP is in neutral territory. The SEC’s recent appeal of the court ruling on XRP has added some uncertainty to the market, but Ripple isn’t slowing down. The company is pushing forward with its global expansion, forging new partnerships, and focusing on its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product. ODL is particularly popular in Asia and the Middle East, where it’s being used to streamline cross-border payments. Even with the regulatory hurdles, XRP adoption is growing as more financial institutions and payment providers integrate it for faster, cheaper international transactions. Ripple is also staying innovative with its recent launch of RLUSD, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, and its plans for an IPO. On top of that, XRP’s increased listings on major crypto exchanges are boosting its accessibility and liquidity for investors. When it comes to price predictions, CryptoBull is highly optimistic, forecasting XRP could hit $13 in the near term as part of a larger bull cycle that could push it above $20. Meanwhile, STEPH IS CRYPTO offers a more cautious outlook, predicting XRP is nearing a major breakout with potential targets between $5 and $14. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Could Transform Bitcoin with Seamless Cross-Chain Compatibility, Advanced Security, and Community-Centric Governance Bitcoin often faces hurdles like network congestion, slow transaction speeds, and high fees. These issues stem from its original design, which supports only a limited number of transactions per second. During peak periods, backlogs grow, cause delays, and drive up costs for users. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) introduces what could be a groundbreaking solution. Its hybrid Layer-2 technology could operate as a parallel network to Bitcoin’s main blockchain to ease congestion, reduce fees, and increase scalability. One of Bitcoin’s core challenges lies in its 10-minute block time, which slows transaction processing. PlutoChain could address this by offering a block time of just 2 seconds, which would rival the speed of blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. It could also unlock new potential for Bitcoin by adding smart contract capabilities and enabling it to evolve beyond a simple store of value. With EVM compatibility , PlutoChain could allow developers to migrate Ethereum-based projects seamlessly to Bitcoin. This could make way for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and AI-driven applications to thrive within Bitcoin’s ecosystem. During its testnet phase, PlutoChain handled 43,200 transactions daily, which showcases its ability to scale without delays or congestion. The project values security, which is why it has undergone successful audits conducted by SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi . PlutoChain’s governance is fully community-driven and empowers users to propose and vote on upgrades, partnerships, and features. Final Words XRP’s growing adoption, innovative solutions like ODL, and Ripple’s ambitious global expansion make it a strong player in the cross-border payment space, despite ongoing regulatory challenges. Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could lead to Bitcoin’s transformation by addressing its scalability issues and introducing game-changing capabilities like smart contracts. It could position Bitcoin as faster, smarter, and more adaptable, making this project worth taking a closer look at. ————– This article does not offer financial advice.

This comes as part of the worldwide investment trend into projects for rising AI services. According to a Bloomberg report , the team led by Ambani has bought Nvidia’s next-gen AI chips to develop Jamnagar’s largest planned data infrastructure with a three-gigawatt power ceiling. This project surpasses every existing data center since none expands beyond one gigawatt in size. A Reliance representative refused direct comment but pointed towards Akash Ambani’s recent remarks. Reliance Jio’s CEO, Akash, confirmed that the completion schedule for the new project would last two years. He assured that the team would follow the “true Jamnagar style in record time” as established during Jamnagar projects. Ambani’s data center creation can attain the largest operating capacity According to DC Byte, the current largest data centers have total capacities below one gigawatt. Computing capacities for AI models demand vast power resources, and data center megawatt capabilities set operational thresholds. Ambani’s record of ambitious strategic moves parallels his approach to artificial intelligence development. His industry-transforming telecom pricing model remains consistent with future plans for significantly reduced AI inferencing rates, the operation that powers AI systems such as ChatGPT. The measures could deliver significant cost savings for startups and businesses that use these AI tools. Ambani’s data center is estimated to be up to $30 billion Jamnagar will become even more significant for Reliance’s technology infrastructure as its data center capability expands threefold, which will significantly advance India’s artificial intelligence industry. Reliance manages multiple renewable energy facilities throughout the residential town, with a population of 650,000. While experts believe project expenses may reach between $20 billion and $30 billion, Reliance still lacks a defined financing strategy. The company’s latest balance sheet shows $26 billion reserved. Reliance aims to drive capacity and affordability achievement for AI transformation. Reliance’s goal to power its data center includes using renewable energy sourced from adjacent solar and wind installations. Alternative solutions, such as fossil fuels and substantial battery systems, will be necessary to maintain a consistent energy supply because renewable energy cannot provide steady power on its own. Ambani’s ambition is clear. In last year’s speech, he outlined plans for affordable AI in India through collaboration between Reliance’s infrastructure skills and worldwide partnerships. The launch of generative AI systems, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, will create massive market demand for AI-ready data centers. By 2030, McKinsey and Co. forecast a threefold increase in global data center capacity while the United States struggles with a 15-gigawatt shortage. To fulfill the predicted demand, organizations would need to expand their existing capacity to twice what has been constructed since 2000.

This development means that mainstream financial institutions in the United States can now hold crypto. Updated Framework According to the new bulletin , financial entities must now disclose the risks and obligations associated with safeguarding crypto assets. Although early adoption is permitted, these changes will apply retroactively to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan recently stated that U.S. financial institutions are prepared to embrace the opportunity to custody crypto assets, provided there are improvements in the regulatory framework. Several notable figures in the industry celebrated the move, attributing it to the newly inaugurated Trump administration. House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill was quoted in an X post saying: “Finally, the Biden-Harris misguided SAB 121 rule has been rescinded. Holding reserves against the assets held in custody is NOT standard financial services practice, and I am pleased this rule was nullified.” He further applauded the financial watchdog for its swift action under the new dispensation, calling it a step forward for digital assets and innovation in America. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce also celebrated the development by writing on social media: “Bye, bye SAB 121! It’s not been fun.” The changes follow some leadership adjustments at the agency, with Commissioner Mark Uyeda recently taking on the role of chair in an acting capacity. The interim leader has adopted a different approach than his predecessor, Gary Gensler, whose tenure was criticized for enforcing strict rules on the industry. Uyeda had previously called for a shift in the regulator’s handling of crypto guidelines, and this decision aligns with his stated goals. A Controversial Rule Reversed SAB 121, introduced in March 2022, required financial firms holding digital assets for customers to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheets. This condition was widely criticized for its complex and burdensome reporting standards, which many argued made crypto custody unnecessarily difficult for banks and associated institutions. In May 2024, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers passed a resolution to overturn SAB 121, but President Biden vetoed the bill, defending the SEC’s judgment. Later in September, a group of Republican lawmakers wrote to then-Chair Gensler, demanding the rule be rescinded. Meanwhile, Donald Trump recently signed his first crypto executive order to establish the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets Markets. The initiative is tasked with developing a framework to address the crypto regulatory landscape. The group is also responsible for creating a strategic national digital asset stockpile, with the wording suggesting it may consist of more than just Bitcoin, as initially thought.

With two crypto-based ETFs securing approval last year, the market is eagerly watching for the next token to receive a regulatory green light. Meanwhile, the Ethereum price takes a dip and the ETH token reaches $3,212. Investors flock to IntelMarkets to get more prominent gains in this bull run. Can SOL Price Break $300 Barrier After SOL ETF Approval? Over the past week, the SOL has outpaced BTC and ETH in performance, drawing significant attention from US traders. Meanwhile, American financial giant CME Group is reportedly exploring the launch of Solana ETFs. Expectations are high that the US SEC may approve these funds this year. If realized, such a development could act as a major catalyst, potentially pushing SOL back to its ATH. Solana’s price surged 20% this week, driven by rising memecoin trading enthusiasm. Speculation around a potential Solana ETF and meme coin hype could push SOL toward $300. As of Thursday, the SOL price hovered at $248, marking a slight decrease of 3% during the U.S. trading session. The cryptocurrency faced resistance near the $260 level, struggling to maintain momentum after a recent bullish surge. The SOL Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 62.26 on the 24-hour chart. This shows that bullish momentum remains but is cooling off from overbought conditions. If buying pressure increases, the SOL price could retest the $260 level. A breakout past this level could push prices toward $280 and 294 levels, surpassing the recent ATH, most expected by Solana ETF. Ethereum Price Prediction: Will ETH Surge? Ethereum price is once again in the spotlight as ETH slumps below $3,350. The Ethereum price is ranging $3,200 to $3,300. This tight range has analysts speculating on whether Ethereum price can break out toward $3,500 – $3,800 in the coming weeks or remain stuck in its accumulation phase. According to Our Crypto Talk, Ethereum price is forming a strong accumulation zone, a pattern often associated with bullish momentum. The respected analyst believes that ETH could be on the verge of a breakout, which may bring excitement among traders and long-term holders alike. Meanwhile, Crypto General highlights that capital from recent Solana and meme coin rallies could rotate back into Ethereum (ETH), potentially driving its price to $4,000 in the long term. This trend underscores Ethereum’s price status as a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem, but it also raises questions about where smart money is moving next. While Ethereum price remains a reliable long-term hold, savvy investors are beginning to rotate a portion of their ETH gains into emerging projects that offer higher ROI potential. One such project, already generating significant buzz, is becoming a favorite among early adopters seeking exponential growth. IntelMarkets (INTL): Primed for 50X Gain in Q1 IntelMarkets (INTL) , a new AI altcoin, is among the cryptocurrencies to watch out for. Its bullish AI narrative and huge growth prospects are some of its biggest attractions, driving huge interest and demand—over $7.2 million has been raised in early funding. Completely decentralized, there is an equal opportunity to participate in the ongoing presale. At the same time, it is not VC-backed—the same can’t be said for most utility coins—nor is a group of holders holding the majority of the supply. Priced at $0.082 in the ninth stage of the ICO and tipped for a 50x jump in value after Tier-1 exchange listings in Q1, it has become a top pick along with Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). Further, its intriguing blend of AI and DeFi paints a bullish picture. As an AI-powered trading platform, it will integrate artificial intelligence across all levels—the first true modern-gen exchange protocol. At its heart will be automated and self-learning trading bots and an AI-based blockchain poised to transform the $36 billion global crypto trading landscape.

In 2031, the target price for XRP is between $17.16 and $18.59, with an average price of $17.87. XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future. Whether it will reach new highs or continue to grow steadily, it remains to be seen, but this crypto asset will undoubtedly play an important role in global financial institutions.

Technical indicators give out a bullish signal with respect to the ongoing market trends. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically tailored for rapid and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The extent of adoption and Ripple’s strides in forging strategic partnerships are pivotal in shaping XRP’s value trajectory. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. Why is XRP up? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has increased as the buying influx was abruptly taken, recovering the price to $3.179. The RSI, as well, has risen above 60; the continual upside in the past week has led to a massive recovery. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to nearly double from its current level. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by next year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.84, achieved on January 7, 2018. Will XRP reach $10? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a high chance of reaching $10 by 2028. It is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, which still makes it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100? If one XRP coin is worth $100, its market cap must be more than $5.4 trillion. Comparatively, Bitcoin’s market cap is $1.91T trillion; considering the current global economic situation, it is unlikely for XRP to reach $100 under current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is trading at five times its value last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $18.59 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Ripple’s XRP has transcended the cryptocurrency space, now rivaling traditional finance giants. On-chain data reveals XRP’s market capitalization has surpassed BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, reaching $162 billion as of January 15, 2025. This milestone positions XRP ahead of global brands like Coca-Cola, Disney, and Nike. Read more about it here . XRP surged 12% to $3.14, its highest price since 2018. This surge was fueled by a 37.4% increase in XRP holdings by “whales” (investors holding 1-10 million XRP), who accumulated 1.43 billion tokens. Read more about it here .

It is important to consider that predictions are not investment advice. Professional consultation is suggested, or you can carry out your research. XRP historic price sentiment Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. XRP price history Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022 it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In 2025, XRP is trading near the $2.40 level.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS|REGULATION|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-24 14:05:00

While BTC is making investors happy, the same is not true for altcoins. While the majority of altcoin investors are in loss, they are eagerly waiting for the altcoin rally to come. However, a negative analysis for altcoins came from the analysis company Alphractal. Accordingly, Alphractal analysts stated that the Altcoin Season Index experienced a sharp decline and said that this was a bear market signal for altcoins in the short term. However, analysts stated that investors should not panic and that this decline in the index provided investors with a buying opportunity. At this point, analysts referred to historical data and said that historically, declines and low values in this indicator provide an excellent buying opportunity to take positions in altcoins and benefit from possible future recoveries. He stated that the interest in altcoins has increased recently and that this could be a sign that a bullish phase for altcoins is very close. “Altcoin Season Index Drops Sharply: Bear Market Signal or Buying Opportunity? The Altcoin Seasonal Index is falling rapidly, indicating a Bear Market for Altcoins in the short-term. This reflects Bitcoin’s dominance as the metric shows Altcoins losing momentum. However, historically speaking, low values in this indicator have been an excellent opportunity to take a position in Altcoins and take advantage of possible future recoveries. Another noteworthy point is the recent increase in public interest in Altcoins on Wikipedia, which suggests that more people are curious and researching the market.

Furthermore, this expert has come out putting the chances of a SOL ETF at 80% by the end of the year. Fueled by such predictions and optimism, he’s expecting the Solana price to climb to its new ATH by February. However, he also points to a new $0.08 altcoin for those seeking exponential gains that established coins can not provide. Read on to find out more about Solana’s price trajectory in the coming period and why this altcoin is set to outperform, delivering life-changing gains. Is SOL ETF On The Horizon? Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform designed to support decentralized applications (dApps) and crypto projects with fast transaction speeds and low fees. This flexibility has made it regarded as the home to dApps, DeFi, and NFTs. Solana’s price is currently sitting at $248, 22% up on the weekly charts, retaining its form despite the unstable market periods. The Solana price reached its ATH in November 2021 at a record high of $260. During the November 2024 market rally, Solana once again soared and managed to test the $250 level. This phenomenal price movement can be attributed to several factors, one of them being rumors about the potential approval of SOL ETFs by mid-2025. Notably, asset management firms such as REX Advisers and Osprey Funds have filed applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch SOL ETFs. Market analysts are increasingly optimistic about the approval of SOL ETFs in 2025. Experts have reportedly predicted an 80% chance of the SEC greenlighting spot SOL ETFs within the year. The approval of SOL ETFs is expected to have a substantial impact on Solana’s price. However, despite all of this, its large market cap and it being a well-established coin will keep the growth more modest. According to some analysts, the Solana price could rise to $300 by the end of the year, paling in comparison to the $0.08 altcoin. Furthermore, the declining interest in SOL-based meme coins could put pressure on the token. Although Solana can hardly replicate the results achieved in its earliest stages, with the launch of SOL ETFs, it would remain a great option in the long term. The $0.08 Altcoin, IntelMarkets (INTL): The Future of AI-Driven Crypto Trading IntelMarkets is an AI-powered trading platform with an aim to revolutionize the global crypto trading market with its advanced AI driven trading solutions.

With some analysts predicting a 50x increase post launch, INTL comes out as a must-watch altcoin in 2025.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XRP and Remittix dominate the 2025 altcoin buzz, with XRP’s legal saga and Remittix’s presale hype vying for the spotlight in the race to create crypto riches. Table of Contents Ripple: Legal battles and a loyal community Remittix: A rising star with real utility Choosing the 2025 path: XRP or RTX? With XRP vs RTX dominating the latest chatter about 2025 millionaire altcoins, the question arises: which one has the staying power and the rocket fuel to deliver epic gains? In a market prone to hype and sudden crashes, it’s no surprise that some investors lean on proven tokens like Ripple (XRP), while others point to Remittix as a fresh approach to remittances and real-world utility that has already brought in $1 billion in its presale stage. Let’s dive in, crunch some numbers and see where the road might lead. Ripple: Legal battles and a loyal community Ripple has weathered years of legal drama, yet it keeps bouncing back. In 2023, a partial victory in a federal court ruled that retail XRP sales didn’t violate securities laws. That prompted a 46% price jump within four weeks, momentarily lifting XRP’s daily trading volume to over $2.3 billion. However, the SEC’s ongoing appeal still hangs overhead, dampening institutional enthusiasm. CEO Brad Garlinghouse remains optimistic, calling the appeal a “rehash of already failed arguments,” but caution persists among bigger investors. Despite the legal saga, Ripple’s cross-border payment solutions maintain a global footprint. Banks and financial firms remain intrigued by faster, cheaper settlements which could elevate XRP usage if regulators eventually give a clear green light. Some forecasters project a 5x or 10x rally if the lawsuit fully resolves in Ripple’s favor. Then again, extended uncertainty might stifle momentum. For holders eyeing 2025 millionaire altcoins, XRP’s potential relies heavily on a stable legal outcome and the community’s unwavering loyalty. You might also like: Remittix could outperform Shiba Inu, Cardano and Binance Coin this year Remittix: A rising star with real utility While Ripple fights legal battles, Remittix presale synergy grabs headlines for tackling cross-border payments in a different way. Instead of wooing big banks first, Remittix aims for everyday transactions by letting people convert crypto to fiat seamlessly. The team has already raised over $5.4 million toward a $36 million presale goal. Liquidity is locked for three years and the contract will be renounced after the presale moves designed to reassure risk-averse investors. That’s enough to get tongues wagging about “XRP vs RTX” for cross-border dominance. Could Remittix be the next 100x contender? Analysts claim Remittix’s PayFi framework could reshape a banking industry valued at $183 trillion. Even capturing a small slice of that market might vault RTX into the stratosphere. If the presale hype translates into mass adoption, the token could see a 100x leap by 2024, a forecast that piques interest from both casual traders and whales tired of meme coins. Of course, no project is guaranteed success; mainstream adoption and consistent development are crucial. Still, the promise of bridging crypto and fiat without hidden fees sets Remittix apart. Choosing the 2025 path: XRP or RTX? Ripple has a huge head start, global partnerships and brand recognition. Yet the SEC’s lawsuit still looms, casting shadows on its future. On the flip side, Remittix presale synergy offers a shot at capturing everyday finance, transforming how people send money worldwide. It’s an underdog story but one with an ambitious plan for tackling remittance fees and bridging crypto’s complexity gap. Anyone hunting for 2025 millionaire altcoins must weigh risk tolerance against possible returns. XRP might deliver stable (yet potentially slower) growth if it wins its legal battle. Remittix, still in its infancy, could skyrocket if PayFi clicks with mainstream audiences. Both carry unique risks, regulatory overhang for XRP and adoption hurdles for RTX.

Its recent rally has likely been fueled by the broader crypto market surge, increased holdings by World Liberty Financial, and Trump’s executive order to explore the establishment of a “National Digital Asset Stockpile.” ETH Has Finally Flexed Muscles Ethereum (ETH) remains the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, but throughout this bull cycle, it has failed (so far) to impress the community. And while Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and many more have recently reached record price peaks, ETH is still in red territory on a monthly scale. However, the asset witnessed a substantial resurgence in the past 24 hours, and some industry participants took this as a sign that a major rally could be just around the corner. According to CoinGecko’s data, ETH currently trades at approximately $3,400, representing a 6% increase on a daily scale. ETH Price, Source: CoinGecko One of the optimists is the X user CRYPTOWZRD. The analyst believes a breakout above the $3,550 resistance level could push ETH to $4,000 and beyond . According to Cold Blooded Shiller, the cryptocurrency is attempting to “form a new trend from here,” envisioning a potential spike to a new all-time high of $5,000 by March this year . CrediBULL Crypto outlined even more bullish forecasts . The former cited ETH’s HTF PA (High Time Frame Price Action) to assume that the asset could be poised for a major comeback in the near future . “ETH is going to come back with a vengeance in the coming months, and ironically enough, it seems it’s going to leave some of its strongest supporters behind. 10k is a bare minimum once we break out, imo , and I think 20k is certainly not unreasonable by the end of the cycle .” Why is ETH Pumping? One obvious factor that has potentially contributed to the asset’s positive performance in the last 24 hours is the overall resurgence of the crypto sector. Bitcoin (BTC) and many of its leaders are all in the green today (January 24), while the industry’s global market capitalization has soared to almost $3.8 trillion. Another reason could be World Liberty Financial’s decision to increase its holdings. Most recently, the DeFi platform, which has ties to US President Donald Trump and his family, purchased 3,079 ETH. Its total Ethereum possessions reached 74,228 tokens (valued at over $250 million at current rates). Last but not least, we should mention that Trump signed an executive order to review the creation of a “National Digital Asset Stockpile.” Initially, he intended to establish a strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve in the US, but the initiative’s scope seems to have expanded to other cryptocurrencies, too.

With its innovative approach, it is becoming a prominent figure in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape. SHIB and PEPE Ready for Remarkable 300% Growth Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) are showing encouraging signs of significant growth.

However, it's crucial to remember that the crypto market is highly unpredictable, and such projections come with inherent risks.

This rise in network activity has fueled predictions that SOL could climb to $500 in 2025 as the demand for meme coins increases. While the Solana price is taking a breather from its recent rally, investors are turning to PropiChain (PCHAIN) for maximum gains. It draws investors with its AI and real estate features. PropiChain has raised over $2 million in its ongoing token presale. This is because its highly undervalued price of only $0.01 per PCHAIN token is attractive to growth investors. Solana Price Hits New ATH, Daily Fees Skyrocket The Solana price recently hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $293.31 thanks to the launch of Trump-related meme coins. The spike in network activity led to a record $33.2 million in daily fees, marking a new milestone. This has trickled down to other key metrics such as TVL and DEX trading volume. Solana’s total value locked eclipsed $12 billion while the DEX trading volume rose more than 350% in a week. Analysts are confident this augurs well for the Solana price in the long run. Experts are predicting that the Solana price will reach $500 in 2025. With a current price of $255, the Solana price will have to double to reach this projected target. If the layer-1 network can maintain this momentum, it can rally to another high in H1 2025. PropiChain’s AI Features Attract Savvy Investors PropiChain has become one of the top AI altcoins to watch in 2025 due to its innovative features. While the Solana price is projected to double to $500, investors are piling cash into PCHAIN due to its 55,000% growth potential.

Investors looking to make strategic real estate investments can take advantage of PCHAIN’s predictive market analysis .

Additionally, PropiChain incorporates the metaverse for virtual viewings. It helps buyers to scout properties without being there physically, expanding their reach. Can the Solana Price Momentum Outshine PCHAIN? The Solana price has been on a tear, rallying to a new peak near $300. However, the altcoin is projected to rise to $500 at best. This is where PropiChain takes the cake due to its unlimited growth potential. Undervalued PropiChain to Pump 55,000% in Q1 PropiChain’s early investors have seen 200% gains in the first two rounds of the token presale.

Notably, Trump said he would promote the development and growth of lawful and legitimate dollar-backed stablecoins worldwide as part of a broader crypto strategy outlined in his executive order on Thursday. As per a report from Reuters , Cipollone explained that Trump’s focus on promoting stablecoins worldwide could draw more customers away from traditional banks, weakening their business by reducing fees and clients. He emphasized that this makes the case stronger for the European Central Bank (ECB) to launch its own digital currency, the digital euro, as a response to this growing trend. “I guess the key word here (in Trump’s executive order) is worldwide,” Cipollone told a conference in Frankfurt. “This solution, you all know, further disintermediates banks as they lose fees, they lose clients…That’s why we need a digital euro,” he said. Banks are worried that a digital euro could lead customers to move their money into ECB-backed wallets, draining their funds. The European Central Bank is still testing how a digital euro would work, but a final decision on whether to launch it will be made once European lawmakers approve legislation on the matter. Meanwhile, Trump’s executive order also blocks the Federal Reserve from issuing its own central bank digital currency (CBDC).",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,FIAT|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-24 15:15:48

Many more milestones are expected with Donald Trump’s presidency. However, volatility and uncertainty still exist, creating challenges for traders. One crypto investor lost nearly $900k ($892k precisely) to such difficulties, highlighting the need for risk management and researched investments. In this blog, let’s discuss what went wrong. Crypto Investor Succumbed to FOMO, Losing $892K in 2 Days An anonymous crypto trader went into the trading industry, spending 4,248 SOL, equivalent to $1.06M, to buy various tokens. However, to his surprise, all the trading activities failed, leaving the trader with a $892K loss. According to the Lookonchain post, all this happened within two days, as the crypto trader succumbed to the FOMO and invested in the trending cryptos of the time. Although trends often bring heavy returns, timing plays an important role. A trade placement at the end of the trend usually leads to heavy losses. In this way, another trader lost $60k with constant wrong judgment with three cryptos. This aforementioned crypto investor also lost to FOMO and repeatedly made the same mistake, losing in all trades. Trader Failed With 12 Tokens Continuously, Reaching 0% ROI Lookonchain’s analysis reveals that the crypto investor has invested in 13 tokens, including ALON, VINE, and many others. Out of these, the person faced losses in 12 tokens and barely made any returns on the remaining crypto, i.e., just $231. The biggest losses were on ALON and VINE, where the investor spent $627K and $888k on VINE, which all went in vain. As a result, the ROI on this trader reached almost 0% and the loss to $891K in just two days. What’s The Lesson Here? The crypto industry offers various profitable opportunities, but profits depend on the trader, trading skills, and many other factors. The aforementioned crypto inventor failed in all these measures, losing $891k. This clearly shows why one should not trade with FOMO and implement the right trading technique to sustain profits in the market.

These cryptocurrencies provide unique solutions for blockchain use, ranging from ultra-fast transactions to traditional financial services. Remittix’s presale has already garnered more than $5.3 million and is projected to grow 100x by 2025. For those curious about the direct link between crypto and fiat, visit Remittix right away. Toncoin Aiming for New Peaks Toncoin emerged from Telegram’s blockchain ambitions and has built a substantial user base due to its rapid transactions and low fees. Recent statistics indicate Toncoin achieves over $1 million in daily transactions, demonstrating a strong community. Despite initial regulatory challenges linked to Telegram, TON now operates autonomously. Enthusiasts believe it could advance significantly if institutional partners join. However, some warn that maintaining community enthusiasm is crucial to sustain its momentum. For those who value user-friendly technology, Toncoin’s emphasis on scalable DeFi positions it as a leading contender for the upcoming bull market. AVAX Ready for a Comeback AVAX rose to prominence in a previous cycle, known for its swift processing and subnet architecture that enables customized chains. Avalanche recorded $17.7 billion in swaps across 4.8 million transactions last quarter, indicating steady network usage. Some are optimistic that AVAX can reach its former peaks if the DeFi sector continues to migrate to its platform. While there is significant competition from other layer-1s, AVAX supporters argue that the platform’s adaptability makes it stand out. Whether you view AVAX as a secure choice or part of another hype cycle depends on your interest in newer protocols. Nevertheless, its combination of speed, deflationary tokenomics, and dApp potential keeps AVAX on investors’ radars for possible major rallies by 2025. Stellar’s Consistent Development Stellar (XLM) has maintained its relevance by facilitating millions of transactions daily, focusing on cross-border and micropayment applications. With weekly active accounts exceeding 280,000, Stellar’s network might be undervalued. Partnerships with enterprises, such as IBM, bolster its standing as a credible solution for global finance. Critics point to its lack of marketing as a barrier to XLM’s breakout. Supporters see it as a hidden treasure: strong fundamentals, consistent fees, and a mission centered on financial inclusion. If more businesses or NGOs adopt Stellar, XLM could see a gradual rise in 2025. Remittix Presale: Bridging Crypto and Everyday Finance While Toncoin, AVAX, and Stellar focus on DeFi, speed, or enterprise collaborations, Remittix follows a different strategy: connecting crypto with fiat remittances. Raising over $5.3 million in its presale indicates a strong demand for simplifying global money transfers. Rather than relying on hype, Remittix targets the $190 trillion traditional banking sector. By addressing real-world challenges, it aims to attract audiences beyond crypto enthusiasts. Liquidity is locked for three years, and the contract will be renounced, providing reassurance to buyers concerned about rug pulls. If you're interested in a solution that could surpass typical DeFi tokens, visit Remittix to see if it fits your investment approach. Arguments for a Mega Rally in 2025 4 Cryptocurrencies to Consider Now for Mega 2025 Rallies Toncoin, AVAX, Stellar, and Remittix are not just speculative picks fueled by memes. They each tackle important blockchain challenges. Toncoin addresses scalability with a user-focused approach, AVAX utilizes subnets for custom networks, Stellar offers solutions for enterprises and NGOs, and Remit provides a direct link to mainstream financial systems. While no investment is guaranteed, these diverse strategies might protect your portfolio from market fluctuations. If you favor genuine adoption over speculative hype, Remittix might be a standout choice for long-term growth. As we begin 2025, the quest to identify the next big winner could soon pay off.

Each one offers a distinct approach to blockchain utility, from lightning-fast transfers to mainstream financial services. Remittix’spresale has already pulled in over $5.3 million and is forecasted to be 100x by 2025. If you’re intrigued by a direct connection between crypto and fiat, head to Remittix now. Toncoin Reaches for New Heights Toncoin grew out of Telegram’s blockchain vision and has attracted a large user base, thanks to quick transactions and minimal fees. Recent data shows Toncoin’s daily transactions surpass the $1 million mark, signaling a robust community. While the platform faced early regulatory hurdles tied to Telegram, TON now operates independently. Fans argue it could make big strides if institutional partners come on board. Critics caution that community momentum needs to stay high, or Toncoin’s buzz might fade. Still, for those who appreciate user-friendly tech, Toncoin’sfocus on scalable DeFi could make it a prime candidate for the next bull market. AVAX Poised for a Revival AVAX took off in an earlier cycle, boasting quick throughput and a subnet model that allows specialized chains. Avalanche saw $17.7 billion in swaps across 4.8 million transactions last quarter, highlighting consistent network use. Some believe AVAX can reclaim previous highs if the DeFi community continues migrating to its ecosystem. Others note stiff competition from other layer-1s, but AVAX fans say the chain’s flexibility sets it apart. Whether you see AVAX as a safe bet or just another hype cycle depends on your appetite for newer protocols. However, its mix of speed, deflationary tokenomics and dApp potential keeps AVAX on the watchlist of investors aiming for major rallies by 2025. Stellar’s Steady Progress Stellar (XLM) has quietly remained relevant by processing millions of transactions daily, mostly for cross-border and micropayment use cases. With weekly active accounts surpassing 280,000, Stellar’s network may be underrated. Enterprise tie-ins, such as with IBM, reinforce its credibility for global finance solutions. Skeptics say lack of marketing visibility has limited XLM’s breakout. Supporters see it as a hidden gem: strong fundamentals, stable fees, and a mission centered on financial inclusion. If more corporations or NGOs adopt Stellar, XLM could experience a steady climb in 2025. Remittix Presale Synergy for Everyday Finance While Toncoin, AVAX and Stellar aim to tackle DeFi, speed, or enterprise deals, Remittix takes a different path: bridging crypto and fiat remittances. Over $5.3 million raised in presale suggests ample demand for a service that simplifies global transfers. Instead of relying on hype, Remittixtargets the $190 trillion traditional banking space. By focusing on real-world friction points, it hopes to attract broader audiences beyond crypto enthusiasts. Liquidity is locked for three yearsand the contract will be renounced, which reassures buyers wary of rug pulls. If you want to explore a solution that might outshine typical DeFi tokens, visit Remittix and see if it aligns with your investing style. The Case for a 2025 Mega Rally 4 Cryptos To Buy Now Set For Mega 2025 Rallies Toncoin, AVAX, Stellar and Remittix aren’t just meme-fueled picks. They each address critical blockchain pain points. Toncoin tackles scalability in a user-centric way, AVAX leverages subnets for tailored networks, Stellar delivers enterprise and NGO solutions and Remit offers a direct route to mainstream financial systems. While no coin is a sure bet, combining these distinct angles might hedge your portfolio against the market’s volatility. If you believe in real adoption rather than speculative fluff, Remittix could be a standout option for the long haul.

Meanwhile, 1Fuel and KAS are touted as the best cryptocurrency investments traders can make this season, with market analysts laying more emphasis on 1Fuel. The numbers are backing investors’ claims on why 1Fuel (OFT) is the best cryptocurrency investment. 1Fuel’s presale phase 3 currently has gained over $1.4 million, potentially crossing $2 million in days. With limited tokens available, its price is predicted to surge potentially higher by 100x upon launch from the current $0.017 move BONK and KAS are unlikely to replicate. BONK confined in a bearish channel BONK has been decidedly bearish among market investors, who have been selling the asset, a movement that started on November 20, 2024, and the bearish wave appears likely to intensify. Using the price range tool on the BONK/USDT chart , since peaking at $0.00006230 on November 20, it has lost over 48% of its value and could continue to slide lower. A closer look at the chart shows the reason behind the expectation for a further drop in BONK comes after its recent rejection from a resistance trendline on the chart, a level known to mount selling pressure on an asset. Concerns amidst promising future for KAS Investors’ gains on KAS have been on a steady declining path. According to CoinMarketCap , after returning a total gain of over 77,000% from its low of $0.0001699, the asset’s performance has continued dropping, with only a 35.31% gain in the past year and a 13.01% gain in the past month. The steady drop in KAS gains over the years and since its launch can be attributed to the growing supply of the asset. According to Kaspalytics , the asset’s supply has hit its highest point since launch, crossing 25.06 billion tokens now available to trade. Increases in supply such as this, by default, cause prices to fall, with KAS declining by 3.32% in the past 24 hours. Investors consider KAS among the best cryptocurrencies to purchase because of its relatively low price of $0.1332. Now, the focus is entirely on 1Fuel , expected to pull a significant stunt in the market. 1Fuel’s potential remains fit as the right alternative With BONK completely bearish and KAS facing supply issues, 1Fuel remains investors’ viable option to pull a major market breakout this season. The high level of interest in 1Fuel comes as it has a solid use case backing the asset with its cryptocurrency wallet and great tokenomics, ensuring a limited supply of the asset in the market. 1Fuel’s crypto wallet is currently in the development phase, and it’s set to introduce unique and innovative features that work to benefit users. Its cross-chain function, eliminating multiple steps involved in trading a single token across different chains in just one click, is the most anticipated, according to analysts. Other key functionalities of the wallet, like its P2P exchange, privacy mixers, and staking-to-earn options, make it a powerhouse that would attract market liquidity, particularly in a bull run, as such activities tend to occur simultaneously. On tokenomics, 1Fuel has chosen the presale path, allowing users to buy in early, having a say in future events and growth through governance rights, and attaching more uses to the token itself. Conclusion 1Fuel is staying ahead on the list of best cryptocurrencies to watch out for in 2025. Its fundamentals, such as tokenomics, blockchain solutions, and real-world use cases, will keep it relevant beyond Kaspa and BONK in the evolving crypto market. Now’s the best time to join the 1Fuel presale to secure your stake for massive gains this year.

It has been slightly over a year since the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the launch of spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs for the U.S. market. After achieving record net inflows and assets under management in 2024, spot BTC ETFs have entered 2025 with notable momentum. In a post on X on Jan. 24, Balchunas highlighted the impressive performance of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. Funds such as BlackRock’s IBIT, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Ark/21Shares’ ARKB have seen significant inflows year to date. IBIT recorded net inflows of over $2.3 billion YTD, while FBTC attracted over $1.1 billion. “The spot bitcoin ETFs quietly on fire to start the year, with $4.2b in flows which is 6% of all ETF flows,” he noted. Since their launch, these ETFs have garnered more than $40 billion in net inflows, with total AUM now exceeding $121 billion. You might also like: 4 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs among top 20 launches of all time With a return of approximately 127%, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have now surpassed environmental, social, and governance ETFs in total assets. Leading ESG ETFs, such as Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF, iShares Global Clean Energy ETF, and SPDR S&P 500 Fossil Fuel Reserves Free ETF, collectively hold about $117 billion in AUM. According to Balchunas, net assets held in spot Bitcoin ETFs are now “about the same as gold spot.” While BTC ETFs are off to a strong start this year, the Ethereum ( ETH ) market has not seen the same level of traction. Meanwhile, the crypto market has witnessed a surge of activity with new altcoin ETF filings, including ones for Solana, XRP, Litecoin, TRUMP and Dogecoin . Could these altcoin ETFs pose a threat to U.S. spot Bitcoin funds? Balchunas doesn’t believe so. “For more context, Ether ETFs are like +$130m YTD, which isn’t bad, but this is why BTC is on another level and will utterly dominate this category. Even if we see like 10 altcoin ETFs roll out, they’ll draw headlines but fight over crumbs (albeit sizable ones) relatively speaking,” he posted on X. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded net inflows of $188 million on Jan. 23, marking the sixth consecutive day of positive flows. In 2025 alone, these funds have seen over $1 billion in net inflows on Jan. 17 and more than $805 million on Jan. 21. Notably, the slowdown to $188 million came as the market reacted to former President Trump’s crypto executive order.

ECB executive board member Piero Cipollone voiced the urgency of the move at a policy meeting in Frankfurt today, warning of potential disruptions to traditional banking systems. Yesterday, President Trump signed an executive order prioritizing U.S. dominance in digital finance technology. The order emphasized the need to protect the sovereignty of the U.S. dollar by promoting legal and legitimate dollar-backed stablecoins around the world. Speaking at the Institute of Law and Finance’s 13th Future of Finance Conference, Cipollone expressed concern about the impact this strategy could have on the Eurozone. “I think the key word in Trump’s executive order is worldwide,” Cipollone said. “This solution disintermediates banks even more because they lose their fees, they lose their customers. That’s why we need a digital euro.” The ECB envisions a digital euro as an online wallet, secured by the central bank but operated through private institutions such as commercial banks. This would allow users, including those without traditional bank accounts, to make payments securely. However, individual assets would likely be limited to prevent excessive liquidity shifts and the funds would not earn interest. Cipollone highlighted the need to accelerate testing and regulatory approval to avoid being left behind in the global race for digital currency leadership. While the ECB is still experimenting with the design and functionality, the final decision on implementation depends on pending legislation in the European Union. The Trump administration’s executive order takes a different approach by explicitly prohibiting the Fed from issuing its own central bank digital currency (CBDC). Instead, the U.S. is focusing on encouraging private sector innovation to cement dollar-backed stablecoins as a preferred alternative in global finance. Cipollone warned that U.S. efforts to push for global adoption of stablecoins could further strain the region’s financial systems by pushing customers away from traditional European banks. “The need for a digital euro has never been more evident,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

Built with robust and scalable architecture, the network was one of the potential “Ethereum-killers”. Years later, few traders are convinced. Ever since 2022, the token has been on a more-or-less steady decline. This has prompted holders to complain over a perceived lack of development. This is why some users are finding alternatives in projects like TON and its DeFi hub Elluminex. But does Polkadot really have a problem with development? Is Polkadot Doing Anything? The development metrics for Polkadot (DOT) seem solid. Back in 2022, Polkadot reached an all-time high in developer contributions . At the time, the network recorded even more contributions than Ethereum. At the time, Polkadot also saw a peak in active developer counts. Still, despite a noticeable drop since 2022, the network still has almost 1000 monthly active developers. Source: Polkadot These developers have been working on several major initiatives. These include working on Polkadot 2.0, which aims to improve governance. Moreover, the network recently overhauled its backend system for developers, lowering barriers to entry. On the consumer side, Polkadot also integrated Circle’s USDC token. While developer metrics seem solid, holders remain unconvinced. They express frustration over the lack of tangible effects on its price. Year over year, Polkadot’s price remained virtually the same, staying around $6.53 . What is worse, DOT traded in that range since 2022. It appears that the real reason for DOT’s slow performance is not a lack of development, but a lack of users. The combined TVL on all Polkadot’s parachains is just $100 million . In comparison, Ethereum’s TVL is almost $66 billion. Due to a lack of users, Polkadot is not showing any signs of potentially reclaiming its 2020 levels. In fact, since its $55 all-time high, Polkadot lost 88.1% of its value. This sluggish price performance has prompted many to look for greener pastures. Elluminex To Tap Telegram’s 950 Million Users While Polkadot offers robust tech, it lacks the user base that would push its price up. This is not a problem for TON , thanks to its deep integration with Telegram. Last year, it was the fastest-growing blockchain ecosystem, seeing an 800% increase in TVL . Source: Defilama TON has gained a significant user base thanks to its integration with Telegram. Thanks to Telegram mini-apps, TON is among the easiest blockchains to engage with. Still, the project is far below its potential, which is something that Elluminex (ELX) aims to solve. Despite its fast growth, TON suffers from a serious lack of liquidity. For that reason, traders are excited over Elluminex, which will bridge liquidity to TON from 40 major blockchains. With cross-chain swaps, TON will benefit from liquidity on all major chains. Thanks to its scalable infrastructure, a growing user base, and the coming influx of liquidity, TON has the potential to be a key player in DeFi. At the same time, Elluminex is positioned to be the biggest player in DeFi, benefiting from TON’s growth.

Chain, a blockchain firm backed by over $40 million from investors including Pantera Capital and Citigroup,has threatened legal action against Sun following allegations of market manipulation. In an X post on Jan. 24, Sun claimed that Chain was using “high leverage and contract that could cause serious harm to many exchange users.” XCN @chain is currently engaging in significant market manipulation.

Justin Sun 🍌 (@justinsuntron) January 24, 2025 While Sun did not provide details about the alleged manipulations, he warned crypto exchanges to exercise caution and stated that he would “report their illegal activities to the SEC and DOJ for further investigation.” He also tagged major exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, and Bybit, urging them to take action. Chain rejects market manipulation accusations Chain was quick to respond, rejecting Sun’s allegations. In a follow-up post, the company stated that it is “not actively engaged in ANY trading of XCN, nor involved in ANY market manipulation directly or indirectly.” Chain further clarified that the XCN token is managed by OnyxDAO and announced plans to explore “legal remedies” against Sun over his claims. The Chain team is not actively engaged in ANY trading of XCN, nor involved in ANY market manipulation directly or indirectly. We take these allegations extremely seriously and are exploring legal remedies against @JustinSun. XCN is managed by @OnyxDAO and not by @Chain . — Chain (@Chain) January 24, 2025 Soon after Chain responded, Sun fired off another X post. This time, the TRON founder tagged OnyxDAO and called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice to look into the situation. The accusations came right after the XCN token saw a big price jump, as its price soared 149% in one day and nearly 400% in a week, as crypto.news reported earlier. Founded in 2014, Chain has raised over $40 million in funding from Khosla Ventures, Pantera Capital, Capital One, Citigroup, Fiserv, Nasdaq, Orange, and Visa, the firm claims on its website. In 2018, Stellar acquired Chain to form Interstellar, a commercial arm of the Stellar Foundation. In 2020, Chain was re-acquired.

The trader pseudonymously known as Bluntz tells his 312,000 followers on the social media platform X that the “big” AI-related crypto assets are signaling the possibility of the bullish run coming to an end over the short term. According to the analyst who regularly applies the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis, lots of the AI-related altcoins have retraced from the peak of the final wave of a bullish trend that started months ago. The Elliott Wave theory states that the main trend of the price of an asset moves in a five-wave pattern while a correction occurs in a three-wave pattern. “Going to be some rude awakenings for the AI hype in the coming month in my opinion.” According to Bluntz, aixbt by Virtuals ( AIXBT ), a crypto market-focused virtual AI agent, and Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ), a memecoin that incorporates an AI framework for the purposes of generating ideas and content, are “pretty clear” examples of crypto assets that are on the tail end of a bullish trend that started months ago. On which between AIXBT and FARTCOIN will have the deeper correction, Bluntz says , “I actually thought AIXBT looked more bearish, but then all the FARTCOIN bagholders came out of the woodwork and I realized that’s probably the one that dumps more.” Source: Bluntz/X Source: Bluntz/X AIXBT is trading at $0.740 at time of writing, down by 21% since the all-time high reached last week.

As a result, the price of SOL has bounced from the important $240 support level, and key on-chain metrics have improved. There’s also a notable increase in transactions on the SOL network, nearing a monthly high, which is pushing the SOL price toward reaching $300 by the end of this month. Trump Memecoin Creates New ATH for Solana’s Stablecoin Supply The release of the Trump meme coin has led to a significant recovery in SOL’s price from its recent low. The return of crypto-supporter Donald Trump and several of his executive orders have pushed Solana’s stablecoin supply, transaction count, and total value locked (TVL) to record levels. Also read: Solana Price Prediction Today (24th January 2025) According to data from The Block, the number of transactions on the Solana network is close to reaching its monthly peak of 291.6 million. Currently, the count stands at 289.75 million, indicating a spike in activity on the SOL network. Over the past week, the amount of stablecoin in Solana’s system has exponentially increased, nearing $11 billion for the first time and setting a new record high. A significant reason for this surge seems to be the popularity of Trump family-themed memes coins, specifically the Official Trump (TRUMP) and Official Melania Meme (MELANIA) coins. These coins have brought in billions of dollars and attracted hundreds of thousands of new users to Solana recently. As a result, the number of new Solana wallet addresses created each day reached nearly 5.2 million. Additionally, the active address count on the SOL network is now at 5.3 million. Data from DefiLlama shows that the excitement about memecoins in the Solana ecosystem has also caused a significant increase in its total value locked (TVL). Solana’s TVL has skyrocketed from $1.28 billion on January 24, 2024, to $12.44 billion today, marking an increase of more than 870% since the start of the year. It also rose by 25% in just the past week. What’s Next for SOL Price? The price of Solana is holding steady above a key level on its chart, showing that buyers are feeling confident. Although it’s trying to stay above $260, sellers are pushing back against big price increases. Right now, Solana’s price is $266, after a rise of 7.9% in the last 24 hours. The trading pair SOL/USDT is above $265 and could go higher than the nearby Fibonacci levels. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 60, which is in the buying zone, suggesting that Solana’s price might climb above $290. If it stays above $290, this could be good for buyers, possibly pushing the price up to $310. However, if the price drops below the 20-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA20) on the 1-hour chart, sellers could drive it down towards $233.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-24 15:31:15

Another major factor contributing to Remittix's appeal is its potential to enhance financial inclusion on a worldwide scale.

Remittix Presale Gains Momentum, Exceeding $5 Million At the heart of the Remittix ecosystem lies the versatile RTX token, which plays a pivotal role in staking, platform rewards, and governance. With the presale currently ongoing, Remittix (RTX) tokens are available at a competitive price of just $0.0272 each, and the project has swiftly amassed over $5.2 million. Experts predict a massive 800% price surge during the presale phase, with further expansion expected as the platform gains recognition for its practical uses. Positioned strategically in the lucrative cross-border payments sector, Remittix (RTX) is gearing up to lead the PayFi industry by 2025.

That’s what every crypto investor hopes to get when entering the market. Looking at 2025, analysts predict the underrated coins to explode are Algorand (ALGO), Binance Coin (BNB), Stellar (XLM), and Polkadot (DOT). Meanwhile, Rollblock has been tipped as the best underdog among the coins with a potentially massive return on investment (ROI). Having raised over $9.2 million, the new crypto might just be the altcoin of the year. Let’s find out why. Rollblock (RBLK) The Rollblock presale has been causing waves. Within a few months, the presale has raised over $9.2 million. One of the reasons investors are bullish on the new crypto is its massive ROI potential. Already, the token has returned over 300% gains since the presale began, and investors are positioning for subsequent short-term gains from its presale and long-term post-launch pump. Moreover, the Rollblock project is poised to shine in the billion-dollar iGaming industry thanks to an array of exciting features. The blockchain-based casino aims to utilize its technology to eliminate issues like unfair house edges, providing a truly rare level of transparency. Algorand (ALGO) Over the past year, the ALGO price surged by over 150%. This has caused a positive ALGO price prediction of $0.6 in the first quarter of the year. The ALGO price has experienced a month-on-month increase of over 4%. This suggests a bullish sentiment among ALGO traders and investors. If the bullish drive remains, ALGO could reach a new all-time high (ATH) in the coming months. Binance Coin (BNB) BNB is one of the best-performing coins over the past year. The Binance Exchange token has done over 120x within this period. The exchange’s continuous ecosystem growth has caused experts to tip BNB for bigger ROI in the new year, evident in the positive BNB price analysis. The BNB price already crossed $740 this month, edging toward its December 2024 ATH of around $790. Though the BNB price is now down to around $680, a significant bullish drive will turn its fortune around. Stellar (XLM) Having returned over 200% ROI in the past year, XLM is another low-cap altcoin with the potential for massive gains this year. The XLM price has surged by over 12% in the past month, reaching $0.4 in the process. A sustained bullish drive among XLM bulls could see XLM break beyond its ATH of around $0.87. Plus, various developments within the XLM ecosystem could positively impact the XLM price in the long run. Polkadot (DOT) With just an uptick of slightly over 3%, DOT doesn’t have the biggest gains in the past year. Plus, the DOT price has dipped by about 13% in the past month. However, experts remain optimistic that the DOT price is set for an upward drive this year, evident in the positive DOT price predictions among analysts. However, DOT is relatively more expensive than the other low-cap tokens with potential. Conclusion While DOT, XLM, ALGO, and BNB offer good investment opportunities, RBLK promises the most ROI because of its combined short-term and long-term gains. To be at the forefront of the project’s potential, interested investors can buy Rollblock at its current low price of $0.047. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

The executive order called “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Finance Technology,” directs the settling up of a crypto working group tasked with creating a federal regulatory framework dealing with the issuance and operation of crypto. BTC is up over 3% in the past 24 hours, as it raced to a high of $106,913 on Thursday before settling at its current level of $105,270. Bitcoin (BTC) Soars Following Key Developments Bitcoin (BTC) surged past $106,000 on Thursday as it raced to an intraday high of $106,913 following crucial developments in US crypto policy and speculation surrounding plans for a national Bitcoin reserve. BTC saw considerable volatility on Thursday, rising to an intraday high of $106,913 and dropping to a low of $101,290 before settling at $104,004. The executive order added a further boost to price, setting up a task force to create a regulatory framework for crypto. It also mentions a national crypto reserve, calling for the task force to evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile. It also proposes the criteria for creating such a stockpile. Later, Senator Cynthia Lummis, a known Bitcoin advocate, announced she had been appointed the Chair of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets and she had accepted the position. “Digital assets are the future, and if the United States wants to remain a global leader in financial innovation, Congress needs to urgently pass bipartisan legislation establishing a comprehensive legal framework for digital assets that strengthens the U.S. dollar with a strategic bitcoin reserve. I am humbled my colleagues have placed their trust in me to chair this historic subcommittee, and I look forward to shepherding bipartisan legislation to President Trump’s desk this year that secures our financial future.” Reports have also emerged that President Trump was set to hold a call with Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador. The potential call fueled speculation about US crypto policy. BlackRock’s IBIT Acquires 11,000 BTC Spot Bitcoin ETFs have continued to record strong inflows this week following Donald Trump’s inauguration and other economic developments. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) bought an additional 1,478 BTC worth $155 million, taking its weekly purchases to 11,000 BTC . IBIT also registered the largest-ever daily trading volume on Thursday, recording a staggering $6.8 billion. The surge in buying activity indicates growing institutional interest in BTC . Thanks to these inflows, BlackRock’s IBIT ETF’s net inflows have surged past $40 billion. Thanks to the growing demand for ETFs, asset managers are creating more innovative products for traders. Earlier this week, Calamos Investments announced the launch of the Protected Bitcoin ETF, guaranteeing 100% money back if BTC fell over 50%. However, it also limits potential gains to 11.5%. The surge in spot Bitcoin ETF interest was highlighted by ETF Store president Nate Geraci, who stated, “While everything else is going on, spot bitcoin ETFs have quietly taken in $3.7bil over past 6 days. *$3.7bil* That’s a ridiculous number.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has gained nearly 4% over the past 24 hours and is trading around $105,360. However, BTC is range-bound, oscillating between $100,000 and $106,000, and faces significant resistance at higher levels. If BTC can cross this resistance, analysts expect it to cross its all-time high and set a new ATH above $110,000. According to an analysis by Rekt Capital, “Bitcoin has once again successfully retested the Range Low of $101k (black), this time forming a Higher Low in the downside wicks BTC has since bounced right back up to the Range High (red) and is once again in contention for a potential Daily Close above the resistance.” Looking at the price chart, BTC experienced significant volatility since the weekend after reclaiming $100,000, surging to an intraday high of $105,761 before settling at $103,732. However, markets turned bearish over the weekend, and BTC fell to an intraday low of $101,591 before settling at $103,579, registering a marginal decline. Buyers attempted a recovery on Sunday as BTC rose to $106,552. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching this level, and BTC dropped over 2% to $101,434. Source: TradingView BTC surged to a new all-time high on Monday, reaching $109,312. However, volatility hit the market, and the price dropped to an intraday low of $99,516 before reclaiming $100,000 and settling at $102,408. Buyers retained control on Tuesday, pushing BTC up 3.56% to $106,054. Sentiment changed on Wednesday as BTC dropped 2.21% to $103,715. Volatility returned on Thursday as BTC rose to an intraday high of $106,913 and fell to an intraday low of $101,290 before registering a marginal increase and settling at $104,004. The current session sees the price up just over 1% as buyers set their sights on $110,000. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

However, RTX , a cutting-edge presale cryptocurrency, is capturing significant interest within the crypto community. Experts believe it could surge by over 10,000%! With its revolutionary features and practical applications, this presale token might be the top investment choice for substantial returns today. Solana’s Price Hovers at $250: What's the Next Move? Solana's price has been stable recently. Although SOL dropped 10% from its peak of $275 within a day, it has maintained a level of $250. In the past week, Solana has drawn more attention from U.S. investors than Bitcoin and XRP. This surge of interest in Memecoins and new altcoins, along with ETFs, has fueled this excitement around SOL. The price of Solana has soared by an impressive 48% over the past week, surpassing XRP's 18% rise and Bitcoin's 34% increase. However, when trading volumes increase quickly, the market can become oversaturated, potentially leading to unexpected price changes. Currently, Solana is finding support around $250, maintaining its value for now. The big question is whether it will rebound to $300 or drop towards $200. Investors are closely watching these trends to determine if SOL is one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy now or if there are better opportunities elsewhere. Binance Coin Reaches $715: What's Next for Investors? On Thursday, BNB reached a significant milestone, hitting $715. Starting from $660 on Tuesday, BNB has gained 8.7% over the past week. This rise is part of a surge in bitcoin trading on centralized platforms like Binance, which saw a record-breaking $3.72 trillion in December. Binance remains the top platform, with its growing popularity boosting demand for its native coin, BNB. Many traders are gearing up for market shifts; speculation around political events, like Trump's inauguration, drives even more activity. Some analysts suggest that this increased trading volume could push BNB's price significantly higher, possibly reaching $750 if the momentum continues. Why Remittix Stands Out as a Top Investment Choice Today Remittix is transforming the way we handle cryptocurrency payments. Its platform enables users to send and receive payments swiftly, converting digital currencies into fiat money in mere minutes. This feature positions it as one of the best coins to buy now for both individuals and businesses. With the presale token phase currently active, RTX is attracting considerable investor interest. As more people adopt the network, experts anticipate its price could skyrocket, potentially reaching $1. During this presale, the token is affordably priced, offering a fantastic chance for early investors to maximize their returns. Remittix sets itself apart by focusing on simplicity, transparency, and cost-effective design. The platform boasts lightning-fast transaction speeds and no hidden fees. It's designed to streamline cross-border payments for everyone. Businesses appreciate its efficiency, while individual users value its ease of use. If you're looking for a promising investment, RTX is a strong contender. Its innovative approach to cryptocurrency transactions and its responsiveness to market demands make it a significant player. With no hidden fees, dependable features, and remarkable growth potential, Remittix is more than just a cryptocurrency.

Traders Seek Significant Gains,https://bitzo.com/2025/01/lightchain-ais-journey-from-0005-to-2-or-dogecoin-reaching-1-traders-seek-significant-gains,"As traders aim for substantial returns, the decision between Lightchain AI’s dramatic potential to jump from $0.005 to $2 and Dogecoin’s gradual climb to $1 becomes evident. Lightchain AI, having already secured $12 million at a presale price of $0.00525 per token, stands out within the crypto sphere. With its distinctive technology and robust investor support, there is a strong belief that Lightchain AI could yield significantly higher returns in the next bull market, capturing the interest of those in pursuit of remarkable growth. Comparing Growth Prospects: Lightchain AI vs. Dogecoin Lightchain AI and Dogecoin symbolize two different strategies in the cryptocurrency arena, each offering distinct growth opportunities. Lightchain AI , with its groundbreaking AI-driven blockchain solutions and decentralized framework, presents substantial long-term growth potential. Its presale triumph at $0.005 and the $12 million raised highlight strong investor trust, with a roadmap centered on scalable AI-driven applications and future expansion. Conversely, Dogecoin, which started as a meme coin, has gained traction through its community-centric approach and speculative appeal. While Dogecoin's rise has been driven by social media trends and celebrity boosts, Lightchain AI's emphasis on practical utility and advanced technology positions it as a more enduring choice for long-term investors, potentially leading to greater growth down the line. The Appeal of Lightchain AI for Traders Seeking Large Gains Traders are increasingly gravitating towards Lightchain AI for substantial returns, driven by the project's promising milestones and unique risk mitigation strategies. The roadmap outlines key phases of development, starting with a prototype phase in November 2024, proceeding to a testnet launch in January 2025, ensuring a robust and secure platform before the mainnet launch in March 2025. Lightchain AI's growth blueprint includes expanding its ecosystem, collaborating with other chains, and establishing itself across various sectors. Plans to tackle challenges focus on scalability, security, and latency by continuously refining the process, ensuring Lightchain AI remains a top contender for practical AI applications. This well-thought-out plan and clear steps make Lightchain AI an attractive choice for investors seeking substantial gains. Lightchain AI's Path to $2: Unleashing Profit Potential in 2025 Lightchain AI is poised to revolutionize the crypto industry by 2025, with explosive profit potential setting it apart from rivals. Thanks to its state-of-the-art technology, strategic roadmap, and strong investor backing, Lightchain AI could potentially reach $2—or even beyond—in the coming years. As AI adoption accelerates on a global scale, the demand for secure, efficient decentralized solutions like Lightchain AI is increasing rapidly. This surge in demand could drive significant growth in token value, offering early investors a chance for extraordinary returns. With industries increasingly turning to AI-driven solutions, a scalable, high-performance blockchain platform like Lightchain AI isn’t just a luxury—it’s essential. The future looks promising, with Lightchain AI leading the way. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Tron ( TRX ) has dropped to $0.2575, representing a 43% decline from its 2024 high, bringing its market cap to approximately $22 billion. However, the charts below suggest that the coin could bounce back and potentially retest its 2024 high. TRX price formed a falling wedge pattern The weekly chart indicates that Tron has remained above the 50-week moving average, signaling that its long-term bullish trend remains intact. Additionally, TRX has formed a falling wedge pattern, characterized by two descending and converging trendlines. This chart pattern often leads to a strong bullish breakout when the two lines approach their confluence. Tron has also formed a doji candlestick pattern, identified by a small body with long upper and lower shadows. These chart patterns collectively point to a potential rebound in the coming weeks.

The chart below shows that the network has generated $1.44 billion in fees over the past six months. In comparison, Ethereum ( ETH ) has made $857 million, while Solana ( SOL ) made $636 million in the same period. These fees are significant for Tron holders because they receive a portion as staking rewards. Currently, Tron offers a staking yield of approximately 4.5%, higher than Ethereum’s 3%. Tron profitability | Source: TokenTerminal Tron supply continues to fall Another critical factor is the decreasing supply of Tron in circulation. According to TronScan , TRX is one of the most deflationary tokens in the crypto industry, with an annual deflation rate of -2.83%. There are currently 86.14 billion TRX tokens in circulation, down from 88.6 billion on the same date last year. This trend is driven by the fact that the number of newly minted TRX tokens is consistently smaller than the amount burned. For example, on Thursday, Tron burned 7.7 million tokens while generating only 5.06 million. Tron supply chart | Source: TronScan Tron account holders are steady The number of Tron account holders has also grown steadily, further solidifying its position as one of the most active networks in the crypto space. There are currently over 165.17 million accounts holding TRX, up from 114 million on the same day last year. This growth signals increasing adoption among investors. Tron accounts chart | Source: TronScan The other key important data on Tron is the substantial sums of Tether ( USDT ) that pass through its network. It handled a volume worth $156 billion on Thursday, up by 18% from a day earlier.

James Zhang, founder of Jambo, said it to Empire host Santiago Santos in a bonus Empire episode last week . Jambo, for those of you who may not be aware, is an onchain mobile network. We’ll get more into it in a bit, but Zhang’s points about really looking to give folks access to the digital economy stood out to me. Right now, Jambo’s biggest user base is in Latin America. Zhang originally thought the biggest user base would perhaps be Africa, but that hasn’t been the case…yet. As Santos noted, “the next JPMorgan doesn’t look like JPMorgan. It looks like an MVNO with fintech services layered on top.” People should be able to digitally access all the integrations without ever having to go into, say, a bank branch. For Jambo, that means not only reaching a user base, but ensuring those users are as loyal as I am to Apple. And that’s where crypto comes in. And now you know. Check out the bonus Jambo episode of Empire above I had a chance to chat with Zhang earlier this week, and I was curious how he’d classify Jambo. Is it a DePIN? Is it more? What can I say, I’m paid to be nosey. First let’s start with the basics. Jambo’s been around for a while, having last raised capital from a number of big VCs back in 2022. The round was led by both Pantera and Paradigm, if you want to be specific. Zhang’s the first one to admit that it was a totally different market when they last raised compared to now, and the team’s been hustling. Even back in 2022, the reception for Jambo was “great,” Zhang noted. There’s an appetite to disrupt the Latin American and African phone markets with a device that is “censorship resistant.” But after the 2022 raise, Jambo and Zhang had to go into “cockroach mode” to survive the bear. And now, well, we’re here, on the other side. Zhang wouldn’t turn down the opportunity to raise again, he admitted, especially because he finds this market trickier than a bear market. “The reason is because in the bear market, we had already raised funding. We had already built our team, and [then] it was just shipping product. And honestly, there weren’t as many … you could say distractions, and … macro is distractions. But when one memecoin gets launched and sucks 90% of liquidity, it’s a little tough on the rest of the market or any narrative, so for us, we just honestly want to see more stability going into a token launch,” he told me. Zhang said that they’ve never specifically branded as a DePIN though Jambo clearly has elements of that, given that it offers both hardware and networks. “If you take our entire network together, it becomes one of the largest DePIN networks that users can tap into,” he said. He’d prefer if you think of them as a consumer-facing product, given that it’s their specialty. Outside of the hardware offerings, they also launched a satellite program earlier this week to “connect all 700,000-plus devices,” he said. Maybe Zhang’s really not that far off when he says he wants to be the onchain Apple. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

The number of cases dropped by 30% in Gary Gensler’s final year as SEC chairman, from 47 in 2023 to just 33 in the previous year. In spite of this reduction, the monetary fines rose to an all-time high of nearly $5 billion. A Year Of Record-Breaking Penalties Though enforcement numbers dropped, the SEC gathered penalties never seen before. The majority of this entire amount came from a single multi-billion dollar settlement. It is a far cry from the years Gensler led, in which fines, although significant, were less focused in specific cases. Despite a brief rise in the number of lawsuits filed against the crypto industry in the final months that SEC Chair Gary Gensler was in office, the agency overall saw a 30% decrease in enforcement actions against the industry last year. https://t.co/ONnMsaAIOo pic.twitter.com/bMEMIiQ0V3 — Law360 (@Law360) January 24, 2025 Between April 2021 and December 2024, the US regulatory body levied fines totaling over $6 billion for 125 activities related to cryptocurrencies. When compared to the collection of $1.50 billion that Jay Clayton oversaw from 2017 to 2020, this amount is over four times greater than that amount. Gensler’s Aggressive Stance On Fraud Gensler’s administration placed a strong focus on fraud. Around 66% of cases during Clayton’s term involved claims of fraudulent activities, a significant rise from 54% during his tenure. The SEC also kept looking at unregistered securities sales. Under Gensler, such infractions accounted for about 63% of all enforcement actions —a little lower than the 71% noted in the Clayton era. Notwithstanding the changing character of these lawsuits, this trend underscores the SEC’s relentless commitment to control of crypto-sector activity. Enforcement Trends In Comparison To Their Predecessors Between the Gensler and Clayton administrations, there is a stark contrast in their approaches to cryptocurrency regulation. Gensler oversaw 125 enforcement actions in just over three years, whereas Clayton initiated only 70 during a comparable timeframe. The fact that Gensler resolved 98 of these cases demonstrates a strong enforcement commitment. In reaction to cryptocurrency markets’ complexity and digital asset proliferation, the SEC has become more active. The Road Ahead For Crypto Regulation The record fines underline the SEC’s influence on shaping the cryptocurrency environment even if enforcement actions in 2024 decreased. With Gensler leaving, it is yet unknown how the new leaders will oversee the crypto industry. Industry insiders are still in discussion, meantime, whether the SEC would keep its strict posture or change to fit evolving market conditions. Gensler’s legacy emphasized a period of rigid monitoring and record-breaking penalties, implying that US financial authorities would most likely keep giving crypto control top priority.

A breakout from this structure is critical for determining the cryptocurrency’s next significant move. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart ADA’s price has been consolidating inside a triangle pattern following a rejection at the critical $1.2 resistance level. This rejection halted the prior upward momentum and introduced a prolonged period of market indecision. The price structure now suggests a balance between buyers and sellers, as evidenced by the RSI indicator hovering near the neutral 50 level. The triangle pattern represents a coiling price action behavior, signaling that a decisive breakout is imminent. A successful bullish breakout would likely pave the way for Cardano to reclaim the $1.2 mark and initiate a sustained upward trend. Conversely, a bearish breakdown could lead to heightened selling pressure, delaying a recovery. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, ADA encountered rejection at the $1.2 critical resistance zone after a bounce from the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.8. It resulted in a period of sideways consolidation, with the price forming a slight ascending wedge pattern within the broader triangle. The current market conditions suggest that a bullish breakout is the more probable scenario, as the wedge’s structure often signals a continuation of upward momentum. If buyers succeed, the asset will likely surge toward and potentially break above the $1.2 resistance zone. On the other hand, if selling pressure intensifies, Cardano’s 0.5-0.618 Fibonacci retracement range will serve as a critical support level, potentially absorbing downward momentum and preventing a deeper decline. This breakout will heavily influence the market’s next move, making the current phase critical for traders and investors.

This tactical move aligns with MANTRA Chain's $1B tokenization deal with DAMAC, a major real estate player in Dubai. The crypto community is paying attention, with leading influencers emphasizing the distinctive role $OM plays in the rapidly changing RWA space. Around $20M Worth of $OM Pulled from Binance by Whales 🐳Significant on-chain activity reveals that three wallets collectively withdrew 5.348M OM tokens (~$20M) from Binance at an average price of $3.71 per token.🔸 0xb370678a20d4bdbd4923a90d013f117f905838eb withdrew 2.487M… pic.twitter.com/QUZ32lGL5V — Open4profit (@open4profit) January 23, 2025 These withdrawals are particularly timely given the prospects of Trump's presidency and its possible influence on the U.S. real estate market. With DAMAC planning a $20B expansion in the U.S. and a $1B collaboration with MANTRA for tokenization, the Trump-DAMAC-MANTRA link could transform institutional adoption of RWA in 2025. The synchronized buying behavior indicates strategic positioning by savvy investors before significant changes. On-chain analysis shows that these actions were coordinated among three wallets, each holding just enough ETH to cover gas fees: 0xb37: Withdrawn 2.487M $OM ($9.2M) - Wallet created on December 10, 2024 0xFdf: Withdrawn 1.634M $OM ($6.1M) - Displaying a steady accumulation pattern 0x361: Withdrawn 1.227M $OM ($4.6M) - Newly established wallet within the last day As MANTRA Chain positions itself as the leading regulated RWA infrastructure amid potential policy changes in the U.S., the current price around $4 could offer substantial value. It appears that smart investors are gearing up for potential price targets between $8 and $15 as the Trump-DAMAC-MANTRA collaboration progresses throughout 2025.

Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said that Ballard and his wife were kidnapped on early Tuesday from their home in Central France and held captive at two separate addresses, Reuters reported on Friday. The prosecutor said that the kidnappers contacted another Ledger co-founder to demand ransom paid in cryptocurrencies. A police operation involving French elite forces GIGN freed Ballard on Wednesday and his wife was found on Thursday, the prosecutor said. Ballard was taken to hospital to receive treatment to one of his hands, which was mutilated, Beccuau said, without revealing further details, according to Reuters. Local newspaper Le Parisien reported that the attackers severed Ballard's finger and sent it to associates to extort a ransom. ""We are deeply relieved that David and his wife have been released, and are now safe,"" Pascal Gauthier, chairman and CEO of Ledger, said in a statement shared with CoinDesk. Rumors circulated on social media earlier this week that one of the co-founders of Ledger had been kidnapped. Reports alleging that Eric Larchevêque, another co-founder of the company, was the victim turned out to be false. CoinDesk reached out to Ledger for confirmation at the time, but the company didn't comment. ""Our top priority was always to allow law enforcement to do their jobs and protect the integrity of the investigation,"" CEO Gauthier said. ""We respected law enforcement requests around safeguarding critical details of the ongoing investigation and appreciated members of the press who did the same."" The incident was another example of an alarming trend of robberies and crime targeting crypto traders and industry figures as the crypto bull market marches on creating riches to investors. For example, Dean Skurka, the CEO of WonderFi, a publicly listed crypto holding company that owns one of Canada's largest crypto exchanges, was kidnapped for a ransom in Toronto last year. ""Have seen an uptick in irl [real life] robberies targeting crypto traders located in Western Europe over the past few months,"" popular blockchain sleuth ZachXBT posted on Telegram. ""The cases all involve known people in the crypto community where they were held at gunpoint.

Polygon (POL) According to CoinMarketCap, the Sleeper Titan Polygon (MATIC) token is valued at $0.445. This suggests a strong possibility of a resurgence for Sleeper Titan. Back in 2021, Polygon stood out as the leading Layer-2 Ethereum scaling solution, leaving investors wanting more. However, by 2025, Polygon's dominance has declined due to intense L2 competition, leading to weak pricing in 2024. The scenario is set for a turnaround. Positioned for a DeFi market rebound and increased capital inflows this year, Polygon, with its robust ecosystem, established partnerships, and developer-friendly infrastructure, could experience a substantial revival, making it a promising candidate for 2,500% gains in the upcoming months. Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa (KAS), priced at $0.113, is an altcoin with significant promise. Kaspa leads in blockchain innovation with its high-speed transactions and scalability, thanks to its revolutionary Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology. Projections suggest an average price of $0.18 within a year, with CoinCodex predicting a rise to $0.42 by early 2025. Kaspa could reach $1 by 2029, but its ability to innovate will be key to its success. With growing acceptance and creative developments, Kaspa could see a 2500% increase in three months, appealing to investors willing to take risks. Bonk (BONK) Dubbed the ""Shiba Inu of Solana,"" Bonk has climbed to the forefront of the meme coin scene, driven by hype and creativity. Priced at $0.0000349, Bonk offers an enticing entry point for investors seeking substantial gains. Leveraging Solana's scalability and low transaction fees, BONK presents itself as a practical and efficient choice for users. Bonk's active development team is adding features beyond just meme appeal, enhancing long-term engagement and utility. Its strategic integration into the Solana ecosystem boosts its usability and positions it for significant growth as adoption increases. By merging a dedicated community with solid technology, Bonk could potentially achieve 2,500% growth in the coming months. Cronos (CRO) Currently priced at $0.135, Cronos (CRO) is a blockchain powerhouse gaining momentum. Developed by Crypto.com, this decentralized, open-source platform is transforming DeFi, NFTs, and metaverse applications. Developers can easily integrate Ethereum-based dApps into Cronos using the Cosmos SDK and Ethereum's Virtual Machine (EVM). The Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism of Cronos enables fast transactions and low fees, making it attractive to users and developers alike. The Cronos ecosystem, with over 500 projects, continues to expand, and the introduction of Cronos zkEVM, a Layer 2 scaling solution, will enhance scalability and reduce transaction costs. As the platform continues to innovate, Cronos is set for a 2,500% increase in three months, making CRO a coin with immense growth potential. Stellar (XLM) Stellar (XLM), currently priced at $0.39, is an appealing cryptocurrency for those seeking steady growth. As a leading platform for cross-border payments and financial inclusion, Stellar has pioneered seamless fiat-to-cryptocurrency transactions. A significant partnership with MoneyGram expands its global network and value proposition. As new markets and financial institutions embrace Stellar, analysts anticipate its value to double by 2025. For long-term investors aiming for a 2500% gain in the short term, XLM is a solid option. Conclusion Investing in altcoins priced under $0.50 can lead to substantial gains in the near future. Rexas Finance , Polygon, Kaspa, Bonk, Cronos, and Stellar could potentially see 2500% growth in three months. These projects stand out from the competition with their innovative technology, strong community backing, and unique use cases. From tokenizing real-world assets to scaling solutions and strategic partnerships, these cryptocurrencies are set to grow within their respective industries. For investors seeking high rewards at a low cost, altcoins present some of the most promising crypto opportunities.

Currently, there's buzz among experts about whether Lightchain AI , a groundbreaking blockchain venture priced at a mere $0.005625 during its presale, having already amassed over $12.7 million, could offer similarly remarkable returns. Thanks to its pioneering technology and increasing market trust, Lightchain AI is being touted as a potential trailblazer in the forthcoming wave of blockchain innovation. Is BNB's Historic Growth a Roadmap for Future Success? Since its inception, Binance Coin (BNB) has shown remarkable growth, transitioning from a token used for trading fee discounts on the Binance exchange to a crucial component of the crypto landscape. As of January 23, 2025, BNB is valued at $689.94 USD, peaking at $703.22 USD intraday. BNB's rise has been propelled by Binance's strategic moves, which include expanding its use cases like transaction fees on Binance Smart Chain, token sales on Binance Launchpad, and payments across multiple platforms. Regular quarterly token burns reduce BNB's supply, potentially enhancing its value. Moreover, Binance Smart Chain has solidified BNB's role as a pivotal asset in decentralized finance (DeFi), luring developers and users alike. These strategies have significantly contributed to BNB's impressive market growth. Why Lightchain AI Might Be the Upcoming Giant in Cryptocurrency Lightchain AI unveils the novel Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, rewarding nodes for performing AI tasks like model training and optimization. This approach not only bolsters network security and efficiency but also sets it apart from traditional consensus methods. The project’s roadmap outlines a clear path for growth, with pivotal milestones such as the testnet launch in January 2025 and the mainnet going live in March 2025, demonstrating its dedication to innovation and scalability. Additionally, Lightchain AI boasts strong tokenomics with a total supply of 10 billion LCAI tokens, strategically allocated to ensure sustainability and fair participation. By integrating AI with blockchain technology, Lightchain AI tackles issues related to scalability, governance, and privacy, cementing its status as a leader in decentralized intelligence. Is It Possible for Lightchain AI to Achieve BNB's ROI? While aiming for BNB's 600,000% ROI is ambitious, Lightchain AI has several favorable factors. The project’s early presale success, with over $12.7 million raised, indicates strong investor trust. Furthermore, its emphasis on practical applications and scalability sets it apart in a market often driven by speculation. Analysts suggest that if Lightchain AI continues to draw developers, businesses, and retail investors, its value could see exponential growth when listed on major exchanges. With a low presale entry price, early investors could reap significant benefits as platform adoption increases. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

While the asset has experienced a series of bullish events that have driven its price to its current level, the analyst strongly believes that the cryptocurrency can jump even higher to reach $20. XRP Long To Short Term Price Prediction According to a crypto analyst identified as ‘XRP Meesku’ on X (formerly Twitter), the XRP price is gearing up to skyrocket to a new long-term ATH target of $20. The analyst’s bullish outlook for the token stems from its innovative potential, as advanced developments and technological advancements tend to drive price surges in a cryptocurrency. Related Reading: XRP Price Rallies To ATH At $3.4, Here’s What’s Driving It And Why The Pump Will Continue Notably, the analyst revealed that there has been ongoing speculation that XRP could be pivotal in national banking. He highlighted that many discussions have arisen suggesting that the altcoin could be used as a potential base layer for the United States (US) banking system. If this happens, it could fuel significant growth and adoption for XRP, potentially positioning it as a “global asset that is gaining traction.” Moreover, it could trigger a price increase of $20 ATH for the altcoin. In the mid-term time frame, XRP Meeksu predicts that the altcoin could potentially hit $8 first before attempting to break past its cycle top. He reveals that his optimistic outlook for XRP was influenced by factors such as new financial products like futures and the ongoing legal challenges with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Based on his analysis, the crypto expert suggests that resolving these issues could spark a price rally. Finally, the analyst shared a short-term price forecast for XRP, highlighting that altcoin is expected to experience significant volatility, leading to price fluctuations. Due to its sharp growth potential, he predicts a surge to $3.6 or higher was possible. Moreover, the X market expert mentioned the increase in significant liquidation trends, underscoring that traders may take a long position after being forced to close due to market fluctuations. Bullish Factors Driving The Price Surge While the XRP Meeksu shares his long- to short-term bullish prediction for the XRP price, the analyst also outlines several bullish activities that could drive a potential surge in the cryptocurrency. According to the crypto expert, the XRP market has seen a lot of activity lately, with the price stabilizing despite spikes in whale activity. Related Reading: XRP Price Eyes Bullish Flag Breakout That Could Put 50% Gains On The Board Looking at the asset’s past performances, the analyst mentions a notable transfer of $62 million to various crypto exchanges — a movement that could potentially be seen as a sell signal for strategic whale repositioning. Moreover, the CME Group has hinted at launching XRP futures, paving the way for institutional adoption and engagement in the cryptocurrency. Furthermore, the analyst delved deeper into the lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC, highlighting discussions about potential settlements and the conclusion of the almost four-year legal battle. Despite the lawsuit drama, the crypto expert disclosed that XRP’s overall sentiment remains bullish as analysts project more growth in the future. He revealed that XRP is showing signs of a price recovery and could soon hit new ATHs. Moreover, its community remains vibrant and active, sharing updates about ongoing scam threats, key events, and more.

With its cutting-edge technology and impressive presale results, investors are keeping a close eye on Lightchain AI for its potential to experience significant growth. As the cryptocurrency market gears up for new opportunities, many experts suggest that Lightchain AI could echo Cardano's success, promising substantial returns for early investors over the upcoming years. Will Lightchain AI Emulate Cardano’s 2017 Success? The intriguing question of whether Lightchain AI can replicate the historic gains Cardano achieved in 2017 persists. Cardano's ascent was propelled by a robust roadmap, strong community backing, and pioneering technology. Lightchain AI boasts similar features, such as a well-defined development strategy, the innovative application of AI within blockchain, and a highly successful presale that has raised $12.7 million at $0.005 per token. Though it remains uncertain if Lightchain AI will precisely follow Cardano's trajectory, its unique position in the blockchain sector with decentralized AI solutions gives it a competitive advantage. Should Lightchain AI successfully implement its roadmap, garner widespread adoption, and cultivate a robust community, it could achieve gains comparable to, or even surpassing, those of Cardano as the project develops. What’s Fueling the Anticipated Q1 2025 Boom for Lightchain AI? Lightchain AI’s anticipated surge in early 2025 is attributed to several crucial factors, including its commitment to reducing bias, a strong prototype phase, and well-planned tokenomics. The platform's dedication to mitigating bias ensures fairness and equity in AI calculations, attracting interest from both developers and investors. The prototype phase, set to begin in November 2024, will focus on polishing core elements like the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), allowing for real-world testing and feedback. Tokenomics is pivotal, with the presale price set at $0.005 and a total of $12 million raised, enabling Lightchain AI to establish a sustainable ecosystem. With these strong foundations, the platform is positioned for rapid growth in the first quarter of 2025, making it a prominent contender in the crypto arena. Lightchain AI Now Accessible to All In contrast to many blockchain initiatives limited to accredited investors, Lightchain AI is breaking new ground by opening its presale to the general public. This bold approach encourages a diverse and inclusive community, offering smaller investors the opportunity to invest early in a potentially game-changing technology. Moreover, Lightchain AI’s open-source strategy invites everyone to contribute to its development. This level of transparency and collaboration is refreshing in the cryptocurrency world and lays the groundwork for truly innovative advancements. As Q1 2025 approaches, Lightchain AI is preparing to make a significant impact in the blockchain industry. All eyes are on this project as it navigates its path to becoming a major industry player.

It’s an approach that has proved fruitful, with the companies coming out of EasyA’s app community and monthly in-person hackathons having raised money at a collective valuation of over $3 billion from top VC firms such as a16z crypto and CMT Digital. And EasyA’s mobile app, which helps developers easily start building their own Web3 projects, has over a million users worldwide. At the first EasyA Consensus hackathon in Austin last May, more than 700 participants launched 100 different crypto projects, and the Kwoks are expecting similar numbers for upcoming events at Consensus Hong Kong and Consensus Toronto (if you’d like to apply for the EasyA Hackathon at Consensus Hong Kong 2025, please go here ). Here they discuss why their unique approach to hackathons, how they expect Consensus Hong Kong will differ from hackathons in other parts of the world and how Donald Trump’s election could affect the types of projects crypto developers focus on. This series is brought to you by Consensus Hong Kong. Come and experience the most influential event in Web3 and Digital Assets, Feb.18-20. Register today and save 15% with the code CoinDesk15. This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. How did EasyA get started? Dominic: So we originally launched EasyA about four years ago as the go to place for anyone to learn about the world's best blockchains. Anyone can use the EasyA app on iOS and Android to learn about the top Layer Ones out there, like Solana, Polkadot, Stellar and Ripple’s XRP Ledger. And people can learn how to not only develop, but also launch their own projects. We also host a lot of big hackathons in person all around the world, in which hundreds of people come in person and launch projects on our blockchain partners. And the goal is to get these people not just launching, but then also founding and building startups that go on to get funded by the ecosystem and VCs. How do you approach hackathons differently than other companies that run these? Dominic: Two things. The first is that EasyA is very focused on founders who want to start their own companies, versus hackathon “bounty hunters.” We really want to make sure that our participants actually stick around and build their projects because that’s where we see the future of Web3 really being built from. And the second thing is most of our hackathons are single chain, so participants focus on one piece of tech and they actually launch on that one, as opposed to focusing on 50 different chains. We want to put people in front of the best ecosystems that have the most support for developers. How do you think the Consensus hackathon in Hong Kong will be different from those you hold in other parts of the world? Dominic: The scale is just going to be super big. We've already had a record number of people apply for the seats in the arena. We'll obviously have people from Hong Kong, but then also from other Asian countries like India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and China. And we're also seeing huge numbers of people from the West want to come. For many of those people, it'll be the first time they've actually been to Asia. Do you expect there to be differences in the types of projects that developers in Asia pursue, as opposed to those in other parts of the world? Phil: There's a geographical element and then there's also a thematic one. A huge theme that we've seen come up over the past couple of weeks is AI x Web3, and a lot of developers are excited about that intersection. We've also seen protocols like virtuals really kick off and become very successful, so I think we'll see a lot of that. Geographically, in Asia there are obviously so many different currencies, and we're seeing that developers there actually understand those cross-border use cases a lot better. If you're a U.S.-based developer, you don't necessarily see those friction points a ton. So I think that we're going to see a lot more of the cross border payment solutions start to flesh themselves out. How do you think Donald Trump’s presidency will affect the kinds of projects you see at your hackathons? Phil: Obviously DeFi has always been one of the biggest areas of product market fit in crypto — arguably one of the few that actually has that fit. But so far because of, frankly, how scared a lot of developers were in the States, a lot of people just weren't building nor launching in the U.S. And so you'd often go on to a decentralized app and it'll say “Oh, you're in the States, you can't use this.” So that’s a very visible area where we're going to start seeing changes. Another area where you can't participate if you’re from the U.S. is airdrops. So if you are an end user, you couldn't really access a lot of crypto. And if you wanted to target this demographic, which of course is the wealthiest in the world, you couldn't. So I think DeFi is really going to explode, especially in the States. Both of you are also speakers at Consensus Hong Kong. What will you be talking about? Dominic: Our keynote will be about why it's so hard right now for Web3 ecosystems to attract developers now. And we're going to be giving some of our tips on how they can attract developers more easily and at a bigger scale. Right now, Web3 firms are competing over the same developers, and the growth of Web3 devs has pretty much stagnated. And obviously at EasyA, our whole mission is actually to bring way more developers into the space. That starts with making it easy. But we’re also making several big tech upgrades that will allow developers to build much more easily on-chain. And we're going to be revealing those on stage.",Consensus Hong Kong 2025 Coverage|chk2025|Hackathon|Developers|Asia,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|DOT|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-24 16:41:07

This ascent is largely due to Elon Musk's high-profile backing, strong community engagement, and widespread viral popularity. With a market cap exceeding $54 billion and holding the seventh rank on CoinMarketCap, Dogecoin continues to attract long-term investors and substantial players, who are accumulating massive amounts of DOGE. The forecast for Dogecoin's price suggests that technical indicators are favorable. With robust support coming from the 20- and 50-day SMAs at $0.36, DOGE's upward trend might soon challenge crucial resistance levels at $0.43 and $0.45. A breakout could propel the coin to $0.49, and analysts predict it might eventually climb to $10 or even $15, based on past trends and growing market optimism. Despite stiff competition from newer meme coins like BONK and Official Trump, Dogecoin's ecosystem remains strong. The integration of the meme coin into pro-crypto policies, along with Musk's consistent support, makes DOGE an essential component of any investment portfolio. Shiba Inu Competes For Dominance in the Meme Coin Arena Another major player in the meme coin sector, Shiba Inu (SHIB), is vying for market prominence. Despite minor fluctuations, SHIB's price remains optimistic, moving within an upward channel that analysts believe could yield significant returns. With a market capitalization of $11 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $500 million, SHIB continues to attract those on the lookout for the next big opportunity. Shiba Inu's developers have openly discussed the token's potential. Recent advancements, such as the integration of Shibarium, have bolstered investor confidence. Although aiming for $0.50 might seem ambitious, the community-driven projects and increasing burn rates of SHIB suggest a bright future for the token. The foundation and loyal following of SHIB remain strong as it navigates the volatile market. While analysts foresee modest short-term growth in the meme coin sector, SHIB is well-positioned as a lasting competitor in the long run. Remittix Disrupts the Crypto Payment Landscape While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu hold their ground, Remittix (RTX) is shaking up the market with its groundbreaking PayFi protocol. By combining blockchain speed with fiat convenience, Remittix enables users to transfer funds globally without hidden fees or unfavorable exchange rates. This means you can send cryptocurrency to a family member abroad, and they receive the exact fiat amount, with no surprises or complications. With a presale price of $0.0282, Remittix has already garnered over $5.3 million. The presale offers a unique opportunity for early investors, with expectations of 25x returns. Analysts foresee an astounding 5,000% increase upon launch, driven by the growing demand for seamless cross-border payments. Remittix's versatility provides it with a competitive edge. Supporting over 40 cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies, the platform simplifies international transactions for individuals and businesses alike. RTX is setting a new standard for retailers adopting Remittix Pay for seamless crypto transactions or freelancers invoicing clients overseas. Key features of the platform include its security and transparency. Its transparent flat-fee model ensures recipients get precisely what senders intend, while investors benefit from a fully audited smart contract and a locked liquidity pool. With plans to debut on major exchanges like Uniswap, Remittix is set to revolutionize the $190 trillion global payments market. Conclusion The rise of altcoins like Remittix signals a shift in the cryptocurrency landscape, even as Dogecoin's price predictions and Shiba Inu's technical indicators show that meme coins continue to thrive. The innovative PayFi protocol positions RTX as a game-changer, while DOGE's strong foundation and SHIB's community-driven initiatives remain attractive. For investors seeking significant returns and practical utility, Remittix offers an ideal mix of innovation and growth potential. With its presale gaining momentum and the prospect of substantial rewards, now is the perfect time to consider adding Remittix to your portfolio. As a global leader, Remittix is redefining the future of payments and cryptocurrency adoption in a sector driven by innovation and accessibility. For investors who aren’t afraid of disruption.

In a recent operational alert , the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada outlined how virtual currencies, including Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), Tether ( USDT ), and USD Coin ( USDC ), are being leveraged to facilitate international drug trade while bypassing traditional financial systems. FINTRAC’s findings highlight the role of darknet marketplaces in connecting fentanyl producers and buyers. FINTRAC published today an #OperationalAlert to support businesses in recognizing financial transactions related to the laundering of the proceeds of fentanyl and other illegal synthetic opioids.

Once funds are released, they can be transferred to private wallets, laundered through mixing services, or converted to fiat currencies via exchanges, complicating efforts to trace the money trail.

Key participants include the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Canada Post, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, and the Canada Border Services Agency. Project Guardian focuses on identifying financial transaction patterns linked to synthetic opioid trafficking. This includes monitoring payments for precursor chemicals, lab equipment, and shipping services. Micro-traffickers, who often use postal and courier services to ship small quantities of drugs, are increasingly turning to virtual currencies for global sales. Meanwhile, large-scale distribution networks exploit freight corridors, particularly in Vancouver and Toronto, to transport precursors and finished opioids. FINTRAC’s alert urges financial institutions to closely monitor cryptocurrency transactions associated with darknet marketplaces, privacy-focused smart contracts, or mixing services. These are often tied to synthetic opioid operations and represent a significant risk for facilitating illicit activities.

Bullish Divergence Spotted appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After a prolonged period of downside momentum, Dogwihat (WIF), a popular Solana-based meme coin, is poised for a massive upside movement. This positive outlook can be attributed to the formation of bullish price action and the rising interest from traders over the past 24 hours. Dogwifhat (WIF) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, WIF appears bullish as it has formed a bullish divergence on its daily time frame. Whenever an asset forms a bullish divergence, it indicates that the asset is likely to skyrocket soon. Additionally, WIF seems to be consolidating near a crucial support level of $1.30. Source: Trading View Historically, this level has acted as strong support for the meme coin. Since August 2024, WIF has reached this level nearly four times, and each time, it has experienced significant upside momentum. Looking at the historical price momentum, experts and analysts are expecting a similar kind of upside movement. Based on the recent price action, if WIF breaks out of the consolidation and closes a daily candle above the $1.50 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 40% to reach the $2 level in the future. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), currently near 35, indicates that WIF could soon experience a strong price reversal and significant upside momentum. 80% of Binance Traders Go Long For WIF Looking at the bullish outlook, Binance traders have shown strong interest and confidence in the meme coin over the past 24 hours, according to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass .

Even though the prices don’t exactly reflect it on a seven-day scale, a lot has happened on the macro level that could pave the way for a longer-term progress that was much-desired. That said, the total crypto market cap currently sits at around $3.8 trillion, but let’s take it one step at a time. The very first thing that happened at the beginning of the week was Donald Trump taking the oath of office and stepping into his position as the 47th president of the United States of America. This unchained a series of events that could provide for a long-lasting impact on the industry. Right off the get-go, Trump signed an executive order, which, among other things, established a working group on Digital Asset Markets with the purpose of exploring the merits of creating a strategic national cryptocurrency stockpile. Now, some clarifications are in order. Many expected Trump to focus on Bitcoin and to actually mandate the government to consider buying it for its national reserves. Whereas in reality, the order only talked about not selling the crypto that the country has confiscated. Nonetheless, the order in question also aims to prohibit the creation and further usage of central bank digital currencies to prevent a potential dispute to the dollar’s hegemony. Also, the document outlines the necessity for for easy access for individuals and crypto companies to the country’s banking system, effectively putting a halt on operation Chokepoint 2.0. That said, Trump also appointed an interim Chairman to the Securities and Exchange Commission – Mark Uyeda. They also established a task force headed by Commissioner Hester Peirce (a.k.a Crypto Mom) to work on creating a fair and transparent framework for digital assets. All in all, it was a very good week in terms of crypto fundamentals, not so much as for the price as most of the coins are charting losses with the exception of BTC, which is up by around 2%.

Arguably, the biggest news in the cryptocurrency space this week came on Thursday night when the new US President signed an executive order to review the creation of a ‘National Digital Asset Stockpile.’ This, alongside Senator Cynthia Lummis’ election to chair the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digita Assets, prompted Changpeng Zhao to claim that the BTC reserve is ‘pretty much confirmed.’ Donald Trump Pardons Silk Road Creator Ross Ulbricht . President Trump seems to be keeping up his promises, at least for now, as he officially pardoned Ross Ulbricht, the controversial founder of the notorious Silk Road. The developer spent roughly a decade behind bars as he was convicted in May 2015 on seven charges and received two life sentences plus 40 years without the possibility of parole. SEC Revokes SAB 121, Paving the Way for Banks to Hold Crypto . More favorable news from the new US administration toward crypto came with a substantial change within the Securities and Exchange Commission. A new policy, called SAB 122, overturned the controversial SAB 121, which essentially blocked banks from holding crypto assets. Trump Names Uyeda and Pham as Interim SEC and CFTC Leaders . The changes within the two top US financial watchdogs – CFTC and SEC – began with the appointment of Mark Uyeda as the latter’s interim Chair and Caroline Pham to spearhead the former until permanent leaders are voted in. Trump Downplays Meme Coin Profits in First Statement After Launch . The crypto space was rocked in the past week by the launch of two official meme coins by the US President and the First Lady. The consecutive token releases during the weekend sent shockwaves throughout the market, but Trump downplayed the profits when he finally addressed the assets publicly. Here’s What CryptoQuant’s IBCI Signals for Bitcoin’s Next Move . Bitcoin went on a wild ride this week, from a brief slip below $100,000 to a new all-time high above $109,000 on inauguration day. Since then, the asset has calmed and stands a few grand from that peak. However, there are some warning signs that this bull run could come to an end soon or at least be paused for a while.

Numerous investors from the ADA ICO days are now gravitating toward Rexas Finance , having previously benefited when ADA catapulted from its initial $0.0024 ICO price to a peak of $3.10. Currently, RXS is priced at $0.175 during its 11th presale phase. Forecasts suggest it could soar to an incredible $40.25 by 2025—representing a potential 23,000% growth. So, what's drawing these experienced crypto investors to this presale, and what underpins their optimism? RXS Presale: A 485% Jump Hinting at Future Growth Launching in early September 2024 at $0.030 per token, Rexas Finance's presale has already witnessed a 485% increase, reaching $0.175 in its 11th stage. The presale has successfully sold over 407,674,311 RXS tokens, accumulating $37,968,404. This impressive growth mirrors the early success of ADA and excites investors who either missed out on Cardano's pivotal moment or are keen to replicate their past successes. With a total of 1 billion RXS tokens, Rexas Finance offers substantial growth opportunities while maintaining scarcity to ensure long-term value. Could Rexas Finance Be the Next Cardano? Rexas Finance stands out for its ability to let users tokenize and trade assets with minimal effort. Whether it's trading tokenized gold or buying a small stake in a Manhattan luxury property, the possibilities are endless. Thanks to Rexas Finance's Token Builder, anyone can tokenize their assets without needing to code. This opens up asset ownership and makes blockchain access easier for companies and individuals. The Launchpad ensures seamless funding for innovative projects by enabling anyone to back their tokenized ventures. Supporting ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 standards, the platform can handle various token types, from fungible assets to NFTs. Rexas Finance has successfully passed its Certik audit, providing investors with assurance of its transparency and security. Unlike many businesses that rely heavily on venture capital, Rexas Finance has embraced a community-first approach. This decision has fostered a dedicated group of private investors who resonate with the project's vision of revolutionizing asset ownership. Rexas Finance's listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko reinforce this commitment to transparency and decentralization, allowing investors to monitor real-time data and verify token information. To boost investor excitement, Rexas Finance is hosting a $1 million RXS giveaway. Twenty fortunate winners will receive RXS tokens worth $50,000 each. With 841,498 entries to date, participants can enhance their chances by completing tasks and sharing the offer on social media. This initiative aims to increase the project's visibility and reward early supporters. RXS's Potential Compared to ADA's Ascent The staggering 17,400% growth from $0.0177 in 2020 to $3.10 in 2021 serves as a reminder of how early investments in promising projects can lead to significant returns. Rexas Finance possesses similar qualities that contributed to ADA’s achievement: Robust Foundations: Much like Cardano’s focus on blockchain advancements, Rexas Finance is revolutionizing asset tokenization. Community Involvement: ADA’s expansion was largely fueled by an enthusiastic community, a dynamic Rexas Finance emulates with its no-VC strategy. Opportunities for Early Investors: Just as ADA’s ICO price of $0.0024 attracted astute investors, RXS’s current presale price of $0.175 offers a chance to invest before a potential surge. Industry experts forecast that RXS could reach $40.25 by 2025, providing a 23,000% return from its current presale valuation. With its emphasis on real-world asset tokenization, transparent operations, and community-driven expansion, Rexas Finance exhibits all the characteristics of a breakout cryptocurrency project. Investors from the Cardano ICO era are eagerly joining the Rexas Finance crypto presale at $0.175, anticipating a potential 23,000% gain as it aims for $40.25 by 2025. Don't Overlook the RXS Presale Rexas Finance is a pioneering initiative that leverages blockchain technology to unlock trillions in asset value. It is not merely another coin. Its credibility is further supported by its Certik audit, CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko listings, and community-focused approach. As the presale gains momentum, now is the time to act.

Although Ethereum continues to be a dominant player in the crypto sphere, these rising projects present distinct growth prospects. Among these is Lightchain AI , a blockchain platform that integrates artificial intelligence, having already garnered $12.8 million in its presale and set at a price of $0.005625. Let's explore why these tokens are drawing interest. Lightchain AI (LCAI) Lightchain AI ($LCAI) is transforming the digital landscape by integrating state-of-the-art artificial intelligence with robust blockchain technology. Aimed at providing groundbreaking solutions across various sectors, the platform features a fair and sustainable tokenomics structure, limiting the supply to 10 billion tokens for presale, staking rewards, liquidity, marketing, team, and treasury purposes. What sets $LCAI apart is its deflationary tokenomics. With each transaction or AI task completion, a portion of the fees is burned, permanently reducing the number of tokens in circulation. This inherent scarcity not only supports the ecosystem but also has the potential to enhance the value of the remaining tokens over time. Lightchain AI is more than just a blockchain platform—it’s a revolutionary force, blending advanced AI and blockchain to redefine the future of technology. Are you ready to be part of this transformation? Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) As of January 24, 2025, Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) continue to be significant players in the blockchain sector, addressing issues related to scalability and decentralization. Solana’s hybrid consensus mechanism of Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) allows for rapid transaction speeds and low fees, making it suitable for DApps and DeFi initiatives. Conversely, Avalanche’s innovative consensus protocol offers customizable subnets and promotes interoperability across different blockchain networks. Solana's SOL is currently priced at $251.28, while Avalanche’s AVAX is valued at $35.99, both showing signs of recovery from previous market declines. Avalanche’s emphasis on asset tokenization and partnerships, including collaboration with Amazon Web Services, bolsters its growth potential. Solana’s forthcoming Saga crypto phone aims to enhance user interaction and broaden its ecosystem, attracting investor interest. Reasons These Tokens May Eclipse Ethereum Even though Ethereum remains the preferred platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications, issues such as high gas fees and scalability have created opportunities for competitors. Tokens like Solana, Lightchain AI , and Avalanche tackle these challenges by providing quicker, more efficient solutions tailored to specific use cases. For investors looking for opportunities beyond Ethereum, these tokens offer a chance to leverage emerging trends and innovations in the blockchain arena. As the market progresses, these projects are well-positioned to spearhead the next wave of crypto adoption. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

39380945,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=380381,1737738793,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/39380945.jpeg,Top Ripple (XRP) Price Predictions: Analysts Reveal Key Targets,https://cryptopotato.com/top-ripple-xrp-price-predictions-analysts-reveal-key-targets/,"TL;DR Analysts predict XRP could rise to a new all-time high if key support levels hold, with possible pullbacks to $2.80 or $2.50 seen as buying opportunities. A favorable resolution in the Ripple v. SEC case and the potential approval of an XRP ETF in the U.S. could drive the asset’s price higher, with optimism fueled by the changes in the SEC leadership. Is $10 Possible? Ripple’s XRP has been flying high ever since Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential elections. Prior to the vote, the asset’s price hovered around $0.50, but currently, it is worth $3.20 (per CoinGecko’s data). This represents a whopping 540% increase, with many analysts expecting further gains in the following months. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko One of the people touching upon the matter is the popular X user Michael van de Poppe. He told his over 750,000 followers on the social media platform that a potential price plunge to $2.80 might serve as an optimal entry point. He also claimed that an eventual rise to $10 per coin is not out of the question. EGRAG CRYPTO chipped in, too. The analyst envisioned a possible retest of $2.83 and a drop to $2.50, “which is normal.” In general, though, the trader remains bullish, predicting the price to reach new dimensions if it breaks above $3.40. Recall that XRP almost hit that target on January 16. As CryptoPotato reported , it spiked to as high as $3.39, standing just 1% away from its all-time high registered at the beginning of 2018. The Bulls Are Waiting for These Developments One of the most important factors that could positively impact the price of XRP is the final resolution of the Ripple v. SEC lawsuit (assuming it benefits the firm). Just a few days ago, the agency’s former Chairman, Gary Gensler (considered a huge enemy of the digital asset sector), resigned and was succeeded by the pro-crypto Mark Uyeda. This has infused enthusiasm across the XRP Army that the case might conclude with a favorable resolution for Ripple soon . The popular American lawyer John Deaton also shares that thesis. He claimed there are three possible scenarios for the case after Gensler’s departure. The most likely includes dismissing the SEC’s appeal of the 2023 verdict set by Judge Analisa Torres. Back then, the magistrate ruled that XRP sales on public exchanges to retail investors did not constitute securities transactions. However, Deaton thinks Ripple will have to pay the previously ordered $125 million penalty for violating certain rules. The fine shouldn’t be a problem for the company since some execs already promised to abide by the rules. It also represents just a fraction of the $2 billion the securities regulator initially requested. The potential launch of an XRP ETF in the United States may also trigger upward pressure on the price of the underlying asset. A few weeks ago, Monica Long (Ripple’s president) said that such a product was “likely to be next in line.” According to Polymarket, there is a 64% chance that the investment vehicle will see the light of day before the end of 2025.

Solana faced major disruptions from meme coins, steering investors toward 1Fuel, a new crypto with 50x growth potential. Table of Contents Solana outages resume after meme coin launch 1Fuel presales making waves – hit 150 million tokens sold Cracks appeared on the Solana Infrastructure this past weekend as two meme coins caused massive disruptions. This has led investors to consider a new crypto project with up to 50x potential, 1Fuel . Summary The Trump and Melania meme coins caused unprecedented congestion on the Solana Blockchain 1Fuel has emerged as one of the leading presales in 2025, with over 150 million tokens sold The third stage of the 1Fuel Presale is currently $0.017 You might also like: SHIB & PEPE could storm ahead of DOGE: 1Fuel pre-release turns heads Solana outages resume after meme coin launch Over the weekend, the launch of two meme coins, TRUMP , and MELANIA , significantly disrupted the Solana ecosystem. These launches triggered massive congestion, delays, and numerous failed transactions. Although optimists look to this to be a plus for cryptocurrencies, underlying cracks in Solana’s infrastructures make this less likely. Interest in these meme tokens surged in anticipation of the president’s second term inauguration, leading to a rush of retail investors eager to invest. This unprecedented surge in activity caused extensive congestion across the network. The impact extended beyond Solana-based services like Jupiter and Phantom; even centralized exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance experienced outages related to Solana transactions. Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Helius Labs, discussed the outage and attributed it to factors including extraordinarily high volatility, excessive use of compute Units, and fee inconsistencies. The high volatility in meme coin prices resulted in settings for low slippage, which increased the likelihood of transaction failures. Despite Mumtaz’s optimism about the situation, the general perception of the event remains negative. The Solana community is questioning whether the current infrastructure can handle the surge in transactions as cryptocurrencies become more mainstream. Being labeled as an ‘Ethereum-killer’ yet facing similar issues as Ethereum casts a negative light on Solana. This concern is driving investors toward another project, 1Fuel, which promises to be a one-stop shop for all things cryptocurrency. 1Fuel presales making waves – hit 150 million tokens sold Imagine enhancing crypto trading and investing with AI technology. Well, don’t imagine anymore; 1Fuel is the market-ready answer. 1Fuel is changing the cryptocurrency market with its cross-chain functionality, military-grade security, and one-click solution. Its emergence aligns perfectly with the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency, automating complex processes and freeing traders from the need for technical backend knowledge. The success of presale stages 1 and 2 underscores the market’s growing recognition of 1Fuel’s unique value. With stage 3 of its presale currently underway, 1Fuel is poised to have an even greater impact. Over 150 million tokens have been sold, representing 30% of the presale supply. Presale 3 offers investors the opportunity to buy in at $0.017, marking a 17x increase from Stage 1 price of $0.001 and a 50% increase from Stage 2 price of $0.012. This is the final chance to acquire 1Fuel at these exceptional prices, as several crypto commentators predict it could rise by at least 10x upon its first exchange listing later in 2025. Interested investors wouldn’t want to miss this chance to stack up 1Fuel’s tokens in its ongoing presale at $0.017. Its current growth rate suggests it won’t be at this price for long.

Ondo Finance ( ONDO ) jumped after Larry Fink pressed the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve tokenized stocks and bonds. This statement, coming from the head of the world’s largest asset manager, with over $10.7 trillion in assets under management, has further bolstered interest in the tokenization space. BlackRock has been actively involved in the tokenization industry through its BUIDL product, which currently holds over $640 million in assets. Ondo Finance has partnered with BUIDL for its Short-Term US Government Treasuries product, which manages more than $189 million in assets. The recent rally in ONDO also comes as anticipation builds for the upcoming Ondo Summit, the platform’s inaugural event focused on tokenization and the disruption it is driving in the financial services industry. Scheduled for Feb. 6, the summit will feature speakers from prominent financial institutions, including BNY Mellon, BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree, and Pantera. Additionally, representatives from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission will participate, further elevating the event’s significance. Speculation about potential partnerships and announcements at the summit has fueled optimism, with investors expecting Ondo to perform well ahead of and during the event. The token’s price rebound also comes a week after the network unlocked over 2.5 billion ONDO tokens. Its next unlock is scheduled for Jan. 18, 2026.

The price has since formed a falling wedge pattern, with the upper trendline connecting the highest swings since Dec. 16 and the lower trendline connecting the lowest levels since November. As these lines converge, ONDO has made a bullish breakout. Ondo has retested the key resistance level at $1.4850, the upper side of the cup and handle pattern, another bullish sign. It has formed a small inverse head and shoulders chart pattern. Based on these technical patterns, ONDO is likely to continue its upward trajectory, with the next key target at $2.1430, representing a 45% gain from its current level. However, this bullish outlook would be invalidated if the price drops below the support level at $1.0950.

These coins have quickly attracted significant interest since their introduction, already reaching notable market capitalizations. Nonetheless, they face criticism within the crypto community, with some arguing that they highlight the more negative aspects of digital assets. Implications of Trump’s Meme Coin for the Crypto Market Just two nights before taking office, President Donald Trump announced on his X page the official listing of his meme coin $TRUMP . This news set off a frenzy, captivating the entire crypto scene, as investors rushed to acquire the new coin. $TRUMP achieved immediate success, surpassing SHIB and PEPE to become the second-largest meme coin by market cap, though it now ranks third. Currently, the Official TRUMP coin is the 25th largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap nearing $7 billion, despite being launched only a week ago, on January 17, 2025. Moreover, on the eve of his inauguration, Melania Trump launched her own meme coin, $MELANIA, stirring excitement in the crypto world and leading to significant price increases for various cryptos, including Bitcoin. This recent introduction of the $TRUMP meme coin by President Trump has ignited enthusiasm in the cryptocurrency community, with many seeing it as a step toward legitimizing digital assets and potentially positioning the U.S. as a leader in the crypto arena. However, these tokens ($TRUMP & $MELANIA) have been heavily criticized for their speculative nature and the potential for market manipulation. Reports suggest that Trump's associates hold a large quantity of the $TRUMP coin, raising concerns about centralized control and the risk of pump-and-dump schemes. Given these issues and their large market caps, numerous investors are turning to emerging meme coins with smaller market caps, seeking opportunities for significant gains by entering early. Many are now eyeing Trump crypto alternatives still in presale, as getting in early at a low market cap can be advantageous.

But THIS Altcoin can be the Next Big Thing,https://coingape.com/solana-price-jumps-10-in-24-hours-but-this-altcoin-can-be-the-next-big-thing/,"Solana’s demand has surged even more than it already is when Donald’s Trump TRUMP launched on the chain and rumors of plans to open a SOL-based strategic reserve started circling around. Already up by 10% already, the word on the crypto space is that it can potentially climb higher. While investors have been jumping into SOL thanks to its rising popularity, a brand-new token presale called Nebula Stride also seems to have gained major traction. What is Solana’s Next Price Target? Solana has finally managed an all-time high of about $258 with its latest pump. Even though the token was trading at the $256 level in November 2024, the market’s volatility pushed it down to the $190 level, often. And when the market grew immensely volatile, the drop pushed it even lower. However, in a single month, it has managed to jump from about $195 to more than $284, with the recent price range being around $270 after a slight correction. Since it has just broken its highest-ever price range, SOL is likely to go into what is called a price discovery mode. In this phase, the price of Solana is likely to explore a new price range depending on the dynamics of market demand and supply. During this price discovery mode, Solana’s price could likely experience heightened volatility as traders and investors attempt to establish a new fair value, which is likely to be higher than the current price range. With no historical resistance above the previous ATH, upward momentum may be fueled by FOMO and increased buying pressure from retail and institutional investors. However, there is also a chance of profit-taking, likely by early holders, which could potentially create intermittent corrections. To gauge the growth potential, one may look at indicators in the short term. These key indicators may include trading volume, market sentiment, and any developments related to Solana’s ecosystem or partnerships. If the bullish trend sustains, Solana might test the $300-$350 range in the short term, with further growth contingent on broader market conditions, especially among the high market cap projects. But Why is Solana Pumping? Solana is gradually becoming the most used blockchain, and the rise of meme coins within its ecosystem attest to that fact. BONK, for example, drew eyes towards Solana, and other tokens followed soon. And when the current US president, Donald Trump, announced his plans to add Solana, alongside XRP, to the US strategic reserve, things took a turn for the better. Although it is only a “maybe” right now, that’s enough for the people to support SOL. The market as a whole has been enjoying an increase in value as well. However, Solana’s growth is more evident among the large-cap cryptos and is likely to sustain the current uptrend in the days to come, as long as positive developments and announcements keep coming in. Nebula Stride’s Is Generating A Lot of Buzz Right Now Every time a bull market arrives, investors start hunting for projects that could give big gains from early on. For instance, projects like Sui or Aptos, which, along with strong utility, incentivized users with massive airdrops. The latest addition to this trend might be Nebula Stride , a presale that has caught the attention of the investing citizenry globally through its innovative tech-centric concept and a whopping $1 million giveaway. Nebula Stride is a presale project that aims to completely transform the financial space by allowing individuals to manage their finances freely. It aims to do so by creating an ecosystem that is fully powered by blockchain and decentralized. The DeFi revolution starts with NebulaStride! NebulaStride is currently pre-selling the NST token, and it will be the foundation of the future ecosystem.

Its native token, NST, shall serve as the focal point of the ecosystem, as it could be used to make transactions, participate in staking, vote on key platform development issues, and earn privileges within the rewards system. This multifunctionality of the native token will be what makes it the most important component of the project, facilitating user interaction within the platform. The giveaway is also set to be massive, where participants who invest at least 100 USDT in NST tokens shall be eligible to potentially win 10,000 USDT. The amount is set to be received by 100 lucky winners, making the NST giveaway one of the biggest in the space recently. Still in its first presale stage, investors have been hurrying to stock up on the tokens as much as they can before the price starts increasing from its current $0.025 level. While Solana is set to see further growth, projects like Nebula Stride may also likely go viral, given their smaller market caps and potential to 10x or even 100x in value in the coming weeks.

Last night, President Trump signed the “Digital Assets” executive order (EO), and let’s just say Bitcoiners are feeling... sour. Initially, rumors swirled that this might be the long anticipated Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) legislation. But nope — not even close. Bitcoin reserve didn’t get a single mention. Instead, the EO said: ""The Working Group shall evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile and propose criteria for establishing such a stockpile, potentially derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts."" Translation: This EO looks like a vague ""let’s study shitcoins"" roadmap rather than a bold step toward a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. If you were hoping for a nation state orange pill moment, this ain’t it. But before you rage tweet, take a deep breath. There is a silver lining. The EO does outlaw CBDCs — a huge win for freedom money and a more Bitcoin-aligned future. And, as Senator Cynthia Lummis reminded us yesterday, her Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill is “ a BIG lift ”: Why is this good news? Let’s break it down: Executive Orders Are Fragile: EOs are quick to implement but can be easily reversed by the next administration. They’re political Post-it Notes, not permanent fixes. Legislation Is Durable: Laws passed through both houses of Congress are far harder to repeal. Lummis’ long term strategy aims to cement Bitcoin’s role in the U.S. economy for generations, not just the next election cycle. She is taking the low time preference route, and I salute her for that. Senator Lummis said it herself in an X DM she allowed me to share: “Even if the EO had been an outright Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, the next administration (after Trump) could undo it (what’s done administratively can generally be undone administratively). So, in order to get the 20-year minimum HODL, which my bill calls for, and meaningfully address America’s debt, we have to go through the legislative process (passage through both the House and Senate) to get it to the President’s desk for signature. It’s really important that we have momentum for a marathon, not a sprint. I don’t want people getting discouraged. The trajectory is to the moon but we have to stick with it and work the process. Lots to do but the EO was a great jumping-off point to get us there.” So yes, the EO feels like a quick win for crypto execs eager to pump their bags. But the real fight for Bitcoin’s future is just beginning. A congressionally approved SBR is better than an SBR via Executive Order. Full stop! Bitcoin has always thrived in adversity. Whether it’s bans, restrictions, or now the ""national digital asset stockpile"" nonsense, Bitcoin’s resilience is unmatched. As Senator Lummis works to push the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill through Congress, individual states are already leading the charge. States are introducing Bitcoin-specific reserve legislation, not vague ""digital asset"" plans. Meanwhile, global momentum is building. Putin didn’t say, ""no one can control digital assets,"" he said “no one can control Bitcoin” . Nation states aren’t about to FOMO into $TRUMP or FARTCOIN. They’re watching, learning, and inching closer to Bitcoin. Bitcoin wins because it is superior money. Every piece of news, even setbacks, is ultimately bullish for Bitcoin because it exposes weaknesses in fiat and strengthens Bitcoin’s narrative. So stay patient. The slow burn will be worth it.

Significant events, such as the CPI report, the FOMC meeting on January 29, and the effect of Trump's inauguration on January 20, could significantly impact Bitcoin's path and propel it further. Emerging projects like PlutoChain ($PLUTO) are also garnering attention. With sophisticated Layer-2 solutions and enhanced transaction speeds, PlutoChain might overcome some of Bitcoin's existing hurdles and unlock new features. Bitcoin Price Outlook – Could Trump’s Inauguration Trigger Another BTC Surge by February 2025? At present, Bitcoin (BTC) is valued at roughly $103,900, marking a 1.05% drop from its last closing price. Bitcoin's Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 65.045, indicating that the asset is nearing overbought territory. Looking at moving averages, Bitcoin's 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is at $99,416.28, with the 200-day SMA at $96,330.46. The fact that the 50-day SMA is above the 200-day SMA indicates a bullish trend. Key resistance points to watch include the significant $100,000 mark and the crucial $106,000 level. Bitcoin's value has climbed back to $100,000 after a dip to around $90,000 earlier this month, amid talk that Trump's actions could again shake the market. The forthcoming CPI report is a major focus, with favorable inflation numbers possibly elevating Bitcoin's price. Additional factors, such as the comeback of institutional investors, increased stablecoin creation, and renewed influx into spot Bitcoin ETFs, might offer further support. Leading crypto companies, including Ripple, Coinbase, Kraken, Robinhood, and Circle, have together donated over $10 million to Trump’s inaugural fund. Executives are congregating in Washington as the president-elect gets ready to assume office, sparking speculation about executive orders that might alter crypto policy. Trump, known for his crypto-friendly views, is predicted to issue directives on January 20, one of which could potentially trigger a surge in Bitcoin's price. Galaxy Digital's CEO has boldly predicted that Bitcoin might reach $500,000 if a reserve system is adopted. Meanwhile, Crypto Rover forecasts the price might hit $280,000 following Trump's inauguration. In contrast, analyst VirtualBacon predicts Bitcoin will reach $200,000 by the end of the year, citing factors such as increased liquidity from the Federal Reserve, pro-crypto policies, rising ETF inflows, and a possible altcoin season contributing to the rise. Can PlutoChain’s Hybrid Layer-2 Solution Unlock BTC’s Full Potential in 2025? PlutoChain ($PLUTO) is a robust Layer-2 solution that aims to enhance Bitcoin’s capabilities for DeFi, NFTs, and advanced blockchain applications. Bitcoin’s network frequently faces issues with slow transaction speeds, high fees, and congestion – though this may soon change. PlutoChain could resolve these issues by developing a hybrid Layer-2 network to alleviate traffic, reduce costs, and increase scalability. With block times of only 2 seconds—compared to Bitcoin’s 10-minute intervals— PlutoChain could enable quicker, more efficient smart contract execution while preserving Bitcoin’s trusted infrastructure. EVM compatibility is also a feature that might allow developers to seamlessly port Ethereum-based projects to PlutoChain. This could pave the way for new possibilities in DeFi, NFTs, and AI applications, extending Bitcoin’s role beyond just a store of value. During its testnet phase, PlutoChain processed 43,200 transactions in a single day without any congestion, highlighting its potential for practical applications. Security remains a top priority for PlutoChain. The platform has been audited by SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi . Continuous code reviews, stress testing, and compliance with global standards ensure its dependability. Moreover, PlutoChain encourages community involvement and transparency by allowing users to participate in voting on updates, partnerships, and features through its official Discord channel. Conclusion With Trump’s inauguration nearing, there is growing optimism about Bitcoin's prospects. Speculation about increased institutional interest and potential regulatory shifts could propel the cryptocurrency leader to new heights in the upcoming months. Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) may play a crucial role in overcoming Bitcoin’s longstanding obstacles. With a potential mainnet launch on the horizon, keeping an eye on PlutoChain might be worthwhile to see if it gains significant traction.

American venture capitalist Andreessen Horowitz has revealed plans to withdraw its crypto investments in the United Kingdom, opting to capitalize on burgeoning opportunities in the United States instead. Trump’s vow to transform the US into a crypto capital, coupled with his recent crypto-focused executive orders, has significantly boosted the community’s sentiment. Institutional investments, such as those from Andreessen Horowitz, further bolster the community’s confidence, solidifying the country’s status as a global digital asset hub. Andreessen Horowitz To Explore US Crypto Market According to a recent report , venture capitalist firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) is planning to downsize its UK crypto operations, shifting its focus towards the US. People familiar with the matter revealed that the firm has taken the initiative to explore the US crypto economy. However, the venture capitalist hasn’t commented on the matter. Significantly, Andreessen Horowitz’s decision to concentrate more on the US crypto space is largely influenced by Donald Trump’s crypto policies . Following Trump’s re-election, the firm informed business leaders and government officials that it plans to reduce its investment commitments and presence in the UK. US Regulators’ Crypto Crackdown And a16z’s UK Shift Notably, Andreessen Horowitz entered the UK crypto market in 2023, opening investments in London. Making a high-profile entry, the platform’s crypto investments head, Chris Dixon, stated, “London is a major financial hub, it’s a major tech hub, and frankly, it’s a very attractive place for people to live.” A16z’s earlier focus shift to the UK marked the firm’s first expansion outside the US. The move followed the US regulators’ stringent regulations over the crypto industry, especially after the FTX exchange debacle in November 2022. When the venture capitalist started its crypto journey in London, the then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak welcomed them, stating that the team’s arrival marked a “testament to our [their] world-class universities and talent and our [their] strong competitive business environment.” At the time, the platform invested in multiple crypto companies in the UK, including Arweave, Aztec and Improbable. Donald Trump’s Crypto Policies Attract Institutional Investors Following his re-election in 2024, Donald Trump made a significant comeback by introducing new crypto policies aimed at reshaping the US crypto landscape. Reiterating his campaign promises, Trump pledged to turn America into a crypto capital. In the latest development, Trump released an executive order to develop a national digital asset stockpile. The initiative aims to foster the growth of cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins while developing a robust regulatory framework. These strategic moves significantly influenced Andreessen Horowitz to shift its focus to the US. US Investor’s Reduced UK Ambitions ‘Not a Big Loss’ Responding to Andreessen Horowitz’s investment withdrawal plans, a UK official stated that the move would not significantly impact the country. The official stated that their UK investments were led remotely from the US, not from a UK office. Reportedly, the company’s partners are still exploring crypto choices in the UK. However, as per the official’s statement, they usually visit from the US instead of being based in the UK. Emphasizing a16z’s little presence in the country, the official stated, “They were never really here.” The post Andreessen Horowitz To Bet On US Crypto Industry Following Trump’s Executive Order appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Blockchain News|Company|a16z|Andreessen Horowitz|Donald Trump Crypto|US Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|AR|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-01-24 17:51:28

The United Daily News reports that Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) plans to submit the draft legislation on virtual asset service providers (VASPs) in June. The bill includes a provision that will give banks the authority to issue stablecoins—crypto assets designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a commodity or currency, or regulated by an algorithm. Bank director Zhuang Yuyuan says the stablecoins circulating in the market, including the dollar-pegged USDC and Tether ( USDT ), are not approved by the authorities. The situation is anticipated to change once the law takes effect as the FSC will have to greenlight all stablecoins issued in Taiwan, along with their issuer and reserve allocations. FSC Chairman Peng Jinlong says banks will jointly manage the stablecoins with the central bank. The FSC is also set to run a trial of crypto custody services with local banks in the first quarter of 2025. Last year, the regulator mandated all crypto-based companies to register by September or face harsh penalties.

39386739,https://blockworks.co/news/thorchain-halts-withdrawals-insolvency,1737741600,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,THORChain halts withdrawals amid $200M insolvency,https://blockworks.co/news/thorchain-halts-withdrawals-insolvency,"Founded in 2018, THORChain is an OG DeFi L1 chain that rose to fame with its innovative cross-chain swaps (THORSwap). Since then, the chain has expanded to offer lending and savings interest accounts. As of earlier today, THORChain withdrawals from its Lending and Savers products have been officially halted. THORSwap and the underlying chain are fine. The halted withdrawals come off the back of the painful decision by THORChain co-founder JP Thor two weeks ago to pause deposits into the Savers and Lending program for a six-to-twelve month period — a decision which was overturned by Thorchain validators. The chain is sitting on about $200 million of BTC and ETH-denominated liabilities that it cannot afford to pay out, at least not without further crashing the price of its native token, RUNE. Wait, why does RUNE enter the picture? THORChain lending works differently to other DeFi money markets like Aave. On THORChain, lent collateral is instantly sold for its native RUNE token, which is then burned after swapping to a borrower’s desired debt asset. When borrowers repay their loan, new RUNE is minted again to repurchase the borrower’s pledged collateral from the market and repay it to borrowers. This effectively places RUNE token holders as the counterparty for each loan. This somewhat roundabout mechanism is nice if you’re bullish RUNE. The mechanism design places RUNE at the center of the value accrual flywheel and increases its demand. The key risk here, however, is that this depends on RUNE outperforming assets like BTC and ETH that it is borrowed against. Simply put, THORChain’s protocol design is long RUNE against BTC and ETH. When RUNE depreciates relative to BTC and ETH, more RUNE needs to be minted at the closure of the loan than the amount of RUNE that was burned initially. This leads us to the unwanted outcome that is happening today: inflationary (and selling) pressure on RUNE rather than the intended effect of deflationary (and buying) pressure. RUNE’s tokenomics is also intertwined with its yield-bearing Savers product. THORChain’s Savers uses a kind of wrapped synthetic asset (called synths ) to allow single-sided asset exposure. Roughly, it works like this: A user deposits one BTC. THORChain sells half the BTC for RUNE, and adds the BTC-RUNE pair to a liquidity pool. The user receives synthetic BTC, which can be staked for yield (accruing from swap fees and liquidity rewards) without the risk of impermanent loss. When the user chooses to withdraw, THORChain sells the previously bought RUNE to form one BTC, which is then returned to the user. Note the similar “long RUNE, short BTC and ETH” dynamic at play here. This design protects against impermanent losses for LPs, but it also means LPs are taking a leveraged long on RUNE. Thus, RUNE’s underperformance creates the same kind of downward spiral consequences for Savers, just as it did for its lending product. The chart below shows the rate of RUNE mints far exceeding the rate of RUNE burn: Source: Thorcharts It’s worth reiterating that THORSwap, the original use case of THORChain, is fine. It’s still swapping about $50-60 billion in weekly trading volumes, and generated about $700k in fees over the past week. Source: Thorcharts The RUNE token, however, is down 44% on the week, which is not fine. It’s the asset that needs to be sold to repay borrowers wanting to close their loans, or savers wanting to withdraw, but doing so would accelerate the crash of RUNE’s price, which in turn leads to deeper insolvency. Osmosis co-founder Sunny Aggarwal said of the THORChain debacle: “The situation unfolding with THORChain is eerily similar to what happened with Terra/Luna implosion in 2022, where the protocol’s solvency was too heavily dependent on the price performance of the native token.” Next steps? THORChain’s co-founder suggests using protocol revenue and incentives from its sister company Rujira (previously Kujira) to make lenders whole over a 2-3 month timeframe while everything is on pause mode. If $RUNE hits $2.50 I will be recommending to every node I delegate with to Pause Lending via Node Mimir. 1) Pause lending 2) Tokenise positions on App Layer asap (with maybe even $RUJI incentives) 3) 10% System Income into payback fund to accumulate RUNE to fund payouts 4)… — JP.THOR | ACEL (@jpthor) January 23, 2025 “It’s uncertain whether lenders can be fully compensated. Some have suggested that the shortfall could be covered by protocol fees collected over time. But this overlooks an important point: the bulk of THORChain’s liquidity comes from its lending and savers platform, ThorFi. So it doesn’t make sense to consider THORChain and ThorFi as separate entities,” Aggarwal told Blockworks.

The move, encapsulated in the newly issued SAB 122, is poised to serve as a more substantial catalyst for Bitcoin’s price dynamics than the anticipated US Bitcoin Reserve (SBR), according to several industry experts. Implications For Bitcoin Originally enacted in 2022, SAB 121 mandated that banks classify customer-held cryptocurrencies as liabilities on their balance sheets. This classification significantly increased the operational costs and complexities for financial institutions, effectively deterring them from offering crypto-related services. Thus, the requirement acted as a barrier, limiting the integration of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into mainstream banking operations. Related Reading: Bitcoin Capital Inflows See Notable Slowdown, But Is This A Worry? The withdrawal of SAB 121 through SAB 122 effectively removes this accounting impediment. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce lauded the decision on social media, stating, “Bye, bye SAB 121! It’s not been fun: http://SEC.gov | Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 122.” The Bitcoin community has responded favorably to the SEC’s decision. Andrew Parish, founder of x3, emphasized the significance of SAB 122 on X, asserting, “Rescinding of SAB 121 is a bigger catalyst for Bitcoin than the SBR. Bookmark this post.” Similarly, Fred Krueger, founder of Troop, highlighted the broader market implications, noting, “SAB 122 is extremely good for Bitcoin. More significant than the Bitcoin Reserve, which is also coming. Now watch the Banks start accumulating.” Vijay Boyapati, an Ex-Google engineer and the author of The Bullish Case for Bitcoin, further elaborated on the transformative potential of the SEC’s action, stating, “It really is hard to emphasize how huge a sea change we’re witnessing. We went from the worst conceivable anti-Bitcoin, anti-innovation, anti-growth, anti-business administration to the most friendly Bitcoin administration you could hope for. This is 100% not priced in.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Aims For $150,000-$170,000 With Wave Formation, Here Are The Details Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, succinctly captured the market sentiment with his tweet: “SAB 121 has been rescinded, allowing banks to custody Bitcoin. 🚀” This aligns with Saylor’s previously outlined tgree catalysts for Bitcoin reaching $1 million per coin, where the facilitation of traditional bank custody stood as last open m factor. The regulatory easing is expected to catalyze increased institutional participation in the BTC and crypto market. Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America—the second-largest US bank by assets—addressed the potential for broader crypto adoption during an interview with CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Moynihan stated, “If the rules come in and make it a real thing that you can actually do business with, you’ll find that the banking system will come in hard on the transactional side of it.” This statement aligns with the SEC’s latest directive, indicating that banks are now more likely to develop and offer crypto services, including custody solutions, which were previously constrained under SAB 121. The removal of these regulatory hurdles is anticipated to enhance the liquidity and accessibility of Bitcoin, potentially driving a new wave of demand similar to the spot ETFs in January last year. At press time, BTC traded at $105,466.

Most concerningly, it’s not mentioned in the portion of the document that addresses the potential for the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets (also established via the EO) to create a “stockpile” of digital assets. Here’s exactly how it reads: “The Working Group shall evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile and propose criteria for establishing such a stockpile, potentially derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts.” Bitcoin is one of 17 digital assets the Federal Government has seized. ""stockpile"" is jargon that means holding what they have, but not necessarily buying anything according to @arkham , here's all the coins that the USG holds over $1m pic.twitter.com/CtLEuP5utA — Alex Thorn (@intangiblecoins) January 23, 2025 The idea that the government would hold onto the 16 other crypto assets the government is holding is both silly and pointless, as none of those other assets were designed to be a store of value, and a chunk of them are just digital versions of the ever-debasing U.S. dollar. In other words, there’s no reason for the U.S. to stockpile digital assets that are perpetually losing value versus bitcoin. Without even getting into the features that differentiate bitcoin from the other assets on the list above — like its hard-coded perfect scarcity or its network’s level of decentralization — one needs to only take note of the fact that no digital asset has ever made subsequent highs versus bitcoin in consecutive bull markets to understand why it makes sense to only hold bitcoin. I mean, even someone whose company evaluates shitcoins for a living agrees: I didn’t donate $12 million to Kamala or cost the GOP three additional Senate seats like Ripple did. But I’m still gonna try to help @realDonaldTrump and team understand why XRP is the poster child for why we shouldn’t have a national crypto reserve. Bitcoin Reserve or nothing. — Ryan Selkis (d/acc) 🇺🇸 (@twobitidiot) January 24, 2025 So, please President Trump, beef up the bitcoin stockpile by swapping the 16 other digital assets you’re holding for bitcoin, and let’s call it a day. Surely, you’ve seen how well the bitcoin-only approach has worked out for President Bukele , with whom you spoke just the other day.

These coins have thrived on the enthusiasm of their communities and the viral power of memes, maintaining their popularity in the crypto world. Yet, as the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, Lightchain AI , a blockchain venture infused with artificial intelligence, is emerging as a formidable rival. With its cutting-edge capabilities and increasing market traction, Lightchain AI is set to challenge DOGE and SHIB's stronghold. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu - The Strength and Struggles of Meme Coins Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, two popular meme coins, have made a significant impact in the digital currency arena. Launched in 2013 as a parody of Bitcoin, Dogecoin features the Shiba Inu dog from the Doge meme and has amassed a devoted following. Shiba Inu, which debuted in 2020, brands itself as the ""Dogecoin killer,"" aspiring to surpass Dogecoin in popularity. Both coins have seen considerable growth, with Dogecoin's market cap recently hitting $23.3 billion, while Shiba Inu's stands at $10.2 billion. Despite their humorous origins, these coins face challenges such as high volatility and speculative trading, largely driven by social media buzz and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. Their value is more dependent on community involvement and trends rather than practical utility, raising questions about their long-term stability in the rapidly evolving crypto industry. Lightchain AI: A New Player Revolutionizing the Scene Lightchain AI is shaking up the cryptocurrency market by merging advanced AI with blockchain technology, providing practical solutions for developers, businesses, and investors. In contrast to meme coins like DOGE and SHIB, which rely on community hype, Lightchain AI delivers decentralized AI processes for functions such as data analysis, predictive modeling, and automation. Its platform empowers creators and developers to innovate and monetize their projects through features like the AI-driven Memecoin Launchpad, nurturing a vibrant creative ecosystem. Moreover, Lightchain AI's scalable framework allows for high transaction throughput and effectively manages complex tasks, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. By marrying practicality with cutting-edge innovation, Lightchain AI positions itself as a compelling alternative to speculative digital assets, promoting substantial progress in the blockchain sector. The Future Landscape of Crypto Innovations While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have undeniably left their mark on the crypto space, their dominance might be waning. Lightchain AI's novel strategy, real-world applications, and solid market momentum position it as a formidable contender. For those investors looking beyond meme-based assets, Lightchain AI offers an appealing blend of technological advancement and growth prospects. As the crypto market continues to change, this emerging player could redefine success in the blockchain arena. Additionally, with the advent of new technologies and strategies such as Lightchain AI , we can expect to see more diversification and innovation within the cryptocurrency sector. This evolution will not only drive greater mainstream acceptance but also expand the horizons of blockchain technology's potential. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

The movement that started with Helium and has spread to numerous categories, including mapping and car data, this year is now spreading to hospitality. The initiative shows how quickly DePINs — or decentralized networks of physical infrastructure — are becoming mainstream. The fast food and hospitality industry, often associated with consistency and efficiency, is quietly upgrading as decentralized technologies make their way into the mainstream. The adoption of DePIN by major franchises like Taco Bell and KFC signals a shift in how these businesses operate and engage with technology. At the core of this transformation is the integration of DePIN devices — sensors, routers, and other physical infrastructure — powered by blockchain and token-based incentives. These networks enable businesses to contribute to shared ecosystems while gaining real-time operational insights and being rewarded for their participation. It’s a forward-thinking approach that combines cutting-edge technology with the practical needs of fast-food and hospitality businesses, paving the way for greater efficiency, sustainability and customer satisfaction. With DePIN, the industry is embracing a strategic evolution — one that reflects the growing potential of decentralized technologies to enhance traditional models while creating new opportunities for growth. For franchisees, the potential benefits of DePIN are significant. By integrating DePIN devices into their operations, they can unlock a wealth of opportunities: Enhanced operational efficiency: DePIN devices, such as air quality sensors from Ambient Network , can provide real-time data on environmental conditions. This information can be used to optimize HVAC systems, improve indoor air quality, and reduce energy consumption. Increased customer satisfaction: By leveraging DePIN-powered solutions, franchises can offer a more personalized and convenient customer experience. For instance, indoor cell site deployments from Helium Mobile or XNET can provide reliable connectivity, while blockchain-based supply chain management can ensure product quality and freshness. A case study: the power of collaboration A prime example of DePIN's impact on the franchise industry is the partnership between major fast-food chains and Ambient Network , the largest decentralized air quality network on Solana. By deploying air quality sensors across hundreds of stores, from coast to coast, these franchises are not only improving air quality for their customers but also contributing to a cleaner environment. Moreover, they are generating valuable data insights that can be used to optimize operations and reduce costs. “With the growing maturity of tokens and decentralized technologies, we’re seeing a shift in how we can use these assets within our stores and properties,” explains Pushpak Patel, Founding Principal at CMG Companies , one of the largest operators of KFC, Taco Bell, Sonic, Little Caesars, Rent-A-Center, and Ace Hardware franchises in the US. “By installing 1,000 DePIN devices from Ambient Network, we’re enhancing our ability to gather operational insights across our locations. Having air quality sensors installed doesn’t just provide real-time conditions, both outdoor and indoor — it also enables us to participate in demand-response programs. And with the strategic density of our locations, we can help unlock greater coverage for the network, which in turn generates additional data insights. This is a game-changer.” Franchisees may partner with third parties to deploy and manage the infrastructure, or they can manage the devices in-house to improve operational efficiency with the devices and potentially generate an excellent return on investment. With Helium, these deployer participants are seeing ROI from a few dollars to tens of dollars per day based on factors like location, miner density and network demand. Parami Investors , one of the largest deployers of Helium and Ambient devices in North America, has also been bullish on DePIN opportunities for franchise locations. We are clearly seeing greater adoption by retailers and hospitality providers to adopt and deploy decentralized solutions such as Helium and Ambient. Ambient is now deployed across highly dense commercial shopping and dining centers like the Japanese Village Plaza in Los Angeles’ Little Tokyo district, hotels like the Best Western in Las Vegas and fast food chains like Taco Bell, KFC and Five Guys. Revolutions start on the street with franchisees pushing the envelope for wider corporate adoption. The road ahead As DePIN technology continues to mature, we can expect to see even more innovative applications in the franchise industry. From decentralized energy grids like Powerledger and community-powered solar from Glow , to blockchain-based loyalty programs from Hang , the possibilities are endless. For fast food retailers and franchisees, deploying DePIN devices is not just a technological trend — it’s an investment in a more efficient, profitable, and sustainable future. From generating passive income to collecting valuable data and optimizing operations, the benefits are clear. As the technology continues to evolve, franchisees and other small businesses will find even more ways to leverage DePIN devices to improve both the customer experience and their bottom line. Decentralized solutions are building an ecosystem that benefits everyone, driving participation through incentives. And DePIN devices are a key part of that vision. By embracing these new technologies, franchisees are setting themselves up for long-term success, ensuring that they remain competitive in an ever-changing market.",Opinion|DePIN,EN,0,0,TECHNOLOGY|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-24 18:15:36

Analyst Javon Marks provided insights into XRP’s current price action and why it could record this parabolic rally. XRP Price Targets $10 Following Crucial Breakout In an X post, crypto analyst Javon Marks indicated that the XRP price is targeting a rally to $10 following a crucial breakout. According to Marks, XRP’s 9-hour chart looks to have displayed another breakout. He added that this could spark a continuation towards the $10 levels. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that XRP was breaking out of a bull pennant at the $3.18 resistance level. The chart also showed that XRP witnessed a significant rally the last time it broke out from this bull pennant towards the end of last year. Based on technical analysis, XRP looks to boast a very bullish outlook, which could spark massive rallies for the crypto. Analyst Mikybull Crypto recently predicted that Ripple’s native coin could record a price surge to $8 . He explained that this could happen because of the current bullish fundamentals. In a more recent X post, the analyst reaffirmed his bullish stance for XRP. He shared an accompanying chart that showed that the coin was ready for a massive move to the upside. Analyzing The XRP/BTC Chart Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto provided an in-depth XRP price chart analysis against its Bitcoin pair. While analyzing the weekly chart, he noted that Ripple’s native crypto is less than three days away from the weekly close. The analyst remarked that a full-body candle close above the blue line he highlighted on the chart could lead to a parabolic rally for XRP. He went on to analyze the 3-day chart, noting that all three previous body candles closed above the blue line, indicating strong bullish momentum. He added that the XRP price is also recording long-legged candles, which typically suggest bullish sentiment in the market. These long-legged candles are said to signify that the bulls are scooping up opportunities and winning the struggle against the bears. On the 12-hour time frame, Egrag Crypto stated that XRP is forming a descending channel against the Bitcoin price , which he noted is typically bullish. The analyst added that a breakout is likely, with the odds favoring an upward movement. In line with this, the analyst highlighted XRP price breakout scenarios. In the case of an upside breakout, he remarked that a move above the upper trendline could lead to significant gains. An upside breakout looks more likely as Egrag Crypto noted that approximately 70% of the time, descending channels break to the upside. Meanwhile, in the case of a downside breakout, the analyst warned that XRP falling below the lower trendline may trigger a downward trend. He told market participants to watch for increased trading volume, often accompanying breakouts. According to him, around 30% of the time, the price breaks to the downside in such cases. What To Watch Next For Ripple’s Native Crypto In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades highlighted the next levels to watch for the XRP price. She mentioned the $3.24 price level, noting that this critical .118 level failed to hold, and it’s an important price to reclaim. The second price she highlighted is $3.32, noting that the top trendline would likely be resistance over the weekend. To confirm the move to the wave 5 target at $3.80, CasiTrades stated that the XRP price needs a clean break above $3.32 with strong momentum to flip this level into support. In the meantime, XRP continues to consolidate within the triangle she highlighted on her chart. The crypto analyst remarked that the crypto is respecting the triangle consolidation pattern and is holding firm.

The US crypto market is abuzz with optimism after Trump’s crypto executive order added to a series of pro-crypto developments since his election victory and inauguration.

Shiba looks primed for a run-up, but 1Fuel’s record-breaking $1.5 million presale funds cut short this excitement. Shiba’s 300% return not met with optimism The memecoin market has soared in recent months, but SHIB has had no part in it. New memes have gotten traders’ attention, as the presidential meme coins launched at the start of 2025. The SHIB price has declined over the past month, shedding about 40% of its value. However, a broader perspective reveals that the cryptocurrency has surged by almost 300% in the last 12 months. The recent bear run in the currency appears short-lived as Shiba Inu is now poised for a bull run, with a target price of $0.00007. This target represents a 350% increase from its current price. In addition to its price dynamics, significant investment activities from major whales suggest an upcoming accumulation period in anticipation of this upward trend for Shiba Inu. Coupled with development moves like the launch of the TREAT token and the much-anticipated launch of the SHI stablecoin, Shiba looks to be primed for a big run While these developments have been the positive news Shiba Inu investors have been eager to hear, the emergence of a new token, 1Fuel, has been capturing headlines.

After reaching a significant milestone of $1,500,000 from over 150 million tokens, 1Fuel has demonstrated a strong performance, marking it the leading presale of 2025. The success of the first two presales has left many in awe, and crypto analysts are now predicting returns of 20-40 times the investment by the end of the third presale. This outcome would place 1Fuel in an exclusive class of top gainers for the year. Even established crypto projects are experiencing a shift as investors withdraw their funds to participate in what they expect to be a lucrative rally. How is 1Fuel different? One major issue with blockchain technology is interoperability. The need for cross-chain transactions has never been more critical, and a user-friendly solution is highly anticipated. 1Fuel addresses this challenge with a one-click solution that facilitates cross-chain transactions effortlessly. It simplifies the backend complexities, allowing users to manage multiple cryptocurrencies in one place. Beyond its ease of use, 1Fuel incorporates sophisticated security measures, such as Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs), ensuring secure and atomic transaction processes. Additionally, 1Fuel leverages artificial intelligence to automate its complex operations, reduce transaction costs, and enhance portfolio management.

WLD, which Altman started, initially rose and then cooled. Let’s explore why the Worldcoin token will likely rebound and 5x this year. Worldcoin Price Reacts To Elon Musk and Sam Altman Jibes The WLD token jumped this week after Donald Trump unveiled the Stargate AI project. This deal, which involves firms like OpenAI, Oracle, and Softbank, will invest $500 billion in US AI infrastructure . Elon Musk criticized the deal, noting that it did not have $500 billion in committed fund. OpenAI’s Sam Altman responded and questioned Musk’s patriotism. These jabs are notable for Worldcoin because it is a project that Altman started. WLD To Benefit From AI Investments Worldcoin price may benefit from the ongoing investments in the artificial intelligence industry. In addition to the Stargate, there were other large AI deals this week. Google invested $1 billion in Anthropic, two weeks after it raised more cash at a $60 billion valuation. Elon Musk’s xAI also raised $6 billion at a $40 billion valuation. Worldcoin is seen as an AI crypto because of its features like World ID and the World Chain. Altman hopes that its data will be used in training more advanced AI models. Other AI tokens that may benefit from this theme are Virtuals Protocol and ai16z. Worldcoin Price Analysis Points To A Bottom The daily chart shows that the WLD price has lagged behind most coins in the past few months despite the AI hype. It remains about 81% below its highest level in 2024. Its attempts to recover found a substantial resistance at $4.1592. On the positive side, Worldcoin price has formed a triple-bottom chart pattern whose neckline is at $4.1592. This pattern is made up of three lower swings where an asset struggles to move below. The value of WLD is attempting to cross the 50-day moving average, while the MACD indicator has formed a bullish divergence pattern. Worldcoin Price WLD Price Targets Therefore, a clear break above the triple-bottom’s neckline at $4.15 will validate the thesis and lead to more gains. The next level to watch will be the resistance at $6.55, where it failed to rise above in May last year. Worldcoin price will then jump to last year’s high of $12, which is about 5x from the current level. This is in line with many other altcoins like XRP and Solana have risen and retested their 2024 highs. A drop below the key support at $1.30 will invalidate the bullish view.

In an interview with Fox Business, the AI and crypto czar spoke on the growing complexity of classifying digital assets, categorizing the two as collectibles. Digital Asset Classification “When you talk about digital assets, it could mean many things… you’re talking about a vast area of innovation,” Sacks stated in the interview . He explained that virtual assets cover a broad spectrum, including securities and commodities, placing NFTs and meme coins in the collectible category. This classification could influence the way the two are perceived, shifting the focus from their volatility to their potential as items of cultural and commemorative significance. Sacks elaborated on this idea, comparing such assets to traditional memorabilia. Speaking on the Solana-based Official Trump (TRUMP) meme coin, he said: “I think the Trump coin is a collectible. It’s like a baseball card or a stamp. People buy it because they want to commemorate something.” However, he clarified that his statements should not be interpreted as a regulatory position. NFT and Meme Coin Legitimacy Debate The legitimacy of non-fungible tokens and meme coins is still a hot topic. Last August, NFT marketplace OpenSea received a Wells notice from the SEC over claims that such assets on its platform might be regarded as unregistered securities. In December, the gaming-focused NFT project Cyberkongz was sent a similar warning from the regulator. This debate has intensified with the recent launches of the official TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a crypto skeptic, has urged federal regulators and the Office of Government Ethics to investigate the TRUMP meme coin. In a January 22 letter, she alleged it had enriched the President and provided a means for crypto funds to flow to him. At a recent press briefing, Trump downplayed the situation by saying he did not know whether he had benefited financially from the project and claimed to have no knowledge of the coin’s value. The introduction of these tokens also caused some constitutional compliance concerns, with Zack Guzman from Coinage noting that while the emoluments clause prohibits presidents from profiting from their office, meme coins challenge these existing rules. Meanwhile, billionaire investor Mark Cuban previously dismissed the Trump project as a gamble, suggesting it could harm the crypto industry’s reputation, especially if proper regulations were not in place. Similarly, former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan described such tokens as speculative assets, famously calling them a “zero-sum lottery.” The post Crypto Czar Classifies NFTs and Meme Coins as Collectibles appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Meme coins|NFT|Regulations|United States,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-01-24 18:30:18

The White House issued an executive order on digital assets , calling for a friendly approach to crypto across the administration and the creation of a ""digital asset stockpile"" (which may, or may not be, a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve). Regulatory editors Nik De and Jesse Hamilton were all over the news, as usual. The SEC withdrew a controversial crypto accounting rule , started a crypto taskforce headed by Hester Peirce (aka “Crypto Mom”), and named crypto-friendly Commissioner Mark Uyeda as acting chair. Senator Cynthia Lummis, arguably crypto's most loyal friend in Congress, was named to head the Senate Banking Committee's new digital assets panel , Hamilton also reported. We dissected the fallout from the (very) controversial memecoins dropped by the Trump family on the eve of Monday’s swearing in. CoinDesk’s Shaurya Malwa reported that 60 Solana Whales made off with at least $10 million each (many others gained a lot less). Reporting from Tom Carreras on Monday showed that the paper wealth generated by these surprise tokens was, frankly, staggering, even absurd. Still the memecoins were a great success, encouraging filings for memecoin ETFs , Helene Braun reported. Helene also broke the story about how CME leaked information about XRP and SOL futures ETFs by mistake , which sank those tokens and weighed on the broader market . Ross Ulbricht, who created Silk Road about 12 years ago, educating thousands on bitcoin for the first time, went free after serving ten years in prison. His freedom was a key promise of the Trump team on crypto. Sam Reynolds had the news. And the news kept on coming.

Tron (TRX) Poised for 30% Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The overall cryptocurrency market seems to be recovering. Amid this, TRX, the native token of the Tron blockchain, is poised for massive upside momentum. The reason for this positive outlook is its bullish price action and the rising interest of traders in the altcoin, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm CoinGlass. TRX’s Bullish On-Chain Metrics According to CoinGlass , TRX’s long/short ratio currently stands at 1.15, indicating strong bullish sentiment among traders. The data further reveals that 53.50% of top traders hold long positions, while 46.50% hold short positions. Source: Coinglass Additionally, TRX’s rising open interest (OI) has increased by 15% in the past 24 hours and 7.9% in the past four hours. The rising OI hints at increasing participation from intraday traders, further supporting the bullish outlook. Tron (TRX) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, TRX has confirmed a breakout from its bullish double-bottom price action pattern and has further breached a crucial trendline it had been facing since December 2024. Following this breakout, TRX sentiment has completely shifted from a downtrend to an uptrend. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if TRX sustains itself above the $0.24 level, it could soar by 30% to reach the $0.35 level in the coming days. However, the altcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 55, indicating that TRX is still in a zone where it could rally significantly. With bullish sentiment dominating both on-chain and technical indicators, TRX appears well-positioned for a significant upward move in the short term. Current Price Momentum TRX is currently trading near $0.259 and has experienced a price surge of over 4.15% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume increased by 5% and appears to be gradually rising, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|TRX|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-24 19:04:39

McGlone says that gold has been outperforming the markets, suggesting that investors are moving their wealth into the precious metal as the preferred safe haven asset amid concerns of worsening macroeconomic conditions. “‘Number must go up’ risks: Bitcoin and beta’s problem versus gold: it may not be a good sign for risk assets that despite substantial competition from Bitcoin, gold beat the record-setting stock market in 2024. Is the metal getting too hot or telling us something? My bias is the latter, especially due to [US President Donald] Trump administration uncertainty and promotion, and the risks of highly speculative digital assets.” Source: Mike McGlone/X McGlone also believes whether Bitcoin can hold $100,000 as support may be the deciding factor in whether the flagship crypto asset will remain in an uptrend. “Bitcoin may need to stay above $100,000, or else. In similar upward trajectories from 2022 nadirs, gold and Bitcoin could be running into resistance thresholds, and what might matter most is the crypto versus $100,000. If Bitcoin backs down, it would suggest similar for the stock market, with implications for deflation, lower bond yields and tailwinds for gold.” Source: Mike McGlone/X Lastly, McGlone notes how the value of the US stock market capitalization and Bitcoin versus the US’s gross domestic product (GDP) is much higher than when Trump first took office in 2017, indicating market peaks may be near. “Selling when they’re yelling `risk’: the juxtaposition of elevated US equities and Bitcoin versus crude oil at the start of 2025 versus 2017 may emphasize risks of excess enthusiasm. When President Trump first took office eight years ago, US stock market capitalization to GDP was closer to 1.2x, and the crypto was at about $1,000. Fast forward to 2025 and stocks are about 2.2x GDP, and Bitcoin has risen 100x to $100,000.” Source: Mike McGlone/X Bitcoin is trading for $106,274 at time of writing.

Shiba Inu loses steam as Rexas Finance emerges with real-world asset tokenization and promises massive potential returns. Table of Contents SHIB forecast and updates: Whales exit Rexas Finance: A new beginning Why Rexas Finance is a Shiba Inu competitor Conclusion Early investments in developing projects can produce large profits in the crypto market. Although well-known tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB) have had their glory times, a fresh rival has surfaced, ready to have a major influence. Rexas Finance (RXS) is rapidly drawing notice with its real-world asset (RWA) tokenizing system. With its ongoing presale and an ambitious roadmap, Rexas Finance could turn a modest $300 investment into $300,000 by mid-2026. SHIB forecast and updates: Whales exit Shiba Inu has been a household name in the crypto community for some time, but recent statistics imply it is losing appeal. Reflecting a dip of 1.86% in the past 24 hours and of 5.73% over the past week, SHIB is selling at over $0.000021 per token as of January 9, 2025. The token is currently 76.54% below its all-time high of $0.000088. On-chain data emphasizes even more a concerning trend for SHIB. Often called “whales,” bigger investors have begun to pull out of their stakes. Wallets carrying between 10 million and 100 million SHIB have plummeted by 20%; those carrying between $10,000 and $1 million in SHIB have dropped by 16–22%. This enormous sell-off points to declining Shiba Inu confidence; many are cashing out while still able. For those looking for long-term development, SHIB is losing appeal as big investors withdraw and the price continues to drop. Rexas Finance: A new beginning Rexas Finance, though, offers a convincing substitute for SHIB. This project provides a platform allowing users to generate, manage, and trade asset-backed tokens, concentrating on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Rexas Finance is enabling everyone to enter the realm of tokenization by streamlining the difficult asset management procedure. This might be a game changer for sectors including real estate, commodities, and intellectual property. The presale of Rexas Finance, launched in September 2024, has been outstanding. The first stage, valued at $0.03, sold out in three days, indicating great demand among investors. In Stage 11 of its presale, RXS token prices jumped to $0.175, a 483% rise in four months. Big investors are drawn to this fast expansion; Rexas Finance has already raised $37,855,967 by selling 407,031,814 tokens. Rexas Finance is still in its early years; hence, there is much opportunity for development, unlike Shiba Inu, which is already well-known in the meme coin scene. The project’s launch of the RXS coins on tier-1 exchanges in early 2025 could propel the price even higher. Analysts predict that Rexas Finance has the potential for a massive 100,000% increase by mid-2026, taking the price of RXS to $100 per token. You might also like: Rexas Finance the next Shiba Inu: Why $1000 could hit $50000 by mid-2025 Why Rexas Finance is a Shiba Inu competitor There is a chance that Rexas Finance will become a major rival of Shiba Inu. The initiative has moved to build market credibility and confidence. For example, two of the most reliable cryptocurrency tracking sites, CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, feature it. Furthermore, the recent Certik assessment guarantees Rexas Finance’s dependability and security as an investment choice. Rexas Finance has laid a foundation by eschewing venture capitalism. Depending on grassroots support, its network is expanding fast. Rexas Finance is positioned to profit from the rising interest in distributed finance and blockchain technology, emphasizing tokenization and a defined 2025 road map. With the present presale price of $0.175 per token, a $300 investment would buy over 1,714 RXS tokens. Should RXS’s price approach $100 by mid-2026, the investment would be valued at $300,000. This offers a 100,000% return. Conclusion Though Shiba Inu might have been a popular meme coin, its glory days seem to be behind us as whales leave and price losses persist.

Despite the broader market recovery, the token remains down 46% from its all-time high, reflecting significant bearish trends. Investors are questioning whether Fartcoin can rebound or if further declines are inevitable amidst ongoing market volatility. Fartcoin Price Dips 10% Can It Plunge Below $1? Fartcoin price has dropped by 10%, raising questions about whether it could slip below the $1 mark. After an impressive end-of-year rally, the memecoin surged to a peak of $2.61 on January 20, 2025. This marked a 60% increase before a sharp decline triggered concerns about a potential bearish reversal. Despite the dip, FARTCOIN remains 20% higher than its value a month ago. Since December 2024, the price has climbed steadily within an ascending parallel channel. Over the weekend, the AI based meme coins broke out of the channel, initiating a parabolic upward move. However, recent losses have tempered the momentum, pushing the price back by 10%. While uncertainty persists, Fartcoin’s ability to hold above key support levels will determine its future trajectory in the volatile crypto market. However broder crypto market has seen a slight surge with BTC hovering above $106k. FARTCOIN Price Dips as Whale Swaps $1.2M for GOAT Tokens Fartcoin price saw a sharp movement after a whale executed a $1.2 million token swap, trading 902,374 $Fartcoin for 3.07 million $GOAT. The transaction, recorded on the GOAT platform, highlights increasing whale activity in decentralized finance. According to Lookonchain, the unidentified whale made one of the largest swaps in recent hours. The trade signals a trend of significant token migrations among major holders. The GOAT token, a relatively new asset, has been gaining attention amid rising demand. Large swaps like this can influence token prices and liquidity, leading to market speculation. Whales continue to impact decentralized exchanges, often triggering price shifts. As GOAT gains traction, investors are closely watching its performance. A whale swapped all 902,374 $Fartcoin($1.2M) for 3.07M $GOAT 2 hours ago. https://t.co/lw7zNKQ1KT pic.twitter.com/HhwMRJzwd6 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 23, 2025 Fartcoin Price Analysis As of Friday, the FARTCOIN price has seen a decrease, trading at $1.43, signaling potential bearish sentiment in the market. The token has fallen by 10% in the past 24 hours, accompanied by a trading volume of $371 million. The current price sits below the crucial $2 resistance level, showing that the asset is struggling to regain momentum after a recent pullback. Analysts point out the $1 support level as the key area to watch for further declines. Technical indicators hint at further downside risks. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers near 46, below the neutral 50 level, indicating declining buying pressure. The MACD also remains bearish, with the signal line crossing above the MACD line, reflecting weakening momentum. Key Levels to Watch Fartcoin price attempted to break above the $2.00 resistance but failed to hold, leading to a correction. The price is now hovering closer to the $1.40 support level, a key zone to watch. A breakdown below $1.00 could trigger a deeper sell-off. Fartcoin price chart: TradingView Fartcoin’s ability to maintain support at $1 will be crucial for its next move. Market sentiment and whale activity will influence future price action and volatility.

Now, he is turning his attention to leading meme coins such as Panshibi ($SHIBI). Panshibi is currently in its presale stage and is anticipated to offer up to 1,200% returns for early investors in the near future. Could this be the next major player in the crypto arena, or is it simply another passing trend? Floki Inu's New Bullish Signals Amid Market Swings Floki Inu has managed to navigate recent market fluctuations and is now exhibiting new bullish patterns, sparking renewed interest among its supporters. Although Floki Inu had been somewhat overshadowed by other leading meme coins such as BONK and Dogwifhat last year, the team is committed to reclaiming its prominence. The current value of Floki Inu (FLOKI) on CoinMarketCap is approximately $0.000145, marking a 9.2% drop over the last week. Despite this short-term decline, Floki Inu’s market cap remains over a billion dollars, a testament to its strong market position. This solid foothold has led analysts to believe that Floki Inu might soon experience a substantial rally, potentially reaching new peaks and generating excitement among its investors. PEPE Price Forecast: Bull Flag Pattern Suggests Impending Rise Pepe Coin, inspired by the well-known internet meme ""Pepe the Frog,"" is rapidly attracting attention in the cryptocurrency market. Priced at just $0.0000157 currently, it stands as one of the most affordable among the leading meme coins. The recent listings on major exchanges like OKX and Binance have expanded Pepe's market visibility, opening it up to a vast array of new investors. Technical analysis indicates a promising outlook for Pepe Coin. A Bull Flag pattern on the charts suggests a potential price increase to $0.0000375, effectively doubling PEPE's present value. Panshibi ($SHIBI): The Emerging Crypto to Monitor Panshibi ($SHIBI) merges three significant communities—Asia, Pandas, and Memecoins—into a vibrant crypto initiative. Drawing inspiration from the beloved panda, Panshibi seeks to establish itself as one of the leading meme coins by uniting meme aficionados. The project integrates Social-Fi and AI elements, enabling token holders to engage in entertaining challenges, earn rewards, and claim prizes. Panshibi has successfully completed a comprehensive smart contract audit, encountering no issues, which ensures transparency and security for its investors. This commitment to safety fosters confidence in the project. The Panshibi team has a robust strategy for long-term expansion. They have allocated 60% of the tokens for the presale, 15% for rewards, and 10% each for exchanges and marketing. Plans also include introducing staking, NFTs, and supporting panda conservation initiatives. With 15 presale phases, the token price escalates after each stage, encouraging early investment. Once the presale concludes, the $SHIBI token will be listed on Uniswap and several centralized exchanges (CEXs). 2025: An Exciting Year for Meme Coins, with $SHIBI at the Forefront Analysts have high hopes for 2025, predicting it will be a remarkable year for meme coins, driven by positive regulatory developments and a surge in investor interest in altcoins. $SHIBI, in particular, is anticipated to witness substantial growth this year. Currently priced at $0.002, the token is expected to climb 1,200% by the end of the presale, with further projections of a staggering 145,000% increase post-launch, positioning it as one of the most promising investments currently available.

39390135,https://coingape.com/?p=235335,1737746367,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Semler Scientific Announces $85M Offering Amid Bitcoin Accumulation Plans,https://coingape.com/semler-scientific-increases-85m-offering-amid-bitcoin-accumulation-plans/,"Semler Scientific has announced an increase in its convertible senior notes offering to $85 million from the previously planned $75 million. The company also granted initial purchasers the option to buy an additional $15 million in notes. This move aligns with its corporate strategy, which includes further investment in Bitcoin. Semler Scientific Announces $85M Private Offering In a press release , Semler Scientific announced that it had priced its private offering of $85 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25% convertible senior notes due 2030. The offering is made in reliance on the exemption provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, which permits the offer of securities to certain qualified institutional buyers. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, the transaction is anticipated to be completed on January 28, 2025. The notes are not secured, and the interest will be compounded at a rate of 4.25% per annum and will be paid on the first of February and the first of August of every year, starting from August 1, 2025. The conversion rate at the commencement of the offering is 13.0826 shares per $1,000 principal amount, which implies a conversion price of $76.44 per share. This is a 25% premium over the last reported stock price on January 23, as reported at the Nasdaq stock exchange. Semler Scientific can elect to receive the consideration in cash, stock, or a combination of both after the conversion. The notes are not redeemable by the company before August 4, 2028. From this date, redemption is allowed if the common stock of Semler Scientific is trading at not less than 130% of the conversion price for a particular period. If a “fundamental change” occurs, for example, a merger or acquisition, noteholders are entitled to put their notes to the company and compel it to repurchase the notes at their face value plus interest. Capped Call Transactions and Potential Market Effects To limit the dilutive impact of note conversions, Semler Scientific used capped call transactions with financial institutions. These transactions establish a cap price of $107.01 per share, which is 75% above the last trading price of the stock on the 23rd of January 2025. The company also anticipates that the financial institutions involved will offset their exposure by acquiring and liquidating Semler Scientific shares. As a consequence, these activities may affect the price of the stock before and after the transaction. If the option held by initial purchasers to purchase more notes is exercised, Semler Scientific anticipates that it will undertake further capped call transactions. Semler Scientific Bitcoin Investment Strategy Semler Scientific expects to receive gross proceeds of approximately $89.0 million in this offering, with net proceeds of approximately $81.4 million, or $95.8 million, if the additional $15 million option is exercised. The company will spend $6.6 million on the capped call options, and the rest of the money will be spent on corporate purposes, such as buying more Bitcoin. This move comes after the company announced plans to raise $75 million to expand its Bitcoin strategy as part of its overall financial approach. The company has expressed its focus on digital assets, following the trend of corporations adopting Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Bitcoin Market Developments and Broader Context Semler Scientific’s decision follows a trend that has seen institutional investors and governments express interest in Bitcoin. The US government is said to be looking into the possibility of holding a Bitcoin reserve, with Senator Cynthia Lummis in charge of the Senate’s Digital Assets Subcommittee . During the World Economic Forum, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink met with sovereign wealth fund managers to discuss Bitcoin investment approaches. Fink remarked that the Bitcoin price could reach as high as $700,000 if these fund managers allocate 2% to 5% of their portfolios in Bitcoin.

Stereotypes don’t just come into being baselessly, there is a kernel of truth to them, otherwise they would not have spread virally as an idea in the first place. But they, as well as the worldviews they espouse, are also exaggerated beyond that kernel. Bitcoin is currently stuck in a game of tug of war between the naive idealists and the jaded cynics. On one hand, the idealists argue that we already won. We don’t have to do anything, Bitcoin is magically guaranteed success. It’s already going to take over the world, everyone is going to own it, it is the best store of value ever. That’s all it needs to win and succeed. No improvements needed. On the other hand, the cynics argue that we’ve lost, or are going to. That short of a total overhaul changing Bitcoin drastically, there is no way Bitcoin can succeed in the world. It will become captured and useless. “Who knows where to start?” is the response to asking for what improvements are needed. Both of these extremes dominating the public dialogue sweeps attention away from two important things, the reality of what can already be done with what we have, and how substantially that reality can be expanded with even very small and simple improvements. As things stand right now, Bitcoin to have any degree of censorship resistance and privacy for a big portion of the world would depend on custodians. The best we can do in that regard is lots of small and local chaumian ecash mints, but to run an ecash mint requires running a Lightning node. Lightning is complicated, and screwing up and losing the most recent channel state can lose all of your money. The design allows your counterparty to steal all of your funds if you try to use an old channel state after updating it. CTV + CSFS would give us LN-Symmetry, a type of Lightning channel giving a new way for channels to work. Instead of using an old state allowing the other party to take all your money, LN-Symmetry channels would allow them to just “cut through” all the intermediary states and spend your old state into the most recent one on-chain, ensuring everyone gets the correct amount of money. That one small change (and that is by no means all CTV + CSFS enables) would radically change the landscape of who would be capable and willing to run a local ecash mint. The risk of losing everyone’s money through incompetence would almost disappear. This one small new functionality would heavily improve Bitcoin’s odds of staying private and censorship resistant. Does it scale self custody to the whole world? No. Does it drastically improve Bitcoin’s value despite store of value maximalists’ claim improvement isn’t needed or possible? Absolutely. Bitcoiners need to stop focusing solely on the extremes and poles when it comes to possibility in this space, there is a wide open field mostly unexplored between them. If we really want to know our odds of success, the limits of what we actually can and can't do with Bitcoin, then we need to explore that field. This article is a Take .

Trump’s Latest Meme Coin Achieves a 1,000% Increase The Official Trump coin made its debut late Friday. Its launch was publicized on President Trump’s X and Truth Social accounts during the Crypto Ball, a gathering celebrating his White House return, organized by crypto leaders in Washington, D.C. Starting at $6.24, the coin surged over 1,000% to reach $75.35 within just 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Created as a representation of support for Trump’s principles, it carries a disclaimer stating it is not meant for investment or as a security. Initially, 200 million coins are available — expected to expand to 1 billion over three years — with only 10% open to the public, while 80% is allocated for creators and Trump’s CIC Digital affiliate.

The crypto industry is going full-throttle on Trump mania, but at least one family member isn’t happy with the latest development, particularly the release of the $IVANKA coin. Related Reading: TRUMP Token Tops XRP In Trading Volume Despite Sharp Decline In a post on Twitter/X, Ivanka Trump blasted the news of the new crypto project, calling it a “fake crypto coin” currently being promoted without her consent. The presidential daughter stated that she’s not connected with the project and is currently working with her legal team over the unauthorized use of her name in marketing the crypto. This isn’t the first time a Trump-themed coin became available in the market. Just days before taking office, Trump advertised a meme coin, followed by the launch of the $MELANIA coin. Ivanka Publicly Denies Any Link With $IVANKA Crypto Project On Thursday, the presidential daughter publicly denied any links to a new crypto meme coin that’s marketed under her name. In a Twitter/X post that has generated over 1.2 million impressions, Ivanka issued a strong warning and reminder to consumers against this suspicious crypto project. It has come to my attention that a fake crypto coin called “Ivanka Trump” or “$IVANKA” is being promoted without my consent or approval. To be clear: I have no involvement with this coin. This fake coin risks deceiving consumers and defrauding them of their hard-earned money,… — Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) January 23, 2025 Ivanka shared that she had no connection with the project and criticized the developers for using her likeness and name without approval, calling it a violation of her rights. She added that her legal team is taking this issue seriously and plans to sue over misuse of identity. The presidential daughter added that the crypto project is not just unacceptable but also deceptive and exploitative. Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, held important positions in the first Trump administration. However, the couple seems to enjoy their time on the sidelines. Controversy Swirls Around The New Coin Releases Trump-themed meme coins are some of the most popularly traded tokens in the market today. However, their release and marketing were controversial. On January 17th, US President Donald Trump launched the Official Trump token on the Solana blockchain. Then, after two days, the First Lady also announced her coin, the “Melania Coin”, supported by the Solana blockchain. President Trump used Truth Social to announce his crypto coin, encouraging the community to join the celebration and the special Trump Community. Days after its launch, the Trump token hit an all-time high of $75, pushing the project’s market cap to $15 billion. However, the enthusiasm on Trump’s coin immediately fizzled, trading at the $37 level, reflecting a 50% drop. Also, the Melania meme coin suffered the same fate, plunging by 80%, and it’s now trading at $2.8.

THORChain, a decentralized cross-chain liquidity protocol, has paused its network operations due to a significant debt crisis amounting to nearly $200 million. This move has drawn parallels to the 2022 collapse of Terra/Luna, with Sunny Aggarwal, Co-Founder of Osmosis, a decentralized exchange in the Cosmos ( ATOM ) ecosystem, commented on the situation to crypto.news. “The situation unfolding with THORChain is eerily similar to what happened with Terra/Luna implosion in 2022, where the protocol’s solvency was too heavily dependent on the price performance of the native token,” Aggarwal said. THORChain’s design inherently positions it as reflexively long on its native token, RUNE. This means the protocol’s solvency is contingent upon RUNE’s price outperforming assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), which are used as collateral. Recent market trends have not favored RUNE ( RUNE ), leading to financial instability.

In May 2022, Terra, the third-largest cryptocurrency ecosystem at the time, collapsed within three days, wiping out $50 billion in valuation. Aggarwal further stated that “it’s uncertain whether lenders can be fully compensated. Some have suggested that the shortfall could be covered by protocol fees collected over time. But this overlooks an important point: the bulk of THORChain’s liquidity comes from its lending and savers platform, ThorFi. So it doesn’t make sense to consider THORChain and ThorFi as separate entities.” As THORChain navigates this crisis, it is clear there are inherent risks associated with protocols heavily reliant on the value of their native tokens, similar to Terra. Effective risk management and sustainable design are crucial to prevent such scenarios and protect users’ funds. “Essentially, Thorchain needs to maintain significant liquidity over the long term. But this will be challenging because ThorFi’s lenders and savers will logically be trying to withdraw their funds en masse,” Aggarwal said.

The Fineqia FTSE Cardano Enhanced Yield ETN, which went live on the Vienna Stock Exchange on Jan.24, will allow investors to tap into opportunities around Cardano ( ADA ) price appreciation while still earning yield regardless of the underlying asset’s price movement. ETNs are debt instruments that collateralize an exchange-traded product’s underlying asset, including crypto. The Cardano ETN, which trades under the ticker YADA, provides access to yield by deploying ADA across yield-bearing DeFi protocols. The global DeFi market currently holds over $155 billion in total value locked across various protocols. According to DeFiLlama , the TVL peaked at $207 billion during the last bull market. Meanwhile, research platform Statista estimates that the global DeFi ecosystem could see its revenue grow to $542 billion by 2025.

According to a new memo released by the White House, Trump signed an executive order yesterday promoting the use of blockchains for individuals and entities. Other aspects of the order include protecting US citizens from the risks of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) by barring them, promoting fair and open access to banking services for all, and defending the rights of those who choose to self-custody their assets. “The digital asset industry plays a crucial role in innovation and economic development in the United States, as well as our Nation’s international leadership. It is therefore the policy of my Administration to support the responsible growth and use of digital assets, blockchain technology, and related technologies across all sectors of the economy.” The order also establishes a Working Group – made up of people in key roles such as the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, and the Homeland Security Advisor – that would consider creating a crypto stockpile out of the digital assets legally frozen by the Federal Government. “The Working Group shall evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile and propose criteria for establishing such a stockpile, potentially derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts.” Trump’s order also establishes protections for miners, saying that they could freely engage in developing, mining, and validating.

Buterin says the crypto sector has spent the past year entering “a new order” where people cheer on the idea of creating a token for anything at any scale. “And so now is the time to talk about the difference between sugar-high short-term fun that is unwise to recommend to newbies, and long-term fulfillment and wealth-building. It is not about ‘fun is bad’, it is about the equivalent of modern hyperaddictive cellphone games, versus chess or World of Warcraft. Now is the time to talk about the fact that large-scale political coins cross a further line: they are not just sources of fun, whose harm is at most contained to mistakes made by voluntary participants, they are vehicles for unlimited political bribery, including from foreign nation-states.” US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump both launched controversial new memecoins in the past week. The Ethereum founder says the public should prioritize “the brightest possible vector” for the future of capital allocation mechanisms. “The goal is not to indiscriminately accelerate everything, including superintelligent AI and fentanyl, the goal is to selectively accelerate defense so that it can keep up with offense. Sometimes, that defense is a matter of cultivating our own sense of virtue. Sometimes, that defense is a matter of creating better alternatives. In DeFi, we are already starting to see a return toward honest token-based fundraising that gives users a clear understanding of what they are buying, bringing us the best of pre-2020-era Initial Coin Offerings while addressing their downsides.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

On January 24, Sun accused Chain of engaging in activities that could harm cryptocurrency exchange users, specifically referencing the use of high leverage and contracts. Sun posted on the platform X (formerly Twitter), tagging major exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, Bybit, KuCoin, and HTX Global, urging them to investigate Chain’s activities. Chain Threatens Lawsuit Against Justin Sun Over Market Manipulation Claims Following a heated discussion on X , Chain announced its intent to pursue legal action against Justin Sun. The dispute began when Sun claimed that Chain’s alleged actions posed risks to crypto exchange users. He also stated he would report Chain’s activities to the SEC and DOJ. In response, Chain firmly denied the allegations. The company clarified that it is not involved in any trading or manipulation of its XCN token. Chain also stated that XCN is managed by OnyxDAO, not by Chain itself. The company emphasized its commitment to transparency and accountability while exploring legal options against Sun. Founded in 2014, Chain has raised over $40 million from investors, including Pantera Capital and Citigroup. The company has undergone significant developments, including its acquisition by Stellar in 2018 and re-acquisition in 2020. Chain operates in the blockchain space with a focus on advancing decentralized technology. Notably, the lawsuit threat emerged days after Justin Sun revealed a strategy to boost ETH price to $10,000 by halting ETH sales and taxing Layer 2 solutions. Sun Tags Major Exchanges and Demands Investigation Justin Sun’s accusations were amplified by tagging cryptocurrency exchanges in his post. He called on platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, and Bybit to investigate Chain’s activities. Sun warned of the alleged risks associated with high leverage and contracts used by Chain. Chain’s response included a clear statement disassociating itself from the management of the XCN token. The company reiterated that OnyxDAO manages XCN and denied any involvement in trading or market manipulation. The blockchain protocol tweeted, “The Chain team is not actively engaged in any trading of XCN, nor involved in any market manipulation directly or indirectly. We take these allegations extremely seriously and are exploring legal remedies against Justin Sun.” XCN Price Action This escalation occurred amidst a surge in XCN’s market value. The token recorded a 149% price increase in one day and nearly 400% over the week. Sun’s claims appeared to link this price movement to alleged manipulation, further intensifying the situation. At press time, Onyxcoin (XCN) is trading at $0.0242, marking a rise of 32% over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has seen an increase in trading volume, up 273% to $1.42 billion, alongside a market capitalization that has grown to $745.24 million. Meanwhile, the Tron co-founder recently emphasized the security advantages of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) over Coinbase Wrapped BTC (CBBTC). Justin Sun critiqued Coinbase’s lack of a Proof of Reserves system, highlighting the risk of asset freezing.

While Cardano and Solana have established themselves with impressive on-chain statistics and sophisticated technical setups, Remittix is capturing attention with its compelling value proposition in a highly profitable sector. This PayFi contender aims to revolutionize the market by addressing inefficiencies in conventional global payment systems. So, what features are attracting investors to Remittix (RTX), and how might Cardano and Solana perform in the first quarter of 2025? Cardano (ADA) Records Monthly Rise Despite Short-Term Dips Cardano has been steadily progressing, and its network metrics are beginning to reflect the effort. Currently priced at $0.96, ADA’s RSI is comfortably at 57, suggesting a bullish trend that isn’t overextended. Additionally, the MACD on the daily chart signals an upcoming crossover, indicating a potential upward breakout. On-chain data reveals that 71% of Cardano (ADA) holders remain optimistic about the project's trajectory. Whale activity remains steady, with wallets holding over 1 million ADA making up 45% of the total supply. Interestingly, there's a rise in smaller, active wallets, signaling increased interest from retail investors in Cardano's potential. With future updates aimed at enhancing smart contracts and DeFi capabilities, Cardano might be preparing for a rally that favors endurance over speed. Solana (SOL) Drops 2.65% Within a Day Solana, known for its lightning-fast blockchain capabilities, is maintaining its allure. Trading close to $243, Solana’s (SOL) MACD recently turned bullish, with an RSI of 62, indicating potential for further gains before encountering resistance. On-chain data presents an intriguing scenario: while whales still control 68% of the supply, there’s a noticeable rise in short-term holders taking advantage of price fluctuations. Network activity is on the rise, with daily transactions increasing by 15% over the past month. Developers are returning after past challenges, thanks to recent updates that have enhanced network stability. With zk-rollups integration on the horizon, Solana's technological advancements are setting the stage for a possible significant surge. The main question remains: can it reclaim the $30 mark and maintain the momentum?

Ethereum ( ETH ) was trading at $3,400, down by nearly 20% from its highest level in December last year. This decline coincided with controversies surrounding the Ethereum Foundation and its token sales. ETH has also dropped as balances on exchanges have continued to rise, while the popular buy-sell ratio on Binance has remained bearish. Still, Ethereum has several catalysts that may push it to $5,000. Ethereum Pectra upgrade The first major catalyst for Ethereum’s price is the upcoming Pectra upgrade , which is expected to occur in March. This will be one of the biggest upgrades in Ethereum’s history, introducing several crucial features. The first feature will bring features like transaction bundling and gas sponsorship. It will also introduce the maximum effective balance, meaning that staking rewards will be added to a validator no matter their size. Additionally, the Pectra upgrade will increase blob throughput, adjust calldata costs, and enable execution layer triggerable exits.

The chart below shows a divergence between Ethereum’s price and its open interest. While Ether has dropped nearly 20% from its highest level in November, open interest has continued to climb. ETH open interest | Source: CryptoQuant Ethereum price has strong technicals ETH price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Ethereum’s price has strong technical indicators, which could push it significantly higher in the longer term. ETH has formed a falling wedge chart pattern, composed of two descending and converging lines, which is widely considered a bullish signal. Ethereum has also formed an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, with its neckline at $4,082. The left and right shoulders are around the $3,000 level. This pattern frequently precedes substantial price gains. Furthermore, the recent retreat aligns with the fourth phase of the Elliott Wave pattern. This phase is typically followed by a bullish fifth wave. As a result, Ethereum is likely to experience a bullish breakout, with the initial key level to watch at $4,082. A break above this level could lead to further gains, potentially testing the key resistance at $4,800, its all-time high. Beyond this, ETH could surge toward $5,000.

""Unfortunately, under Operation Chokepoint 2.0, Biden regulators abused their power and forced financial institutions to cut off services to digital asset firms, political figures, and conservative-aligned businesses and individuals."" Operation Chokepoint 2.0 is the name Republican lawmakers and the digital assets industry have been using for the systemic severing of crypto insiders from U.S. banks, in reference to an earlier era's Operation Chokepoint — a government-sanctioned effort to reduce risk in banking by encouraging the lenders to back away from legal but otherwise risky businesses. Delving into the struggle of crypto executives and businesses to maintain banking relationships, the House Oversight Committee is ""investigating whether this debanking practice originates from the financial institutions themselves or from either implicit or explicit pressure from government regulators,"" according to a letter the committee chairman, Representative James Comer, sent on Friday to founders and CEOs of several crypto companies and organizations, including Coinbase, Lightswap and Uniswap Labs. The challenge of pinning the lack of banking options entirely on the government is that some financial institutions may have made decisions based on their own risk appetites or business plans that deliberately steered clear of crypto interests. And banking regulators such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency were public in their guidance that regulated banks seeking to do crypto business would face restrictions and additional scrutiny from the agencies. However, a Coinbase pursuit of private FDIC communications with banks demonstrated that the agency directed them to stop pursuing digital assets services until the regulator had specific rules in place, which it wasn't developing. ""We are grateful to assist in the thorough investigation of this pernicious practice,” said Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, which also received the House committee's letter probing the trend. Meanwhile, congressional Democrats have been focusing their own investigation requests on President Donald Trump's recently launched meme coin, $TRUMP . He's been accused of using the presidency to rack up billions of dollars, and they cite the token as a potential risk for dangerous conflicts of interest. The House Financial Services Committee announced a hearing on the issue late Friday, scheduled for Thursday, Feb. 6.

If we have a more friendly SEC I could see an easier path for approval. I could see this kind of friendly landscape start a new era of like corporate meme coins, obviously we have the meme coins that just launched on Solana like TRUMP and MELANIA, but we could also see something like Boeing Airlines just launched a meme coin on Solana and there’s this potential for kind of a new adoption of some sort of meme coins around different corporations launching their own thing, I don’t know what that would look like but I think the door has been opened for that.” Magadini remains positive on a Solana ETF approval in the U.S. in 2025. Technical analysis and SOL price forecast Solana trades 12% under its all-time high of $295.83, at $262.32. On the SOL/USDT daily price charts, technical indicators support gains in Solana price.

SOL/USDT daily price chart | Source: Crypto.news Analysts at Kraken confirm that Solana continues its strong upward momentum and trade above key Exponential moving averages, after setting a new all-time high above $260. Analysts are quoted in Kraken’s OTC report: “This impulse move originated from a failure to close below the 200-day EMA and trendline, support near $168, with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $230 now providing key support. On the back of this sharp rally, the RSI has approached overbought territory near 75, reflecting strong bullish momentum but also signaling potential caution for short-term traders. A decisive daily close above $260 would confirm renewed bullish momentum and likely pave the way for further upside exploration, with $280 and $300 emerging as the next key targets. However, failure to hold above $230 could see SOL revisit lower support levels, with $204 being the next significant area for bulls to defend.” Messari analysts break down the launch of TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins on the Solana chain and note that their impact on Solana’s record $85 billion DEX volume supported a bullish sentiment among traders. Crypto market participants view this as a major milestone for crypto adoption, concerns over insider allocations are rampant, according to tweets on X. It remains to be seen how the meme token launch could shape long-term market trends, the role of future meme coin launches, and how Trump’s engagement with crypto might shape the industry over the next four years.

The prices for PEPE and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have slipped to approximately $0.00001474 (a decrease of 7.65%) and $0.00001989 (a decline of 3.53%), respectively. Meanwhile, a relatively obscure project called Remittix (RTX) has surged, raising over $5,800,793.66 with 297,588,750.58 tokens sold at $0.0297 each, with the next price set at $0.0311. It’s being dubbed a viral XRP competitor due to its growing role in cross-border transactions. Let's delve into why whales seem to be shifting from PEPE and Shiba Inu (SHIB) to Remittix (RTX). Pepe (PEPE): The Fading Star of Meme Coins Once a meme coin sensation, PEPE enjoyed rapid gains driven by social media excitement. However, as the initial buzz faded, stability issues began to surface. Large crypto holders moving significant amounts out of PEPE have contributed to its recent decline, suggesting that these major players might see limited potential for long-term growth. While meme coins can offer dramatic short-term profits, they also carry high risks. This risk might be leading these investors to seek out more stable tokens in the crypto ecosystem. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Another Meme Coin Facing Challenges It’s not just PEPE experiencing difficulties; Shiba Inu (SHIB) is also under strain. With its price at $0.00001989, down 3.53% in the last 24 hours, SHIB is struggling to regain its past momentum. Despite its vibrant community and occasional celebrity backing, the heavy selling of Shiba Inu by crypto whales adds significant pressure, potentially hindering price recovery. Some analysts suggest that SHIB lacks the real-world applications that whales are increasingly interested in. As a result, SHIB holders are looking into new tokens that might offer stronger fundamentals. Remittix (RTX): An Emerging Choice Enter Remittix (RTX), a token designed for cross-border payments, allowing users to convert cryptocurrency into fiat and transfer funds directly to bank accounts worldwide. This practical approach could be why Remittix (RTX) is catching the attention of large investors. Having raised $5,800,793.66 in its ICO and sold 297,588,750.58 tokens at $0.0297, RTX is gaining traction among those looking for more reliable returns than typical meme coins. It’s being referred to as a “viral XRP rival” due to its focus on fast and affordable global transfers, similar to Ripple. If whales believe Remittix (RTX) can achieve even a portion of XRP’s success, the potential rewards could be substantial. Why Whales Prefer Tokens with Purpose While trends in the crypto world can shift rapidly, one thing remains constant: whales typically invest in tokens that offer more than just hype. This explains the buzz around crypto whales divesting from Pepe and Shiba Inu. While memes can become viral sensations, they can just as quickly lose their appeal if new trends arise. In contrast, a token like Remittix (RTX), which addresses real-world challenges, may hold its value when meme coins falter. This increasing preference for utility-based projects might not only attract whales but also appeal to regular investors tired of the volatility associated with purely hype-driven tokens. Conclusion At present, it appears that whales are reallocating their funds, moving away from PEPE and Shiba Inu (SHIB) to pursue opportunities with stronger fundamentals. Remittix (RTX) stands out in this regard, with its focus on practical cross-border solutions and steady growth in its token sale. As the market continues to evolve, more significant investors may follow this trend. Ultimately, large investors often seek tokens with enduring value rather than those driven by speculative mania. Whether Remittix (RTX) will fully live up to its label as a viral XRP rival remains to be seen, but for now, it’s attracting attention from investors weary of the meme coin roller coaster.

According to crypto analytics platform CryptoQuant data, a rising open interest has hinted that Ethereum may see a breakout soon. Ethereum Price and Open Interest Outlook According to CryptoQuant analyst Shayan BTC, if the Ethereum price breaches a key resistance level, it could set the stage for a sustained ride. Per the analyst , ETH open interest has steadily risen in recent weeks. He noted that this implies growing participation in the futures market. The rising Ethereum Open Interest aligns with Coinglass data, which shows a 6.5% surge in this metric over 24 hours. Per the data, a total of 9.71 million ETHs are now committed by futures traders. Per Shayan’s analysis, the Open Interest has jumped to its highest level in weeks, with traders opening long positions. Amid this outlook, the CryptoQuant analyst sees a sharp divergence between open interest and price. Despite the jump in open interest, Ethereum’s price is yet to break its previous cycle’s high. This shows a large imbalance between market expectations and price action. At the time of writing, the price of Ethereum jumped by 5.26% in 24 hours to $3,369. Despite this growth, the coin is down by over 30% from its all-time high (ATH) of $4,891.70. ETH Not Out of the Woods According to the CryptoQuant analyst, the elevated open interest makes the coin susceptible to liquidation. This liquidation may trigger a drawdown, such as the crypto market selloff that impacted ETH earlier this week. This outlook can push ETH prices in any direction that remains uncertain. However, Shayan BTC hinted that the current outlook suggests a potential rally is ahead. He noted that the price may chart a sustained rally if Ethereum successfully overcomes a crucial resistance level. Rising Open Interest Signals Ethereum’s Imminent Breakout: A Bullish Rally Ahead? “If Ethereum successfully overcomes key resistance levels, it could set the stage for a sustained rally.” – By @ShayanBTC7 Full post https://t.co/nEkybTVB55 pic.twitter.com/GwE2S84ICb — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 24, 2025 Per an earlier ETH price analysis , the prospect of the coin hitting $10,000 was deemed likely. This projection hinges on the growing accumulation of World Liberty Financial and its likely inclusion in the national reserve. Ethereum Foundation and Pectra Influence Beyond the technical indicators in the price of the coin, the prospect of the coin may also be impacted by the activities of the Ethereum Foundation. As reported earlier, there is a projection that ETH may jump to $6,000 if the Ethereum Foundation stops selling the coin. Over the past few months, the Foundation has initiated a series of ETH selloffs, which it has noted are part of its operational obligation. Additionally, Ethereum’s prospects may be impacted by the upcoming Pectra upgrade. This upgrade, scheduled to launch in mid-March, seeks to enhance the scalability and security of the chain. Developers are in the final stages of the launch, the success of which may significantly impact its price outlook.

Amid this, whales have been accumulating the token. $38.51 Million XRP Outflow from Exchanges Today, January 24, 2025, data from the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass revealed that long-term holders and investors have withdrawn a significant $38.51 million worth of XRP from exchanges in the past 24 hours. Source: Coinglass This substantial outflow from exchanges indicates potential accumulation by long-term holders, which could create buying pressure and drive further upward momentum. However, the transaction occurred during a period when XRP’s price struggled to gain traction. Apart from this, another factor gathering attention is the dumps made by these whales. Spot inflow/outflow metrics revealed that before the token was withdrawn from exchanges, investors and long-term holders had dumped a significant $35.4 million worth of XRP, suggesting that sentiment is now recovering. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels Currently, XRP is consolidating in a tight range between the $2.915 and $3.30 levels for more than a week. However, expert technical analysis suggests that despite the consolidation, the token appears bullish, as it recently broke out from a bullish flag-and-pole price action pattern on the daily time frame. Source: Trading view Based on the recent price action and historical momentum, if XRP breaks out of the consolidation and closes a daily candle above the $3.31 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 35% to reach the $4.50 level. RSI Flashing Bullish Sign Currently, XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 60, which is close to the overbought area. Analysts and experts view this as an indication that the token still has enough room to soar significantly in the coming days. XRP is currently trading near $3.15 and has experienced a price surge of over 2.10% in the past 24 hours.

The Massachusetts lawmaker, alongside Representative Jake Auchincloss, directed the request to the heads of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE), the Treasury Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Concern Over TRUMP, MELANIA In a letter dated January 22, the Democratic legislators shared their unease over the launch of the Official Trump (TRUMP) and Melania Meme (MELANIA) tokens. According to them, the cryptocurrencies allowed the head of state to earn “extraordinary profits” using his position. They noted that the President’s family business and affiliates hold 80% of the TRUMP meme coin’s supply, and his net worth shot up by at least several billion USD as the coin’s value rose last weekend. Warren and Auchincloss also highlighted that anyone, including foreign leaders, could secretly use the cryptocurrency to gain influence over Trump. “Anyone, including the leaders of hostile nations, can covertly buy these coins, raising the specter of uninhibited and untraceable foreign influence over the President of the United States,” the letter read. Further, they pointed out that meme coins are infamous for rug pulls and scams , suggesting that Trump and his associates could dump their holdings, make lots of money, and crash the coin’s price. They also emphasized how the terms of the two tokens purport to indemnify them from fraud-related claims, meaning buyers may not be able to sue or join class action lawsuits against their issuers. This, in the legislators’ opinion, made TRUMP and MELANIA “ripe for market manipulation.” The Senator and the Congressman also observed a possible conflict of interest: the President could directly benefit from selling crypto while also being in a position to appoint the people responsible for crafting policies to regulate the digital asset sector. “He will be in a position to seek commitments from agency heads, to not only decide how the market is valued, but to implement lax policies to crack down on crypto scams like pump-and-dump schemes that are regularly conducted through meme coins,” the two claimed. Questions for Regulators Warren and Auchincloss concluded their missive with several questions for the government agencies addressed, including one to the OGE, about whether it was aware of any other president-elect who launched a business hours before taking office. They also wanted to know if there were any ethics rules the President and First Lady could be subjected to regarding their meme coin holdings. From the Treasury, the legislators wanted to know if U.S. corruption laws prevent foreign actors from buying cryptocurrencies like those issued by Trump and whether there is a way to track and identify people or entities that buy the coins. The SEC and CFTC, which recently got interim heads, were also put on the spot and asked if they had any authority to handle “threats posed by meme coins.” Additionally, the Democratic politicians wanted to know whether the agencies would investigate investor complaints against the TRUMP and MELANIA tokens. All queries are expected to be answered by February 4.

Table of Contents DOT: A blockchain leader, but limited growth potential BeerBear: The rocket to rapid profits is here Conclusion The crypto world is heating up, and speculators are laser-focused on the next big breakout star. Among the low-cap contenders, one token is grabbing attention with the potential to deliver jaw-dropping gains of 9,750%. For those who thought Polkadot (DOT) was a high-flyer, this meme coin is here to steal the spotlight. Enter BeerBear , a rising star that crypto analysts believe could be the market’s next massive success story. DOT: A blockchain leader, but limited growth potential Polkadot is no stranger to the spotlight. Renowned for its interoperability and unique parachain technology, DOT has secured its place among top-tier blockchain platforms. Its robust ecosystem and ability to connect different blockchains have attracted significant investor interest. The chart shows that Polkadot reached its peak in late 2021, with a sharp decline following shortly after. Since then, the price has remained stagnant at significantly lower levels, reflecting weak market sentiment and a lack of interest. The current price of $6.35, compared to its previous high of $53.87, indicates no substantial recovery and minimal momentum for future growth. With no new catalysts or innovations driving demand, DOT appears unlikely to regain its past highs. Investors seeking better opportunities may find promise in alternatives like Beer Bear.

The total stablecoin supply on Solana has surged to $10.5 billion, doubling since the start of January, according to data source Artemis . Circle's USDC led the increase surpassing $8 billion in total circulation on Solana, adding more than $4 billion this month, while Tether's USDT grew to $2 billion from $917 million, per Artemis. Stablecoins are a key piece of infrastructure in the crypto economy, serving as a popular source of liquidity for crypto trading. Solana and its ecosystem of in-built protocols built have become a bustling hub for trading and launching tokens in red-hot, fast-growing crypto sectors such as memecoins and crypto AI agents . The network's stablecoin liquidity growth was steady over the past months as digital asset markets rejuvenated with crypto-friendly Trump's election victory, but it skyrocketed with the launch of TRUMP coin Jan. 17, the ""official"" memecoin tied to the U.S. President. Released on Solana, the token garnered massive trading volume across decentralized exchanges, driving transaction activity and liquidity inflows to the network. Before the token got listed on popular centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, trading with the TRUMP coin was first available on decentralized exchange (DEX) Meteora paired against the USDC stablecoin, David Duong and David Han from Coinbase Institutional Research, noted in a Friday report. That said, fast-moving traders first needed to first acquire USDC to buy the coin, driving USDC inflows to the network. Along with stablecoin growth, trading volume on Solana-based decentralized exchanges (DEX) also soared to record highs of more than $25 billion daily, executing 74% of overall DEX trading volume on all blockchains, the report noted. ""Staggering numbers,"" Sean Farrell, head of digital asset research at Fundstrat, said in an X post . The increased activity was reflected in Solana's native token ( SOL ) price, posting the largest gain through this week with 20% among the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index members, vastly outperforming bitcoin's (BTC) 2% advance.

To read full editions, subscribe . President Trump yesterday issued his first crypto executive order . The news and ensuing chaos on Crypto Twitter reminded me of Biden’s crypto executive order , published in March 2022. Let’s take a trip down memory lane. Here’s what Trump’s report says, and how it differs from Biden’s plans: On CBDCs Trump’s order prohibits federal agencies from establishing, issuing or promoting central bank digital currencies. It calls for any ongoing projects creating a CBDC to be “immediately terminated.” CBDCs “threaten the stability of the financial system, individual privacy and the sovereignty of the United States,” Trump’s order reads. Biden was less resolute on the topic. His administration struck a bit of a middle ground , saying they saw “merit” to a US CBDC but also acknowledged “potential risks and downsides to consider.” In the end, Biden directed agencies to create a report on the future of money and payment systems. We eventually got this report , which, like Biden’s executive order, said little definitively. The Treasury recommended “advancing” work on a CBDC and “prioritizing” improvements to cross-border payments. Spoiler alert, a CBDC was never developed. On “protection” When it comes to security, Biden and Trump hold very different views on how to approach digital assets. Biden’s order focused on protecting consumers from the risks associated with investing and engaging with crypto. He also highlighted national security concerns, calling digital assets a threat to financial stability and a tool ripe for abuse from illicit actors. Trump’s EO also includes the term “protection,” but his administration is concerned with maintaining US dollar dominance and shielding citizens from the dangers of CBDCs. The Working Group Trump’s order established a Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, to be led by “crypto czar” David Sacks . Included in this group are the chairs of the CFTC and SEC, attorney general and secretaries of the Treasury and Homeland Security, among other cabinet members. Trump’s Working Group “shall evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile and propose criteria for establishing such a stockpile, potentially derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the federal government through its law enforcement efforts.” As one source on the Hill told me last night, this is a long way of saying the “ strategic bitcoin reserve is going to live in bureaucratic purgatory for a long time, maybe forever.” Biden did not create any such working group, or any crypto-specific advisory council. But he did task the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets to create a report outlining the various risks of digital assets. This report noted that crypto can pose a threat to financial stability, and it recommended Congress pass legislation designating rulemaking authority to appropriate agencies (something like a market structure bill, for example.) Spoiler: This, too, has lived in political limbo for years. Only time will tell if this latest crypto executive order inspires more progress than Biden’s. But it’s worth noting that the industry excitement around Trump’s EO bodes well. Never underestimate what some well-funded lobbyists can get done on Capitol Hill.

US lawmakers have set sight on the government’s regulatory overreach, sparking investor enthusiasm. In a recent development, the US Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has initiated investigations on the alleged debanking of crypto companies and individuals. While debanking refers to the isolation of crypto firms from the banking sector, the US lawmakers’ move intends to put an end to the authority’s indirect control over the crypto space. US Oversight Committee Probes into Operation Chokepoint 2.0 According to a Forbes report , the US Oversight Committee has launched investigations on the “improper debanking” of individuals and organizations related to crypto. Under the leadership of Chair James Comer (R-Ky.), the Committee aims to collect testimonies from affected individuals and companies. On Friday, the US Oversight Committee sent a letter to industry leaders, revealing their investigation plans. By examining the groups claiming to be debanked, the committee seeks to determine whether the trend is driven by their independent decisions or by government overreach. Industry Leaders Allege Government’s Indirect Control Over Crypto The term “Operation Chokepoint” could be traced back to former President Barack Obama’s reign when financial services were restricted for high-risk industries. Reflecting on the term, Andreessen Horowitz co-founder Marc Andreessen called the process of debanking during the Biden era “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” Industry experts like Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and CLO Paul Grewal corroborated Andreessen’s comments. Grewal posited, “Financial regulators have used multiple tools at their disposal to try to cripple the digital-asset industry.” Chokepoint 2.0: SEC’s Aggressive Regulation Sparks Backlash Notably, Uniswap Labs Founder Hayden Adams complained that his bank accounts were closed without prior notice. He added, “I know many individuals and companies who have been similarly targeted simply for working in the crypto industry.” Similarly, Brian Armstrong revealed that banks closed ties with more than 30 tech companies. He added that the US SEC and former Chair Gary Gensler attempted to “unlawfully kill our [their] entire industry.” He also addressed it as the Biden government’s “most unethical and un-American” action. Meanwhile, Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, described Operation Chokepoint 2.0 as the government’s “indirect” regulation of the crypto industry. Investigation on Debanking: What To Expect? Reportedly, more than 120 crypto hedge funds were debanked over the past three years. While real estate and private credit investors enjoyed banking services, crypto hedge funds were denied the same facilities. As cited by the committee, First Lady Melania Trump shared her personal experience of being debanked, which she attributes to political bias. With an active investigation, the Oversight Committee intends to protect crypto users and traders from unfair government control. The agency envisions ensuring an unbiased crypto trading atmosphere in the United States and thereby terminating Operation Chokepoint 2.0. The unredacted FDIC files that Coinbase secured will undoubtedly be useful in this investigation. US Banks Remain Ready To Embrace Crypto Recently, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire expressed optimism about the future of crypto, anticipating that banks will soon facilitate cryptocurrency trading. He believes that Trump’s new crypto policies will cease Operation Chokepoint 2.0, collaborating with the banking industry. At the same time, Bank of America’s CEO Brian Moynihan expressed the US banking industry’s willingness to accept cryptocurrencies. Wall Street giants are also eying the crypto market. They seek to make a strategic entry into the space to tap into its immense opportunities.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Cryptocurrency thrives on chaos, but keen observation reveals patterns and signals for spotting opportunities. Table of Contents The patterns Get to know the ecosystem Social media: The speculation engine The Macro Finding the signals Tools of the trade Cryptocurrency is a riddle wrapped in hype. It’s a market that loves chaos, where every spike and dip feels like the start of something big or the end of everything. To outsiders, it’s a game of chance. To those who study it, who watch for patterns and listen to the whispers beneath the noise, it’s something more deliberate. The market moves in signals. The trick is knowing how to read them. Crypto trends aren’t about crystal balls or insider tips; it’s about observation and interpretation. Someone doesn’t have to be a programmer or a trader to spot opportunities. What they need is focus. Patterns emerge for those who care to look closely enough. You might also like: Ex-Paxful CEO’s Bitcoin marketplace Noones exploited for nearly $8m, ZachXBT says The patterns Cryptocurrency doesn’t move randomly, no matter how wild the charts look. There’s a beat to the chaos, driven by technology, investor sentiment and broader economic forces. Knowing the beat is key to trends. Look at the basics: price movements, trading volume, market capitalization. These aren’t just numbers; they’re signals. A surge in trading volume might mean growing interest in a project. A sudden dip could mean a sell-off due to bad news or profit taking. And then there’s Bitcoin , the market’s constant pulse. Keeping an eye on Bitcoin price trends is non-negotiable — it’s the base layer. When Bitcoin moves, it often takes other coins with it, pulling the whole market up or down in its wake. Study how it behaves in different market conditions. Watch how altcoins react to its movements. These patterns don’t just happen; they’re a reflection of the global investor sentiment. Get to know the ecosystem The cryptocurrency world isn’t a monolith. Bitcoin is the flagship, yes, but thousands of other coins — Ethereum , Solana and a sea of altcoins — each bring something different to the table. Some are for privacy, some for speed, some for building platforms other developers can use. Start here: learn the language of the ecosystem. Know which projects matter and why. Bitcoin sets the tone for the market—its influence on price trends is unmatched — but it’s not the only one shaping sentiment. Ethereum for example, drives the conversation around smart contracts and decentralized finance. Keep an eye on how these projects evolve and how they react to the market. Knowing the players isn’t about memorizing a list of coins. It’s about learning their stories. Why were they created? What problems are they trying to solve? And most importantly, are they delivering on their promises? Social media: The speculation engine In crypto, the chatter is everything. Twitter and Reddit aren’t just where people talk about trends — they’re where trends start. A single tweet can send a coin to the moon or to zero. But navigating this noise is an art. Look beyond the hype. Who’s behind the chatter? Influential voices in the crypto space — devs, analysts, and a few high-profile investors—set the tone. If they’re talking about a project, there’s a reason. But don’t take everything at face value. Social media is a playground for hyperbole and false promises. Use it as a tool to spot themes, not as the only source of truth. Combine what people see online with real data and their own research. The Macro The crypto market doesn’t exist in a bubble. It’s tied to tech, regulation, and global events in ways that aren’t always immediately apparent. Watching cryptocurrency trends means watching what’s happening outside the bubble. When governments announce new regulations, the market listens. When a big company adopts blockchain or accepts Bitcoin, it creates waves. And when economic uncertainty looms, crypto becomes a topic of conversation as people look for alternatives to traditional investments. Stay curious. Read widely. And remember, trends aren’t just about what’s happening now — they’re about where the world is going. Finding the signals Not all trends are worth following. The crypto market is full of noise — meme coins and overhyped projects promising the moon. The trick is to know how to filter out the noise from the signals. Start with consistency. Is there real work happening behind the scenes or is the chatter just speculation? Projects with strong teams, clear goals and transparent operations tend to stand out. They may not get the same hype as a new shiny coin but they’re often more reliable in the long term. Be cautious of sudden moves. Price spikes are exciting but often followed by sharp declines. Ask what’s driving the movement. Tools of the trade There are plenty of tools to track cryptocurrency trends. Market trackers, portfolio apps and even blockchain explorers can help someone make sense of it all. Try a few and find what works. The best tools don’t just show numbers; they help understand them. Look for platforms that visualize the data in a way that’s easy to read. And don’t be afraid to switch it up as needs change. The crypto market changes fast, and so do the tools that are used too.

With the ETHBTC ratio remaining near a two-month low, sellers are pushing to stabilize the price below $3,400. This pressure has led to a significant drop in an important on-chain metric, indicating potential further declines in its price. Ethereum’s Decline Might Be Short-Term The price of Ethereum has been experiencing mixed reactions in the market as both buyers and sellers face liquidations. According to Coinglass, Ethereum saw a total of $35 million in liquidations over the past 24 hours, with $14 million coming from buyers and $21 million from sellers. Data from IntoTheBlock indicates that Ethereum’s volatility has been decreasing over the last 30 days. A significant drop in volatility could be a negative sign for Ethereum because it suggests less trading activity, which could reduce the chances of the price moving above key resistance levels. Currently, the volatility rate stands at 42.6%. At the time of publication, the ETH/BTC ratio, which indicates Ether’s value relative to Bitcoin, stands at 0.03194 according to TradingView data. This ratio has decreased by 19% since December 5, when Bitcoin reached $100,000 for the first time. However, in the previous bull market cycle, the ETH/BTC ratio hit a low of around 0.03 in March 2021 and then climbed to 0.077 within two months. During this time, the price of Ether rose by 110%, reaching $3,817. Also read: Ethereum Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Can ETH Price Hit $5k? As Bitcoin’s adoption now grows, being bearish on Ethereum will be a mistake. Some believe that while many are focused on what US President-elect Donald Trump might do with Bitcoin during his tenure, Ether could also benefit indirectly from Bitcoin’s wider adoption. Apollo co-founder Thomas Fahrer stated that if the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is implemented, it could drive Bitcoin’s price up to $1 million this cycle. He also noted that this would be positive for Ether, suggesting that a price target of $4,000 could be achievable. What’s Next for ETH Price? Ethereum’s price has been climbing sharply, breaking past previous resistance levels and now trying to push above the immediate Fibonacci channel. However, it’s facing some selling pressure around the declining resistance line, posing a significant challenge for buyers. Currently, Ethereum is trading at $3,343, having increased by 1.01% in the last 24 hours. The ETH/USDT trading pair is hovering just below $3,430, which could present a significant hurdle. If it can maintain above this level, it could be beneficial for buyers, potentially driving the price up to $3,730, and possibly even to $4K. Conversely, if the price falls below the EMA20 trend line on the 1-hour chart, sellers could drive it down to around $3,200. Nonetheless, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 52 suggests there could be an uptick soon, as it indicates continued buying interest.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|BTC|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-24 20:42:20

Dogecoin’s trend hints at potential growth in altcoin season Dogecoin is showing signs of bouncing back. Recently, the price has been between about 30 and 43 cents. While it has dipped by nearly 8% in the past week, it’s still up over 165% in the last 6 months. The nearest resistance is just below 50 cents, with more significant resistance above 60 cents. If DOGE manages to break these levels, it could ride the bullish wave. The Moving Averages suggest sideways motion, but relative strength and stochastic indicators suggest more room for upward movement. The market may soon favor altcoins like Dogecoin, sparking new interest and possibly leading to notable gains. Shiba Inu Price poised for a bullish surge after recent dip Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen a recent price dip. Its current range is $0.00001827 to $0.00002364. This drop marks a 10.64% decline over the past week and 16.27% over the month. Yet, it shows a 15.58% rise over six months. The price is near support at $0.00001625. If it stays strong, SHIB could break past $0.00002699 resistance. The RSI is under 50, suggesting the market may shift upward. Potential growth could lead to breaking the second resistance at $0.00003236, a rise of about 27% from the current range. Keep an eye on these levels for signs of a bullish trend. Conclusion As DOGE and SHIB show less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the leading meme coin aiming to bring financial freedom to all. Offering a 700% ROI during its presale from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages, it combines governance rights, loyalty rewards, and staking benefits.

On Friday, Committee Chair James Comer sent letters to prominent crypto executives, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Uniswap founder Hayden Adams, seeking information about reported banking restrictions. The inquiry aims to assess whether financial institutions acted independently or were influenced by government pressure to deny services to crypto firms. 1/ Today we, along with some of the most important crypto companies and investors, received a letter from @GOPoversight asking for information on the recent debanking of lawful companies and individuals.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Glassnode and Swissblock co-founders Jan Happel and Yann Alleman – who together share the handle Negentropic – say that based on historical precedent, altcoin season could start if Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) dominance levels start to fell and its price stabilizes above $100,000. “Flashback to February 2021. In the last cycle, February kicked off altcoin season. Could it happen again? Two key factors must align: 1) Bitcoin dominance must decline. 2) Bitcoin must hold a stable price above $100,000. The scenario seems to be shaping up – will history repeat itself?” Source: Negentropic/X However, the duo goes on to note that the top crypto asset by market cap’s recent rise in dominance and price has delayed altcoin season. “Dominance: 58%+. Price: Holding strong above $100,000. Fundamental news has supercharged this Bitcoin-focused market, delaying an altcoin season for now. Altcoins? We’ll have to wait a bit longer… but the clues are starting to appear.” Source: Negentropic/X Earlier this week, Happel and Alleman said that BTC appears ready to break out based on the Bitcoin Fundamental Index (BFI), which evaluates several aspects of the Bitcoin market, including wallet activity and transaction volume. At the time, they predicted that the crypto king was en route to a $110,000 price tag but would first meet resistance around $106,000. Bitcoin is trading for $106,419 at time of writing, a marginal increase during the last 24 hours.

To read full editions, subscribe . SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce — two days after being named leader of a new crypto task force — revealed SAB 121 would be no more. Bye, bye SAB 121! It's not been fun: https://t.co/cIwUc0isUE | Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 122 — Hester Peirce (@HesterPeirce) January 23, 2025 Some context: A Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, represents interpretations and policies followed by SEC divisions in administering federal securities laws-related disclosure requirements . The SEC published SAB 121 in March 2022. It notably said that an entity “should present a liability on its balance sheet to reflect its obligation to safeguard the crypto-assets held for its platform users.” Why does the crypto industry care so much about the agency rescinding this? Cantor Fitzgerald Howard Lutnick explained the issue pretty well in a video he posted to X in September — a couple months before Trump nominated him to lead the Commerce department. There’s a misunderstanding that TradFi players don’t want to transact in bitcoin, Lutnick claimed . He added that for banks to custody a client’s bitcoin, “they would have to set aside their own money equal to that amount in sort of like a jail.” Indeed, financial organizations told SEC Chair Gary Gensler that the bulletin “has curbed the ability of the associations’ members to develop and bring to market at scale certain digital asset products and services.” The upshot? As VanEck research execs wrote in a December post detailing 2025 crypto predictions, this repeal “will pave the way for banks and brokers to custody spot crypto, further integrating digital assets into traditional financial infrastructure.” Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer argued in a Friday note that this SAB 121 rescission “represents an even more meaningful game-changer for bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem” than a potential strategic bitcoin reserve does. While SAB 121 was published in 2022, it wasn’t until last year that Congress sent a bill overturning the guidance to Joe Biden’s desk. He vetoed it . Ava Labs deputy general counsel Wee Ming Choon told me last month that rescinding SAB 121 would be an act of “good will” that a new agency administration could take quickly.

This upward momentum follows news of a US executive order establishing a national digital asset stockpile, contributing to a positive market environment. Amid this backdrop, CryptoQuant analyst ShayanBTC has provided a fresh perspective on Ethereum’s current trajectory. Shayan highlights an interesting divergence between the increasing open interest in Ethereum futures and the price, which has yet to reach previous highs. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Price Stalls Below $3,500 as Leverage Ratios Climb—What Next? Growing Futures Market and Divergent Price Action According to Shayan in a post recently uploaded on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, Ethereum’s open interest—an indicator of active futures contracts—has surged to its highest levels in recent weeks, indicating heightened market participation and growing interest among traders. The analyst notes that the rise in ETH’s open interest and slow price response suggests a disconnect between market sentiment and price performance. While futures traders appear optimistic, this optimism has not yet translated into Ethereum breaking key resistance levels. The analyst wrote: Interestingly, there is a divergence between Ethereum’s price and futures market activity. Despite the significant increase in open interest, the price has yet to break its previous highs, showcasing a potential imbalance between market expectations and price action. Shayan also notes that elevated open interest could lead to volatility. Historically, large buildups in open interest have been followed by significant price swings as positions are liquidated. Although the direction of the next move remains uncertain, current activity and sentiment lean toward a potential bullish breakout. Shayan suggested that if Ethereum can surpass critical resistance, it could pave the way for a more prolonged rally. Market Concerns And Bearish Indicators In contrast, another CryptoQuant analyst, Darkfost, presents a more cautious outlook. Darkfost points to a range of bearish factors, including increasing Ethereum inflows and reserves on Binance. According to the data shared by Darkfost, since September 2024, Ethereum inflows have consistently outpaced outflows, leading to a rise in exchange reserves. This trend reflects selling pressure, as more Ethereum is moved to exchanges, potentially indicating an intent to sell rather than hold. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Revival: What the Signs Say About Its Next Move Additionally, Binance’s taker buy-sell ratio has remained bearish for months, showing a consistent dominance of sell orders. Darkfost reveals that the shift in these metrics suggests that some investors may be locking in profits or reallocating capital elsewhere, leading to a more cautious market sentiment.

ETH and Bitcoin trends diverge as RTX, a unique crypto project, captures attention with unique features and rapid growth. Table of Contents Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade set to launch in March Why does Bitcoin’s price keep rising? Why Remittix is turning heads Conclusion The market is accustomed to abrupt changes and contradictory patterns, with Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) frequently setting the pace. While Bitcoin is the cryptocurrency’s gold due to its prominence as an economic vault, Ethereum’s interesting trends are driven by its programmable blockchain technology. Yet, beyond these giants lies a rising contender shaking up the industry: Remittix (R TX) . Let’s explore these dynamics and uncover why RTX is the talk of the town. Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade set to launch in March Ethereum ’s evolution continues with the much-anticipated Pectra upgrade, set for March 2025. Designed to enhance scalability, user experience, and network health, this upgrade promises to redefine how Ethereum operates. Key features like EIP-7702 introduce account abstraction, enabling batch transactions, one-time gas fees, and sponsored payments. Meanwhile, EIP-2537 revolutionizes zero-knowledge cryptography, boosting privacy and security. Validators, too, stand to benefit from EIP-7002, allowing flexible staking withdrawals and an increased staking balance cap. The Pectra Upgrade demonstrates Ethereum’s unwavering commitment to innovation, which draws in both developers and investors. A breakthrough might push ETH’s price above $6,000, even though it is now facing resistance at $4,093. Its long-term survival, however, depends on frequent revisions and market adoption. You might also like: SOL holders back Remittix: The altcoin set to change the future of global transfers Why does Bitcoin’s price keep rising? With Bitcoin’s price currently at $104,000, the trajectory of the leading coin is influenced by both long-term investor confidence and data-driven forecasts such as the NVT Golden Cross. This metric, which compares Bitcoin’s market cap to transaction volume, signals an impending price surge when it hits local bottom zones. Analysts suggest that BTC is gearing up for sustained growth. This confidence is evident on exchanges such as Binance, where rising optimistic sentiment and positive buy-sell ratios are prevalent. Despite not being as programmable as Ethereum, Bitcoin’s price grows because its strength as a decentralized asset keeps it at the top of the cryptocurrency market. Why Remittix is turning heads In a market dominated by giants, Remittix emerges as a game-changing player redefining cross-border payments. Positioned as a bridge between cryptocurrency and traditional fiat systems, RTX leverages blockchain to solve age-old inefficiencies in global transactions. Picture what it would be like to send $1000 to a family member abroad using Solana, and they receive the exact amount in their bank account with no hidden fees, no inflated exchange rates, and no crypto expertise required. That’s the simplicity and power of Remittix. Beyond its seamless user experience, RTX is disrupting a $190 trillion industry with its transparent fee model and extensive network support for 30+ fiat currencies and over 40 cryptocurrencies. Freelancers, businesses, and individuals alike benefit from its Remittix Pay API, which allows crypto payments with fiat settlements, bypassing traditional banking hurdles. With its current presale price of $0.0297, RTX presents an investment opportunity that is too good to pass up. Early adopters stand to gain significantly, with projections indicating increases of up to 5,000% following launch. Supported by a thorough smart contract examination and a dedication to transparency, the presale has already generated $5.6 million. Remittix is well-positioned to take the lead in the PayFi industry as the need for creative payment solutions increases. Conclusion While Ethereum and Bitcoin carve out their respective paths, the crypto world’s gaze is increasingly turning to Remittix. With its unique combination of blockchain technology and fiat systems, RTX is a unique way to solve practical financial problems. Remittix’s promise of faster, cheaper, and more transparent payments puts it in a position to change the game as Ethereum gets ready for its next update and Bitcoin maintains its leadership. With its presale gaining momentum, RTX is more than just a token; it’s a movement redefining global commerce. To learn more about Remittix, visit the Remittix presale and join the Remittix community.

The Ripple Labs legal team filed the request on Jan. 23, with the crypto company’s legal team noting that Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen and chief executive officer Brad Garlinghouse “join in this request.” “I write on behalf of Appellee-Cross-Appellant Ripple Labs Inc (“Ripple”) concerning the above appeal and cross-appeal. Under this Court’s Rule 31.2(a)(1)(B), Ripple requests a due date of April 16, 2025 for its brief. I am authorized to state that Appellees Bradley Garlinghouse and Christian A. Larsen join in this request,” Ripple Labs legal team member Michael Kellogg wrote. The SEC recently filed its brief, arguing against the ruling that retail sales of XRP ( XRP ) were not securities. In July 2023, Judge Analisa Torres of the New York District Court ruled that XRP was not a security, marking a notable victory for Ripple and the broader crypto industry. However, the court determined that Ripple violated securities laws in its institutional sales of the XRP token.

On Jan. 21, acting SEC chair Mark Uyeda announced a crypto task force to look into the agency’s approach to regulation of the sector amid plans to develop a clear framework. SEC has also been said to be looking at withdrawing certain crypto lawsuits.

To read full editions, subscribe . Crypto’s new viral app isn’t very new at all. Solana-based social project Clout saw its downloads take off after launching an iPhone app that lets users buy tokenized versions of social media profiles. This is very similar to the premise behind the viral 2023 app friend.tech, which was itself a rehashing of BitClout, a Crypto Twitter tokenization app that went viral in 2021. Friend.tech’s founding team already stepped away from the platform, while BitClout’s founder was just charged with fraud by the DOJ and the SEC. Clout hasn’t leaned away from its forefathers. The project posted a meme today riffing on Justin Timberlake’s famous line as Sean Parker in The Social Network: “Drop the ‘Bit.’ Just ‘Clout.’ It’s cleaner.” “Integrity and healthy tokenomics!” was Clout founder Ben Pasternak’s reply when I asked him what sets his app apart. At the time of writing, Clout was #34 on the App Store’s finance chart. The app is so congested that I haven’t been able to land a transaction all day. And Clout isn’t the only so-called SocialFi app grabbing Solana users’ attention. Tribe.run — which is still in invite-only mode — has also seen some momentum for a tokenized X profile app that creates token-gated group chats called tribes. I managed to snag an invite and have been enjoying the app, which features a nostalgic Windows 98-esque design. Tribe comes with an airdrop feature built in where I was able to send some of my token to my group chat members. This feature is enabled by Solana zero-knowledge compression . When I asked Tribe founder Bill Zheng why he thinks his app can succeed where friend.tech, for instance, failed, he said the former app had a “fundamental flaw” in that creators had no incentive to stay engaged. Tribe employs a subscription model where tribe members must pay a certain amount of SOL to stay in the group chat — giving the tribe creators a reason to stick around. Outside of Solana, Kaito AI has seen success with its Yaps platform that doles out points for users who are active — or who yap a lot, in internet parlance — on Crypto Twitter. SocialFi’s resilience underscores the resilience of Elon Musk’s social media platform. X remains the center of the online crypto world, and until that changes, crypto social apps will keep testing out new ways to monetize Crypto Twitter.

This makes them the second and third fund managers to do so after Canary Capital. Grayscale And Coinshares File For Litecoin ETF In an X post , the President of the ETF Store, Nate Geraci, revealed that Grayscale and Coinshares have filed with the US SEC to offer a Litecoin ETF. In Grayscale’s case, the asset manager filed a 19b-4 form to list and trade its Grayscale Litecoin Trust as an ETF. Meanwhile, Coinshares filed an S-1 form with the Commission to offer an LTC ETF. These are the second and third applications for such ETF following Canary Capital’s filing last year. This continues the flurry of crypto-related ETFs that have flooded in ever since US President Donald Trump took office and designated Mark Uyeda as the acting US SEC Chair . There is optimism that the new SEC administration would be more open to approving these funds, unlike the previous administration under Gary Gensler. Moreover, Trump has already vowed to make the US the crypto capital . It is worth mentioning that Grayscale has also filed for a Bitcoin Adapters ETF and a Solana ETF. The asset manager refiled to convert its Solana Trust into an ETF. Meanwhile, besides a Litecoin ETF, Coinshares has also filed with the US SEC to offer an XRP ETF. Coinshares becomes the sixth asset manager to file for an XRP ETF after REX Shares filed for one earlier this week.

It is considered to be more efficient as it allows APs closely monitor the demand for the ETF and to act fast by buying or selling shares of the fund without cash being involved in the process. Retail investors are not eligible to participate.

However, the token is now testing a key resistance level at $2.10, a level historically associated with selling pressure and price declines. $7.18 Million LDO Inflows into Exchanges As LDO’s price surged, on-chain data from CoinGlass revealed an inflow of $7.18 million worth of LDO tokens into exchanges, hinting that long-term holders or whales may be preparing to sell. Source: Coinglass The inflows into the exchanges suggest that long-term holders or whales have moved their holdings to the exchanges for a potential sell-off. However, this could lead to selling pressure and further price decline. Looking at such a dump in the past 24 hours indicates that history may repeat itself. Lido DAO (LDO) Technical Analysis and Key Levels According to expert technical analysis, LDO appears bullish but is currently at a crucial resistance level of $2.10. LDO’s daily chart shows that its price has reached this level more than twice, and each time, it has witnessed a price drop of over 28%, from $2.08 to $1.47. Source: Trading View However, this time, due to past history, investors have begun dumping their holdings and speculating that LDO could once again drop by 28% to reach the $1.47 level. Conversely, if the current sentiment for LDO continues and the price breaches the resistance level, closing a daily candle above $2.10, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 65% to reach the $3.50 level. However, in the cryptocurrency market, such a rally is easily achievable. LDO is currently trading near $2 and has experienced a price surge of over 15.50% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume has jumped by 78%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors compared to previous days.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,LDO|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-24 21:54:32

Your teacher told you to write it as if to an alien, a being who had never encountered a cookie before, which meant touching on each sense – sight, sound, smell, touch, taste. You might not have realized it then, but describing something in a way that allows people to get a clear picture is actually quite hard. Let me try to describe Matheus Pagani, founder and CEO of Venture Miner. Matheus is a male with light caramel skin and dark brown hair. Even though his hair is cut close, you can tell it’s curly. He’s got a thick dark brown, almost black beard, which connects to a mustache. His eyes are dark brown behind thin wire glasses. His bottom lip sticks out a little further from his top lip, giving him a look of assurance, but not arrogance. Picturing him yet? How confident are you? Oh yeah, and he’s Brazilian. Got it? Let’s see what Matheus Pagani actually looks like. Is this what you had come up with in your head from my description? Doubt it. Whenever I told you he was Brazilian, did you accessorize him in bright colors and a feathered headdress? Something like this? If so, check your bias, but also you’re thinking like an AI. That was what ChatGPT came up with from the prompt “some Brazilians having fun.” Pagani showed this and other examples spit out by our generative AI (Italians have fun by sitting around long tables with multiple generations eating pizza) during the AI2Web3 Bootcamp in NYC in early December. The bootcamp, run by Pagani and Build City, brought together 59 participants across all skill levels to learn how the two buzziest (and often misunderstood) technologies can be brought together to create useful products and services. Pagani used a version of the middle-school assignment to explain how and why AI made the significant leaps that have kept us all excited and on edge over the past few years. Before there was largely only text data being used to train AIs, and as the exercise highlights, that only goes so far. But mix text information with visual data, and you get a fuller picture. And understanding this, getting hands on with both AI and blockchain technology to understand its core components is what the bootcamp was all about. For Pagani, these skills are going to be relevant for nearly all people – engineers, tech users, journalists, artists, doctors – real soon. “We want to join brilliant minds from all backgrounds to come and work with AI and Web3, since the junction of their multiple perspectives can uncover new use cases that we would never envision just with a specialized Web3 or AI mindset alone,” Pagani said. “Nowadays we have tools to easily enable any non-technical enthusiasts to build practically functional applications and systems just with ""plain English,"" so what matters is bringing passionate people interested in solving problems together with the proper education. When you have this combination, you just need to light the match and watch it burn.” Mind-Boggling Building What makes the intersection of these two technologies so exciting is just how much you can build in such a short amount of time without really any prior technical experience. Not only will AI source whole codebases with the right prompt, but the crypto industry is also building tools to help make developing at the intersection of both more intuitive and accessible. For instance, Coinbase, who sponsored the bootcamp, launched AgentKit in November. The framework allows developers to build AI agents with their own crypto wallets , enabling the agents to interact autonomously with blockchain networks. This could be used to build a squad of agents that can monitor the markets and execute trades automatically based on predefined rules and guardrails. “One day, we’ll have AI agents own their own cars and operate their own taxi service that gets paid by customers in crypto and then uses that crypto to purchase repairs,” Lincoln Murr, associate product manager at Coinbase, told the attendees. Coinbase currently has a grants program ongoing for building with AgentKit. “What you build doesn’t have to be useful; we have a bias towards cool stuff,” Murr told the bootcamp, hoping to inspire projects and applications that no one has yet thought of. Ora Network also has an interesting model for developers looking to build AI-enabled Web3 applications or vice versa. The network allows developers to utilize current large language models, including Meta’s Llama3 and Stable Diffusion, but it also enables developers to build their own models and offer a so-called initial model offering (IMO) to crowdfund its continued development. “It’s kind of winner-takes-all right now in AI, but with this model, we’re allowing the crowdfunding of AI building and training, so people can have a share of the models, which is empowering if we think these models will run society in a decade,” Alec James, partnerships and growth lead at Ora, said during the bootcamp. “If that’s the case, we’ll want that development distributed.” Near, Fleek and Alora were also among the companies that sponsored the bootcamp and presented their various tools and programs for building at the intersection of these two innovative technologies. Can Devs Do Something? During the final day of the bootcamp, nine teams presented working prototypes for projects that blended Web3 and AI. These projects ranged from AI assistants meant to help you pick gifts, order delivery or diversify your financial portfolio to applications to help crypto operators pump out memecoins with big virality potential. Jackie Joya, a participant who had flown in from San Francisco, said the bootcamp has really inspired her to keep building. With a background in animal science, Joya is still new to engineering, but was amazed how much a novice could build with the tools available. Other participants, across all skill levels, said similar things. Choudhury Imtiaz, a market researcher from Bangladesh, who is in the U.S. on an H-1B1 Visa waiting for a placement, hasn’t heard of Web3 before the bootcamp, but was able to pitch a team project on the last day. And Isayah Culbertson, who has worked as an engineer for both crypto and AI projects separately, was able to learn skills for building with both, which he thinks has the potential to change the world for the better. “I see the combination accelerating the research and development of so many different fields, while also allowing for a more equitable distribution of wealth generated from that R&D,” he said.",Opinion,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|SPONSORED|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-24 21:55:52

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. BeerBear, a new meme coin, is emerging as a potential rival to altcoin titans like Chainlink and Sui. Table of Contents Chainlink SUI BeerBear Conclusion The crypto world is buzzing with speculation and profit-hunting, but not all coins are equal when it comes to massive gains. Altcoin titans like SUI and LINK may have solid reputations, but they’re losing steam. Meanwhile, a hidden gem called BeerBear is capturing the attention of speculators with its growth potential. Chainlink Chainlink has long been a favorite among altcoin fans, but its glory days appear to be fading. The Chainlink chart reveals a history of volatility in recent years. Despite occasional recoveries, the asset has failed to maintain higher levels, indicating weak long-term momentum. LINK’s recent growth appears more like short-term speculation rather than a foundation for future gains. The chart lacks clear signals of stability or the potential for significant growth. It’s hard to get excited about a coin that keeps teasing gains but fails to deliver. The LINK army is starting to dwindle, and the market sentiment is shifting toward other opportunities. SUI SUI entered the market with promise but its hype is wearing thin. The price has stagnated, and many experts are finding it hard to argue for any substantial upward movement. With trading volume declining and whales exiting the scene, SUI looks more like a fading star than a new powerhouse.
