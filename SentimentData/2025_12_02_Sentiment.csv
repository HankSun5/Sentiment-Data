That’s a 200,000 increase from Wednesday and a 15% spike overnight, signaling a notable surge in XRP Ledger usage. This jump could be driven by increased automation, whale movements, or early institutional interest following the rollout of XRP-related ETFs in the U.S. market. But despite the spike in network activity, XRP has dropped 6.7% in the past 24 hours, falling back to $2.04 after briefly reclaiming higher levels last week. Trading volumes have nearly doubled to $4 billion, suggesting that sellers are becoming more aggressive. Whether this payment surge is the start of a larger move or a warning sign remains to be seen. XRP Price Prediction: Will $1.90 Hold or Trigger a Deeper Crash? XRP found temporary support at $1.90 in late November after a strong U.S. jobs report and dovish comments from the New York Federal Reserve helped lift risk sentiment. While that level provided a short-term bounce, buyers failed to follow through with enough momentum to spark a full recovery. Source: TradingView Now, despite the increase in XRP Ledger usage, the XRP price prediction looks rather bearish. The price appears to be on track to retest the $1.90 zone once again. If it breaks below this key level, a sharper correction toward $1.65 could follow, marking a potential 19% downside from current levels. If support holds at that level, we may see bulls re-enter to push prices to new highs in 2026. In this kind of environment, where uncertainty dominates, early-stage presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) may offer better upside than legacy tokens, especially as attention shifts to faster, more scalable networks. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): Solana Technology Unlocks Real Scaling for Bitcoin Bitcoin has the trust and liquidity, but it has struggled to support the kind of innovation seen on faster chains. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) solves this by using Solana technology to build the first true Layer 2 for Bitcoin, bringing speed, scalability, and smart contract support to the network. With this upgrade, developers can finally launch DeFi platforms, payment systems, and even meme coins that run fast, cost less, and stay connected to Bitcoin’s underlying value. It’s Solana-level performance, built directly on top of the world’s most trusted blockchain. As a result, BTC investors can start earning yield, staking, and lending their assets right away after sending their tokens to the Hyper Bridge. As wallets and exchanges adopt the solution, the demand for $HYPER is expected to increase over time. To buy $HYPER before the next price increase, you can head to the official Bitcoin Hyper website and link up a compatible wallet like Best Wallet . Simply swap USDT or ETH to buy or use a bank card instead.

55222050,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=224791,1764631510,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Massive Bitcoin Whale Transfer: 4,683 BTC Moves from Kraken in $405 Million Mystery",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-whale-transfer-kraken-unknown-wallet/,"BitcoinWorld Massive Bitcoin Whale Transfer: 4,683 BTC Moves from Kraken in $405 Million Mystery In a move that instantly captured the cryptocurrency community’s attention, blockchain tracker Whale Alert reported a staggering Bitcoin whale transfer . A colossal 4,683 BTC, worth approximately $405 million, was moved from the major exchange Kraken to a private, unknown wallet. This single transaction highlights the immense scale at which major players, or ‘whales,’ operate within the Bitcoin ecosystem, often sending ripples through the entire market. What Does This $405 Million Bitcoin Whale Transfer Mean? When a Bitcoin whale transfer of this magnitude occurs, analysts and traders scramble to interpret its implications. A transfer from an exchange to a private wallet is typically seen as a ‘withdrawal’ from the trading platform. This action generally suggests the holder is moving their assets into long-term storage, a strategy often referred to as ‘HODLing.’ Therefore, this move could signal strong conviction in Bitcoin’s future value, as the whale chooses to secure their holdings offline rather than keep them readily available for sale. However, the ‘unknown’ nature of the destination wallet adds a layer of intrigue. It could belong to: A wealthy individual securing their fortune. A cryptocurrency fund or institution rebalancing its cold storage. A custody solution for a corporate treasury. This ambiguity is what fuels market speculation after every major Bitcoin whale transfer . Why Should Everyday Investors Care About Whale Movements? You might wonder why a single transaction between two wallets matters to you. The answer lies in market psychology and liquidity. Large Bitcoin whale transfer events can influence market sentiment in several key ways. First, removing such a significant amount of Bitcoin from an exchange reduces the immediate sell-side pressure. Fewer coins are available on the order books, which can contribute to price stability or even upward momentum if demand remains constant. Conversely, a transfer *to* an exchange often signals an impending sale, which can worry the market. Second, these movements serve as a high-profile indicator of what the largest and often most informed players are doing. While not a guaranteed signal, a withdrawal of this size suggests confidence, which can have a trickle-down effect on retail investor sentiment. The Security and Transparency of Blockchain This event perfectly showcases the dual nature of Bitcoin’s blockchain: transparent yet private. Anyone can see the transaction hash, amount, and wallet addresses involved thanks to the public ledger. This transparency allows services like Whale Alert to exist and provides a level of auditability unmatched in traditional finance. However, the identity of the wallet owner remains protected. We know *what* happened and *where* the coins went, but not *who* was behind it. This balance is a foundational principle of cryptocurrency, ensuring financial privacy while maintaining a verifiable record of all transactions. What’s Next After a Major Bitcoin Whale Transfer? Following a Bitcoin whale transfer , the market typically watches for two things. The first is any immediate impact on Bitcoin’s price. The second, and often more telling, is the wallet’s future activity. Will it remain dormant, signaling long-term holding? Or will it become active, potentially moving funds to other wallets or back to an exchange? The community will be monitoring this ‘unknown wallet’ closely, as its next move could provide further clues about the whale’s strategy. In conclusion, the movement of 4,683 BTC from Kraken is more than just a large number on a screen. It is a powerful reminder of the scale of the Bitcoin economy, the behavior of its most significant holders, and the transparent yet private nature of its underlying technology. While the exact intent behind this Bitcoin whale transfer remains a mystery, it underscores a narrative of accumulation and long-term belief that continues to define the asset’s journey. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a “Bitcoin whale”? A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Bitcoin. Their transactions are significant enough to potentially influence the market price due to the sheer volume of assets they move. Why transfer Bitcoin from an exchange to an unknown wallet? The primary reasons are security and long-term holding. Private wallets (especially cold storage) offer greater security against exchange hacks. Moving coins off an exchange signals an intent to hold rather than trade in the short term. How can we track these large transfers? Blockchain analysis firms and bots like Whale Alert monitor the public Bitcoin ledger in real-time. They flag transactions that exceed a certain value threshold and publish alerts on social media. Does a whale transfer always mean the price will go up? Not necessarily. While a withdrawal from an exchange is often viewed as bullish, it is not a guaranteed price indicator. Many other macroeconomic and technical factors drive Bitcoin’s price. What is an “unknown wallet”? An unknown wallet is simply a cryptocurrency address that has not been publicly linked to a known identity, exchange, or institution. Its owner remains anonymous. Is my Bitcoin safe if I keep it on an exchange like Kraken? While major exchanges invest heavily in security, the principle “not your keys, not your coins” applies. For maximum security, especially for large holdings, transferring to a self-custody wallet is recommended. Found this deep dive into the recent whale movement insightful?

55222170,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=224790,1764631811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Resilient Yearn.finance Hack Recovery: How $2.4M Was Reclaimed,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/yearn-finance-hack-recovery-explained/,"BitcoinWorld Resilient Yearn.finance Hack Recovery: How $2.4M Was Reclaimed In a stunning display of resilience, the decentralized finance protocol Yearn.finance has successfully recovered a significant portion of assets stolen in a recent security breach. This Yearn.finance hack recovery effort represents a crucial victory for the DeFi community, showcasing that even in the face of sophisticated attacks, protocols can fight back. Let’s explore how this recovery happened and what it means for the future of decentralized finance security. How Did the Yearn.finance Hack Unfold? The attack on Yearn.finance exploited specific vulnerabilities in the protocol’s smart contract code. According to the team’s investigation, the perpetrator manipulated an “unchecked arithmetic” logic flaw combined with a design defect. This combination created a dangerous loophole that allowed the attacker to mint unlimited amounts of yETH tokens. Once the attacker created these tokens, they used them to repeatedly withdraw the underlying collateral from the protocol. The total losses from this sophisticated attack reached approximately $9 million, making it one of the more significant DeFi security incidents in recent months. What Made the Yearn.finance Hack Recovery Possible? The successful Yearn.finance hack recovery of $2.4 million didn’t happen by accident. Several factors contributed to this positive outcome: Rapid response team activation immediately after detecting the exploit Collaboration with security partners who specialize in blockchain forensics Transparent communication with the community about the incident Strategic tracking of the stolen assets across blockchain addresses So far, the recovery team has successfully reclaimed 857.49 pxETH from some of the attacker’s addresses. This represents about 27% of the total stolen funds, with recovery efforts continuing through coordinated security partnerships. Why Does This Recovery Matter for DeFi Security? The Yearn.finance hack recovery sets an important precedent for the entire decentralized finance ecosystem. While security breaches remain a significant concern, this incident demonstrates that protocols can implement effective response strategies. The recovery shows that DeFi platforms are maturing in their approach to security incidents. Moreover, this event highlights the importance of having robust security partnerships and response plans in place before incidents occur. The speed and coordination displayed by Yearn.finance likely prevented further losses and enabled the partial recovery of stolen assets. What Are the Key Takeaways for Crypto Investors? For investors participating in decentralized finance, the Yearn.finance hack recovery offers several important lessons: Protocol resilience matters – How a platform responds to security incidents is as important as preventing them Transparency builds trust – Clear communication during crises maintains community confidence Security is an ongoing process – Even established protocols must continuously audit and improve their code Recovery is possible – Not all stolen crypto assets disappear forever While the full $9 million hasn’t been recovered yet, the $2.4 million reclaimed represents a significant achievement in the ongoing battle against DeFi exploits. How Will This Impact Future Yearn.finance Development? The Yearn.finance hack recovery effort will likely influence the protocol’s future development roadmap. Security audits will probably become more rigorous, and the team may implement additional safeguards against similar attack vectors. This incident serves as a powerful reminder that even experienced DeFi protocols must remain vigilant about potential vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the recovery process itself provides valuable data about how attackers operate and how stolen funds move through the blockchain ecosystem. This information can help strengthen not just Yearn.finance but the entire DeFi space against future attacks. Conclusion: A Testament to DeFi Resilience The successful Yearn.finance hack recovery of $2.4 million demonstrates that decentralized finance protocols are developing the maturity to handle security crises effectively. While the incident revealed vulnerabilities that need addressing, the coordinated response and partial asset recovery show promising progress in DeFi security practices. This event ultimately strengthens the argument for continued innovation in decentralized finance while emphasizing that security must remain a top priority. The recovery serves as both a cautionary tale and an inspiring example of resilience in the face of adversity. Frequently Asked Questions How much did Yearn.finance recover from the hack? Yearn.finance recovered approximately $2.4 million worth of assets from the $9 million hack, representing about 27% of the total stolen funds. What vulnerability did the hacker exploit? The attacker exploited an “unchecked arithmetic” logic flaw combined with a design defect that allowed unlimited minting of yETH tokens, which were then used to withdraw collateral. Is my money safe on Yearn.finance now? While the protocol has recovered some funds and is addressing vulnerabilities, all DeFi investments carry inherent risks. Users should conduct their own research and consider security practices before investing. How did Yearn.finance track and recover the stolen assets? The protocol worked with security partners specializing in blockchain forensics to trace the stolen funds across addresses and successfully recover 857.49 pxETH from some attacker-controlled wallets. Will there be compensation for affected users? Yearn.finance has not announced specific compensation plans, but the recovery of $2.4 million may help mitigate losses. Users should monitor official announcements for updates. What measures is Yearn.finance taking to prevent future hacks? The protocol is likely implementing more rigorous security audits, code reviews, and potentially new safeguards based on lessons learned from this incident.

His view is that this development will help reveal how aggressively issuers intend to build long-term XRP positions now that several funds are operating simultaneously. Expanded ETF Lineup Marks a New Phase The latest entrant, the 21Shares XRP ETF (TOXR), begins trading today and joins existing products from Bitwise, Canary Capital, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton . According to Steingraber, having these issuers participate in the market at the same time offers the clearest opportunity yet to assess institutional appetite for XRP. Even before the fifth fund came online, the combined inflows were considerable. Over the past month, total net inflows exceeded $666 million without a single day of outflows. Bitwise increased its holdings to 80.5 million XRP last week, while Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, and Canary Capital also expanded their positions. Steingraber argues that these early figures represent only a preliminary stage and anticipates stronger accumulation as more U.S. issuers complete their launches. Next week is a big milestone for XRP. We will have the first full week of trading with 5 pure spot ETF's running in competition. It's going to tell us ALOT by the end of week what we can expect for these funds acquiring XRP for the long term. https://t.co/S3TENqa4PP pic.twitter.com/LQ48QLKcgh — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) November 30, 2025 Analyst Simulation Suggests Limited Available Supply Financial analyst Mohamed Bangura conducted a sensitivity model that attempts to project how ETF participation may influence market dynamics. His model used several assumptions: an average daily ETF demand of 74.5 million XRP, a circulating exchange supply of roughly 2.7 billion XRP, a scheduled escrow release of 300 million XRP every 30 days, and elasticity values of 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 across a 180-day window. Bangura concluded that when elasticity is on the lower end, available exchange supply diminishes rapidly. At higher elasticity levels, prices respond more sharply because additional liquidity must be sourced from OTC markets. He emphasized that even without assuming strong emotional trading behavior, the projected outcomes indicate significant upward pressure on the market. Steingraber highlighted the model to support his argument that ETF-related demand may be absorbing liquid XRP more quickly than previously assumed. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Concerns About OTC Liquidity Intensify Parallel to this analysis, Digital Ascension Group CEO Jake Claver has expressed concerns that OTC and dark-pool liquidity may already be strained. He estimates that approximately 800 million XRP of private-market liquidity was acquired during the first week of ETF accumulation, representing almost half of the supply he believes was previously accessible off-exchange. Currently, XRP ETFs collectively manage more than $687 million in assets, equivalent to slightly over 300 million XRP. Since most ETF accumulation occurs away from public exchanges, the price has not yet reflected the reduction in available tokens. Claver argues that more pronounced market volatility will likely emerge when ETFs are compelled to source XRP directly from exchanges rather than from private channels. The launch of the 21Shares fund, which begins with a 0.50% management fee and a $500,000 seed basket, introduces additional competition among issuers. With five spot XRP ETFs now active and two more expected to enter the market, Steingraber maintains that the coming days will be a critical period for understanding how institutional investors intend to position themselves. According to him, this week represents a significant milestone for XRP and could offer early indications of longer-term demand trends.

Moreover, this technology helps to develop different stages of more advanced AI technology within the blockchain. Bittensor also uses its TAO token to incentivize node operators and AI developers. What’s next for Bittensor and TAO in 2025 and beyond? Let’s get into the TAO price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Bittensor Ticker TAO Current price $267.44 Market cap $2.51B Trading volume (24-hour) $185.72M Circulating supply 9.59M TAO All-time low $30.40 on May 14, 2023 All-time high $767.68 on Apr 11, 2024 24-hour low $255.66 24-hour high $290.34 TAO price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Volatility (30-day variation) 17.31% (Very High) 14-day RSI 38.96 (Neutral) 50-day SMA $377.03 200-day SMA $343.44 Sentiment Bearish Fear and greed index 24 (Extreme Fear) Green days 9/30 (30%) Bittensor price analysis TL;DR Breakdown : TAO is testing major support around $260, where sellers seem to be tiring. A short-term bounce is forming, but the broader trend remains bearish. On December 1, 2025, Bittensor’s price analysis indicates a clear bearish trend as TAO drops to $266.6, representing a 7.75% decline over the past 24 hours. Sellers remain in control, though the price hovering near the $260 support may attract short-term traders looking for intraday volatility. TAO/USD 1-day chart analysis Tao’s daily candle shows the coin sinking 7.75% and pressing directly onto the lower Bollinger Band at $263, which often signals a stretched downside and can trigger short-term relief bounces. The price remains firmly below $308, confirming that the broader trend structure remains decisively bearish. The wick rejection near $254 reinforces that sellers attempted but failed to extend a breakdown, suggesting early fatigue at these levels. TAO/USD 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The MACD remains negative, with the histogram easing slightly, creating a subtle flattening that suggests weakening downside momentum rather than an imminent reversal. Meanwhile, the RSI, hovering near 37, shows Bittensor approaching oversold territory without fully entering it, indicating that while bearish pressure persists, sellers may soon lose efficiency if sub-$260 liquidity is tested again. TAO/USD 4-hour chart analysis On the 4-hour chart, TAO shows a decisive green candle closing at $266.8, reclaiming almost all of the previous session’s sell-off and producing the first meaningful bullish reaction in several sessions. Even so, the price remains below all three Alligator lines, which continue sloping downward. This layout confirms that while buyers have stepped in, the dominant intraday trend is still bearish, and rallies into those moving averages are likely to encounter resistance. TAO/USD 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView The MACD histogram remains negative but is shrinking noticeably, reinforcing the idea that intraday sellers are losing strength. The strong reversal candle off the $258–$260 zone marks a credible short-term demand area that aligns with the lower band region on the 1-day chart. Bittensor technical indicators: Levels and actions Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $307.41 SELL SMA 5 $308.35 SELL SMA 10 $306.14 SELL SMA 21 $322.36 SELL SMA 50 $377.03 SELL SMA 100 $353.41 SELL SMA 200 $342.44 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $332.73 SELL EMA 5 $344.97 SELL EMA 10 $349.15 SELL EMA 21 $349.99 SELL EMA 50 $357.85 SELL EMA 100 $363.10 SELL EMA 200 $369.96 SELL What can we expect from Bittensor price analysis next? TAO appears primed for a relief bounce rather than a trend reversal, with buyers likely to defend $260 while overhead resistances slow any sustained breakout. If bulls fail to reclaim $280–$285, the downtrend will resume. If they succeed, TAO can extend to over $300. Is Bittensor TAO a good investment? TAO coin continues to trade higher, indicating growing adoption among crypto investors. Despite this, the coin faces uncertainties and volatility like all other cryptocurrencies. Our Cryptopolitan price prediction explores its expected movements from 2025 to 2031. Why is TAO down? TAO is down primarily due to high volatility, sell pressure from validators, and weak market sentiment surrounding speculative AI tokens. Recent breakdowns below key support levels also accelerated the decline. How much is the Bittensor stock worth? Bittensor (TAO) powers the Bittensor Network and is not a stock. Stocks are usually traded on stock exchanges, and stock ownership represents a stake in a company. Buying TAO tokens gives the buyer certain rights within the Bittensor Network, for example, governance participation but not ownership in a company. However, Bittensor (TAO) tokens can be purchased and traded on different exchanges, including Binance, Bitget, Coinbase, KuCoin, and Kraken.

Over the past week, the altcoin has shown signs of weakness, with long-term holders starting to move their coins.

Despite a small bounce earlier in the week, ADA failed to build any lasting momentum, leaving the risk of new lows on the table, something big wallets appear to be avoiding.

The MACD golden cross stands to be short-lived, already teetering on a death cross back below the signal line.

A breakdown of the channel eyes another 35% crash to $0.24, a support level that has acted as a firm bottom throughout this market cycle. However, with a catalyst for demand like Spot ETF approval or favourable macro conditions for a U.S. interest rate ease in December, a false breakdown could put the bullish case back in focus.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is poised to release its first draft of proposed stablecoin rules under the groundbreaking GENIUS Act before the month ends. This move signals a pivotal step toward formal federal oversight for dollar-pegged digital currencies, directly impacting issuers and the entire market’s future stability. What Are the New FDIC Stablecoin Rules? According to a report from CoinDesk, the FDIC has officially started the regulatory process. Commissioner Travis Hill outlined the timeline in written testimony to the House Financial Services Committee. The agency plans to publish the draft application rules for potential stablecoin issuers by year’s end. However, the core of the framework—the prudential standards—will come early next year. These standards will define the crucial capital and liquidity requirements that FDIC-supervised issuers must meet to operate legally. Why Do These Stablecoin Regulations Matter? For years, stablecoins have operated in a regulatory gray area. The lack of clear federal stablecoin rules created uncertainty for businesses and risks for consumers. The GENIUS Act and the FDIC’s forthcoming regulations aim to change that by establishing a clear playbook. This matters because: Consumer Protection: FDIC involvement suggests a focus on safeguarding user funds, potentially increasing public trust. Market Legitimacy: Clear rules can attract more institutional investment and traditional finance players into the crypto space. Financial Stability: By ensuring issuers hold sufficient reserves, the rules aim to prevent a “run” on a stablecoin that could ripple through the broader economy. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Regulators and Issuers? While the path forward is clearer, implementing these stablecoin rules won’t be simple. The FDIC must balance innovation with safety. Key challenges include determining the exact level of reserves needed and defining what qualifies as high-quality liquid assets. For existing issuers, adapting to these new capital and compliance requirements may be a significant operational hurdle. Moreover, how these federal rules interact with existing state-level money transmitter licenses remains a critical question. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community What should you do as this regulatory process unfolds? First, closely monitor the FDIC’s draft release later this month—it will be the first concrete look at the government’s vision. Second, understand that compliance will become a primary competitive advantage for stablecoin projects. Finally, recognize that well-crafted stablecoin rules could ultimately be a positive catalyst, transforming stablecoins from a crypto niche into a mainstream financial tool integrated with traditional banking. The Bottom Line on the New Regulatory Push The imminent release of the FDIC’s draft marks a watershed moment. The era of the “wild west” for dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies is ending. The proposed stablecoin rules under the GENIUS Act will set the foundational standards for a safer, more transparent, and potentially more widely adopted stablecoin ecosystem in the United States. The coming months will define the practical reality of this new framework. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is the GENIUS Act? A: The GENIUS Act is a proposed U.S. federal law designed to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for payment stablecoins, assigning oversight roles to agencies like the FDIC. Q: When will the final stablecoin rules be in effect? A: The FDIC plans to propose prudential standards (like capital rules) early next year. The final rules will follow a public comment period, so they are likely not to be fully implemented until late 2025 or beyond. Q: Will this affect stablecoins like USDC and USDT? A: Yes, if they wish to operate as “payment stablecoins” under U.S. jurisdiction and seek federal approval, they will need to comply with these new FDIC rules. Q: Does this mean stablecoins will be FDIC-insured? A: Not necessarily. The FDIC is acting as the prudential regulator for issuers. It does not automatically mean individual user holdings will receive FDIC deposit insurance; that is a separate determination. Q: How will this impact crypto exchanges? A: Exchanges will likely need to list and support stablecoins from FDIC-approved issuers, which could change the competitive landscape of which stablecoins are most widely used.

He will be replaced by Amar Subramanya, a former Microsoft researcher and a former member of Google’s DeepMind AI team. Giannandrea has been in the lead position since joining the iPhone maker in 2018. According to the company, he will remain the company’s advisor until retiring next spring. Giannandrea steps down following delays in Siri and AI projects The shift comes amid mounting frustrations over missed milestones — most notably, the delayed relaunch of the company’s virtual assistant, Siri, and the underwhelming initial reception of Apple’s broader AI efforts. In March 2025, the tech firm removed Siri from its oversight and reassigned it to other executives; just weeks later, a secretive robotics division also slipped out of its purview. The company’s change in AI leadership comes as experts this year have said Apple has fallen behind its tech peers in artificial intelligence. This technology field has been reinvigorated since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in 2022. Apple Intelligence, which aimed to position the company alongside AI leaders such as OpenAI and Google, has not been well-received by users and critics. Earlier this year, one of its most critical aspects, a significantly improved Siri assistant, was delayed until 2026 , showing major development struggles. Apple seeks to recalibrate AI strategy as competition heats up Subramanya will serve as Vice President of AI, reporting to Craig Federighi, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Software Engineering. Cook noted that Federighi already played a key role in the company’s AI efforts. Federighi is Apple’s top software executive. “In addition to growing his leadership team and AI responsibilities with Amar’s joining, Craig has been instrumental in driving our AI efforts, including overseeing our work to bring a more personalized Siri to users next year,” Cook said in a statement. Subramanya, who has spent 16 years at Alphabet Inc.’s Google and most recently served as Microsoft Corp.’s corporate vice president of AI, is expected to lead Apple’s core “foundation models,”. He will also be in charge of machine‑learning research and AI safety efforts, indicating a renewed push at the firm to recalibrate its AI strategy. In a brief statement, Apple CEO Tim Cook thanked Giannandrea for “the role he played in building and advancing our AI work,” while expressing optimism for the road ahead under Subramanya’s leadership. Subramanya will lead teams at the iPhone maker working on the company’s foundation models, research, and AI safety. Other teams initially under Giannandrea will be moved under Chief Operating Officer Sabih Khan and Services Chief Eddy Cue, Apple said. Apple shares, which are up 16% in 2025 so far, have lagged behind many other big technology companies, as investors have perceived the tech firm as falling behind those investing billions in AI chips and frontier model chatbots. In August, the company announced a “significant increase” in its spending on AI, and Cook has labeled it a “profound” technology. Apple has struck a deal with OpenAI, the leader in AI, to integrate ChatGPT into some of its products, such as Siri. But Apple is playing a different game than companies like Microsoft, Google, and Meta. It is spending much less on infrastructure for the technology. The company also prefers its AI to run on its devices, instead of communicating back to more powerful computers in the cloud. Giannandrea’s departure highlights the struggles in Apple’s AI plans. What was once expected to make the company a leader in AI now appears to be a project facing challenges that require new ideas and direction. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

55223051,637612,1764633618,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55223051.jpeg,"Crypto Lending Rebuilds From The Rubble, Reaching $25B In New Activity—Study",https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-lending-rebuilds-from-the-rubble-reaching-25b-in-new-activity-study/,"Reports have disclosed that centralized crypto lending climbed to roughly $25 billion in outstanding loans in the third quarter, a figure that signals renewed activity among centralized platforms. Activity has picked up this year, and some firms that survived the recent shake-out are growing their loan books again. CeFi Surges According to Galaxy Research , the broader crypto lending market totaled about $36.5 billion as of Q4 2024, down from a high of $64.4 billion in Q4 2021. That drop reflects the fallout from earlier platform failures and bankruptcies that cut into both supply and demand. The makeup of the market has shifted. Based on reports , the largest centralized lenders — including Tether, Galaxy and Ledn — now account for a large share of CeFi loans. Those three together held close to $10 billion of CeFi outstanding loans, equal to roughly 88.6% of that segment by the end of last year. Tether alone represented the biggest single slice. DeFi Borrowing Sees A Strong Comeback DeFi borrowing has recovered sharply from the lows of the 2022–2023 downturn. Open borrows on decentralized platforms climbed from about $1.8 billion in the trough to $19 billion by the end of 2024, an increase of 959% over the period. This shows many users moved back to on-chain solutions as centralized options contracted. Why Numbers Matter Now Market watchers say the new totals matter because they reveal where activity lives today: more on chain, and concentrated among fewer centralized players. Some lenders appear to be operating with higher collateral levels and clearer reporting than some of the failed firms of past years. That has calmed some investors. Still, the total lending market is far below its 2021 size. Risks Remain The concentration of CeFi loans in a handful of firms raises questions about single-point stress. If one large lender faces trouble, contagion could spread. Price swings in major cryptocurrencies also leave loans vulnerable to rapid liquidations. Regulators are watching the sector closely, and policy changes could reshape where and how loans are made. What To Watch Next Observers will be watching quarterly loan books, the pace of on-chain borrowing, and any signals of new capital flowing into lending desks. The market is rebuilding, but it is rebuilding in a changed form — smaller than the peak in 2021 and more split between centralized players and DeFi protocols.

Related Reading: $300 Million Crypto Bet: Kazakhstan’s Central Bank Gears Up The decline occurs amid outflows, a weakening market structure, and fading speculative interest, raising questions about whether a deeper correction may be underway. DOGE's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Dogecoin Breaks Key Supports as Selling Pressure Mounts Dogecoin slipped below important support areas after breaking a bullish trend line on the hourly chart, continuing a multi-day downtrend. The price now trades below the 100-hour simple moving average, near $0.13, with MACD momentum strengthening in the bearish zone and the RSI remaining below 50. The coin declined more than 8% in 24 hours, falling through multiple Fibonacci retracement zones and failing to regain footing above the 23.6% level of the latest swing move. Analysts note that immediate resistance lies near the 50% retracement of the recent decline. A close above that threshold is needed to ease short-term downside pressure. Failure to break above these resistance areas has kept momentum tilted toward sellers, with a retest of recent lows likely if the market does not stabilize. Weak Flows and Derivatives Contraction Deepen Market Strain Spot market flows show persistent distribution. Recent data revealed a $5.7 million outflow, extending the multi-month trend of reduced accumulation from large holders. Earlier inflows that supported rallies toward $0.30 have given way to steady red prints, reflecting waning confidence among major players. Derivatives markets reinforce the weakening structure. Open interest has dropped more than 9% as traders unwind positions rather than add exposure during declines. Long-short ratios show a mild long bias, but price action has repeatedly invalidated those positions, triggering waves of long-side liquidations whenever DOGE attempts to rise above short-term moving averages. These repeated failed rallies have kept Dogecoin locked beneath declining EMAs between $0.154 and $0.202, a structure analysts say remains firmly bearish. DOGE ETF Disappointment and Market Rotation Add Further Pressure Dogecoin’s recently launched ETFs have not provided support. Combined inflows from major issuers barely surpassed $2 million, far below expectations and significantly weaker than the debut flows seen in Bitcoin or Ethereum funds. The soft demand has signaled limited institutional appetite for the memecoin, contributing to negative sentiment.

Several analysts argue that XRP may still be undervalued relative to its expanding relevance in international payments. A major point of debate is whether the global financial messaging network SWIFT could adopt XRP as a component of its settlement infrastructure or use it to complement its existing processes. Ripple Leadership Weighs In Ripple executives have addressed this topic for nearly a decade. In 2015, Ripple Chairman Chris Larsen explained that Ripple’s technology is designed to interconnect diverse payment systems and facilitate immediate settlement across different currencies. He emphasized that the company’s objective is not to displace networks such as SWIFT or ACH but to function alongside them to improve the efficiency of international transfers. In 2018, Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz stated that SWIFT’s exploration of blockchain could enhance competition with RippleNet. However, he also noted that such developments could create an opportunity for XRP to be incorporated as a settlement option for payments initiated through SWIFT. RippleNet's perhaps. But one obvious pivot would be to positioning XRP to settle Swift payments. — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) March 24, 2018 Years later, in 2025, SWIFT confirmed its intention to develop a blockchain-based ledger, further renewing industry interest in potential coordination between the two systems. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has expressed a more assertive view. He argued that SWIFT’s modernization efforts have been limited in scope and has predicted that the XRP Ledger (XRPL) could capture a significant share of SWIFT-related payment flows within several years. How XRP Could Function as a Liquidity Asset for SWIFT A scenario where SWIFT relies on XRP for liquidity does not require SWIFT to alter its messaging architecture. Financial institutions would continue using their existing formats for sending payment instructions. The main difference would arise during settlement. Under this model, funds would be converted from the originating currency into XRP, transferred instantly, and then converted into the destination currency. This process would reduce operational delays, lower costs, and reduce the amount of capital tied up in nostro-vostro accounts held across international banks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Price Outlook if SWIFT Utilizes XRP for Settlement Liquidity SWIFT facilitates approximately $150 trillion in annual global payment flows. If XRP were to serve as the liquidity asset enabling these transfers, its market valuation would likely need to expand significantly to support daily volume. To gauge the scale, the Google Gemini model was consulted for an illustrative calculation. The model noted that daily SWIFT volume averages around $411 billion. With XRP’s circulating supply at roughly 60.25 billion tokens, Gemini applied a conservative liquidity multiple of 100, resulting in an estimated required market capitalization of about $41.1 trillion. Dividing this figure by the circulating supply produced an implied utility-driven price of approximately $682 per token. Gemini added that speculative activity during a major adoption phase could raise the valuation further. Under a multiplier of up to 2.5, the projected range extended from $1,000 to $1,500 per token . If XRP were to reach the high-end estimates in this model, current holders would see substantial increases in portfolio value. For example, an individual with 5,000 XRP valued at around $10,300 today would hold approximately $5 million at a price of $1,000 per token, and around $7.5 million at $1,500. The projections presented by Gemini demonstrate how substantial the market impact could be if such an arrangement were ever implemented. However, the actual outcome would depend heavily on regulatory conditions, competing technologies, and the readiness of major financial institutions to adopt an alternative settlement framework.

On-chain analysts report the purchase, which points to growing institutional confidence in the second-largest cryptocurrency. This move raises important questions about market sentiment and the identity behind the wallet. What Did This Crypto Whale Address Actually Do? According to data from Onchain-Lenz, the unidentified crypto whale address purchased 7,080 ETH from the institutional exchange FalconX. The transaction, valued at approximately $19.89 million, significantly boosted the wallet’s holdings. Consequently, the address now possesses a total of 23,772 ETH, worth roughly $66.77 million at current prices. This is not a random retail investor. The scale of the purchase suggests a sophisticated entity with substantial capital. Furthermore, the use of FalconX, a platform catering to institutions, adds weight to this theory. Who Is Behind the Mysterious Crypto Whale Address? Suspicion points towards two potential owners: Bitmine (BMNR) or the Nasdaq-listed company SharpLink Gaming (SBET). Both entities have shown interest in digital assets, making them plausible candidates. Bitmine (BMNR): A company involved in cryptocurrency mining and blockchain technology. SharpLink Gaming (SBET): A gaming company that has previously explored integrations with cryptocurrency and blockchain. However, the true identity remains unconfirmed. This mystery highlights a key trend: large, traditional companies are increasingly moving capital into crypto assets like Ethereum. Therefore, tracking a major crypto whale address provides valuable insights into institutional behavior. Why Does a Large ETH Purchase Matter? A single crypto whale address moving tens of millions of dollars is a powerful market signal. It demonstrates several key points about the current landscape. Institutional Confidence: Large purchases often signal long-term belief in an asset’s value, beyond short-term price speculation. Market Liquidity: While whale activity can cause volatility, it also adds substantial liquidity to the market. Network Validation: Significant investment acts as a vote of confidence in the Ethereum network’s future utility and security. For everyday investors, monitoring this activity is crucial. It doesn’t mean you should blindly follow, but understanding the “why” behind such moves can inform better decisions. What Are the Risks of Following Whale Activity? While fascinating, tracking a crypto whale address comes with caveats. Whale movements can create misleading signals if taken out of context. For instance, a large buy might be part of a complex trading strategy or portfolio rebalancing, not purely bullish sentiment. Moreover, whales can also sell, potentially triggering market downturns. The key is to use this data as one piece of a larger puzzle, not as a standalone investment thesis. Always combine on-chain analysis with fundamental research and sound risk management principles. Conclusion: Decoding the Signal from the Noise The recent $19.9 million ETH acquisition by a suspected institutional crypto whale address is a noteworthy event. It underscores the deepening integration of traditional finance with the digital asset ecosystem. Whether the wallet belongs to Bitmine, SharpLink Gaming, or another entity, the message is clear: major players are accumulating Ethereum. For the savvy observer, this isn’t just a transaction; it’s a testament to Ethereum’s enduring appeal as a core holding in the future of finance. Keep an eye on this crypto whale address , but remember to build your strategy on a foundation of diverse information and personal financial goals. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a crypto whale address? A crypto whale address is a wallet that holds a large enough amount of a cryptocurrency to potentially influence its market price through trades. Why is the identity of this whale address important? Identifying the entity (like a public company) can provide context on the investment’s motive—whether it’s strategic holding, treasury diversification, or something else—which influences market interpretation. How can I track whale activity myself? You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan or dedicated on-chain analytics platforms that track large transactions and wallet movements. Does a large purchase always mean the price will go up? Not necessarily. While it can indicate confidence, it is just one factor. Market prices are influenced by a wide array of variables including global sentiment, regulatory news, and broader economic conditions. What is FalconX? FalconX is a cryptocurrency prime broker and trading platform designed primarily for institutional investors, offering services like large trade execution and credit. What’s the difference between ETH and Ethereum? Ethereum is the name of the broader blockchain network and ecosystem. ETH (Ether) is the native cryptocurrency token used to pay for transactions and services on that network. Found this deep dive into the mysterious crypto whale address helpful?

This crucial market thermometer, compiled by data provider Alternative, has dropped another point from yesterday, signaling deepening anxiety among cryptocurrency investors. For anyone holding Bitcoin, Ethereum, or altcoins, understanding what this index reading means could be the difference between panic selling and strategic positioning. What Exactly Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as the market’s emotional barometer, measuring investor sentiment on a scale from 0 to 100. At zero, you find extreme fear dominating trading decisions, while 100 represents extreme greed and overconfidence. Today’s reading of 23 places us squarely in the red zone where fear dictates market movements. But how does Alternative calculate this crucial number? The index uses six weighted metrics that together paint a comprehensive picture of market psychology: Volatility (25%) : Measures price swings and market instability Trading Volume (25%) : Tracks the amount of cryptocurrency changing hands Social Media Mentions (15%) : Analyzes cryptocurrency discussions across platforms Surveys (15%) : Gathers direct investor sentiment through polling Bitcoin Dominance (10%) : Measures Bitcoin’s share of total crypto market cap Google Search Volume (10%) : Tracks public interest through search trends Why Should You Care About Extreme Fear Readings? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index hits extreme fear levels, several important market dynamics come into play. Historically, these periods have often preceded significant buying opportunities for patient investors. However, they also signal increased risk and potential for further declines. The current reading suggests that many investors are reacting emotionally rather than strategically, which can create both dangers and opportunities. Consider this: during previous extreme fear periods, we’ve witnessed some of the best long-term entry points for cryptocurrencies. The key is distinguishing between temporary panic and fundamental breakdowns. Right now, with the index at 23, we’re seeing classic fear-driven behavior including reduced trading volumes and negative social media sentiment. How Can Investors Navigate This Fearful Market? Navigating a market dominated by extreme fear requires discipline and perspective. First, recognize that sentiment indicators like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index measure emotions, not fundamentals. While Bitcoin’s technology remains unchanged and Ethereum’s development continues, investor psychology has shifted dramatically. This disconnect between sentiment and substance creates potential opportunities. Here are three actionable strategies for current market conditions: Dollar-cost average : Instead of timing the market perfectly, consider regular, smaller purchases Reassess your risk tolerance : Ensure your portfolio matches your actual comfort level with volatility Focus on fundamentals : Look beyond price movements to technology adoption and development progress What Historical Patterns Tell Us About Recovery Historical analysis of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reveals interesting patterns. Extreme fear readings often cluster around market bottoms, though timing the exact turnaround remains challenging. The index spent extended periods in fear territory during 2018-2019 and again in 2022, both times preceding significant recoveries. However, each market cycle differs, and past performance never guarantees future results. Currently, the index’s sustained presence in extreme fear territory suggests we may be approaching a sentiment extreme. When everyone feels fearful, sometimes the smartest move is to think differently. This doesn’t mean blindly buying, but rather conducting thorough research and preparing for potential opportunities. The Bottom Line on Today’s Market Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 23 clearly signals that fear dominates cryptocurrency markets. While this creates short-term challenges, it also sets the stage for potential opportunities when sentiment eventually improves. Successful investors often profit by going against extreme emotional currents, buying when others are fearful and selling when others are greedy. Remember that market sentiment represents just one piece of the investment puzzle. Combine insights from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index with fundamental analysis, technical indicators, and your personal investment goals. Markets move in cycles, and today’s extreme fear will eventually give way to another emotional extreme. The question isn’t if sentiment will change, but when and how prepared you’ll be when it does. Frequently Asked Questions What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 23 mean? A reading of 23 indicates extreme fear in cryptocurrency markets. This suggests most investors are pessimistic, potentially leading to panic selling and reduced trading activity. Historically, such extreme readings have sometimes preceded market recoveries. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index updates daily, providing a current snapshot of market sentiment. You can track changes over time to identify trends and potential turning points in investor psychology. Can the Crypto Fear & Greed Index predict price movements? While the index measures sentiment rather than predicting prices directly, extreme readings often correlate with potential turning points. However, it should be used alongside other analysis tools rather than as a standalone predictor. What’s the difference between fear and extreme fear on the index? The index categorizes readings: 0-24 as extreme fear, 25-49 as fear, 50-74 as greed, and 75-100 as extreme greed. Moving from fear to extreme fear indicates intensifying negative sentiment. How reliable is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index provides valuable sentiment data but has limitations. It reflects current emotions rather than future fundamentals, and its multi-source methodology helps reduce individual metric biases. Should I buy cryptocurrency when the index shows extreme fear? Extreme fear can signal potential buying opportunities, but shouldn’t be your sole decision factor. Consider your investment strategy, risk tolerance, and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions. Found this analysis helpful?

It is now reportedly permitting the trade of mutual funds and ETFs that primarily invest in cryptocurrencies on its platform. This change in stance illustrates a substantial shift from their previous beliefs . Following this announcement, the asset manager clarified that it would grant its users the opportunity to trade ETFs and mutual funds that focus on specific cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, and Solana, starting Tuesday. Several crypto firms shift their focus towards ETF trading Vanguard’s recent decision to allow trading of ETFs and mutual funds demonstrates a significant shift for a firm that once expressed its belief that digital assets were highly volatile and posed substantial risks to major investment portfolios. Notably, this shift in stance was adopted despite the cryptocurrency market experiencing a loss of more than $1 trillion in value since early October. This move drew the attention of reporters, who reached out to the asset manager in an attempt to uncover the main motivators behind this decision. Responding to a request for comment, Vanguard mentioned that the surging demand from both individual and institutional investors led them to embrace the move. To support this claim, analysts weighed in on Vanguard’s comment, noting that since the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, these ETFs have managed to capture billions in investments. On the other hand, reports from reliable sources indicate that the asset manager’s decision aligns with the current industry trend. This finding was drawn after it was discovered that its competitors are now allowing the trade of ETFs on their platforms. An example is BlackRock , Vanguard’s main rival. BlackRock was reported to still hold about $70 billion in its IBIT ETF despite some withdrawal cases and a decline in the price of BTC. However, this number reflects a decline from approximately $100 billion held just two months ago. Meanwhile, sources acknowledged that Vanguard’s new approach makes regulated crypto investments available to over 50 million brokerage clients, who collectively manage more than $11 trillion in assets. It is worth noting that crypto-linked ETFs are considered one of the quickly expanding fields in the history of US funds. Crypto analysts also highlighted that cryptocurrency supporters may view Vanguard’s decision as an indication that traditional finance cannot ignore the influence of digital assets. As the topic of discussion sparked heated debates among individuals, Andrew Kadjeski, who leads brokerage and investments at Vanguard, decided to weigh in on the situation. Kadjeski stated that a test was conducted on cryptocurrency ETFs and mutual funds during market fluctuations. According to him, the results showed that they function as intended, while investors found it easy to purchase or sell them. “The way we manage these funds has improved over time, and what investors want keeps changing,” Kadjeski added. Vanguard vows to support most crypto ETFs and mutual funds Vanguard has shifted its focus towards mutual funds and ETFs trading over a year after Salim Ramji assumed the role of the asset manager’s CEO. Notably, Ramji is a former executive at BlackRock and a strong supporter of blockchain technology. Following his pro-crypto stance, Vanguard recently made public its intention to back most crypto ETFs and mutual funds that strictly adhere to regulatory rules set. This strategy will take place similarly to how the company manages other asset types, such as gold. However, reports noted that Vanguard has no plans to introduce its own digital assets in the near future. Additionally, it will still exclude funds connected to memecoins, as defined by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. “Even though Vanguard doesn’t plan to create its own crypto products, we serve millions of investors with different needs and risk levels. We aim to offer a trading platform that allows our clients to invest in the products they choose,” Kadjeski added.

A recent PBOC warning on illicit crypto activities has sent shockwaves through digital asset prices, highlighting the fragile balance between innovation and oversight. According to a CNBC report, this move by China’s central bank has directly contributed to negative market sentiment and significant liquidations. Let’s break down what happened and why it matters for your portfolio. What Did the PBOC Actually Say About Illicit Crypto Activities? The People’s Bank of China (PBOC), in coordination with other agencies, announced a strict crackdown on illegal operations involving virtual assets. This specifically targets activities around stablecoins and other digital tokens operating outside the legal framework. The announcement wasn’t about banning cryptocurrency outright for individuals but focused squarely on illicit crypto activities like unlicensed trading, fraud, and money laundering. However, the market often reacts to the tone as much as the content. The firm language triggered immediate risk-off behavior among traders. How Did the Market React to the PBOC Warning? The reaction was swift and severe. Experts cited by CNBC point to a cascade of effects: Heightened Anxiety: Ben Emons of Fedwatch Advisors noted market participants remain anxious following a major Bitcoin sell-off. Massive Liquidations: The price decline was likely influenced by approximately $400 million in exchange liquidations. Leverage Unwind: The impact was magnified because some exchanges offer extreme leverage, up to 200x, on a large scale. This created a perfect storm where the PBOC warning on illicit crypto activities acted as a catalyst, forcing over-leveraged positions to be sold off rapidly, which pushed prices down further. Why Does a PBOC Warning Still Hold So Much Power? China has maintained a strict stance on cryptocurrencies for years. Therefore, you might wonder why a new PBOC warning on illicit crypto activities still carries such weight. The answer lies in scale and precedent. China represents a massive pool of both historical and potential market activity. Any regulatory signal from its central bank reminds global investors of the 2021 crackdown that profoundly reshaped the industry. It reinforces the ongoing regulatory uncertainty that hangs over the crypto space, making large investors nervous and triggering automated selling. What Can Traders Learn From This Volatility? Events like this are not just news items; they are critical learning opportunities. The market’s violent reaction to the PBOC warning on illicit crypto activities offers clear lessons: Regulatory News is Key: Always monitor major regulatory announcements from significant economies. Understand Leverage Risk: High leverage can amplify gains but also catastrophic losses during volatility. Sentiment Drives Short-Term Moves: Often, the market’s perception of risk changes faster than fundamentals. Moving forward, watching how other global regulators respond will be crucial. Will they echo the PBOC’s concerns or strike a different tone? Conclusion: Navigating a Regulated Future The recent market dip fueled by the PBOC warning on illicit crypto activities is a potent case study. It underscores that cryptocurrency is no longer a wild west asset class detached from traditional finance and governance. While innovation continues, the path to mainstream adoption is paved with regulatory milestones. For savvy participants, this means developing a strategy that respects both the technological potential of crypto and the evolving reality of global oversight. The market’s recovery will depend on its ability to absorb such shocks and demonstrate resilience. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Did China ban cryptocurrency again? A1: No, this was not a new blanket ban. The PBOC warning specifically targeted illicit crypto activities like illegal trading and fraud, not individual ownership. Q2: Why did Bitcoin’s price fall so much? A2: The price fell due to a combination of the negative sentiment from the PBOC warning and the forced selling of over $400 million in leveraged positions on exchanges. Q3: What are “illicit crypto activities” according to the PBOC? A3> These typically include unlicensed financial services, money laundering, fraud schemes, and the unauthorized issuance or trading of stablecoins and other assets. Q4: Should I sell my crypto because of this warning? A4: This is not financial advice. However, such events highlight the importance of having a risk management strategy, understanding your investment horizon, and not investing with high leverage you can’t afford to lose. Q5: Will this affect crypto markets long-term? A5: Single events often cause short-term volatility. The long-term impact depends on whether this signals a broader global regulatory trend or remains a specific action by China. Q6: Where can I get reliable updates on crypto regulation? A6> Follow official communications from major central banks and financial authorities, and rely on reputable financial news outlets for analysis.

This is the powerful, and potentially invasive, future Google is building. For users navigating the complex world of Web3 and decentralized values, this centralization of intimate data presents a stark contrast. Google’s biggest Google AI advantage isn’t just its models—it’s the vast, detailed dossier it has on you. How Google AI Plans to Know You Intimately In a recent podcast, Robby Stein, VP of Product for Google Search , laid out the vision. The goal is to move beyond generic answers to deeply personalized ones. “We think there’s a huge opportunity for our AI to know you better and then be uniquely helpful because of that knowledge,” Stein stated. This personalization engine is already being built through connected services like Gmail, Calendar, and Drive, feeding data into Gemini . Consider this comparison of how AI responses could evolve: Generic AI Response Personalized Google AI Response “Here are the top 5 running shoes.” “Based on your past purchases from Brand X in your Gmail and your recent search for ‘arch support,’ here are 3 models that fit your profile.” “Suggest a weekend getaway.” “Given your photos from previous mountain hikes and your Calendar showing a free weekend, here are cabins available in your preferred region.” The Fine Line Between Service and Surveillance The ambition is clear: an AI that anticipates needs. Stein gave the example of a push notification alerting you when a product you’ve researched for days goes on sale. However, this requires Google to ingest a staggering amount of personal data: emails, documents, photos, location history, and browsing behavior. The risk is creating an experience that feels less like a helpful assistant and more like constant surveillance. This centralizes immense power, a concept at odds with the decentralized ethos of blockchain and crypto communities who prioritize sovereignty over their personal information. Data Privacy in the Age of Gemini This is where significant data privacy concerns emerge. Google states that users can control which apps Gemini accesses via “Connected Apps” in settings. The Gemini privacy policy also warns users not to share confidential information, as human reviewers may see some data. Yet, the opt-out path becomes murkier as AI becomes core to Google’s ecosystem. The company’s solution, according to Stein, is transparency: indicating when a response is personalized versus generic. The Promise: Uniquely helpful, time-saving AI that understands your context. The Peril: A loss of anonymity, potential for manipulation, and a feeling that you are constantly being analyzed. The Parallel: This mirrors the dystopian “Others” in Apple TV’s Pluribus , a hivemind that knows characters intimately without their consent, creating comfort that feels like intrusion. Actionable Insights: Managing Your Digital Footprint For the privacy-conscious, especially those in tech and crypto, proactive steps are essential. Audit Connected Apps: Regularly check the “Connected Apps” setting in Gemini and Google account settings to see what data is being shared. Use Incognito/Private Browsing: For research you don’t want influencing your AI profile, use private browsing modes. Consider Data Separation: Be mindful of what information you store in connected Google services versus more private, encrypted alternatives. Stay Informed: Privacy policies and AI features evolve rapidly. Make it a habit to review updates. FAQs: Google’s AI and Your Data Who is Robby Stein? Robby Stein is the Vice President of Product for Google Search, leading product development and strategy. What is Gemini? Gemini is Google’s flagship suite of AI models and assistants, formerly known as Bard, now integrated across Workspace apps. Can I stop Google AI from using my data? You can limit data sharing through Gemini’s settings and general Google account privacy controls, but core services may still collect data for personalization. Does Apple have a similar AI? Apple’s approach with its AI initiatives typically emphasizes on-device processing, which can offer different data privacy trade-offs compared to Google’s cloud-centric model. The trajectory of Google AI is a masterclass in leveraging existing infrastructure for competitive advantage. For users, the trade-off is stark: unprecedented convenience at the potential cost of profound intimacy. The future of search isn’t just about answering questions—it’s about which entity gets to know the questioner best. As these systems grow more embedded, the community that values decentralization must critically examine where to draw the line between helpful personalization and digital overreach.

Short-term EMAs between $2.18 and $2.33 continue to cap every bounce inside the multi-month triangle. Options open interest surges 184 percent as traders position for a major volatility event. By Jainam Mehta XRP ( XRP-USD ) enters December at one of its most consequential technical levels of the year, with price hovering just above a long-term ascending support trendline that has absorbed every major decline since early spring. The broader structure has tightened into a large multi-month triangle, where a pattern of lower highs is now converging with a rising base that has repeatedly anchored the asset during periods of heavy selling. The market is bracing for a decisive breakout after nearly six months of compression. Price continues to struggle below the declining 20-day and 50-day EMAs, both clustered between $2.18 and $2.33, where sellers mounted a firm defense throughout November. The 100-day and 200-day EMAs form a heavier ceiling between $2.48 and $2.50, reinforcing the view that upside attempts remain corrective unless price can reclaim this broader resistance zone. Technical structure tightens as buyers defend long-term trendline XRP’s daily chart shows the asset moving deeper into the apex of its multi-month triangle. Sellers maintained pressure throughout November, driving each bounce into another lower high along the descending arm of the formation. Monday’s decline toward $2.04 underscored lingering hesitation among buyers, though demand continues to emerge near the long-term trendline that sits just above $1.98. XRP price dynamics (Source: TradingView) The RSI mirrors this cautious stance. Momentum has spent weeks stuck in a weak mid-range zone, failing to break above 55 or register any meaningful bullish divergence. The indicator now sits near 41, signaling mild bearish pressure without entering extreme conditions. Historically, RSI bounces from the 35–40 region have provided short-term relief, but without a break above the descending trendline, momentum remains capped. Spot flow data, however, introduces a notable shift. While many major assets saw persistent outflows in recent weeks, XRP recorded a $3.5 million inflow on its latest reading. Though modest, the timing coincides with price retesting a critical long-term support, suggesting that selective accumulation may be beginning to reappear. The magnitude of inflow remains shallow compared to earlier accumulation phases, meaning buyers are cautious but not absent. Derivative markets signal preparation for a major move The derivatives landscape reinforces the view that traders are positioning ahead of a significant breakout. Open interest has fallen more than 6 percent to $3.87 billion, reflecting a measured reduction in leveraged exposure as volatility narrows inside the triangle. This type of contraction typically precedes explosive moves, as traders step aside before momentum expands. At the same time, futures volume jumped more than 68 percent, and options activity surged. Options open interest is up 184 percent, while volume increased more than sixfold, showing that volatility bets are rapidly building. Traders are clearly positioning around the apex, expecting the next directional move to carry meaningful momentum. Liquidation patterns add another layer to the evolving picture. Nearly $16 million in short liquidations were recorded in the past 24 hours, indicating that sellers may be losing control near the trendline. While shorts dominated throughout November, the sudden spike in short-side wipeouts signals vulnerability and suggests that bears may be overextended as price tests major support. What comes next for XRP The broader setup leaves XRP at a make-or-break point. A break below the rising trendline near $1.98 would expose deeper support at $1.87 and $1.72, marking a shift into a broader corrective cycle. On the upside, reclaiming the $2.33 to $2.40 region would invalidate the descending arm of the triangle and open the door toward $2.58 before testing the wider range near $2.90. With spot inflows improving, options activity soaring, and short liquidations rising, the market appears to be preparing for a high-momentum move. Whether buyers can convert these early signals into a sustained reversal remains the key question heading into early 2026. Previously, we highlighted XRP’s tightening triangle structure and the risk that repeated failures at the short-term EMAs would constrain momentum. The current behavio r near long-term support reinforces those themes, with rising options interest now signaling that traders are preparing for a decisive breakout.

Right now, that number is 25. CoinMarketCap’s crucial Altcoin Season Index sits firmly at this level, sending a clear signal to every investor: we are in a Bitcoin season. But what does this metric really mean for your portfolio, and how should you interpret this phase of the market cycle? Let’s break down the implications. What Exactly Is the Altcoin Season Index? Think of the Altcoin Season Index as the crypto market’s thermometer. It measures the temperature of investor sentiment towards alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, relative to Bitcoin. The index performs a simple but powerful calculation: it compares the 90-day price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin’s performance over the same period. The rule is straightforward. If 75% of these major altcoins are beating Bitcoin’s returns, the market is officially in an “altcoin season.” This condition would give the index a perfect score of 100. Therefore, the current reading of 25 is far from that threshold. It indicates that the vast majority of altcoins are struggling to keep pace with the original cryptocurrency. Why Does a Score of 25 Signal a Bitcoin Season? A score of 25 on the Altcoin Season Index isn’t just a low number; it’s a definitive declaration. This reading means market conditions overwhelmingly favor Bitcoin. Capital is flowing into BTC, often seen as a safe-haven asset within the volatile crypto space, rather than being spread across riskier altcoin bets. Historically, crypto markets move in cycles. We typically see: Bitcoin Season: Bitcoin leads the rally, often driven by institutional adoption, macro-economic factors, or ETF approvals. Altcoin Season: After Bitcoin’s price stabilizes at a higher level, investor confidence grows, and capital rotates into altcoins seeking higher percentage gains. The current index data suggests we are firmly in the first phase. The momentum belongs to Bitcoin. What Should Crypto Investors Do Now? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index is one thing; acting on it is another. This data provides context, not a crystal ball. However, it offers valuable insights for structuring your strategy. First, recognize that Bitcoin dominance often brings stability to the broader market. It can be a period of consolidation for altcoins. This is not necessarily a time to panic-sell your altcoin holdings, but rather a time for disciplined evaluation. Ask yourself: Is my altcoin portfolio built on strong fundamentals? Am I overexposed to highly speculative tokens? Should I rebalance to reflect the current market leadership? Many seasoned investors use Bitcoin seasons to accumulate quality altcoin projects at relatively lower prices, anticipating the next rotation. The key is to have a plan based on data, not emotion. The Bottom Line: Reading the Market’s Rhythm The Altcoin Season Index is a powerful tool for cutting through market noise. A score of 25 provides a data-driven confirmation of what price charts may already show: Bitcoin is in the driver’s seat. This phase highlights the importance of Bitcoin as the market’s bedrock. While altcoin projects continue to build, investor capital is currently rewarding the proven store of value and network security that Bitcoin represents. Ultimately, successful crypto investing involves understanding these cycles. The index doesn’t tell you what will happen tomorrow, but it clearly tells you what is happening today. By paying attention to these signals, you can align your strategy with the market’s prevailing trend, managing risk and positioning yourself for future opportunities when the season eventually changes. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Where can I find the current Altcoin Season Index score? A: You can find the live Altcoin Season Index on CoinMarketCap’s website, typically within their research or market analysis tools. Q: Does a Bitcoin season mean altcoin prices will fall? A: Not necessarily. It primarily means Bitcoin is outperforming them. Altcoins can still rise in value during a Bitcoin season, but typically at a slower rate. Q: How long do these seasons typically last? A: There’s no fixed duration. Bitcoin seasons can last for several weeks or months. The transition to an altcoin season often depends on Bitcoin’s price stability and broader market sentiment. Q: Should I sell all my altcoins when the index is low? A: A low index score is a market condition, not an automatic sell signal. Your decision should be based on your individual investment thesis, risk tolerance, and the fundamentals of the specific altcoins you hold. Q: Has the index ever been wrong? A: The index is a lagging indicator based on past performance. It accurately reports what *has* happened over the last 90 days. It does not predict the future, so a shift can begin before the index score fully reflects it. Found this breakdown of the Altcoin Season Index helpful?

Burniske Thinks The Market Still Has To Break",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/56000-bitcoin-bottom-burniske/,"Placeholder VC’s Chris Burniske sees one of the best long-term setups for Bitcoin building in the background – but he is clear that the real opportunity likely lies lower, with a potential test of levels near $56,000 still ahead. On X, Burniske argues that the current sentiment environment is exactly what eventually produces outsized returns, while warning that it is still early for aggressive deployment. “There’s so much pessimism and short-term thinking on crypto assets these days that the R/R is tilting towards optimism and long-term, sized, high-conviction positions in distressed, public, cryptoassets,” he writes. “That said, the time isn’t yet now, imo.” Bitcoin Bear Market Not Over Yet He reiterates a framework he first shared when Bitcoin was trading at $109,000: “I shared my view @ $109K that BTC only starts to get interesting < $75K, and a revisit of the 200W SMA is always possible (~$56K currently, will trend higher), with all of those numbers still representing a mellow bear.” For Burniske, a move into that band – and even a touch of the 200-week simple moving average – would not mean a structural breakdown, but a more orderly, “mellow” bear market reset. He adds a blunt caveat: “Can we go lower? Sure. Pay your taxes and let’s see what 2026 brings.” Related Reading: Analyst Sets Bitcoin Next Target At $95k-$96k – Here’s Why That patience extends beyond Bitcoin to the broader crypto complex. As an example, he highlights Monad’s MON token, where Placeholder is a venture investor. He describes MON as “one of the highest quality teams to launch in the last few years,” arguing it “sits at a tenth of the FDV of previous high-flyers in its category, while having superior tech & design choices across the board.” For him, MON’s price action is symptomatic of the broader reset: “Observing discourse & price-action around MON … shows how much repricing is happening.” Burniske sees that repricing as necessary rather than catastrophic. “More broadly, the vicious repricing happening in crypto is cathartic,” he says. “Everyone is taking their licks, and smart ones will learn and adapt.” In his framework, tokens are “liquid venture,” and the failure rate should be treated accordingly: “Most crypto assets should go to zero — this is liquid venture, what did you expect?” Related Reading: Newbie Bitcoin Whales Capitulating, But Old Hands Stay Silent The flip side is that a small minority of assets will, in his view, be marked down far too aggressively as “babies are thrown out with the bathwater.” For those, timing and conviction matter more than ever: “there are going to be a handful that reprice far too low … and having the conviction, at the right time, to be optimistic when the consensus is pessimistic will once again yield 10-100X’s.” For now, Burniske’s message to would-be Bitcoin bottom fishers is straightforward: the structural risk–reward is improving, but a convincing bottom may still require a deeper break – potentially toward the rising 200-week moving average around $56,000 – before long-term, high-conviction capital truly steps in. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $85,872.

Whale Alert, the blockchain tracking service, reported a staggering 200 million XRP transfer from an unknown wallet directly to Ripple. Valued at approximately $404 million, this single transaction has sent ripples through the entire XRP community, sparking intense speculation about its purpose and potential impact on the market. What Does This Massive XRP Transfer Mean? When a transaction of this magnitude occurs, it naturally raises questions. Is this a routine movement by Ripple, or does it signal a major strategic shift? Large XRP transfers often fall into a few categories: institutional sales, treasury management, or preparation for ecosystem development. Given the recipient is Ripple itself, this likely points to the company consolidating its holdings, possibly for upcoming quarterly escrow releases or other operational needs outlined in its transparency reports. Could This XRP Transaction Affect the Price? This is the million-dollar—or rather, $404 million—question. Historically, large movements to known entities like Ripple have a different effect than transfers to exchanges. A deposit to an exchange often signals an imminent sale, creating sell-side pressure. However, a transfer to Ripple’s treasury is more opaque. Therefore, the immediate market reaction might be muted, but the long-term implications depend entirely on Ripple’s next move. Will these coins be locked, sold, or used to fuel new partnerships? Let’s break down the key possibilities: Escrow Replenishment: Ripple regularly unlocks XRP from escrow. This transfer could be part of managing that cycle. Liquidity Provision: The funds might be allocated to Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service to facilitate cross-border payments. Strategic Reserve: Ripple could be consolidating assets for future initiatives or partnership expansions. Why Should Crypto Investors Pay Attention? Monitoring whale activity is crucial for understanding market sentiment. A XRP transfer of this size from an ‘unknown wallet’ adds a layer of mystery. Was this a long-term holder distributing assets, or an institutional player executing a planned trade? For investors, the takeaway is to watch for follow-up activity. Does Ripple move these coins again soon? Transparency from the company in its next report will be key to interpreting this event correctly. The Bottom Line on This $404 Million Move In conclusion, while eye-popping in scale, this 200 million XRP transfer to Ripple is likely a part of standard corporate treasury operations rather than a bearish signal. It underscores the immense scale at which Ripple operates and the significant holdings it manages. For the XRP ecosystem, stability in these large movements can be a sign of mature, planned asset management. The true test will be how this capital is deployed to drive utility and adoption in the coming months. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is ‘Whale Alert’ and can their data be trusted? A: Whale Alert is a widely respected blockchain tracker that monitors large transactions across multiple networks. Their data is sourced directly from public blockchain ledgers, making it highly reliable. Q2: Does Ripple moving XRP mean they are selling it? A: Not necessarily. Ripple moves XRP for various reasons, including escrow management, providing liquidity for its ODL service, and transferring to partners. A sale would typically involve sending coins to a known exchange wallet. Q3: How often do these large XRP transfers happen? A: Ripple executes regular, scheduled escrow releases of 1 billion XRP each month. Other large transfers occur periodically related to its business operations, but a 200-million-coin move is significant. Q4: What is an ‘unknown wallet’ in crypto? A: An ‘unknown wallet’ is a blockchain address not publicly linked to a specific entity, exchange, or foundation. It could belong to an individual whale, an institution, or a private fund. Q5: Will this transaction increase XRP’s volatility? A: The direct impact may be limited since the coins went to Ripple, not an exchange for immediate selling. However, any major whale activity can influence trader sentiment and potentially increase short-term volatility. Q6: Where can I track XRP transactions myself? A: You can use blockchain explorers like XRPScan or Bithomp to view the XRP Ledger in real-time. Services like Whale Alert aggregate the largest transactions for easier monitoring.

The move bridges the event prediction platform’s traditional off-chain order book with on-chain liquidity to attract crypto-native traders and scale operations. Put simply, what the partnership means is that Kalshi bettors will now be able to buy and sell tokenized versions of their wagers on Solana, the company told CNBC exclusively on Monday. The tokenized versions of the contracts would work the same way as the regular ones hosted previously on Kalshi’s platform . However, by trading the tokens instead of the actual contracts, users can enjoy more blockchain-native benefits. Kalshi partners with Solana The development puts Kalshi and its rival Polymarket, which allows users to trade directly on-chain, on the same playing field. According to what Kalshi told CNBC , decentralized finance protocols DFlow and Jupiter will serve as institutional clients, merging the exchange’s off-chain order book to Solana’s liquidity. The move shows that Kalshi is going all out in its attempt to court crypto holders as demand for event contracts continues to grow. John Wang, the company’s head of crypto, told CNBC that by tapping into the $3 trillion digital asset market, Kalshi expects it will be able to shore up liquidity needed to scale its offerings at this crucial time when investors’ appetite for prediction markets is growing rapidly. “There’s a lot of power users in crypto,” Wang said. “This is about tapping into the billions of dollars of liquidity that crypto has, and then also enabling developers to build third party front ends that utilize Kalshi’s liquidity.” Kalshi has existed since 2018 and was the first exchange to launch federally regulated event contracts on U.S. congressional races for American traders in late 2024, shortly after winning a years-long legal battle against the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The platform has now added more event contracts to its platform, and is currently running about 3,500 markets, according to a company representative. Last fall, it raised more than $300 million at a $5 billion valuation in a funding round backed by the likes of Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital, in addition to expanding its footprint to more than 140 countries. Polymarket prepares to re-enter the US Kalshi currently has a first-mover advantage, but it will need to continue to grow quickly if it wants to edge out its rivals, an endeavor that will require ample liquidity – something crypto-native traders’ funds could provide, according to Wang. Polymarket announced on November 25 that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) has issued an Amended Order of Designation, which allows Polymarket to operate an intermediated trading platform subject to the full set of requirements applicable to federally regulated U.S. exchanges. The approval means Polymarket will now be able to onboard brokerages and customers directly and facilitate trading on U.S. venues. It is also now permitted to introduce intermediated access, enabling users to trade through FCMs and leverage traditional market infrastructure, custody, and reporting channels. “People rely on Polymarket because we provide clarity where there is confusion and accountability where there is ambiguity,” said Shayne Coplan, Founder and CEO of Polymarket. According to Coplan, the approval allows the company to operate in a way that reflects the maturity and transparency that the U.S. regulatory framework demands. “We’re grateful for the constructive engagement with the CFTC and look forward to continuing to demonstrate leadership as a regulated U.S. exchange,” he said. As part of the amended order, Polymarket has developed enhanced surveillance systems, market supervision policies, clearing procedures, and part-16 regulatory reporting capabilities. The platform is also expected to implement additional rules, policies, and processes applicable to intermediated trading prior to official launch. It will also remain subject to all provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act and applicable CFTC regulations governing Designated Contract Markets, including self-regulatory obligations.

In prepared remarks to the House Financial Services Committee, Michelle Bowman stated that regulators must act now to ensure that innovation and stability are mutually aligned. This effort aims to foster a healthy competition among fintech firms, Wall Street, and crypto-related businesses. In her prepared statement for a hearing with the House Financial Services Committee, Bowman acknowledged that her main responsibility as a regulator is to back mindful innovation. She also urged other regulators to continually improve their ability to address risks associated with new developments. Her remarks come as the US, through the recently passed GENIUS Act , has already laid the foundation for a comprehensive legal framework for “payment stablecoins,” including rules for reserve backing, redemption rights, public disclosures, and regulatory oversight. Traditional lenders caution about the existing dispute between Banks and crypto firms Following this development , Bowman claimed that new technologies play a significant role in the banking sector, as they make the sector more efficient, widen credit accessibility, and promote fairer competition with digital asset firms and fintech companies. She also mentioned that she will work together with other agencies to develop capital and diversification rules applicable to stablecoin issuers. According to Bowman, these regulations will be created as required by the GENIUS Act. This act requires stablecoin issuers to register and maintain dollar-for-dollar reserves formally. Meanwhile, under this collaboration, Bowman stated that the role of these agencies is to clarify digital assets guidelines and offer suggestions on proposed new uses. She made these remarks during an existing dispute between crypto companies and banks. These two sectors disputed over the future of digital asset regulation, including the battle for gaining access to bank charters. Crypto firms argued that these charters are essential for their operations, as access to them could provide several advantages, like increased credibility. Nonetheless, traditional lenders warn that such a move could result in a competitive environment that is unfair or weaken the charter system. If this happens, lenders anticipate that companies will be allowed to carry out their operations under a bank license without complying with all the responsibilities that have historically been associated with it. Bowman’s testimony demonstrates her commitment to bringing various bank capital measures to completion. An example of these measures includes the long-awaited Basel III Endgame. “My strategy is to focus on adjusting the new framework from the ground up instead of trying to change things to fit existing ideas about capital requirements,” she said. Bowman demonstrates her commitment to complete bank capital measures Earlier, a reliable source revealed that the Federal Reserve sent an updated Basel III plan to other US regulators. Sources close to the situation suggested that this plan would significantly ease a capital proposal from the Biden administration targeting the most significant banks on Wall Street. Following the release of this news, several officials shared their predictions regarding the impacts of the Fed’s plan. Some anticipated that this plan could lead to an increase of approximately 3% to 7% overall for most leading banks. While the officials forecasted different viewpoints, these sources, who wished to remain anonymous due to the confidential nature of the situation, declared that there was no precise prediction in the outline. However, reports noted that these estimates were lower than the 19% rise suggested in 2023. Additionally, it was lower than the 9% increase proposed in a compromise version last year. Bowman weighed in on the matter. She mentioned that the Fed will join forces with other efforts to enhance the surcharge for major banks within the wider capital framework.

According to live data from Binance’s USDT trading pair, Bitcoin is currently trading at approximately $87,100. This significant surge is not just a number on a screen; it represents a powerful wave of momentum that has captured the attention of traders and investors worldwide. What’s fueling this remarkable rally, and is this the start of a new bullish phase? Let’s dive into the details. What’s Driving the Current BTC Price Rally? Several key factors are converging to propel the BTC price to these impressive heights. First, institutional adoption continues to gain steam, with major financial firms increasing their Bitcoin allocations. Second, macroeconomic conditions, including concerns about inflation, are pushing investors toward perceived stores of value like Bitcoin. Furthermore, positive regulatory developments in key markets are reducing uncertainty and building investor confidence. The recent price action suggests a strong buy-side pressure that shows few immediate signs of weakening. How Significant is the $87,000 Level for Bitcoin? Breaking through major psychological price barriers is always a critical event. The $87,000 level represents a crucial resistance point that many analysts were watching closely. Therefore, a sustained hold above this price could open the door to the next major target: the $90,000 threshold. This movement is a strong technical signal that reinforces the current uptrend. For traders, key levels to watch now are: Immediate Support: The previous resistance near $85,000. Current Trading Zone: $87,000 – $87,500. Next Major Target: The historic $90,000 level. What Should Investors Consider Now? While the surge in the BTC price is undoubtedly positive, a balanced perspective is essential. Market volatility remains a constant feature of cryptocurrency investing. Investors should consider their own risk tolerance and avoid making decisions based solely on short-term price movements. A disciplined approach, focusing on long-term fundamentals rather than daily fluctuations, often yields better results. Remember, the goal is sustainable growth, not just catching the peak of a wave. Conclusion: A Milestone Moment for Bitcoin Bitcoin’s ascent above $87,000 is a clear demonstration of its growing strength and market relevance. This milestone reinforces its position at the forefront of the digital asset revolution. While future price movements are never guaranteed, this achievement marks a significant moment of market optimism and technical validation. The journey of Bitcoin continues to be one of the most compelling narratives in modern finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the current BTC price?

John Giannandrea, the company’s AI chief since 2018, is stepping down after Apple Intelligence faced embarrassing failures and Siri’s overhaul collapsed. His replacement? A seasoned executive who knows Apple’s biggest competitors intimately. This dramatic shift reveals just how far behind Apple has fallen in the AI race that’s defining the future of technology. Why Did Apple Replace Its AI Chief? The departure of John Giannandrea wasn’t a simple retirement or planned transition. According to internal reports and Bloomberg’s investigation, Giannandrea had already been sidelined months before Monday’s announcement. In March, CEO Tim Cook stripped Siri development from Giannandrea’s oversight entirely, handing it to Mike Rockwell, creator of the Vision Pro. Apple’s secretive robotics division was also removed from his control. The writing was on the wall: Apple’s AI strategy was failing, and leadership needed to change. Meet Apple’s New AI Chief: Amar Subramanya Apple’s choice for Giannandrea’s replacement is telling. Amar Subramanya brings 16 years of Google experience, most recently leading engineering for the Gemini Assistant, followed by executive experience at Microsoft. This hire represents a strategic pivot – bringing in someone who understands Apple’s competitors from the inside. Subramanya will report directly to Craig Federighi, Apple’s software chief, with a clear mandate: fix Apple’s AI problems and help the company catch up in a race it’s currently losing.

The problems started immediately and kept coming: False News Generation: The notification summary feature created embarrassing, untrue headlines, including falsely reporting a suspect’s suicide and declaring sports championships before they ended BBC Complaints: The British broadcaster complained twice after Apple Intelligence spread misinformation about high-profile cases Siri Overhaul Collapse: When Federighi tested the new Siri weeks before its planned April launch, he discovered many touted features simply didn’t work Legal Consequences: The indefinite delay triggered class-action lawsuits from iPhone 16 buyers promised an AI-powered assistant Inside Apple’s AI Organizational Crisis Bloomberg’s May investigation revealed deeper structural problems within Apple’s AI division: Weak communication between AI and marketing teams Budget misalignments and resource allocation issues Employee morale so low that some mocked Giannandrea’s group as “AI/MLess” An exodus of AI researchers to competitors including OpenAI, Google, and Meta The Siri Overhaul That Never Happened Perhaps the most telling failure was Siri’s promised transformation. Apple had positioned the Siri overhaul as its flagship AI achievement, but internal testing revealed fundamental flaws. The delay wasn’t just embarrassing – it was costly. iPhone 16 buyers who purchased devices with the promise of revolutionary AI capabilities are now suing. Even more humbling: Apple is reportedly leaning on Google’s Gemini to power the next version of Siri, a remarkable admission of defeat in a rivalry that spans mobile operating systems, app stores, and now artificial intelligence. Apple’s AI Philosophy: Strength or Weakness? Apple has taken a fundamentally different approach to AI than its competitors. While Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI pour billions into massive data centers, Apple focuses on processing AI tasks directly on users’ devices using Apple Silicon chips. This privacy-first approach avoids collecting user data, with more complex requests routed through Private Cloud Compute servers that promise temporary processing and immediate deletion. But this philosophy comes with clear trade-offs: On-device models are smaller and less capable than cloud-based alternatives Apple’s reluctance to collect user data means researchers train models on licensed and synthetic data rather than real-world information The approach may have permanently left Apple behind in the AI arms race What This Means for Apple’s Future The leadership change represents more than just personnel shuffling. It signals that Apple recognizes the severity of its AI problems and is willing to make dramatic changes. Subramanya’s background suggests Apple may be reconsidering its go-it-alone approach, potentially opening doors to more partnerships like the rumored Gemini integration. Key questions remain: Can Subramanya fix Apple’s organizational dysfunction? Will Apple maintain its privacy-first approach or compromise to catch up? How will this affect Apple’s competitive position against Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI? What does this mean for future Apple products and services? FAQs: Apple’s AI Leadership Shakeup Who is John Giannandrea? John Giannandrea was Apple’s AI chief from 2018 until December 2025. He previously ran Machine Intelligence and Search at Google before joining Apple . Who is Amar Subramanya? Amar Subramanya is Apple’s new AI chief. He spent 16 years at Google , most recently leading engineering for the Gemini Assistant, and later worked at Microsoft before joining Apple . What is Apple Intelligence? Apple Intelligence is Apple’s AI platform launched in October 2024. It represents the company’s response to competitors like ChatGPT but has faced significant technical and public relations challenges. What happened to the Siri overhaul? The Siri overhaul was delayed indefinitely after internal testing revealed many promised features didn’t work. This delay triggered class-action lawsuits from iPhone 16 buyers. Is Apple using Google’s AI technology? Reports suggest Apple is leaning on Google ‘s Gemini to power the next version of Siri, representing a significant shift in strategy for the traditionally insular company. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Apple Apple’s AI leadership shakeup is more than executive musical chairs – it’s an admission that the company’s current approach isn’t working. The promotion of Amar Subramanya, with his deep knowledge of both Google and Microsoft’s AI strategies, suggests Apple is ready to learn from its competitors rather than ignore them. The coming months will reveal whether this change comes too late or represents the beginning of Apple’s AI comeback story. One thing is certain: in the high-stakes world of artificial intelligence, Apple can no longer afford to play catch-up.

After holding steadfast for five long years, this influential investor appears to have sold their entire colossal stash of 20,000 Ethereum. This decisive action, involving transfers worth tens of millions to a major exchange, raises critical questions about market sentiment and the strategies of crypto’s biggest players. Let’s dive into the details and uncover what this monumental sell-off could mean for you. Who Was This Mysterious ETH Whale? On-chain analytics firm Onchain Lens identified the address in question: 0xd908. This ETH whale was no ordinary investor. Their journey began five years ago with a strategic purchase of 21,086 ETH for approximately $7.35 million. For half a decade, they exhibited remarkable patience, holding through extreme market volatility, the DeFi summer, and the recent bear market. However, their strategy has now shifted dramatically. What Exactly Did the ETH Whale Do? The whale’s exit was not a single, frantic transaction but a calculated series of moves. According to the data, the address recently transferred a final batch of 10,176 ETH, valued at around $28.69 million, to the Kraken exchange. This transfer was the culmination of a process where the whale had been depositing funds to exchanges in installments. The key actions were: Initial Purchase: Acquired 21,086 ETH five years ago at an average price near $350 per ETH. Recent Activity: Began systematically moving holdings to exchanges like Kraken. Final Move: Transferred the remaining ~10K ETH, signaling a likely full exit from the position. This methodical approach suggests a deliberate decision rather than a panic sell. Why Would an ETH Whale Sell After 5 Years? Understanding the motivation behind such a significant sale is crucial. While we cannot know the whale’s exact thoughts, several plausible reasons exist based on common investment strategies. First, the whale secured a monumental profit. Their initial $7.35 million investment grew to be worth over $28 million in the final transfer alone, representing a life-changing return. Furthermore, after a five-year hold, an investor might simply seek to realize gains and diversify their portfolio. Other potential reasons include: Portfolio Rebalancing: Shifting capital into other assets or cryptocurrencies. Market Outlook: A potential belief that Ethereum has reached a short-to-medium-term peak. Personal Liquidity Needs: Requiring cash for other ventures or obligations. It’s essential to remember that one ETH whale selling does not inherently predict a market crash. What Does This Mean for the Average Ethereum Investor? Should you follow the ETH whale and sell your holdings? Not necessarily. Whale movements are important signals, but they are just one piece of the complex market puzzle. Large investors have different goals, risk tolerances, and time horizons than most retail participants. Their exit could indicate profit-taking at a local top, or it could simply be an isolated portfolio decision. Therefore, it’s more valuable to view this as a case study in discipline. This whale demonstrated incredible patience, holding through multiple cycles to achieve a massive gain—a powerful lesson in long-term thinking. Key Takeaways from the ETH Whale’s Exit This event encapsulates several core principles of cryptocurrency investing. The whale’s story is a masterclass in patience and conviction, proving that holding through volatility can yield extraordinary results. However, it also highlights the importance of having an exit strategy. Knowing when to take profits is as critical as knowing when to buy. Finally, it underscores the value of transparency in blockchain markets. Thanks to on-chain data, we can observe and learn from the actions of major players, making the crypto ecosystem more informed than traditional finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does a whale selling mean the price of ETH will drop? A: Not always. While large sell-offs can create temporary selling pressure, one whale’s action does not dictate long-term market trends. The overall market sentiment, adoption, and network activity are more significant drivers. Q: How can I track whale movements myself? A: You can use on-chain analytics platforms like Etherscan, Nansen, or Arkham Intelligence. These tools track large wallet transactions and exchange flows, providing insights into whale behavior. Q: What is considered an “ETH whale”? A: There’s no official threshold, but addresses holding tens of thousands of ETH (worth tens or hundreds of millions of dollars) are typically classified as whales due to their potential market influence. Q: Should I sell my ETH if I see more whales selling? A: Do not make investment decisions based solely on whale activity. Consider your own financial goals, research, and risk tolerance. Whale moves are data points, not direct instructions. Did you find this analysis of the major ETH whale activity helpful?

Reports have disclosed that ETF inflows have already topped Over $660 million in less than a month, with zero outflows across 10 consecutive trading days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Face A Harsh December: Rising BTC Difficulty, Falling Hashprice 5 ETFs Trade Together Bitwise recently increased its XRP holdings to 80 million tokens. ETF managers now hold more than $687 million in assets, which represents just over 300 million XRP on record. 21Shares debuted with a $500,000 seed basket and charges a 0.50% management fee. Based on reports, competition among issuers will reveal how aggressively these funds plan to keep buying over the long term. Demand Model A price-path sensitivity simulation run by Mohamed Bangura was shared by analysts and taken up by commentators. The model used a baseline ETF demand of 74.5 million XRP per day, total exchange supply of 2.7 billion XRP, and an escrow release of 300 million XRP every 30 days. Next week is a big milestone for XRP. We will have the first full week of trading with 5 pure spot ETF’s running in competition. It’s going to tell us ALOT by the end of week what we can expect for these funds acquiring XRP for the long term. https://t.co/S3TENqa4PP pic.twitter.com/LQ48QLKcgh — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) November 30, 2025 Elasticity values of 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0 were tested over 180 days. The outcomes showed that low elasticity can rapidly drain exchange-held supply, while higher elasticity can produce sharper price spikes as OTC liquidity absorbs flows. That result has many traders watching liquidity statistics closely. Liquidity Pressure Builds Jake Claver, CEO of Digital Ascension Group, warned that private OTC and dark-pool channels may be running thin. He estimated that about 800 million XRP of private liquidity was absorbed in the first week of ETF accumulation. Because much ETF buying happens off-exchange, price action has not yet matched the tightening supply, and markets may see more abrupt moves when funds are forced to source coins from public exchanges. Whales Reshuffle Balances Meanwhile, reports have disclosed changes among large holders. The top 10,000 wallets now hold 51.39 billion XRP, or about 85% of circulating supply. In one day, 78 new wallets took in 77.324 million XRP. One wallet reportedly collected 35 million XRP, another grabbed 3.63 million, and six wallets added 1.99 million each. 🚀 XRP RICH LIST SHOCKWAVE (11/29/2025) 🐳 Fresh data shows the top 10,000 wallets now control 51.39B+ XRP, and today’s ledger activity screams new whales + stealth accumulation.​ 78 new accounts grabbed 77M+ XRP in one day. 246 existing wallets increased balances by another… pic.twitter.com/wpXZMJUQpI — XRP 🅧 Army | Chacha72kobe4er (@Mullen_Army) November 30, 2025 Up to 44 new wallets were reported to have amassed over 300 million XRP each, while 246 existing wallets increased their combined balance by 17.91 million XRP. Those moves point to quiet accumulation during recent market weakness. Related Reading: $300 Million Crypto Bet: Kazakhstan’s Central Bank Gears Up What Comes Next Analysts say the current setup is a test of liquidity more than a simple demand story. ETF holdings of roughly 300 million XRP are sizable but still small compared with potential daily demand if inflows stay high and additional funds launch. If OTC channels dry up and ETFs must buy on exchanges, volatility could rise quickly. Traders and portfolio managers will be watching order books, OTC reports and ETF filings in the coming days to see how the supply picture changes in practice.

The decline deepened over the weekend, pushing BTC briefly under $85,500 amid broader risk-off sentiment and growing macroeconomic uncertainty. Liquidation Wave Accelerates Downtrend Data from multiple exchanges shows that more than $640 million worth of leveraged positions were wiped out within 24 hours, triggering a sharp breakdown below Bitcoin’s recent trading channel. The pullback followed a breach of a major liquidation cluster under the $90,000 level, which rapidly thinned liquidity and intensified the move toward the mid-$80,000 region. On the charts, Bitcoin lost short-term structural support after falling below the lower boundary of its ascending channel. Indicators such as the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) and the monthly MACD have weakened, with the latter printing a bearish crossover historically associated with extended downturns. Analysts say support now lies around $84,500–$84,800, with deeper levels near $82,000 and $80,500 if selling pressure continues. Altcoins reflected the volatility, with Ethereum dropping to around $2,800 while Solana, XRP, Binance Coin, and Dogecoin recorded losses between 5% and 7%. The total crypto market cap declined by nearly 5% to $2.95 trillion. Bitcoin ETF Outflows and Macro Signals Add Pressure The correction comes as Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded significant outflows through November. The month saw about $3.5 billion leave Bitcoin ETF products, with major issuers facing sizeable withdrawals. Analysts attribute the trend to portfolio rebalancing and profit-taking, rather than a broad exit from digital assets; however, the timing has added pressure to an already fragile market. Global macro developments have also shaped sentiment. The Bank of Japan is signaling a possible rate hike in December, contributing to volatility across risk assets. In the US, traders are awaiting new guidance from the Federal Reserve after the end of Quantitative Tightening. A shift toward easier policy could help stabilize liquidity conditions, but uncertainty remains ahead of upcoming FOMC communications. Market Awaits Fed Direction as Key Levels Hold Despite the downside momentum, some analysts argue that the broader cycle remains intact, calling the current pullback a shakeout rather than the start of a prolonged bear phase. For now, BTC’s ability to hold the $86,000–$87,000 zone will be closely watched. A recovery above $89,000 could ease immediate pressure, while a break below support may open the path toward the low-$80,000 range.

Tomorrow, Grayscale Investments, a titan in digital asset management, will launch the first-ever spot LINK ETF. This move, first reported by Cointelegraph, is not just another fund listing; it’s a pivotal moment for Chainlink’s native token and a significant signal of growing institutional confidence in the crypto ecosystem. This spot LINK ETF represents a new, accessible bridge for traditional investors to gain direct exposure to LINK’s potential. What Exactly Is This Spot LINK ETF? Let’s break down this headline-grabbing term. An ETF, or Exchange-Traded Fund, is a type of investment fund traded on stock exchanges, much like a stock. A spot ETF is crucial here—it means the fund directly holds the underlying asset, in this case, LINK tokens. Therefore, Grayscale’s new product will buy and hold actual LINK to back the value of its shares. This differs from futures-based ETFs, which use contracts betting on the asset’s future price. This direct backing is a major vote of confidence in the asset itself. Why Is This Launch So Significant for Chainlink? Chainlink’s role as the leading decentralized oracle network is well-established, powering smart contracts with real-world data. However, the launch of a spot LINK ETF elevates its profile in several key ways: Enhanced Legitimacy: A spot ETF from a firm like Grayscale signals to the broader financial market that LINK is a mature and credible asset worthy of a structured investment vehicle. Mainstream Accessibility: It allows investors to buy exposure to LINK through their traditional brokerage accounts, without the need to navigate crypto exchanges or manage private keys. Potential for Increased Liquidity: As investment flows into the ETF, Grayscale will need to purchase more LINK to back its shares, which could positively impact the token’s market dynamics. What Does Grayscale’s Move Tell Us About Crypto Trends? Grayscale’s decision to launch a spot LINK ETF is a strategic one. Following the landmark approvals of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the firm is now expanding its product suite to target other high-conviction assets. Chainlink, with its fundamental utility in the Web3 infrastructure, stands out. This launch suggests that institutional players are looking beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum, seeking to provide exposure to the essential “picks and shovels” projects that enable the broader blockchain economy to function. What Should Investors Consider Before Jumping In? While this is a historic and optimistic development, a measured perspective is essential. Investors should understand that this spot LINK ETF will still be subject to the volatility inherent to the cryptocurrency market. The price of the ETF shares will reflect the market price of LINK. Furthermore, like all ETFs, it will carry management fees. Therefore, it’s crucial to research the fund’s specific details, such as its expense ratio and custody structure, once Grayscale makes them publicly available. A New Chapter for Institutional Crypto Adoption In conclusion, tomorrow’s launch is far more than a new ticker symbol. It is a watershed moment that bridges the gap between Chainlink’s innovative technology and the vast pool of traditional capital. This spot LINK ETF validates the growing institutional narrative around real-world asset tokenization and the critical infrastructure needed to support it. It provides a streamlined, familiar path for investment, potentially unlocking a new wave of demand and recognition for the Chainlink network. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: When exactly does the spot LINK ETF start trading? A: The ETF is scheduled to launch tomorrow. Investors should check their brokerage platforms for the specific ticker symbol and availability as trading begins. Q: How is a spot ETF different from other crypto investment products? A: A spot ETF directly holds the cryptocurrency it tracks (LINK). This differs from futures-based ETFs or trusts (like GBTC was), offering more direct exposure to the asset’s spot price. Q: Can I buy this ETF in any country? A: Initially, it will likely be available to investors in jurisdictions where Grayscale products are offered, primarily the United States. Always check your local regulations and brokerage access. Q: Will this ETF impact the price of LINK? A: It has the potential to. As the ETF grows and Grayscale buys more LINK to back its shares, it could create increased buying pressure. However, market dynamics are complex and influenced by many factors. Q: Is my investment in the ETF insured? A: ETF shares are not insured like bank deposits. Their value fluctuates with the market. The underlying LINK tokens will be held by a custodian, but standard market and custodial risks apply. Q: Does this mean Chainlink is a safer investment now? A: “Safer” is relative. The ETF provides a regulated, accessible vehicle, but LINK itself remains a volatile crypto asset. The ETF adds legitimacy but does not eliminate fundamental market risk. Found this breakdown of the historic spot LINK ETF launch helpful? The move by Grayscale is a major signal for the entire crypto market.

The firm moved 6,300 Ethereum, valued at a staggering $17.6 million, to the leading exchange. This single action, reported by on-chain analysts, sends powerful ripples through the ecosystem. What does a deposit of this magnitude from a top-tier firm truly signify for Ethereum’s trajectory and broader market sentiment? Let’s dive into the implications. What Does the Paradigm ETH Deposit to Coinbase Mean? The recent Paradigm deposits ETH to Coinbase event is more than just a large number on a screen. For context, Paradigm is a premier crypto investment firm known for its strategic, long-term vision. When such an entity moves a substantial amount of ETH to an exchange, market participants immediately analyze the potential reasons. Typically, deposits to exchanges can precede several actions, including selling, staking, or using the assets as collateral for other financial activities. However, the sheer size of this transfer suggests a deliberate and calculated move rather than a routine transaction. Therefore, understanding the motive behind the Paradigm deposits ETH to Coinbase is crucial. Is this a preparation for profit-taking, a rebalancing of their portfolio, or part of a larger, undisclosed strategy? The timing is also key, as it interacts with current market conditions, regulatory news, and Ethereum’s own network developments. This action provides a real-time case study in institutional behavior within the volatile crypto space. Decoding the Potential Market Impact So, what could be the immediate and future consequences of this major deposit? Large movements by “crypto whales”—entities holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency—often influence market psychology and liquidity. Liquidity and Price Pressure: A $17.6 million ETH deposit increases sell-side liquidity on Coinbase. If Paradigm decides to sell, it could create short-term downward pressure on Ethereum’s price. Sentiment Indicator: Other investors watch firms like Paradigm closely. This move could be interpreted as a bearish signal, potentially triggering copycat actions or increased caution among traders. Operational Strategy: The deposit might not be for a sale at all. It could be for staking ETH on Coinbase’s platform to earn rewards, or for use in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols accessible through the exchange.

It demonstrates the visibility that blockchain technology provides and offers a lesson in market analysis. While the immediate reasons are known only to Paradigm, the transaction reinforces key principles for all market participants: conduct thorough research, understand the context of major moves, and never let a single headline override a sound, long-term strategy. The crypto market continues to evolve, and informed observation is your most valuable tool. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why would Paradigm deposit ETH to Coinbase instead of selling it directly? A: Depositing to an exchange is the first step. It provides the flexibility to sell, stake, lend, or use the ETH as collateral. The deposit itself doesn’t confirm a sale has occurred; it simply moves the assets to a platform where various actions are possible. Q2: Should I sell my ETH because Paradigm deposited a large amount to an exchange? A: Not necessarily. One institutional transaction should not be the sole reason for your investment decisions. Consider your own financial goals, market research, and the fact that Paradigm’s move could be part of a complex strategy unrelated to a simple sell-off. Q3: How can I track large crypto transactions like this one? A: You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan for Ethereum. By following the transaction hash or known institutional wallet addresses, you can see real-time movements of funds. Several analytics platforms also aggregate and report on these “whale” transactions. Q4: What is a “crypto whale” and why are their moves important? A: A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a large enough amount of a cryptocurrency that their trades can potentially influence the market price. Their moves are watched closely as potential indicators of market sentiment and future price direction. Q5: Does this deposit mean Paradigm is losing faith in Ethereum? A: It’s too early to draw that conclusion. Paradigm is a multi-faceted investment firm. Moving assets is a routine part of portfolio management. The deposit could be for staking (which shows commitment), for rebalancing, or for deploying capital into new opportunities within the same ecosystem. Q6: What’s the difference between an exchange deposit and an on-chain transfer? A: An on-chain transfer moves crypto from one wallet to another on the blockchain. A deposit to an exchange like Coinbase is a specific type of transfer where the recipient address is controlled by the exchange. This typically means the user is preparing to use the exchange’s services. Found this analysis of the Paradigm deposit insightful? The crypto world moves fast, and knowledge is power.

This guidance, emerging during a bear market, highlights a strategic shift where major financial players see long-term value in digital assets. Let’s explore what this crypto portfolio allocation advice means for you and why other giants like BlackRock and Fidelity are echoing similar sentiments. What Does BofA’s Crypto Portfolio Allocation Advice Really Mean? Chris Hyzy, Chief Investment Officer of BofA Private Bank, framed the recommendation carefully. He suggested that a crypto portfolio allocation of one to 4% could be appropriate for specific investors. This isn’t a blanket statement for everyone. According to Hyzy, the ideal candidate is an investor interested in thematic innovation who can stomach high volatility. The lower end of the range (1%) suits more conservative profiles, while the upper end (4%) is for those willing to assume greater risk for potential growth. This nuanced approach is crucial. It treats cryptocurrency not as a speculative gamble, but as a deliberate, measured component of a broader investment strategy. The recommendation acknowledges the asset class’s volatility while recognizing its potential role in a diversified portfolio focused on future innovation. Why Are Major Institutions Suddenly Bullish on Crypto? BofA is not alone in this thinking. The report notes that other financial titans have issued their own guidelines: BlackRock advises a 1% to 2% allocation to Bitcoin specifically. Fidelity recommends a slightly higher range of 2% to 5%. This convergence of advice from traditionally cautious institutions is a powerful signal. It suggests a collective belief that digital assets have matured beyond a niche trend and warrant a strategic place in modern portfolio theory. Their focus is on long-term thematic exposure to blockchain technology and digital finance, not short-term price speculation. How Can You Implement a Smart Crypto Portfolio Allocation? Adopting a crypto portfolio allocation requires a plan, not just a purchase. First, assess your own risk tolerance honestly. Are you the conservative investor at the 1% level, or can you tolerate the volatility for a 4% stake? This percentage should be money you are prepared to hold through market cycles. Next, consider diversification within the allocation itself. Instead of putting the entire portion into a single cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, you might spread it across: Bitcoin (BTC): Often viewed as digital gold and a store of value. Ethereum (ETH): Provides exposure to smart contracts and decentralized applications. A diversified fund or ETF: Offers broad exposure to the top crypto assets, reducing single-asset risk. Finally, treat this like any other investment. Rebalance your portfolio periodically. If your crypto allocation grows significantly beyond its target percentage due to a price surge, consider taking some profits to bring it back in line, thereby locking in gains and managing risk. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges? The primary benefit of a strategic crypto portfolio allocation is non-correlated growth . Cryptocurrency markets often move independently of traditional stocks and bonds, which can help smooth overall portfolio returns during economic shifts. It also provides direct exposure to the potentially transformative blockchain sector. However, the challenges are real. Volatility remains extreme. Regulatory uncertainty persists in many regions. Furthermore, the technological learning curve and security concerns (like safeguarding private keys) present hurdles that traditional assets do not. This is precisely why institutions recommend only a small, manageable percentage. Conclusion: A Measured Step into the Digital Future Bank of America’s 4% recommendation is a landmark moment. It represents the cautious yet growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies by the heart of the traditional financial world. This advice isn’t about chasing hype; it’s about making a calculated, limited bet on financial innovation as part of a balanced strategy. For the thoughtful investor, a small, deliberate crypto portfolio allocation could be a prudent way to participate in the digital asset evolution while keeping overall risk firmly in check. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does BofA’s advice mean crypto is now a safe investment? A: No. The recommendation explicitly targets investors who can tolerate high volatility. Crypto remains a high-risk asset class, and the 1-4% allocation reflects that risk by limiting exposure. Q: Should I allocate 4% if I’m new to crypto? A> If you are new, it is wise to start at the lower end of the range (1%). Use this as a learning opportunity to understand market dynamics before considering a larger allocation. Q: How does this differ from just buying Bitcoin? A> BofA’s guidance is for “crypto assets,” which is a broader category. While Bitcoin may be a core holding, a diversified allocation could include other major cryptocurrencies or funds to spread risk. Q: When should I rebalance my crypto allocation? A> Establish a routine, such as a quarterly or annual portfolio review. If your crypto holding deviates significantly from your target percentage (e.g., grows to 7% of a 4% target), rebalance by selling a portion to buy other assets. Q: Where is the best place to hold this allocation? A> For small allocations, a reputable, regulated cryptocurrency exchange may suffice. For larger amounts or long-term holding, consider transferring assets to a secure personal hardware wallet for enhanced security.

That’s exactly the bold advice from Ju Ki-young, CEO of CryptoQuant, who recently declared investors should never sell their Bitcoin . This isn’t just casual commentary; it’s a powerful mandate from a leading on-chain analytics expert. But what does this mean for your portfolio, and is there truly no scenario to exit? Let’s unpack this compelling perspective. What Does “Never Sell Bitcoin” Really Mean? Ju Ki-young’s statement on X sent ripples through the crypto community. His core message is simple yet radical: adopt a permanent holding strategy for Bitcoin. This philosophy extends the popular “HODL” mindset to its absolute conclusion. The rationale often hinges on Bitcoin’s long-term potential as a store of value and hedge against traditional finance. However, he introduced one critical caveat that adds a layer of real-world complexity. The One Exception: When Shareholders Demand It The CEO’s advice isn’t entirely absolute. He noted a single exception where selling might be necessary: if demanded by shareholders. This exception is crucial for understanding the context. It primarily applies to institutional investors, fund managers, and corporate treasuries where fiduciary duty and stakeholder pressure exist. For the average individual investor, this exception may not apply, reinforcing the “never sell” rule for personal portfolios. This distinction highlights the difference between personal conviction and professional responsibility. It shows that even the strongest believers in Bitcoin’s future must navigate external pressures in certain structures. Why Adopt a “Never Sell” Bitcoin Strategy? Proponents of permanently holding Bitcoin point to several key arguments. First, it eliminates emotional trading decisions during market volatility. Second, it aligns with a long-term belief in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition. Consider these potential benefits: Emotional Discipline: Removes the stress of timing the market. Long-Term Growth Focus: Prioritizes multi-year trends over daily price swings. Simplified Strategy: Turns investing into a simple buy-and-hold action. Network Effect Alignment: Bets on Bitcoin’s increasing adoption over decades. What Are the Practical Challenges? While the philosophy sounds straightforward, applying a “never sell” rule presents real challenges. Life events, financial emergencies, or portfolio rebalancing needs can create pressure to liquidate assets. Furthermore, watching significant profits evaporate during bear markets tests even the strongest conviction. This strategy demands exceptional patience and a separate emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses without touching Bitcoin holdings. Another consideration is opportunity cost. By vowing to never sell Bitcoin, investors might miss chances to take profits and reinvest during market dips. However, advocates argue that attempting to time these cycles often results in missing the biggest growth days, which historically have provided disproportionate returns. How Does This Advice Fit With Responsible Investing? Financial advisors typically recommend diversification and periodic portfolio rebalancing. A “never sell Bitcoin” approach seems to contradict this conventional wisdom. Therefore, it’s essential to view this strategy within the context of your overall financial picture. Bitcoin should likely represent a portion of a diversified portfolio, not its entirety. The key is determining what percentage you’re comfortable holding indefinitely, regardless of price fluctuations. This perspective also underscores the importance of only investing what you can truly afford to lock away for the long term. It transforms Bitcoin from a trading vehicle into a generational asset, similar to how some families treat land or gold. Conclusion: Is “Never Sell Bitcoin” Right For You? CryptoQuant CEO Ju Ki-young’s advice to never sell Bitcoin presents a compelling, conviction-driven approach to cryptocurrency investment. It serves as a powerful antidote to fear-based selling and short-term speculation. While the shareholder exception acknowledges institutional realities, for individual investors, it reinforces a ultra-long-term mindset. Ultimately, whether you adopt this absolute stance depends on your belief in Bitcoin’s decades-long trajectory and your personal financial resilience. The strategy isn’t for everyone, but it offers a clear, disciplined framework for those with unshakable faith in digital gold’s future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What did the CryptoQuant CEO actually say about selling Bitcoin? Ju Ki-young stated on X that investors should “never sell their Bitcoin under any circumstances,” but added that an exception could be made if specifically demanded by shareholders, typically in a corporate or fund context. Does “never sell Bitcoin” mean I should invest all my money in it? Absolutely not. This advice refers to the portion of your portfolio you allocate to Bitcoin. Responsible investing always involves diversification across different asset classes to manage risk. How do I handle financial emergencies if I can’t sell my Bitcoin? The “never sell” philosophy assumes you have a separate, liquid emergency fund in stable assets like cash or cash equivalents. Your Bitcoin investment should be separate from money you might need for unexpected expenses. What if Bitcoin’s technology becomes obsolete? This is a key risk that long-term holders accept. The strategy is based on belief in Bitcoin’s enduring network effects and first-mover advantage. However, all investments carry technological obsolescence risk. Can institutions really follow a “never sell” rule? The CEO’s shareholder exception directly addresses this. Institutions have fiduciary duties and reporting requirements that may force selling regardless of management’s personal beliefs, making the “never sell” ideal more applicable to individual investors. Does this advice apply to other cryptocurrencies? The statement specifically addressed Bitcoin. Most investors draw a distinction between Bitcoin’s store-of-value proposition and other cryptocurrencies with different use cases, which may warrant different strategies.

This action highlights the increasing regulatory scrutiny and the importance of transparency in the crypto market. For traders and holders of GRS, this announcement serves as a crucial alert. What Does an Investment Warning Mean for GRS? When an exchange like Upbit or Bithumb places a coin on its investment warning list, it is a serious red flag. It does not mean trading halts immediately, but it signals to users that the asset is under review for potential risks. According to Bithumb’s official statement, the decision stemmed from the GRS project team’s failure to provide sufficient disclosures on matters that could materially impact the coin’s value. Furthermore, the exchange conducted a review of the project’s business progress and found numerous shortcomings. This proactive step by the exchanges is designed to protect their users from assets that may lack fundamental robustness or transparency. Why Are Exchanges Like Upbit Issuing More Warnings? The crypto landscape is maturing, and with that comes greater responsibility. Exchanges are now front-line regulators in many jurisdictions. An investment warning is a tool to enforce market discipline. Here are the core reasons behind such actions: Insufficient Disclosure: Projects must regularly update the public and exchanges on development progress, team changes, and financial health. Business Shortcomings: A review may reveal a lack of tangible progress, a shrinking community, or failed roadmap milestones. Regulatory Pressure: Exchanges pre-empt stricter action by regulators by policing their listings themselves. This trend underscores a shift from a wild-west market to one where due diligence is paramount. For investors, it means the era of blind speculation is fading. What Should GRS Investors Do Now? If you hold GRS, this news demands your attention. An investment warning is a precaution, not a verdict, but it significantly increases risk. Here is a practical action plan: Review the Official Notices: Read the full statements from Upbit and Bithumb to understand their specific concerns. Conduct Your Own Research (DYOR): Investigate the GRS project’s recent communications, GitHub activity, and community engagement. Has the team addressed the exchanges’ concerns? Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Consider if holding an asset under scrutiny aligns with your investment strategy. Volatility may increase. Monitor for Updates: The situation is fluid. The warning could be lifted if the project responds adequately, or it could escalate to a trading suspension. The Bigger Picture: A Wake-Up Call for Crypto Projects This event is a stark reminder for all cryptocurrency projects. Exchanges are gatekeepers with the power to influence an asset’s liquidity and reputation. Transparency is no longer optional. Projects must maintain open lines of communication with both their community and the platforms that list them. Failure to do so can result in a damaging investment warning that erodes trust and value. For the broader market, this is a positive development. It encourages higher standards and weeds out projects that cannot meet basic operational expectations. It empowers investors with more information, making the ecosystem more robust and credible in the long run. Conclusion: Navigating the New Era of Crypto Accountability The investment warning for Groestlcoin by Upbit and Bithumb is a defining moment. It exemplifies the growing accountability in cryptocurrency markets. For investors, it reinforces the critical need for due diligence. For projects, it is a clear mandate for transparency and delivery. While this specific event focuses on GRS, its implications ripple across the entire industry, signaling that substance will increasingly triumph over hype. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still trade GRS on Upbit and Bithumb? A: Yes, as of this warning designation, trading typically continues. However, the warning is a precursor that could lead to restrictions if the issues are not resolved. Always check the latest exchange announcements. Q2: Does an investment warning mean GRS is a scam? A: Not necessarily. It primarily indicates that the exchange has identified a lack of required information or project progress. It is a call for the project to improve its transparency, not a final judgment on legitimacy. Q3: How long do coins usually stay on the investment warning list? A: The duration varies. It depends on how quickly the project team addresses the exchange’s concerns. It could be weeks or months. If concerns are not met, the next step is often delisting. Q4: Should I sell my GRS immediately? A: This is not financial advice. You should make a decision based on your own research and risk assessment. The warning increases the asset’s risk profile, which may influence your holding strategy. Q5: Do other exchanges follow suit when Upbit issues a warning? A: Sometimes. Other exchanges, especially in South Korea, may review the asset independently. However, it is not automatic. Global exchanges may not take immediate action. Q6: Where can I find the official statements from the exchanges? A: Official notices are always posted in the announcement or support sections of the Upbit and Bithumb websites. Rely only on these primary sources for accurate information. Share Your Thoughts Staying informed is key in the fast-moving crypto world.

South Korea’s leading exchange, Bithumb, has announced a critical operational pause. The platform will temporarily suspend all deposits and withdrawals for assets on the Ethereum network. This planned Bithumb Ethereum suspension is a proactive step, not a cause for alarm. Let’s break down exactly what’s happening, why it’s necessary, and how you should prepare. Why is Bithumb Suspending Ethereum Transactions? The core reason for this temporary halt is an upcoming network upgrade. Bithumb is pausing services to ensure a smooth and secure transition during the Ethereum hard fork. This suspension is scheduled to begin at 7:00 a.m. UTC on December 4th. Therefore, if you plan to move ETH or any ERC-20 tokens, you must act before this deadline. Think of a hard fork as a major software update for the Ethereum blockchain itself.

With the deadline approaching, here are your actionable steps: Complete Essential Transfers Early: If you need to deposit ETH for trading or withdraw to a private wallet, do it well before 7:00 a.m. UTC on Dec 4. Monitor Official Channels: Follow Bithumb’s official announcements for the exact resumption time. Delays, though uncommon, can happen. Consider Trading Pairs: If you need immediate liquidity, explore trading into assets on unaffected networks (like Bitcoin or native exchange pairs) before the deadline. This planned Bithumb Ethereum suspension highlights the importance of staying informed about exchange schedules and network upgrades. Proactive exchanges that communicate these changes clearly help protect user funds and maintain ecosystem stability. Conclusion: A Temporary Pause for Long-Term Gain In summary, Bithumb’s decision to suspend Ethereum network services is a responsible and standard industry practice.

This groundbreaking concept is now reality with Liquid Royalty’s SAIL.r token sale , which bridges the gap between blockchain technology and tangible e-commerce profits. For investors seeking exposure to real-world assets (RWAs), this launch represents a significant milestone in decentralized finance. What Is the SAIL.r Token Sale and How Does It Work? The SAIL.r token sale offers investors a unique opportunity to participate in revenue generated from actual product sales on Amazon. Built on the Berachain (BERA) blockchain, Liquid Royalty has tokenized a portfolio of physical goods, transforming their sales performance into a digital asset. Each SAIL.r token is priced at 10 USDe, the stablecoin from Ethena Labs, and functions as a revenue-sharing instrument rather than a speculative cryptocurrency. When you participate in the SAIL.r token sale , you’re essentially buying a stake in a diversified product portfolio. This portfolio includes three main categories that demonstrate consistent market demand: Kitchenware products with proven consumer appeal Smart home appliances in the growing tech integration market Silver industry products catering to an aging demographic Why Should Investors Consider This RWA Opportunity? The underlying business model presents compelling numbers that distinguish this from purely speculative crypto projects. The product portfolio boasts a gross merchandise volume (GMV) exceeding $50 million, with impressive growth metrics that include: 36.75% year-over-year growth rate 38% total return on the underlying assets Monthly dividend payments in USDe stablecoin This SAIL.r token sale represents a fundamental shift in how blockchain technology can create value. Instead of relying on market speculation, token holders receive 10% of the on-chain revenue generated from actual product sales. This creates a direct correlation between real-world business performance and crypto asset returns. How Does the Revenue Distribution System Function? The distribution mechanism is elegantly simple yet technologically sophisticated. Each month, a portion of the revenue from Amazon sales is converted to USDe stablecoins and distributed proportionally to SAIL.r token holders. This creates a predictable income stream that contrasts with the volatility typically associated with cryptocurrency investments. Transparency is a cornerstone of this SAIL.r token sale . Investors can track real-time sales data through LiquidRoyaltyScan, providing unprecedented visibility into the performance of the underlying assets. This level of transparency addresses one of the traditional concerns about RWA projects – the verification of off-chain activity. Where and How Can You Participate in the Token Sale? The SAIL.r token sale is accessible through two primary channels, catering to both traditional and decentralized finance participants: Official Liquid Royalty Website : For direct purchases using standard payment methods Kodiak Decentralized Exchange (DEX) : For crypto-native investors preferring decentralized platforms This dual approach ensures broad accessibility while maintaining the decentralized ethos of blockchain technology. The fixed price of 10 USDe per token provides clarity for investors calculating their potential returns based on the revenue-sharing model. What Are the Potential Benefits and Considerations? The SAIL.r token sale offers several distinct advantages for forward-thinking investors. First, it provides diversification beyond traditional crypto assets by linking returns to real-world commerce. Second, the monthly USDe dividends offer a stable income component rarely found in cryptocurrency investments. Third, the transparency of sales tracking through LiquidRoyaltyScan reduces information asymmetry. However, investors should consider several factors. The success of dividends depends entirely on the continued sales performance of the underlying products. Additionally, while built on Berachain, the project’s success is tied to both blockchain functionality and real-world retail dynamics. Regulatory considerations for RWA tokens continue to evolve across different jurisdictions. Conclusion: A New Frontier in Crypto-Asset Integration The SAIL.r token sale represents more than just another cryptocurrency offering. It demonstrates how blockchain technology can create tangible bridges between digital assets and real-world economic activity. By tokenizing Amazon sales revenue, Liquid Royalty has created a novel investment vehicle that combines the innovation of decentralized finance with the stability of established commerce. For investors seeking alternatives to purely speculative crypto assets, this offering provides exposure to real business performance with transparent tracking and regular income distribution. As the RWA sector continues to mature, projects like the SAIL.r token sale may redefine how we think about value creation in the blockchain ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly am I buying in the SAIL.r token sale? You’re purchasing a token that entitles you to monthly dividends representing 10% of the on-chain revenue from a specific portfolio of products sold on Amazon. You’re not buying equity in the company or the products themselves, but rather a revenue-sharing right. How are the monthly dividends calculated and paid? Dividends are calculated as 10% of the verified on-chain revenue from product sales. Each month, this amount is converted to USDe stablecoins and distributed proportionally to all SAIL.r token holders based on their holdings. Can I track the performance of the underlying products? Yes, real-time sales data is publicly available through LiquidRoyaltyScan, providing transparency into the revenue generation that determines your dividend payments. What happens if product sales decline? Your dividend payments would decrease proportionally with sales declines, as they’re directly tied to revenue performance. The token value might also be affected by changing expectations about future revenue. Is there a minimum investment amount? Since each token costs 10 USDe, the minimum investment would typically be for one token, though platform-specific minimums might apply on the purchase channels. How does this differ from traditional dividend stocks? While similar in providing regular income, SAIL.r tokens operate on blockchain technology with potentially greater transparency through on-chain revenue tracking and operate in a different regulatory environment than traditional securities.

The changes, originally proposed by Japan’s Financial Services Agency in November, now have political momentum heading into 2026. Under the plan, the FSA intends to introduce a bill during the regular Diet session in early 2026. The shift would bring crypto taxation in line with equities and investment trusts, which already benefit from a uniform 20% rate. Current System Burdens Crypto Traders With High Rates Under existing rules, profits from crypto trading are categorized as “miscellaneous income,” meaning individuals and businesses face income-based taxation. The rate can range from as low as 5% to as high as 45%, depending on annual earnings. High-income earners may also be subject to an additional 10% inhabitant tax, pushing the total burden even higher. This system has long been criticized for discouraging both investment and innovation in Japan’s digital-asset sector. By contrast, gains from equities and investment funds are treated separately from income tax and taxed at a consistent 20%. Proposed Changes Aim to Boost Domestic Crypto Activity Nikkei Asia reported that the proposed reduction is part of a broader plan to place crypto assets within a “solid investor-protection framework” while aligning them more closely with other financial products. The reforms are expected to increase domestic participation by removing one of the biggest deterrents facing retail and institutional investors. If passed, the new structure could make Japan one of the more competitive major markets for digital-asset investing. FSA Bill Targets Oversight, Transparency and Market Integrity Alongside the tax reduction, the FSA’s upcoming legislation will include new rules aimed at tightening market oversight. These measures will reportedly address the handling of non-public information, enhance disclosure requirements and introduce safeguards to reduce risks in crypto trading. The goal is to strengthen regulatory protections while allowing the industry to grow under clearer, more favorable conditions. Lobbying Efforts Show Signs of Paying Off For nearly three years, the Japan Blockchain Association has pushed for a flat-rate tax structure for crypto assets. In 2023, the group published a formal letter urging the government to adopt a 20% rate similar to those used for other investments. “This letter requests a review of tax on crypto assets, which is the biggest hurdle for companies operating Web3 businesses in Japan and a disincentive for the public to actively own and use crypto assets,” the letter reads. While the FSA has not confirmed whether the association’s lobbying directly influenced its decision, the agency began publicly considering reforms in late 2024. Industry Prepares for a New Phase of Growth If the legislation passes in 2026, Japan’s crypto market may experience a substantial increase in trading activity. Lower taxes, combined with stronger investor protections, could attract both domestic users and international companies seeking regulatory stability. The reform would represent one of Japan’s most significant steps toward modernizing its financial landscape and reaffirming its position as a major hub for blockchain innovation.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-12-02 02:46:15

The large language model will be trained to properly understand Ukrainian context, dialects and minority languages. Training will be done first with Google infrastructure before moving to local servers. Officials are expecting cyberattacks upon launch and are preparing defenses against threats like prompt injection. Ukraine has launched a national AI project Ukraine is developing a large language model using Google’s open-source Gemma framework. The country aims to create a fully independent artificial intelligence system for both military and civilian use. Ukraine’s digital ministry and mobile operator Kyivstar announced the project on Monday. It will use Google’s computing infrastructure for initial training before shifting entirely to local infrastructure, ensuring Ukraine retains full control over what AI systems can be accessed by its 23 million citizens daily. Google was selected for the project after extensive evaluation. Meta’s Llama and France’s Mistral AI models were also among the options considered, according to sources familiar with the decision, per a Reuters report. Chinese language models, including DeepSeek and Qwen were also rejected for the project. The Ukrainian military already uses AI tools for aerial and satellite reconnaissance, drone operations, and battlefield analysis. Oleksandr Bornyakov, the deputy minister of digital transformation of Ukraine, explained that avoiding reliance on systems like OpenAI’s ChatGPT was intentional, as Ukraine’s armed forces plan to integrate AI into battlefield management systems for troop coordination and enemy monitoring. Addressing the language gap The project stems partly from communication gaps affecting current AI systems. Bornyakov noticed how the existing AI systems struggle to process the dialect of people from his hometown of Bolhrad in Odesa Oblast, where a blend of Ukrainian, Russian, and Bulgarian is used. Misha Nestor, Kyivstar’s chief product officer, who is overseeing the project, highlighted problems like mistranslations in legal documents and AI-generated errors. Four advisory committees will be in charge of the technical, legal, cultural, historical and linguistic aspects of the new model, ensuring it handles Ukrainian and minority languages such as Crimean Tatar, as well as Russian. Data is being collected from over 90 government institutions, including court registries, educational publishers, regional archives and records of Russian actions during the ongoing war. This comprehensive dataset will allow the AI to understand Ukrainian context and terminology far better than general-purpose global models. The Ministry of Digital Transformation experts say that Gemma is one of the most efficient open models by size and quality, providing a stable balance between performance and resource use. The model’s multilingual support includes Ukrainian already within its capabilities, and its extended tokenizer supports up to 128,000 tokens with multimodal processing of both text and images. Training will occur on secure graphics processing units outside Ukraine, provided by Google , before the finished models are deployed on local data centers. This is the country’s solution to the ongoing threat of Russian strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure. Bornyakov stated that officials expect the system to be attacked immediately after release. The team is developing protections against various cyber threats, including prompt injection attacks where malicious instructions are embedded in tasks given to the AI. Kyivstar has installed more than 3,500 backup generators to stabilize operations as Russia continues to strike Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. The telecommunications company serves more than 22.5 million mobile customers and over 1.2 million fixed-line internet customers as of September.

According to data from Onchain Lens, this pioneer moved 50 BTC, worth approximately $4.33 million, from a wallet that had lain completely dormant since the network’s infancy. This event is more than just a transaction; it’s a direct message from Bitcoin’s past, prompting urgent questions about its future. Why Does This Early Bitcoin Miner Movement Matter? When an early Bitcoin miner activates a wallet untouched for over a decade, it’s a significant on-chain event. These original miners are like digital archaeologists, holding coins mined when the network was just an experiment. Their actions are closely watched because they can signal major shifts in holder sentiment. This movement, therefore, is a powerful data point for understanding long-term Bitcoin economics. The transaction was simple yet profound: 50 BTC split and sent to five new addresses. However, the implications are complex. It could indicate several things: Estate Planning: The original miner may be securing assets for heirs. Market Timing: A decision to realize gains after years of patience. Wallet Management: A simple technical upgrade to modern security standards. What Challenges Do Dormant Coins Present? Dormant coins from an early Bitcoin miner create a unique dynamic in the market. They represent potential future supply that is unpredictable. Their sudden activation can cause short-term price volatility as traders speculate on the intent behind the move. Furthermore, there is always the looming question of lost keys. Millions of Bitcoin are estimated to be permanently inaccessible, making every awakened wallet a minor miracle. This event highlights the incredible discipline of early adopters. Holding through multiple boom-and-bust cycles, including the 2017 mania and the 2021 all-time high, requires immense conviction. The decision to move now, after 15 years, suggests a calculated strategy rather than a panicked sale. What Can We Learn from This Bitcoin Time Capsule? The awakening of this early Bitcoin miner offers actionable insights for today’s investors. First, it underscores the paramount importance of secure, long-term storage. Second, it demonstrates the life-changing potential of patient, conviction-based holding in a volatile asset class. For the market, it’s a reminder that Bitcoin’s history is still actively shaping its present. This movement is not happening in isolation. It coincides with a period of renewed institutional interest and regulatory clarity in many regions. Therefore, while one entity’s actions don’t dictate the market, they contribute to the broader narrative of Bitcoin’s maturation from a cypherpunk experiment to a recognized store of value. Conclusion: A Message from Bitcoin’s Past The transfer by this early Bitcoin miner is a fascinating chapter in Bitcoin’s ongoing story. It connects the network’s foundational era with its current financial landscape. Whether this leads to a sale, further holding, or another long dormancy, it reinforces key cryptocurrency principles: sovereignty, patience, and the power of decentralized history written on an immutable ledger. This event is a powerful testament to the enduring vision of Bitcoin’s creators and earliest supporters. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is this early Bitcoin miner? A1: The identity is unknown, as Bitcoin wallets are pseudonymous. We only know the address was active in mining over 15 years ago, making the owner a true pioneer. Q2: Why move the coins after 15 years? A2: Possible reasons include estate planning, taking profits, upgrading security, or simply testing the wallet. Without the owner’s statement, we can only speculate based on common motivations. Q3: Will this transaction affect Bitcoin’s price? A3: While 50 BTC is a large sum, it’s a tiny fraction of daily trading volume. It may cause minor speculation, but it’s unlikely to directly cause significant price movement. Q4: How many dormant Bitcoin wallets are there? A4> Estimates vary, but blockchain analysts believe millions of Bitcoin, mined in the early years, have not moved in over a decade. Some are likely lost forever. Q5: What does “early miner” mean? A5: An early miner is someone who mined Bitcoin in its first few years (roughly 2009-2012), when difficulty was low, and it was possible to mine significant amounts using ordinary computers. Q6: Is my Bitcoin safe if I leave it in one wallet for years? A6> Yes, from a network perspective. However, you must ensure your private keys or seed phrase are stored securely and physically. Technological obsolescence is a risk for long-term storage. Did this glimpse into Bitcoin’s hidden history intrigue you?

Vanguard Responds To Crypto Demand Bloomberg reported on Monday that beginning on December 2, investors will have the opportunity to trade crypto-focused ETFs and mutual funds holding select cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Solana (SOL). Vanguard’s move appears to be driven by continuous interest in cryptocurrency investment, particularly in light of President Donald Trump’s stance on digital assets, which marks a significant shift from the previous administration. The firm’s new policy will open access to over 50 million brokerage customers, who collectively manage more than $11 trillion in assets, allowing them to engage with regulated cryptocurrency investment products. Andrew Kadjeski, Vanguard’s head of brokerage and investments, remarked, “Cryptocurrency ETFs and mutual funds have been tested through periods of market volatility, performing as designed while maintaining liquidity.” He emphasized that the administrative systems established for managing such funds have matured, accommodating evolving investor preferences. No Memecoins Allowed The firm stated it will support a variety of crypto ETFs and mutual funds that comply with regulatory requirements, similar to how it approaches other non-core asset classes, such as gold. Additionally, funds linked to memecoins, classified as higher-risk by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), will not be included in this initiative. Kadjeski noted, “While Vanguard has no plans to launch its own crypto products, we serve millions of investors with diverse needs and risk profiles, and we aim to provide a brokerage trading platform that allows our clients to invest in choices that align with their preferences.” Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",Breaking News Ticker|Bitcoin ETF news|crypto|crypto ETFs|crypto news|Cryptocurrency|Vanguard|Vanguard crypto|Vanguard crypto ETFs|Vanguard news,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-02 02:56:34

The USDT issuer has shown a notable reduction in government debt exposure, paired with an expanded position in hard assets known for durability and independence from traditional financial systems. Treasury Exposure Drops Amid Changing Macro And Regulatory Landscape Stablecoin giant, Tether, has reduced its US Treasury holdings and increased its Gold and Bitcoin reserves. CryptosRus reported on X that Tether is quietly repositioning itself for what the company expects to be the Federal Reserve’s (FED) next round of rate cuts. Related Reading: Rumble At The Core: How Tether Plans To Dominate The US Stablecoin Market According to BitMex founder Arthur Hayes, Tether’s latest reserve update shows a clear shift away from the US treasuries and deeper into BTC and gold, a sign that the company is positioning for a changing macro environment. Furthermore, the Standard & Poor (S&P) Global noted that Tether is now leaning more heavily into assets with larger price swings in value, warning that this mix could expose USDT if markets turn volatile. Meanwhile, the current S&P Global rating on Tether remains weak. Thus, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has pushed back, saying that the company holds no toxic assets. He claims that its rapid growth reflects a broader shift towards new financial systems that operate outside the traditional banking world. Why Attempts To Break Tether Are Difficult In Practice Crypto analyst Ted Pillows has also offered insight into the Tether Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) as it is making its usual rounds again. The narrative is latching onto the company’s latest attestation, showing a notable shift into Gold and Bitcoin to offset declining interest income. Meanwhile, if these risk assets drop by 30%, Tether’s equity buffer could evaporate, creating an environment where Tether will be insolvent, and panic will kick in. Related Reading: Tether Targets $500 Billion Valuation In New Equity Offering Amid US Expansion Plans However, Ted is steadfast and believes that Tether has been through a decade of this same FUD, and USDT is still sitting at $1.00. They’re fully liquid, but they operate on a fractional-reserve model, much like traditional banks. As long as redemptions remain normal, everything will work smoothly. A problem will only arise if there’s an irrational panic, and then liquidity stress could hit quickly. According to Ted, the USDT isn’t fully backed by cash, but it’s backed by a diverse portfolio that includes the US treasuries, yield-generating assets, and some risk assets. This is all scaled to a massive $174 billion stablecoin. “If someone wants to kill USDT, it’s possible, but I highly doubt it,” Ted noted.

South Korea’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit, has issued a crucial announcement that directly impacts INJ holders. The platform will temporarily suspend all deposits and withdrawals for the Injective (INJ) token. This planned Upbit INJ suspension is a proactive measure tied to an essential network upgrade. Let’s break down what you need to know and how to navigate this brief pause. Why is Upbit Suspending INJ Transactions? The primary reason for this temporary halt is a scheduled network upgrade on the Injective blockchain. Exchanges like Upbit often pause external transactions during such events to ensure security and accuracy. This prevents any potential issues, such as funds being sent to an incompatible address or getting lost during the protocol transition. Therefore, this Upbit INJ suspension is a standard, safety-first procedure in the crypto world. The suspension window is precise. It begins at 1:00 p.m. UTC on December 3rd. Upbit has not specified an end time, which is common. The service will resume once their technical team confirms the network upgrade is stable and fully operational. Traders should monitor Upbit’s official announcements for the restart notice. What Does This Mean for Your INJ Holdings? First, don’t panic. This is a temporary, planned maintenance action. However, it does require your attention. Here’s a clear breakdown of what is and isn’t affected: Deposits & Withdrawals (Halted): You cannot send INJ to your Upbit wallet from an external wallet, nor can you withdraw INJ from Upbit to another address. Trading (Likely Unaffected): Crucially, the spot trading of INJ against other cryptocurrencies like KRW, BTC, or USDT on Upbit’s internal order book is expected to continue normally. Existing Holdings (Safe): The INJ tokens already in your Upbit account remain secure and under your control. This distinction is vital. The Upbit INJ suspension affects moving tokens on and off the exchange but not buying or selling them within it. How Should You Prepare for the Suspension? Being prepared can save you from unexpected inconvenience. Follow these simple, actionable steps: Complete Transfers Early: If you need to deposit or withdraw INJ, do so well before the 1:00 p.m. UTC deadline on December 3rd. Double-Check Deadlines: Remember to account for time zone differences and potential network congestion, which can slow transactions. Monitor Official Channels: For the most reliable updates, check Upbit’s official website or verified social media accounts. Avoid relying on unofficial sources. Plan Trading Accordingly: If your strategy depends on moving assets, adjust your plans for this brief period. What Are the Broader Implications for Injective? Network upgrades, while causing short-term operational pauses, are generally positive long-term signals. They often introduce: Enhanced scalability and speed Improved security features New functionality for developers and users This Upbit INJ suspension highlights the growing maturity of the Injective ecosystem, where major exchanges actively support its technical evolution. It reflects a commitment to providing a secure and up-to-date trading environment for all users. Final Summary and Key Takeaways In summary, Upbit’s temporary suspension of INJ deposits and withdrawals is a routine safety procedure for an upcoming network upgrade. While external transfers are paused, trading on the exchange likely continues. The key for users is to plan ahead, complete necessary transfers before the deadline, and stay informed through official channels. This minor operational pause underscores the professional handling of blockchain developments by major exchanges, ultimately contributing to a more robust crypto infrastructure. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still trade INJ on Upbit during the suspension? A: Yes, in most cases, spot trading (buying and selling INJ on the exchange’s internal market) continues normally. Only deposits and withdrawals from external wallets are suspended. Q2: How long will the Upbit INJ suspension last? A: Upbit has not announced a specific end time. The service will resume after they confirm the Injective network upgrade is complete and stable. Monitor their official announcements for the restart notice. Q3: Are my INJ tokens safe on Upbit during this time? A: Yes, your existing INJ holdings in your Upbit account are secure. The suspension only affects the movement of tokens to and from the exchange, not the custody of assets already there. Q4: What happens if I send INJ to Upbit during the suspension? A: It is highly advised not to do this. Transactions sent during the suspension may not be credited automatically and could be lost or require manual recovery by support, which can be a lengthy process. Q5: Will other exchanges also suspend INJ services? A: Possibly. Other exchanges supporting INJ may announce similar temporary suspensions for their own network upgrade maintenance. Always check the announcements from your specific exchange. Q6: Is this suspension a bad sign for the INJ token? A: No, it is a neutral-to-positive operational procedure. Network upgrades are necessary for improvement and growth, and exchanges pausing services to ensure safety is a sign of responsible management.

55228615,637279,1764644416,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55228615.jpeg,Bitcoin Most Reactive Group Faces Heavy Losses: Drawdowns Match Prior Cycle Bottoms,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-most-reactive-group-faces-heavy-losses/,"Bitcoin is entering a decisive moment as selling pressure intensifies and uncertainty continues to grip the market. Bulls are struggling to reclaim higher levels, and each failed rebound reinforces the prevailing downtrend. With momentum weakening across spot and derivatives markets, investors are increasingly questioning whether BTC can stabilize before more serious structural damage occurs. According to a report by Darkfost, the situation is especially difficult for short-term participants. With a realized price of $113,692, the BTC 1–3 month cohort is now experiencing the largest percentage loss of this entire cycle. This analysis focuses exclusively on the spot market, isolating a group of investors known for more speculative behavior and faster reaction times. Because these holders typically enter during strong momentum phases, their capitulation or continued holding often signals pivotal shifts in market structure. The deep losses within this cohort reveal how aggressively the market has reversed and underscore the mounting pressure on shorter-term players. As Bitcoin approaches critical support levels, the behavior of these investors may determine whether the current correction stabilizes — or accelerates into a broader downturn. Short-Term Holder Capitulation Often Signals Bottom Formation Darkfost highlights that the 1–3 month Bitcoin holder cohort has now spent nearly two weeks sitting on average unrealized losses between 20% and 25%. Historically, this type of drawdown among short-term participants has tended to occur near cyclical bottom formation. These traders typically react quickly to volatility, and when their losses reach this depth, they are pushed into a critical decision point: sell and exit the market, or hold and endure further downside. Throughout this cycle, similar phases of elevated losses have preceded major inflection points. Once a large portion of these speculative holders capitulates — a process that appears to have been unfolding in recent weeks — selling pressure usually begins to exhaust. This shift often creates an environment where accumulation becomes far more attractive for patient investors who track sentiment and realized-price dynamics. However, Darkfost emphasizes that this pattern only holds if the long-term bullish trend remains intact. Structural on-chain indicators, broader demand trends, and long-horizon holder behavior continue to support the idea that Bitcoin’s macro trend has not been invalidated. While volatility may persist in the short term, the alignment of capitulation signals with a still-intact long-term structure suggests that current levels could become an opportunity for strategic accumulation. Bitcoin Tests Weekly Level as Market Searches for Higher-Timeframe Support Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows the most significant corrective phase since the early stages of the cycle, with price falling sharply from the $120,000 region and now attempting to stabilize around the 100 SMA near $84,000–$85,000. This moving average has historically acted as a major structural support during bull markets, and BTC’s current interaction with it marks a critical juncture for the broader trend. The breakdown below the 50 SMA was a clear sign of weakening momentum, signaling that sellers have gained control of the higher-timeframe structure. However, the wick formed beneath the 100 SMA suggests that buyers are beginning to step in, attempting to defend this crucial zone. The reaction so far is constructive but not yet decisive — BTC needs a stronger weekly close above $90,000 to confirm stability. Volume has increased during the decline, indicating forced selling and capitulation rather than organic trend reversal. Historically, pullbacks into the 100 SMA often precede medium-term bottoms within a long-term bullish market, but continuation depends on whether BTC can avoid a sustained weekly close below this level.

U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net inflow, marking the fourth consecutive day of positive movement. While the $370,000 figure might seem modest, the continuation of this trend tells a deeper story about investor sentiment and market stability for this groundbreaking financial product. What Does This Bitcoin ETF Inflow Trend Really Mean? The data from TraderT reveals a fascinating pattern. A net inflow means more new money entered these funds than left them. However, the volume has decreased significantly from previous days. This creates a nuanced picture: sustained interest is meeting with increased caution or profit-taking in certain quarters. Understanding this balance is crucial for any investor watching the Bitcoin ETF landscape. Breaking Down the December 1st Bitcoin ETF Flows The small net inflow resulted from a clash of opposing forces. A substantial $74.03 million outflow from the giant BlackRock’s IBIT fund was counterbalanced by positive movements elsewhere. Fidelity’s FBTC attracted $67.02 million in new capital. Ark Invest’s ARKB saw a $7.38 million inflow. The remaining nine U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs reported no net activity for the day. This highlights a key dynamic: the Bitcoin ETF market is not monolithic. Different funds appeal to different investor bases, and daily flows can vary wildly between them. Why Should You Care About Consistent Bitcoin ETF Inflows? Four days of net positive flows is more than a statistical blip. It signals building momentum. For the broader market, consistent inflows into a spot Bitcoin ETF provide a baseline of demand that can support the asset’s price. It demonstrates that despite volatility, there is a steady, institutional-grade bid in the market. This can be a stabilizing force, separating Bitcoin’s price action from pure retail speculation. The Bigger Picture for Bitcoin ETF Investors While the headline number was small, the trend is the true takeaway. The market for these products is maturing. Investors are making deliberate choices, moving capital between funds based on fees, brand trust, or strategic outlook. This daily flow data acts as a real-time sentiment gauge for sophisticated money entering the crypto space via the regulated Bitcoin ETF pathway. Conclusion: A Steady Drip Can Fill the Bucket The December 1st data for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs reinforces a narrative of gradual, sustained adoption. The fourth consecutive day of inflows, however modest, points to entrenched interest rather than fleeting hype. For long-term observers, this consistent trickle of capital may prove more significant than short-term spikes, quietly building the foundation for the next phase of crypto integration into traditional finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a net inflow for a Bitcoin ETF? A net inflow occurs when the total amount of new money invested into a Bitcoin ETF on a given day is greater than the amount withdrawn by sellers. It indicates positive buying pressure for that fund. Why did BlackRock’s IBIT have an outflow while others had inflows? Daily flows can differ between funds due to various factors like investor rebalancing, profit-taking by large holders in a specific fund, or tactical shifts by institutional managers between different ETF providers. Are four days of inflows a strong bullish signal? While positive, it’s a short-term trend. It suggests stability and ongoing interest, but a sustained bullish signal would require consistent inflows over weeks or months alongside positive price action. How can I use this Bitcoin ETF flow data? Investors can use this data as one of many tools to gauge institutional sentiment. Consistent inflows can be a confirming indicator of broader market health, but should not be used in isolation for investment decisions. Where can I find daily Bitcoin ETF flow data? Data is aggregated by several analytics firms and financial news outlets. Sources like TraderT, Farside Investors, and major crypto news platforms regularly publish this information. Do net inflows guarantee the Bitcoin price will rise? Not directly. While inflows create buying pressure for the underlying Bitcoin held by the ETF, the overall price is influenced by global spot market trading, which is much larger. ETF flows are one factor among many. Found this breakdown of Bitcoin ETF flows helpful?

On December 1st, these funds experienced a shocking net outflow of $79.13 million, abruptly ending a promising five-day streak of positive inflows. This dramatic shift, reported by TraderT, signals a potential change in short-term investor sentiment toward Ethereum-based exchange-traded products. Let’s break down what happened and why it matters for your crypto portfolio. What Caused the US Spot ETH ETFs Outflow? The outflow wasn’t a uniform sell-off. Instead, it was driven by specific major funds. Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) led the retreat with a substantial $49.79 million exit. Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH) followed, seeing $31.62 million leave. Furthermore, the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust contributed an additional $20.28 million to the total outflow. This coordinated movement suggests a segment of institutional or large-scale investors decided to take profits or reallocate capital simultaneously. Was There Any Positive Movement in US Spot ETH ETFs? Yes, a significant counter-trend provided a silver lining. While other funds bled assets, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) stood out. It attracted $26.59 million in net inflows, partially offsetting the broader negative trend. This indicates that investor confidence is not universally shaken. Some capital is simply rotating between different fund providers, possibly based on fees, perceived security, or brand trust. This divergence highlights a key market dynamic: not all US spot ETH ETFs are created equal in the eyes of investors. The flow data reveals a competitive landscape where: Grayscale’s products faced significant redemption pressure. BlackRock’s fund demonstrated relative strength and appeal. The overall market for US spot ETH ETFs remains fluid and sensitive to daily sentiment. What Does This Mean for Ethereum Investors? A single day of outflows for US spot ETH ETFs does not necessarily forecast a long-term bear trend. However, it serves as a crucial reality check. The five-day inflow streak showed growing appetite, but this reversal proves that appetite can wane quickly. For Ethereum investors, this underscores the importance of monitoring fund flow data as a pulse check on institutional sentiment. These flows can indirectly influence Ethereum’s market price by affecting the underlying buying and selling pressure required by the ETF issuers. Therefore, tracking the weekly performance of US spot ETH ETFs becomes an essential tool for understanding broader market forces beyond retail trading on exchanges. Key Takeaways from the ETF Flow Data To summarize the event’s implications: Volatility is inherent: ETF flows, like crypto prices, can be highly volatile. Watch the leaders: Movements in giant funds like Grayscale’s ETHE often set the tone. Rotation is key: Money moving between funds (e.g., from Grayscale to BlackRock) is different from money leaving the asset class entirely. Context matters: One day’s data is a snapshot, not the full movie. The trend for US spot ETH ETFs over the coming weeks will be more telling. In conclusion, the $79 million outflow is a stark reminder that the path toward mainstream adoption for crypto investment vehicles like US spot ETH ETFs will be punctuated by periods of profit-taking and sentiment shifts. For the savvy investor, this data is not a signal to panic, but rather a valuable piece of the puzzle in assessing market health and making informed decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are US spot ETH ETFs? A1: US spot ETH ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold actual Ethereum (ETH). They trade on traditional stock exchanges, allowing investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price without directly buying or storing the cryptocurrency. Q2: Why do ETF flows matter for Ethereum’s price? A2: When an ETF sees large inflows, the issuer must buy more ETH to back the new shares, creating buying pressure. Large outflows force the issuer to sell ETH, creating selling pressure. This can influence the asset’s market price. Q3: Is a single day of outflow a major concern? A3: Not necessarily. It breaks a positive streak, which is noteworthy, but the long-term trend is more important. Market sentiment often shifts daily based on broader financial conditions. Q4: Which US spot ETH ETF performed best on Dec. 1? A4: BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) was the sole major fund with net inflows, attracting $26.59 million while others saw outflows. Q5: Where can I track this flow data? A5: Data is reported by firms like TraderT, Farside Investors, and various crypto analytics platforms. Financial news websites covering cryptocurrency often summarize these figures daily or weekly. Q6: Should I sell my Ethereum because of this ETF outflow? A6: Investment decisions should be based on your long-term strategy and risk tolerance, not a single day’s data. This outflow is one indicator among many to consider.

Over a brutal 24-hour period, a staggering wave of crypto futures liquidations wiped out more than $389 million from leveraged positions. This wasn’t a balanced purge; the data reveals a clear and punishing narrative: long traders, those betting on prices rising, were hit the hardest. Let’s break down what happened and, more importantly, what it means for you. What Are Crypto Futures Liquidations and Why Do They Matter? Before we dive into the numbers, let’s clarify the mechanism. Crypto futures liquidations occur when an exchange automatically closes a trader’s leveraged position because they can no longer meet the margin requirements. Think of it as a forced sale triggered by insufficient funds to cover potential losses. This process is a core feature of derivatives trading, but when it happens at scale, it can accelerate market moves, creating a cascade of selling pressure that impacts everyone. The $389M Bloodbath: A Breakdown by Asset The scale of this event was significant. The forced closures were overwhelmingly concentrated on bullish bets. Here is the stark breakdown: Bitcoin (BTC): $258 million liquidated, with a crushing 78.27% of that coming from long positions. Ethereum (ETH): $112 million liquidated, where 77.68% were longs caught in the downdraft. Solana (SOL): $19.45 million liquidated, and a whopping 83.61% were long positions. This pattern tells a clear story: a sudden price drop triggered margin calls on highly leveraged long contracts, and the ensuing crypto futures liquidations likely fueled further declines. Why Were Long Positions So Vulnerable? Several factors can converge to create this kind of long-squeeze environment. Often, it starts with a market that has seen extended bullish sentiment, encouraging traders to use high leverage to amplify gains. When a negative catalyst emerges—be it macroeconomic news, regulatory fears, or large sell orders—the rapid price drop quickly breaches the liquidation prices for these crowded long trades. The exchange’s automated systems then sell the assets to cover the debts, which pushes prices down even further, triggering more crypto futures liquidations in a vicious cycle. How Can Traders Navigate This Volatility? Witnessing such events is a powerful reminder of the risks in leveraged trading. However, you can take actionable steps to protect your capital: Manage Your Leverage: Using lower leverage reduces your liquidation risk significantly. It’s a buffer against volatility. Set Strategic Stop-Losses: Place stop-loss orders at logical technical levels, not just arbitrary percentages, to exit positions before a forced liquidation. Monitor Funding Rates: Extremely high positive funding rates can signal overcrowded long positions, which is a precursor to a potential squeeze. Diversify Strategies: Don’t rely solely on directional long bets. Consider a mix of spot holdings, staking, or other non-leveraged approaches. The Ripple Effect on the Broader Market These massive crypto futures liquidations don’t happen in a vacuum. The forced selling from derivatives markets adds significant sell-side pressure to the spot market, often leading to increased volatility and fear. This can shake out weak hands, reset leverage levels, and sometimes create potential buying opportunities once the liquidation cascade subsides and the market finds a new equilibrium. Conclusion: Respect the Power of Leverage The recent $389M liquidation event is a stark lesson in market mechanics. While crypto futures liquidations are a normal part of derivatives trading, their scale highlights the dangers of excessive leverage during uncertain times. For savvy participants, understanding these dynamics is crucial. It’s not about avoiding futures entirely, but about trading them with respect, robust risk management, and a clear-eyed view of the potential for sudden, automated sell-offs. The market always humbles the overconfident, but it rewards the prepared. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What triggers a crypto futures liquidation? A liquidation is triggered when the value of your position falls to the point where your remaining margin (collateral) is insufficient to cover potential losses. The exchange closes the position automatically to prevent a negative balance. Can I get my money back after a liquidation? No. Once a position is liquidated, the funds used as margin for that trade are lost to cover the loss. You only recover any remaining collateral that was not used. Are liquidations always bad for the market? Not always. While they cause short-term pain and volatility, large liquidation events can “reset” excessive leverage in the system. This can reduce speculative froth and sometimes create a healthier foundation for the next market move. How can I check current liquidation levels? Websites like Coinglass provide real-time data on liquidations across exchanges, showing heatmaps of price levels where large numbers of positions are set to be liquidated. What’s the difference between a long and short liquidation? A long liquidation happens when someone betting on a price increase gets stopped out. A short liquidation occurs when someone betting on a price decrease is forced to buy back the asset as the price rises, which can fuel a “short squeeze.” Is spot trading safer than futures regarding liquidations? Yes. In spot trading, you own the asset outright. Your holdings can decrease in value, but you cannot be forcibly liquidated unless you are using borrowed funds (margin) on a spot margin platform.

Related Reading: Ripple Scores Major Win As MAS Supercharges Its Singapore License The approval, granted to its local entity KuCoin EU Exchange GmbH, allows the platform to offer digital asset services in 29 European Economic Area (EEA) countries under the EU’s unified crypto regulatory framework. A Major Step Under the MiCA Regulatory Framework The MiCA framework, which took full effect in December 2024, establishes uniform requirements for crypto service providers across the European Union. With its Austrian authorization , KuCoin EU Exchange GmbH is now permitted to offer trading, custody, and other digital asset services across 29 EEA countries through MiCA’s passporting mechanism. To meet MiCA obligations, exchanges must comply with capital adequacy standards, segregate customer assets, adhere to transparency rules, and obtain approval from national regulators. KuCoin reports that it has implemented several security and compliance measures to meet these requirements, including SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001:2022, ISO 27701, and CCSS certifications, alongside third-party proof-of-reserves audits. CEO BC Wong said the authorization aligns with the company’s long-term compliance plans and reflects the regulatory expectations set under MiCA. KuCoin’s Expanded Access Under EU Passporting Rules Under MiCA’s passporting mechanism, KuCoin can now operate its digital asset services across 29 EEA countries, once it is licensed in Austria. This places the exchange among other major platforms, such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp, that secured authorization ahead of the regulation’s full rollout. The license is designed to expand KuCoin’s ability to serve users within a unified regulatory framework that applies consistent standards across member states. This development also aligns with the company’s broader “$2 Billion Trust Project,” which includes efforts to enhance compliance systems and follows its AUSTRAC registration in Australia in November. As part of the transition, EEA users except those in Malta will gain access to KuCoin EU’s upcoming MiCA-compliant platform, while new registrations on KuCoin Global will no longer be available within the region. Industry Implications and Outlook KuCoin’s MiCA approval reinforces a broader shift in the crypto sector as exchanges adapt to tighter regulatory expectations. For investors, MiCA brings more clarity around standards for disclosure, asset protection, and operational oversight. For exchanges, it creates a consistent framework that simplifies cross-border operations.

Ethereum Has Seen A Pullback Over The Past Day The cryptocurrency sector as a whole has witnessed a plunge to kick off the new month, with Bitcoin and Ethereum both being down by more than 5% over the last 24 hours. ETH is back in the low $2,800 levels, having essentially retraced the recovery that it had made during the last week of November. Related Reading: Newbie Bitcoin Whales Capitulating, But Old Hands Stay Silent The sudden price decline has unleashed a wave of liquidations on the derivatives exchanges, leading to $158 million in Ethereum-related contracts being flushed. Of these, $140 million of the liquidations involved long positions alone. Below is a heatmap from CoinGlass that breaks down the liquidation numbers related to the various digital asset symbols. Interestingly, while notable liquidations have occurred, derivatives investors still haven’t become discouraged. ETH Open Interest Has Gone Up Since The Dip As pointed out by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in an X post, the Ethereum Open Interest has witnessed a sharp jump following the price decline. The “Open Interest” here refers to an indicator that measures the total amount of positions related to ETH that are currently open on all centralized derivatives platforms. Here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in this metric over the past couple of days: As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum Open Interest initially collapsed alongside the price drop as long positions suffered forceful closures. As ETH’s bearish momentum tapered off and the price settled into a sideways rhythm, however, the metric saw a gradual reversal in direction, indicating that speculators have started opening up fresh positions. Since the dip, the ETH Open Interest has gone up by almost $654 million, equivalent to an increase of 4.3%. “Looks like the gamblers are back for another round,” noted the analyst. Historically, a high value on the metric has generally been something that has led to volatility for the cryptocurrency. This is because an extreme amount of positions implies the presence of a high amount of leverage in the sector. In these conditions, any sharp swing in the asset can induce a large number of liquidations in the market. These liquidations only feed back into the price move that caused them, making it more intense.

The team initiated Stage 4 of its token repurchase plan a full eight days ahead of schedule, directly responding to recent market turbulence. This proactive step aims to provide tangible support for ASTER holders, reinforcing confidence through action, not just words. Why Did Aster Move Its Buyback Schedule Forward? The official announcement came on December 2nd. Aster stated the primary reason for moving the Aster buyback from December 10th to 1:10 a.m. UTC on December 2nd was “to more effectively support ASTER holders amid increased market volatility.” This signals a team that is agile and responsive, prioritizing holder welfare over rigid timelines. In volatile markets, such timely interventions can be crucial for maintaining ecosystem stability. How Transparent Is This Aster Buyback Process? Transparency remains a cornerstone of this operation. The Aster team emphasizes that all buyback activities are fully verifiable. They encourage the community to track every transaction in real-time through on-chain data explorers. This commitment to an open ledger means anyone can audit the process, which builds immense trust. Key aspects of this transparency include: Real-Time Tracking: All buyback records are publicly accessible on the blockchain. Verifiable Operations: Every token purchase is permanently recorded and cannot be altered. Community Assurance: This approach allows holders to independently verify the team’s actions. What Does an Early Buyback Mean for ASTER Holders? An accelerated Aster buyback schedule is more than a calendar change; it’s a strategic economic decision. By purchasing tokens from the open market earlier than planned, the project effectively reduces the circulating supply of ASTER tokens. This action, especially during periods of high selling pressure, can help create a supportive price floor. It demonstrates the project’s willingness to use its treasury to back its token, aligning its financial resources with community interests. Can Other Projects Learn from Aster’s Strategy? Absolutely. Aster’s move provides a clear case study in proactive tokenomics and community management. While buybacks are common in traditional finance and crypto, the combination of an accelerated timeline, a volatility-driven trigger, and unwavering on-chain transparency sets a high standard. It shows that decentralized projects can and should adapt quickly to protect their stakeholders. The key takeaway is that pre-committed capital mechanisms are most powerful when deployed with timely discretion. Conclusion: A Confident Step in Volatile Times Aster’s decision to launch its Stage 4 Aster buyback eight days early is a bold statement of confidence and responsibility. It transforms a routine treasury operation into a dynamic tool for market support. By tying its actions directly to holder welfare and ensuring complete transparency, Aster strengthens its credibility. This move not only supports the token in the short term but also solidifies the long-term trust essential for any decentralized protocol’s success. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly is a token buyback? A: A token buyback is when a project uses its treasury funds to repurchase its own tokens from the open market. This reduces the circulating supply and can signal confidence in the token’s value. Q: Why is starting the Aster buyback early significant? A> Starting early allows the project to intervene during a period of market volatility, potentially providing more immediate support and price stability for holders than if they had waited for the original date. Q: How can I verify the Aster buyback is happening? A> You can verify it by checking the blockchain explorer for Aster’s treasury or buyback contract wallet. The team states all transactions are on-chain and publicly visible for real-time tracking. Q: Does a buyback guarantee the token price will increase? A> No, it does not guarantee a price increase. While it can reduce selling pressure and signal strength, token prices are influenced by many broader market factors. It is a supportive mechanism, not a price manipulation tool. Q: What is Stage 4 in the Aster buyback program? A> Stage 4 refers to a specific, pre-planned phase of Aster’s multi-stage token repurchase plan. Each stage typically involves allocating a set amount of capital to buy back tokens over a defined period. Q: Will there be more Aster buyback stages after this? A> The announcement specifically covers Stage 4. Future stages would depend on the project’s overall tokenomics roadmap and treasury management strategy, which are usually communicated in advance by the team.

55231410,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=224877,1764648910,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revealed: Cantor Fitzgerald’s Strategic $1.28M Bet on the SOLZ ETF,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/cantor-fitzgerald-solz-etf-investment/,"BitcoinWorld Revealed: Cantor Fitzgerald’s Strategic $1.28M Bet on the SOLZ ETF In a move signaling growing institutional confidence, investment giant Cantor Fitzgerald has publicly disclosed a significant stake in a Solana-linked financial product. Their recent filing reveals a holding of 58,000 shares in the SOLZ ETF , valued at approximately $1.28 million. This action by a major Wall Street player provides a compelling glimpse into how traditional finance is engaging with the crypto ecosystem through regulated vehicles. What Exactly is the SOLZ ETF That Cantor Fitzgerald Bought? Before diving into the implications, it’s crucial to understand what this investment represents. The SOLZ ETF is a futures-based exchange-traded fund. Therefore, it does not hold Solana (SOL) tokens directly. Instead, it invests in futures contracts tied to Solana’s price performance. This structure is a common pathway for institutions to gain exposure to crypto assets within existing regulatory frameworks, avoiding the complexities of direct custody. Why Does Cantor Fitzgerald’s SOLZ ETF Investment Matter? This disclosure is more than just a line item in a quarterly report. It acts as a barometer for institutional sentiment. Led by CEO Howard Lutnick, Cantor Fitzgerald is a respected name in finance. Their investment, while not enormous in the context of their total assets, sends a powerful signal of legitimacy and interest in Solana’s market. Key takeaways include: Validation: A major bank’s involvement adds a layer of credibility to the crypto asset class. Regulatory Pathway: It highlights the futures-based ETF model as a preferred entry point for cautious institutions. Market Trend: This follows a pattern of growing institutional exploration of crypto beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. What Are the Broader Implications for Crypto Investors? For individual investors and market watchers, Cantor’s move offers actionable insights. Firstly, it underscores the importance of understanding the instruments behind headlines—knowing the SOLZ ETF is futures-based clarifies its risk and reward profile compared to direct token ownership. Moreover, it suggests that institutional adoption is progressing through structured products, which could lead to increased market stability and liquidity over time. However, it also means price action in the ETF is one step removed from the underlying spot market. Could This Pave the Way for a Spot Solana ETF? This is the pivotal question many are asking. The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs was a landmark event. Cantor Fitzgerald’s involvement with a Solana futures ETF could be seen as a testing of the waters. While regulatory hurdles for a spot Solana ETF remain significantly higher, growing institutional comfort and product familiarity are essential first steps. The performance and demand for products like the SOLZ ETF will be closely watched by regulators and issuers alike. Conclusion: A Measured Step in a Long Journey Cantor Fitzgerald’s $1.28 million disclosure is a strategic, measured bet. It demonstrates that sophisticated financial institutions are methodically building exposure to alternative crypto assets like Solana through available, regulated channels. While not a wholesale embrace, it represents a meaningful evolution in the dialogue between traditional finance and digital assets. For the market, it’s a sign of maturation; for investors, it’s a case study in how institutional capital flows into the space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does Cantor Fitzgerald now own Solana tokens? A: No. The SOLZ ETF is a futures-based product. Cantor Fitzgerald owns shares in the ETF, which holds derivatives contracts linked to Solana’s price, not the actual SOL tokens. Q: Is the SOLZ ETF the same as a spot Solana ETF? A: No, they are fundamentally different. A spot ETF would hold the actual cryptocurrency. The SOLZ ETF holds futures contracts, which can introduce different risks like contango or backwardation. Q: Why would an institution choose a futures ETF over buying tokens directly? A> Institutions often prefer the regulatory clarity, custodial solutions, and familiar operational framework of ETFs traded on traditional exchanges, avoiding the direct handling of crypto keys. Q: How significant is a $1.28 million investment for a firm like Cantor Fitzgerald? A> In absolute terms, it is a relatively small position. Its significance is symbolic, showing research, due diligence, and a willingness to allocate capital to this emerging asset class. Q: What does this mean for the price of Solana (SOL)? A> It can be viewed as a positive sentiment indicator, suggesting institutional interest. However, the ETF’s influence on SOL’s spot price is indirect, as it trades futures contracts. Q: Can retail investors buy the SOLZ ETF? A> Yes, if the ETF is listed on a public exchange, retail investors can typically purchase shares through their brokerage accounts, just like any other ETF.

CEO Provides Concerning Clues,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/will-strategy-liquidate-bitcoin-holdings-ceo-provides-concerning-clues/,"In a turbulent market marked by falling prices, Bitcoin (BTC) has once again dipped below the $85,000 threshold, driven by growing speculation that Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, may be on the verge of selling some of its Bitcoin holdings. This intensified after a recent interview on the What Bitcoin Did podcast, during which Strategy CEO Phong Le was directly asked whether the company would consider parting with any of its BTC holdings. While the firm’s former CEO, Michael Saylor, has consistently maintained a resolute stance against selling, Le’s comments have raised concerns about potential sales in the future. Is A Bitcoin Sell-Off Imminent? Le indicated that if Strategy’s stock trades below the actual value of its Bitcoin holdings and the company is unable to raise additional capital for preferred dividends, selling some Bitcoin could become a necessity. “If the stock trades below the value of our Bitcoin… then mathematically we would have to sell some Bitcoin. It would be the last resort,” he explained. While this does not confirm an imminent sale, it visibly places the option on the table, leading to increased speculation about a forced sale as preferred dividend payments approach due on December 31. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin Price Is Crashing Today Adding to the unease, Strategy disclosed in a recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it has established a USD Reserve of $1.44 billion to cover these upcoming preferred dividends and mitigate the interest on its substantial debt. This reserve was funded through the proceeds from sales of its class A common stock under the company’s at-the-market offering program. Such moves have diluted current shareholders and contributed to a nearly 11% drop in Strategy’s stock price. Strategy Downgrades BTC Price Forecast This shift contrasts sharply with the company’s previous forecasts, which predicted that Bitcoin would soar to $150,000 by the end of the year. Strategy has now revised its expectations, projecting prices to range between $85,000 and $110,000. The forecast for BTC yields has also been revised down to 24% from a previous estimate of 30%, along with projected Bitcoin gains decreasing significantly from $20 billion to $10.6 billion at the midpoint. Related Reading: $300 Million Crypto Bet: Kazakhstan’s Central Bank Gears Up As Bitcoin’s value continues to plummet, it further unravels Strategy’s financial outlook. Nevertheless, social media experts have pointed to a paradox within the company’s messaging. AlejandroXBT noted that while Saylor has consistently stated he will never sell Bitcoin, he has been conducting private presentations to clients outlining various strategic approaches, suggesting a potential disconnect between public declarations and private planning. When writing, the market’s leading cryptocurrency trades at $84,880, recording major losses of over 7% in the 24-hour time frame.

It last changed hands near $86,400 in Asia, leaving it roughly 30% below its October peak. Bitcoin saw the biggest wipeout over the past 24 hours, with about $251.69M getting liquidated. Ethereum followed with roughly $111.31M in liquidations, while other majors like SOL and ZEC saw smaller amounts at $19.22M and $14.99M, according to CoinGlass . Market snapshot Bitcoin : $86,991, up 1.4% Ether : $2,805, down 0.5% XRP : $2.02, down 0.8% Total crypto market cap: $3.03 trillion, up 0.8% Bond Market Stress Builds As BOJ Signals End To Ultra Loose Policy Equity markets in the region tried to stabilize, although investors stayed cautious. MSCI’s broad index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan rose about 0.6%, while Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 edged 0.5% higher after a sharp drop in the previous session. Behind the nerves sits a week-long selloff in Japanese government bonds, which gathered pace after Bank of Japan governor Kazuo Ueda laid the groundwork for an interest rate increase later this month. Traders increasingly expect the BOJ to move away from its ultra-loose stance, a shift that could ripple through global funding markets. 10-year Japanese government bond yields ticked up another 1.5 basis points in morning trade to around 1.88%, the highest level in 17 years, ahead of a key 10-year auction. On Monday, they had already jumped 6 basis points, while the move spilled into overseas markets and pushed 10 year US-Treasury yields up to about 4.08%. In credit markets, investors kept a close eye on Chinese developer China Vanke, which recently surprised markets by seeking a delay on a local bond repayment. The company has now asked holders to wait a year to be made whole, a move that underscores ongoing liquidity strains in the country’s property sector. Markets Price In December Fed Cut As Economic Data Softens In the US, futures on the S&P 500 were little changed after the index fell 0.5% on Monday and the Nasdaq 100 slipped 0.4%. Data from the Institute for Supply Management showed US manufacturing contracted for a ninth straight month in November, with the headline index easing to 48.2 from 48.7, and components such as new orders, employment and backlogs all weakening. BREAKING: *U.S. NOVEMBER ISM MANUFACTURING PMI SURVEY FALLS TO 48.2; EST. 49.0; PREV. 48.7 pic.twitter.com/ex7Uo9SoLq — Investing.com (@Investingcom) December 1, 2025 The softer tone in the data has reinforced bets that the Federal Reserve is nearing a turn in policy. Interest rate futures now imply about an 86% chance of a 25 basis point cut at the Fed’s Dec. 9 to 10 meeting, helped by signs of cooling activity and a gradual easing in inflation pressures. Fed officials will receive one more reading on their preferred inflation gauge before that decision, with Friday’s report expected to show that price pressures remain present but contained. Even so, many analysts see the labour market as the key factor that will shape the pace of cuts next year. Risk Aversion Rises As Bitcoin Drop Spills Into Crypto-Exposed Equities Crypto-exposed stocks felt the impact of Bitcoin’s slide as risk aversion picked up. Shares of MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, fell sharply, while Coinbase and Robinhood dropped by around mid-single digits. Bitcoin miners such as Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms slid between about 7% and 9% as lower prices squeezed margins. On-chain data added another layer of concern for crypto traders. Analysts at Bitfinex said recent losses in Bitcoin have triggered a wave of realised losses bigger than those seen at the two major lows earlier in the current cycle, in Aug. 2024 and April 2025, describing a market under stress and searching for liquidity as weaker holders capitulate. They noted that such heavy loss realization has often occurred near the later stages of corrective phases, when selling pressure exhausts itself and conditions stabilize.

Sony Bank To Issue Stablecoin As New Payment Method For Games & Anime As reported by Nikkei Asia, Sony Bank could issue a stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar as early as fiscal year 2026. Sony Bank, a subsidiary of Sony Financial Holdings, is one of the largest online banks in Japan. It applied for a banking license in the US back in October. The bank’s parent company went public in September and spun off into its own entity separate from Sony Group. The firm, however, is continuing to support the group’s business developments. The stablecoin project is one such avenue, as Sony Group envisions that the USD-pegged token will be used by customers to pay for content like games and anime in its ecosystem. Sony Group is a well-known name around the world, controlling multiple large media-related businesses like Sony Interactive Entertainment, the company behind the PlayStation, and Sony Pictures Entertainment, a filmmaker. In the fiscal year that ended in March 2025, US customers made up 30% of the group’s overall sales to external customers. With Sony Bank’s stablecoin, the multinational conglomerate is now hoping these users can start paying in the ecosystem with digital assets, cutting back on the transaction fees paid to credit card companies. The bank has formed a partnership with Bastion, an American stablecoin infrastructure solutions provider, to help with the project. “The bank plans to establish a subsidiary to handle its stablecoin business,” noted Nikkei. The move from Sony comes a few months after President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act , establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins in the US. These cryptocurrencies have also been gaining momentum in other parts of the world recently. Hong Kong launched its stablecoin legislation in August and plans on handing out issuer licenses next year. Japan saw the launch of its first yen-backed coin in October. Major European banks have come together to form a consortium to launch a euro-pegged stablecoin, aiming a rollout in the second half of 2026 in a bid to challenge the currently USD-dominated market. Over the past year, the fiat-tied cryptocurrencies have enjoyed some sharp growth, but in the last month, they have suffered a slowdown as part of the downturn in the digital assets sector as a whole. Below is a chart from DeFiLlama that shows how the market cap of the stablecoins has changed over the last several years. The stablecoin market cap set a new record of $309 billion in late-October. Since then, the metric has seen a small decline to $306 billion. USDT and USDC, the two largest tokens in the space, alone account for about $261 billion of this figure. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $86,700, down nearly 6% over the last 24 hours.",Stablecoin|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Sony|Sony Bank|Sony Bank Stablecoin|stablecoin,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-02 05:00:55

According to Hill’s statement, his prepared testimony describes future application and prudential frameworks as federal regulators attempt to regulate the stablecoin industry. U.S. President Trump signed into law the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) in July, which created a federal regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers. Under the GENIUS Act, only licensed issuers are supposed to issue a payment stablecoin for use by U.S. individuals, subject to specific expectations and safe harbors. According to the Congress report, permitted issuers must be either a state-qualified payment stablecoin issuer, a federal-qualified nonbank payment stablecoin issuer, or a subsidiary of an insured depository institution. Travis Hill details regulatory plans for stablecoins According to Hill, throughout 2025, the FDIC has taken a constructive approach with respect to banks that offer goods and services related to digital assets. At the same time, the agency has maintained its expectations that such activities are conducted securely and soundly. Hill stated that the FDIC will be liable for Licensing and overseeing subsidiaries of FDIC-supervised IDIs authorized to produce payment stablecoins. He mentioned that the GENIUS Act will require several rulemakings, including the establishment of capital requirements, liquidity standards, and reserve asset diversification standards. “The FDIC has begun work to promulgate rules to implement the GENIUS Act; we expect to issue a proposed rule to establish our application framework later this month and a proposed rule to implement the GENIUS Act’s prudential requirements for FDIC-supervised payment stablecoin issuers early next year.” Travis Hill , Acting Chairman of the FDIC Board of Directors. Hill further stated that the FDIC is taking into account the suggestions of the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, which released its report in July, as well as its work under the GENIUS Act. The President’s Working Group report recommends clarifying or increasing authorized activities, in which Tokenization of assets and liabilities is one activity that banks may participate in. He stated that the FDIC is currently developing regulations to provide more clarity regarding the regulatory status of tokenized deposits. Notably, the House hearing on Tuesday will also receive testimony from other bank and credit union authorities, including the Federal Reserve. Over the last few years, whenever congressional panels have financial regulators in front of them, cryptocurrency has been a frequent topic of conversation. Michelle, the Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision, stated in her prepared testimony that the central bank was attempting “to develop capital, liquidity, and diversification regulations for stablecoin issuers as required by the GENIUS Act.” Treasury seeks public input on GENIUS Act Other agencies, such as the Department of the Treasury, have also been working on their portions under the GENIUS Act . On September 18, the U.S. Department of the Treasury released an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM). The Department of the Treasury sought public feedback regarding the Treasury’s implementation of the GENIUS Act. According to the Treasury report, the GENIUS Act mandates the Treasury to adopt laws that stimulate innovation in payment stablecoins while providing an appropriately tailored regime to address financial stability problems. Cryptopolitan reported that the Treasury requested that the public submit comments, including data and other information that the Treasury could find helpful. Factually, the ANPRM provides the public with an opportunity to contribute to the implementation of the GENIUS Act, even if it does not impose any new requirements. According to the Treasury, the ANPRM accepts comments and views from a wide variety of stakeholders. The Treasury revealed that the ANPRM was based on the Request for Comment on Innovative methods to detect illicit activity involving digital assets, released by the Treasury on August 18, 2025. According to the Treasury, the ANPRM remained open for Comments through November 4, 2025. Get seen where it counts.

SOL price is now consolidating losses below $130 and might decline further below $125. SOL price started a fresh decline below $135 and $130 against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $130 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $136 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start a recovery wave if the bulls defend $125 or $120. Solana Price Dips Further Solana price failed to remain stable above $140 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL declined below the $135 and $132 support levels. The price gained bearish momentum below $130. A low was formed at $123, and the price is now consolidating losses.

There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $136 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. A successful close above the $136 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $140. Any more gains might send the price toward the $145 level. Another Decline In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $130 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $125 zone.

This significant bet, placed on December 1st, signals strong conviction from a key industry figure at a pivotal time. Let’s break down what this means and why it matters for your own investment strategy. What Does This Massive Long Position Reveal? On December 1st, around 4:00 p.m. UTC, Inbum executed his trade. His entry points were $84,225 for Bitcoin (BTC) and $2,730 for Ethereum (ETH). A long position is essentially a bet that the price of an asset will rise over time. Therefore, by opening this position, Inbum is expressing a firm belief that both leading cryptocurrencies are poised for upward movement. This isn’t a casual trade; it’s a multi-million dollar statement of confidence from someone deeply embedded in the Web3 ecosystem. Why Are Industry Founders Making Big Bets Now? This move goes beyond a simple purchase. It provides valuable insight into market sentiment among crypto builders. Founders like Inbum often have a nuanced understanding of market cycles and underlying technology trends. His decision to allocate such a substantial sum suggests he sees fundamental strength or a favorable risk-reward scenario that others might miss. Key factors he might be considering include: Institutional Adoption: Growing acceptance from traditional finance. Regulatory Clarity: Potential for more defined rules, reducing uncertainty. Upcoming Catalysts: Events like the Bitcoin halving or Ethereum network upgrades. Macroeconomic Shifts: Changing conditions that could favor hard assets like crypto. Should You Follow This Long Position Strategy? While a high-profile long position is noteworthy, it’s crucial to conduct your own research. Never invest based solely on someone else’s actions, no matter how influential they are. However, you can use this information as a starting point for your analysis. Ask yourself: What market data supports this bullish outlook? What are the potential risks? Always remember that cryptocurrency markets are volatile, and even well-informed bets can go against you. Diversification and risk management are non-negotiable. What Are the Risks of a Major Long Position? Opening a large long position carries significant risk, especially in crypto’s volatile environment. A sudden market downturn could lead to substantial losses, particularly if leverage is involved. Furthermore, public announcements can influence market sentiment, potentially creating a short-term price impact that doesn’t reflect long-term value. Therefore, while Inbum’s move is optimistic, it also highlights the high-stakes nature of major crypto investments. Conclusion: A Vote of Confidence in Crypto’s Future Inbum’s $32 million long position in Bitcoin and Ethereum is more than just a trade; it’s a powerful vote of confidence from within the industry. It underscores a strategic belief in the long-term appreciation of these core digital assets. For observers and investors, it serves as a compelling data point, emphasizing the importance of conviction and timing in the cryptocurrency market. Ultimately, it reinforces the narrative that seasoned players are strategically positioning themselves for what they believe is the next phase of growth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a long position in cryptocurrency? A long position means buying an asset with the expectation that its price will increase in the future, allowing you to sell it later for a profit. Why did Inbum choose BTC and ETH for his long position? Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two largest and most established cryptocurrencies, often seen as bellwethers for the entire market. A bet on them is typically a bet on the broader ecosystem’s health. Should I invest in BTC and ETH because a founder did? No. You should never make investment decisions based solely on someone else’s actions. Use this news as a prompt to do your own thorough research and assess your personal financial goals and risk tolerance. What are the risks of copying a large trade like this? The primary risks are market volatility and timing. You may enter at a different price, and the market may move against the position. Large investors also often have different risk profiles and capital than individual traders. How can I track major market moves like this? Follow reputable crypto news sources, on-chain analytics platforms, and the official social channels of major projects and founders for real-time announcements and data. Does this guarantee BTC and ETH prices will go up? Absolutely not. No single trade, no matter how large, can guarantee future price movement. The market is influenced by countless factors.

Other crypto treasury firms are also undergoing leadership shake-ups, including Yorkville Acquisition Corp.’s move to merge with Trump Media and Crypto.com to build a new CRO-focused treasury. Despite the sector’s early momentum, crypto treasury companies across the board are struggling. CEA Implodes After BNB Bet Binance founder Changpeng Zhao’s YZi Labs moved to seize control of CEA Industries, the publicly traded firm that made headlines earlier this year for its bold plan to become the world’s largest BNB treasury company. In a regulatory filing on Monday, YZi said it is seeking to overturn all bylaw amendments made since July, expand the company’s board, and install its own slate of director nominees. The firm argued that the shake-up is necessary to stop what it calls the “continued destruction of stockholder value” and to ensure the business is aligned with shareholders’ interests. SEC filing The investor rebellion happened after a dramatic collapse in CEA’s share price , which sunk roughly 89% from its July 28 peak of $57.59. That surge followed the company’s announcement—on the same day—that it would pivot from a Canadian vape manufacturer to a BNB-focused digital asset treasury firm. YZi helped bankroll CEA’s ambitions through a $500 million PIPE deal that closed in August, and was billed as an effort to build the largest publicly listed BNB Chain treasury strategy. But instead of benefiting from the crypto-centric pivot, shareholders watched the stock plunge to $6.47 on Monday, now trading below its pre-pivot valuation. CEA Industries share price (Source: Google Finance ) YZi’s filing accuses CEA management of failing to provide timely investor updates and making “little to no” marketing effort to promote the company’s new identity. It also takes aim at CEO David Namdar, who was brought in through the firm’s association with investment firm 10X Capital. YZi claims he has shown a “lack of devotion and loyalty” by promoting rival crypto treasury companies, and suggested that the reconstituted board should consider appointing a new chief executive. If YZi succeeds in winning support from the majority of outstanding shareholders, it will effectively gain control of the world’s largest public BNB treasury company. This will be a huge development given BNB’s strong ties to Zhao and Binance, which reportedly controls most of the token’s supply. CEA currently holds 515,054 BNB at an average cost of $851.29, putting its mNAV at 0.79x. While BNB itself fell almost 40% from its record high, the token is still up 24+% on the year. This also means that CEA’s performance lagged quite a bit behind the asset it is built around. BNB’s price action over the past year (Source: CoinMarketCap ) New CRO Treasury Takes Shape Other crypto treasuries are also experiencing shake-ups. Yorkville Acquisition Corp. is bringing in two former Gryphon Digital Mining executives to lead its upcoming merger that will create a publicly traded digital asset treasury centered on accumulating Cronos’ native token, CRO. The company announced that Steve Gutterman will take over as CEO and Sim Salzman will serve as chief financial officer once the merger closes, which is expected in the first quarter of 2026. Both executives bring restructuring, regulatory, and capital-markets experience, having previously helped steer Gryphon Digital Mining through turbulent times and holding senior posts at firms including E*TRADE, American Bitcoin, and Marathon Digital. Announcement from Trump Media Group The appointments came as Yorkville gets ready to merge with Trump Media & Technology Group and Crypto.com to form a new entity dedicated to accumulating and managing CRO as its primary reserve asset. The companies revealed the initiative in September, as well as an initial purchase of 684.4 million CRO at around $0.153 per token. After the merger, the new firm plans to operate a validator node on the Cronos blockchain, giving it the ability to stake CRO, participate in network governance, and earn rewards that could expand its long-term token holdings. Crypto.com became a key crypto partner for the Trump administration over the past few months. It was one of a select few firms invited to the White House Crypto Summit in March, and soon after, Trump Media signed a non-binding agreement with the exchange to explore launching US-based digital asset ETFs. CRO price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The industry, however, is facing more challenges. After a strong start to the year, digital asset treasuries have come under pressure after Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the broader crypto market slumped. Strategy Inc., the flagship corporate Bitcoin holder, fell about 36% over the past month. Mara Holdings, a major miner and the second-largest BTC corporate holder, is down more than 35%.

The asset management giant announced it’s extending the fee waiver for its popular HODL spot Bitcoin ETF until July 2026. This decision represents more than just a temporary discount—it’s a strategic commitment to making cryptocurrency investing accessible to everyone. But what does this mean for your portfolio, and why should you care about this particular HODL ETF fee waiver extension? What exactly is VanEck’s HODL ETF fee waiver extension? VanEck, a respected U.S. asset manager with decades of experience, made a straightforward but powerful announcement on its official website. The company is extending the period during which investors pay zero management fees for its HODL spot Bitcoin ETF. Originally scheduled to expire much sooner, this HODL ETF fee waiver now continues for nearly two more years, providing substantial cost savings for both new and existing investors. This extension means investors can continue to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s potential without the drag of management fees eating into their returns until mid-2026. The timing of this announcement is particularly significant. As Bitcoin ETFs compete fiercely for market share, fee structures have become a major battleground. VanEck’s decision to extend its HODL ETF fee waiver demonstrates confidence in their product and commitment to investor value. This move isn’t just about attracting new money—it’s about rewarding loyalty and building long-term trust in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency investment landscape. Why does this HODL ETF fee waiver matter to investors? You might wonder why a fee waiver deserves this much attention. The answer lies in the power of compounding costs in investment returns. Even seemingly small fees can significantly impact long-term growth, especially in volatile assets like cryptocurrency. This extended HODL ETF fee waiver provides tangible benefits that every investor should understand: Immediate cost savings : Investors keep 100% of their investment working for them without management fee deductions Enhanced compounding : Every dollar saved on fees remains invested and can generate additional returns Competitive advantage : The HODL ETF becomes more attractive compared to competing Bitcoin investment products Reduced barrier to entry : New investors can start with smaller amounts without worrying about fees eroding their position Moreover, this HODL ETF fee waiver extension signals VanEck’s confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. The company wouldn’t commit to nearly two more years of waived fees if they didn’t believe in the asset’s staying power and growth potential. This institutional vote of confidence should reassure individual investors who may still be cautious about cryptocurrency exposure. How does this affect the broader Bitcoin ETF landscape? VanEck’s decision to extend its HODL ETF fee waiver creates important ripple effects across the entire cryptocurrency investment ecosystem. Other ETF issuers now face increased pressure to justify their fee structures or offer competitive waivers. This competitive dynamic ultimately benefits all investors by driving down costs industry-wide. The extended HODL ETF fee waiver also demonstrates how traditional financial institutions are adapting to cryptocurrency market dynamics, where transparency and low costs are highly valued by investors. This development comes at a crucial moment for Bitcoin adoption. As regulatory clarity improves and institutional interest grows, accessible investment vehicles become increasingly important. The extended HODL ETF fee waiver makes Bitcoin exposure more practical for retirement accounts, educational savings plans, and other long-term investment strategies where cost efficiency matters significantly. What should investors do with this information? Now that you understand the significance of VanEck’s extended HODL ETF fee waiver, you might wonder about practical next steps. First, evaluate your current cryptocurrency exposure and consider whether a cost-efficient Bitcoin ETF fits your investment strategy. The extended fee waiver provides a compelling reason to either initiate a position or add to an existing one without the immediate concern of management fees. However, remember that fees are just one factor—also consider the fund’s structure, liquidity, and how it fits your overall portfolio. Second, use this extended HODL ETF fee waiver period to dollar-cost average into Bitcoin exposure. The fee savings become particularly valuable when making regular investments over time. Finally, stay informed about potential changes as the July 2026 deadline approaches. While nearly two years provides substantial runway, understanding when and how fees might be reintroduced helps with long-term planning. The bottom line on VanEck’s strategic move VanEck’s decision to extend its HODL ETF fee waiver until July 2026 represents more than just a temporary promotion—it’s a strategic commitment to cryptocurrency investors. This move lowers barriers to entry, enhances potential returns through cost savings, and signals institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s future. As the cryptocurrency investment landscape continues to mature, such investor-friendly developments mark important progress toward mainstream adoption. The extended HODL ETF fee waiver provides a valuable opportunity for both new and experienced investors to gain Bitcoin exposure through a regulated, transparent vehicle without immediate cost concerns. While investment decisions should always consider multiple factors beyond fees, this development certainly makes VanEck’s HODL ETF more attractive in the competitive Bitcoin investment space. Frequently Asked Questions What is the HODL ETF fee waiver? The HODL ETF fee waiver is VanEck’s policy of charging zero management fees for its spot Bitcoin ETF. The company has extended this waiver period until July 2026, allowing investors to avoid these costs for nearly two more years. How much can I save with this fee waiver? Savings depend on your investment amount and how long you hold the ETF. Since management fees typically range from 0.20% to 0.25% annually for similar products, avoiding these fees on a $10,000 investment could save you $20-$25 per year, with those savings compounding over time. Will the fees return after July 2026? VanEck has not announced specific plans for after July 2026. The company may introduce fees at that time, extend the waiver further, or modify the fee structure based on market conditions and competitive factors. Is the HODL ETF different from other Bitcoin ETFs? While all spot Bitcoin ETFs provide similar Bitcoin exposure, they differ in fee structures, liquidity, and issuer reputation. VanEck’s extended fee waiver currently gives the HODL ETF a cost advantage over many competitors. Can I buy the HODL ETF in my retirement account? Yes, like other ETFs, the HODL ETF can typically be held in various retirement accounts, including IRAs and 401(k) plans, depending on your specific plan’s investment options. What happens if I sell before the fee waiver ends? The fee waiver applies regardless of how long you hold the ETF. You pay no management fees whether you hold for one day or until July 2026, making the product cost-efficient for both short-term and long-term strategies.

However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the volatile crypto market. Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level. In August, on the other hand, SOL made strides and managed to close the month above the $205 mark. In September, the volatility rose sharply as the price rose to the $250 price level but failed to maintain the level and ended the month at $230. In October, the decline increased sharply as SOL ended the month below $170. In November, the decline continued with SOL ending the month below the $130 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-02 05:37:00

According to blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain, the protocol pulled an additional 25 million ENA, worth approximately $6 million, from the Bybit exchange. This latest transaction raises a critical question: is this a routine treasury management move or a calculated play with significant implications for the ENA token’s future? What Does the ENA Withdrawal Mean for Token Supply? When a project like Ethena Labs withdraws ENA from a major exchange, it directly impacts the circulating supply available for trading. The wallet involved in this transaction now holds a staggering 405.15 million ENA, valued at nearly $96.8 million. This action effectively reduces the liquid supply on Bybit, which can influence market dynamics. Therefore, large-scale withdrawals are often watched closely as potential precursors to price volatility or strategic shifts. Why Would Ethena Labs Make This Move? Understanding the ‘why’ behind this transaction is key. Projects typically execute large withdrawals for several strategic reasons: Token Vesting or Staking: The withdrawn ENA could be allocated for team vesting schedules, community rewards, or staking within Ethena’s own DeFi ecosystem. Supply Management: Reducing readily available sell-pressure on exchanges can be a method to support token price stability. Treasury Rebalancing: Moving assets between cold storage, treasury wallets, and exchange accounts is a standard part of operational security and financial planning. The fact that Ethena Labs withdraws ENA consistently suggests a proactive, long-term approach to managing their native asset. How Does This Impact ENA Investors and the DeFi Market? For current and prospective ENA holders, this news is more than just a headline. A reduced exchange supply often leads to increased scarcity, which, if coupled with sustained demand, can create upward price pressure. However, it’s crucial to monitor where the tokens go next. If they are moved to a staking contract, it signals a commitment to long-term protocol health. Conversely, if they are simply shifted to another wallet, it may just be custodial. This move by Ethena Labs also reinforces a growing trend in DeFi where protocols actively manage their token economics to align incentives and build sustainable ecosystems. What Are the Potential Challenges and Risks? While strategic, such large movements are not without scrutiny. The centralization of a vast amount of tokens in a single project wallet can raise concerns about governance control and the potential for sudden, market-moving decisions. Furthermore, the success of this Ethena Labs withdraws ENA strategy hinges on continued project development and user adoption. If demand for the ENA token does not materialize, supply reduction alone may not yield the desired stability or growth. Conclusion: A Calculated Step in a Broader Strategy The decision by Ethena Labs to withdraw $6 million in ENA from Bybit is a significant data point in the evolving story of the protocol. It demonstrates a hands-on approach to treasury management and a clear intent to influence the token’s market mechanics. For savvy observers, it underscores the importance of monitoring on-chain activity to gauge a project’s next moves. As Ethena Labs continues to shape its synthetic dollar ecosystem, how it manages its core asset will remain a critical factor for its overall success. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Ethena Labs? Ethena Labs is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol building a synthetic dollar, called USDe, and offers the ENA token for governance and ecosystem incentives. Why did Ethena Labs withdraw ENA from Bybit? While the exact reason isn’t publicly stated, common motivations include preparing tokens for staking rewards, managing treasury assets, or reducing immediate sell-pressure on the exchange. Does withdrawing tokens from an exchange increase the price? Not directly, but it reduces the readily available supply for trading. If demand remains constant or increases, this scarcity can contribute to upward price pressure. Where can I track these kinds of transactions? You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan or analytics platforms such as Lookonchain, Arkham, and Nansen to monitor wallet activity of major projects. Is it safe to invest in ENA after this news? This action is a strategic operational move, not a direct indicator of future price. Always conduct your own research (DYOR), considering project fundamentals, market conditions, and risk tolerance before any investment. What is the total supply of ENA tokens? The total supply of ENA is 15 billion tokens, with a significant portion allocated to the community, investors, and the project’s ecosystem fund.

The analyst reported that the largest single movement occurred on November 15, when approximately 72 million XRP was transferred off the exchange. Additional notable outflows were reported on November 25 (approximately 22 million XRP), November 7 (approximately 12 million XRP), and November 3 (approximately 10 million XRP). The chart, shared with the commentary and sourced from on-chain exchange ledger data, depicts these outflows alongside the USD price of XRP during the same period. XRP WHALE ACTIVITY EXPLODES 72M XRP (Nov 15) 22M XRP (Nov 25) 12M XRP (Nov 7) 10M XRP (Nov 3) Every major dip was followed by a massive outflow whales are pulling XRP OFF exchanges December might be the month XRP shocks everyone. https://t.co/P3Mx6gqaIS pic.twitter.com/iFcjxVHLGy — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) November 29, 2025 Interpretation from the analyst and community responses The analyst framed these transfers as whale-driven accumulation, emphasizing that repeated, large withdrawals reduce circulating supply available on exchanges. Community responses included one market commentator who described the pattern as consistent with accumulation behavior, asserting that when large holders remove supply from exchange order books, price tends to move accordingly over time. Another market participant expressed frustration that despite sustained retail accumulation and institutional inflows into related products, the XRP price has not broken decisively above the $2.26 level or produced a strong breakout. Insights from the Attached Chart The chart attached to the tweet pairs daily exchange outflow bars with a price line, allowing readers to observe timing relationships between supply movements and market levels. According to the data presented, the largest outflow on November 15 coincided with an inflection in price behavior. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Subsequent smaller but still material outflows occurred at moments of market weakness, which the analyst highlighted as evidence of accumulation activity timed around dips. The commentary did not attribute the withdrawals to specific entities but treated the magnitude and timing as significant for supply-side dynamics. Outlook for December The analyst concluded by suggesting December could be a decisive month for XRP , proposing that continued withdrawal activity by large holders may concentrate supply and create conditions for a pronounced price response. This view aligns with commentators who link reduced exchange liquidity to potential upward pressure. At the same time, the broader market environment remains relevant: order book depth, ETF inflows , macro headlines, and execution of on-chain transfers all interact to determine actual price outcomes. Observers should view on-chain outflow data as a useful indicator, but not as a guarantee of what the market will do next.

South Korean authorities just dropped a bombshell that affects thousands of investors. The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has declared all crypto trading illegal when conducted through platforms like Telegram and open chat rooms. This shocking development means countless traders now face serious risks. Why Did South Korea Ban Telegram Crypto Trading? On December 2nd, South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit made a definitive statement. Any virtual asset service provider targeting domestic users operates illegally unless it’s among the 27 registered entities. The FIU specifically highlighted the alarming rise of illicit operators using Telegram and similar platforms. These unregulated channels have become breeding grounds for scams and fraudulent schemes. The regulator’s warning comes at a crucial time. Many investors, lured by promises of high returns, have turned to these informal channels. However, the lack of oversight creates perfect conditions for financial crimes. The FIU urges extreme caution, emphasizing that only registered exchanges offer legal protection. Which Crypto Exchanges Remain Legal in South Korea? Under South Korea’s strict financial transaction reporting laws, only 27 entities can legally operate. This limited list includes major, well-established exchanges that comply with rigorous regulatory standards. The legal platforms provide essential safeguards that Telegram traders completely lack. The approved exchanges include: Upbit – The country’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb – A major player in the Korean crypto market Coinone – Known for its security measures Korbit – One of Korea’s earliest exchanges Gopax – Popular among retail investors These platforms undergo regular audits, maintain transparent operations, and implement strong security protocols. Their registration with the FIU means they meet strict anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. This regulatory framework protects users from the wild west of unregulated crypto trading illegal operations. What Makes Telegram Trading So Dangerous? Telegram’s encrypted nature and ease of creating large groups make it attractive to illicit operators. However, these features also create significant dangers for investors. The platform lacks the safeguards that regulated exchanges provide, leaving users vulnerable to multiple threats. The risks include: No recourse for fraud – If scammed, you have no legal protection Zero accountability – Operators can disappear instantly Price manipulation – Unregulated markets enable pump-and-dump schemes Security vulnerabilities – No insurance against hacks or theft Moreover, participating in crypto trading illegal activities through these channels could lead to legal consequences for users themselves. South Korean authorities have increasingly focused on tracking and penalizing both operators and participants in unregulated trading. How Can Investors Protect Themselves? The FIU’s warning serves as a crucial reminder about due diligence. Before engaging in any cryptocurrency transaction, verify the platform’s registration status. This simple step could prevent devastating financial losses. Always check if the service provider appears on the FIU’s official list of registered entities. Additionally, be skeptical of offers that seem too good to be true. High-pressure sales tactics, guaranteed returns, and requests for unusual payment methods often signal fraudulent operations. Remember that legitimate crypto trading platforms never promise unrealistic profits or rush investment decisions. For existing Telegram traders, the message is clear: transition to regulated exchanges immediately. While the process might involve additional verification steps, the security and legal protection justify the effort. Your assets deserve the safeguards that only registered platforms can provide. The Future of Crypto Regulation in South Korea South Korea continues to strengthen its cryptocurrency regulatory framework. The recent announcement reflects ongoing efforts to protect investors and maintain financial system integrity. As the market evolves, expect more precise regulations targeting emerging risks. This regulatory clarity benefits legitimate businesses while weeding out bad actors. However, it also requires investors to stay informed about changing rules. The distinction between legal and crypto trading illegal activities becomes increasingly important as enforcement intensifies. Ultimately, South Korea’s approach balances innovation with consumer protection. By channeling trading activity toward regulated platforms, authorities aim to reduce fraud while supporting legitimate cryptocurrency adoption. This creates a safer environment for everyone participating in the digital asset economy. Frequently Asked Questions Is all cryptocurrency trading illegal in South Korea? No, only trading through unregistered platforms is illegal. You can legally trade cryptocurrencies through the 27 exchanges registered with South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit, including Upbit, Bithumb, and Coinone. Why specifically target Telegram for crypto trading? Telegram’s encrypted messaging and large group capabilities have made it popular for unregulated trading operations. The platform’s features enable anonymous coordination of potentially fraudulent schemes that bypass financial regulations. What happens if I continue trading crypto on Telegram? You risk losing your funds to scams with no legal recourse. Additionally, you could face penalties for participating in illegal financial activities as South Korean authorities increase enforcement against unregistered trading. How do I verify if a crypto exchange is legal in South Korea? Check the Financial Intelligence Unit’s official website for their list of 27 registered virtual asset service providers. Only platforms on this list can legally offer cryptocurrency trading services to South Korean users. Are international exchanges like Binance legal in South Korea? International exchanges must register with South Korea’s FIU to operate legally. If an international platform isn’t on the approved list, using it for trading cryptocurrency violates South Korean regulations. What should I do if I’ve already invested through Telegram? Withdraw your funds immediately and transfer them to a registered exchange. Document all transactions and consider reporting suspicious operators to the Financial Services Commission to help prevent others from being victimized. Protect your investments and stay compliant – share this crucial information with fellow crypto enthusiasts. Many traders remain unaware of these regulations, and your share could prevent someone from devastating financial losses.

A potent Wolfe Wave pattern is forming alongside a test of a key weekly trendline. This structural confluence signals that the market is reaching a point of maximum compression, indicating that a significant directional breakout is imminent. Wolfe Wave Formation Signals Strong Future Move According to a recent technical analysis by BeLaunch, AVAX is shaping a notable Wolfe Wave pattern, a formation known for sparking strong directional moves once completed. This developing structure reflects tightening price action and growing pressure within the market, hinting that a significant breakout could be on the horizon. Related Reading: AVAX Reclaims Top 20 Spot as Securitize Chooses Avalanche for EU Securities Platform At the same time, Avalanche is pressing against a descending weekly trendline that has consistently acted as a major resistance level. A breakout above it would reinforce the bullish implications of the Wolfe Wave, while a rejection could force the asset back into a prolonged consolidation. For those eyeing long-term accumulation, BeLaunch points to the $11–$8 range as the most compelling buy zone. This region could provide strong support and aligns with key structural levels, making it an attractive opportunity for investors preparing for the next potential upside cycle. Historical Precedent: The September 2023 Rally Setup BeLaunch went on to highlight that the current Avalanche setup closely mirrors the conditions seen in September 2023, just before a major rally unfolded. The resemblance between the two periods offers a valuable historical reference, suggesting that the market may once again be preparing for a significant move.

Crypto gains are currently subject to a progressive taxation system that can go as high as 55%, discouraging domestic trading among Japanese investors. The proposal places crypto profits under a different taxation framework, where specific income-generating streams are treated independently from business earnings or wages. The 20% is split between regional authorities and the government at 5% (as resident tax) and 15% (as income tax), respectively. These changes are expected to be included in the finalized 2026 tax reform package, which is scheduled for release in late December. Meanwhile, local media reports suggest that the Japanese government plans to press forward with these measures to encourage investment in the equity markets. It also plans to make minors eligible for tax-free investments. Japan’s FSA announces regulatory review The Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) has announced preparations for regulatory changes in line with the proposed tax cut on crypto gains. The changes will treat crypto as a financial product under the same laws governing investment funds and stocks. The FSA’s proposal covers Bitcoin, Ethereum , and nearly 100 other tokens, and the planned structure will reclassify crypto under Japan’s Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, effective in 2026. Meanwhile, institutional involvement is expected to surge under the new rules. According to the FSA, insurance firms and banks could be authorized to offer crypto products through custody arrangements or affiliated brokers. However, the authorization is subject to compliance with insider trading and securities disclosure requirements. The FSA is also preparing a whitelist of about 150 tokens that meet its classification standards. All the assets excluded from this list will face limited access to exchanges and tighter restrictions. Meanwhile, Japanese exchanges could see a significant surge in domestic custody as tax incentives change. Corporate treasuries may also begin to allocate to approved tokens under clearer compliance standards and accounting, the FSA added. The FSA has not yet published a draft legislation or completed the token whitelist, both of which are targeted for a 2026 release. However, the agency has announced that a consultation period will precede official legislative action. The agency also conducted a quick tax comparison across major markets and found that the U.S. treats most tokens as property, taxing crypto profits at rates ranging from 0% to 37%, depending on the holding period. The UK applies a capital gains tax of about 20%-28% with bracket variations. Germany taxes crypto gains as income; otherwise, the holdings are exempted after a year. France also applies a 30% flat rate on crypto profits under its digital asset rules. Crypto reclassification removes compliance barrier for institutions Importantly, the proposed reclassification of crypto assets will remove some compliance barriers for institutions, according to the FSA . The new rule will also establish two regulatory categories for crypto assets: approved assets and non-approved assets. The FSA says approved assets will receive special benefits, including bank custody and similar tax treatment to stocks. The agency believes this will make it easier for institutions to sell and manage them. Non-approved assets will remain in the current, more restrictive tax category and continue to face regulatory constraints. Meanwhile, allowing insurance firms and banks to offer crypto-related products opens up institutional allocation that is yet to be unlocked by other G7 countries. The agency also claims that cutting taxation on crypto gains from 55% to 20% is also expected to significantly impact the behavior of retail traders, according to the agency. The FSA also stated that inclusion in the whitelist will become a requirement for market access for token issuers. The new framework will align crypto with existing securities infrastructure for institutions.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/jake-claver-to-robert-kiyosaki-ill-take-xrp-for-1000-heres-why/,"Business leader Jake Claver offered a straightforward response to investor and author Robert Kiyosaki after Kiyosaki warned that global markets may be entering a difficult phase. Kiyosaki shared his belief that the end of Japan’s long-running carry trade could trigger a broad decline in asset prices. He repeated his usual recommendation to hold gold, silver, Bitcoin, and Ethereum, describing the current environment as one in which careful positioning could still enable people to build wealth despite economic pressure. Claver replied by bringing XRP into the discussion and stated openly that he would take the asset at a $1,000 price . His comment introduced a different viewpoint and shifted the focus toward digital assets beyond the ones Kiyosaki listed. It also reflected the confidence many XRP supporters continue to express, even during times of global uncertainty. I'll take XRP for $1000, Bob https://t.co/pWUN9xidM8 — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) November 30, 2025 Understanding the Japan Carry Trade The exchange is easier to interpret when the background is clear. For many years, Japan kept interest rates extremely low. Investors around the world borrowed money in Japanese yen at very cheap rates and invested it in other countries where returns were higher. This was known as the Japan carry trade. The strategy worked as long as borrowing in yen was inexpensive and the currency did not rise too quickly. Now that Japan has begun moving away from ultra-low interest rates, such a trade is harder to maintain. If the yen strengthens or borrowing costs increase, investors may unwind positions, which can reduce liquidity and put pressure on markets. This is the basis of Kiyosaki’s warning. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Reactions and XRP’s Appeal An additional comment from X user iDeplorableVET added more context from the XRP community . The user pointed to XRP’s dramatic performance in 2017, when it rose more than 63,000% from a fraction of a cent to above three dollars. They noted today’s price level and suggested where that same percentage gain would place the asset now. The comment also referenced ideas such as the reverse carry trade and the possibility of future ETF-driven supply effects, both of which are often raised by those who expect stronger demand for XRP. Taken together, the comments from Kiyosaki, Claver, and community members show how the market views the same global developments differently. While some warn of broad risk, others see the potential for certain digital assets to benefit in the long term, with XRP remaining central to that discussion.

As BTC experiences a pullback, top analysts are providing crucial insights that challenge the most fearful narratives. This Bitcoin price prediction analysis cuts through the noise, revealing why a crash to $30,000 is considered unrealistic and where the true support likely lies. What Do On-Chain Signals Say About the Bitcoin Price Prediction? On-chain analyst Sykodelic offers a data-driven perspective that tempers extreme bearish forecasts. According to their analysis, Bitcoin is currently down about 31% from its all-time high. This correction, while significant, lacks the hallmarks of a major market top. Sykodelic argues the recent bull cycle showed limited momentum compared to previous cycles. More importantly, it didn’t display the classic signs of overheating that typically precede a catastrophic 70% crash. This forms the foundation of their Bitcoin price prediction . Why is $55,000 a Critical Level in This Bitcoin Price Prediction? Historical chart analysis provides a compelling case for the $55,000 level. Sykodelic points to a powerful technical indicator: Bitcoin has never closed below the lower Bollinger Band on its monthly chart. This statistical reality makes $55,000 a likely floor, even in a worst-case scenario. Therefore, the analyst views a plunge to the $35,000 range as highly improbable. This Bitcoin price prediction is grounded in years of market behavior, not short-term fear. How Does Institutional Participation Change the Bitcoin Price Prediction? Jeff Ko, a senior analyst at CoinEx, adds another layer to the conversation. He projects that increased institutional involvement fundamentally alters market dynamics. This makes a repeat of past large-scale crashes less probable. Ko states that even in a bearish scenario, the price is more likely to find a bottom between $65,000 and $68,000. This more optimistic Bitcoin price prediction hinges on the stabilizing force of professional capital. Institutional Buffering: Large entities often buy during dips, creating support. Reduced Volatility: Professional management can smooth out extreme price swings. Long-Term Focus: Institutions typically have longer investment horizons than retail traders. What Are the Key Takeaways From This Bitcoin Price Prediction? The consensus among these experts suggests a measured perspective is warranted. While a drop to $55,000 is possible, a collapse to $30,000 lacks supporting evidence from both technical and fundamental viewpoints. This analysis provides a framework for investors: View the current correction as a normal market cycle phase. Recognize that institutional adoption may prevent historical crash patterns. Use key levels like $55,000 and $65,000 as guides for potential accumulation zones. Ultimately, this Bitcoin price prediction emphasizes rationality over emotion. The data suggests established support levels are much higher than the most fearful headlines claim. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Why do analysts think Bitcoin won’t crash to $30,000? A: Analysts cite the lack of classic bull market overheating signs, the historical precedent of the monthly Bollinger Band, and the new stabilizing influence of institutional investors as key reasons a $30K scenario is unrealistic. Q: What is the most likely price bottom according to this analysis? A: The analysis presents a range. On-chain data suggests $55,000 as a worst-case floor, while institutional perspectives point to a higher bottom between $65,000 and $68,000. Q: How does institutional investment affect Bitcoin’s price stability? A> Institutional investors typically bring larger, longer-term capital. They often view corrections as buying opportunities, which can create strong support levels and reduce the severity of market downturns. Q: Should I be worried about the current Bitcoin price correction? A> Corrections of 20-30% are normal within Bitcoin bull markets. The analyst views suggest this is a healthy pullback to shake out weak hands, not the start of a prolonged bear market.

As stablecoins become more regulated, value may shift to platforms that use them as neutral payment rails for content, AI agents, and communities. The SUBBD platform merges Web3 and AI to cut creator fees, automate fan engagement, and unlock tokenized access while keeping content and earnings under creator control. Its SUBBD Token powers the platform, with solid utility that covers everything from tips to access to exclusive content. Canada’s push to regulate stablecoins is shaping up less like a crypto crackdown and more like a plumbing upgrade for the payments system. Scotiabank has argued Ottawa’s proposed framework is primarily about modernizing digital cash, not rewriting the rules for broader capital markets or speculative crypto assets. According to Derek Holt , VP and Head of Capital Markets Economics at Scotiabank, stablecoins can gain adoption via cross-border payments, lower liquidity premiums, and 24/7 access. For you as an investor or builder, Scotiabank’s distinction matters. Provided that stablecoins are required to be strictly compliant and have bank-grade oversight, the obvious upside shifts to what runs on top of that layer. These include applications, content platforms, and AI-driven user experiences that don’t need to become regulated money transmitters to grow. That’s where AI-powered creator platforms come in. You’re watching major social and subscription networks skim fees that can hit 50–70%, apply opaque moderation, and restrict payouts depending on geography or banking access. Meanwhile, creators are wrestling with fragmented AI tools for scripting, editing, and fan engagement. The SUBBD platform, powered by its native $SUBBD Token , positions itself squarely in this application layer. Instead of competing with bank-approved stablecoins, it uses Ethereum-based rails and AI models to power creator tools, tokenized access, and flexible payouts. As Canada and other jurisdictions tighten the definition of digital money, projects like SUBBD are betting the real upside lies in what people actually do with that money online, not in issuing it. Why Payments Regulation Pushes Value Toward Application Layers If stablecoins in Canada move under a clearer, bank-style regime, they start to look more like compliant digital dollars than speculative crypto products. That reduces regulatory uncertainty for payment tokens but leaves far more creative latitude for platforms that simply integrate those tokens as funding sources, tipping rails, or subscription back-ends. You’re already seeing Web3 projects lean into this separation. Some aim to be fully regulated wallets and on-ramps; others focus on creator tooling, NFT membership passes, and AI companions that plug into whatever stablecoin or token users prefer. Competing AI content platforms are racing to bundle chatbots, video tools, and fan clubs into cohesive ecosystems rather than standalone bots. In that landscape, the SUBBD platform slots in as one of several AI-and-Web3 platforms trying to own the creator relationship instead of the payment license. With its $SUBBD Token , it treats the money layer as interchangeable infrastructure, concentrating instead on how creators deploy AI assistants, voice clones, and token-gated drops to lock in their audiences and reduce reliance on high-fee Web2 intermediaries. Learn more about the project by reading ‘What is SUBBD Token?’ How $SUBBD Turns AI and Tokens into Creator Infrastructure Where most creator platforms monetize by taking a hefty cut, the SUBBD platform is built around the idea that fees up to 70% are unsustainable in a world of programmable money. Running as an ERC-20 ecosystem, it pairs Ethereum smart contracts with proprietary AI models for content generation, chatbots, voice cloning, and object recognition, keeping ownership and earnings with the creator. As the platform’s native token, $SUBBD Token powers exclusive content, subscriptions, PPV events, NFT-based exclusives, and tipping, while supporting staking and XP multipliers as loyalty mechanics. The presale has already raised over $1.3M, with tokens priced at $0.057075, signaling early demand for an AI-first, Web3-native creator stack rather than another generic memecoin play. Our SUBBD Token buying guide provides step-by-step instructions on how you can purchase $SUBBD. As with most token presales, you can stake your tokens as soon as you purchase them. There’s a fixed 20% APY in the first year for staking, followed by platform-benefit rewards and access to exclusive livestreams and BTS content. As a project that builds a pathway to the future of creator platforms, it has huge potential for growth, which also impacts the value of its token. Based on our $SUBBD Token price prediction, the token could reach a high of $0.48 by the end of 2026, given its solid utility. That’s about a 740% increase from its current price. In a world where regulated stablecoins handle the compliance-heavy money flows, the SUBBD platform is pitching itself as the layer where creators, fans, and AI-driven influencers actually meet.

The South Korean exchange has issued an important service announcement that directly impacts your ability to move funds. Starting at 1:00 p.m. UTC on December 2, Bithumb will temporarily suspend all EGLD deposits and withdrawals . This planned pause is not a cause for alarm but a necessary step for a network upgrade. Let’s break down what this means for you and how to navigate this brief interruption smoothly. Why Is Bithumb Suspending EGLD Deposits and Withdrawals? The primary reason for this temporary halt is a scheduled network upgrade on the MultiversX blockchain. Exchanges like Bithumb must pause external transaction services during such upgrades to ensure security and prevent any loss of funds. Think of it like temporarily closing a bridge for essential maintenance; it’s a standard safety procedure in the crypto world. Therefore, this proactive measure protects user assets during the technical transition. What Does This Mean for Your EGLD Holdings? It’s vital to understand the scope of this suspension. The temporary halt applies specifically to moving EGLD tokens on and off the Bithumb exchange. However, your other activities on the platform remain unaffected. Here is a quick breakdown of what you can and cannot do: Paused: Depositing new EGLD tokens from an external wallet to your Bithumb account. Paused: Withdrawing EGLD from your Bithumb account to an external wallet. Unaffected: Trading EGLD against other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Korean Won on Bithumb’s spot market. Unaffected: The safety of the EGLD tokens already held in your Bithumb wallet. In essence, your existing EGLD balance is safe, and you can still trade it. The only restriction is on moving tokens across the exchange’s boundary. How Can You Prepare for the Temporary Halt? A little preparation can help you avoid any inconvenience. Since the suspension of EGLD deposits and withdrawals begins at a specific time, you have a clear deadline. If you need to move EGLD for any urgent reason, such as participating in an external staking pool or transferring to a private wallet, you must complete that transaction before 1:00 p.m. UTC on December 2. Planning ahead is the best strategy. What Happens After the MultiversX Network Upgrade? Once the MultiversX network upgrade is successfully completed and tested, Bithumb will resume its services. The exchange will make a follow-up announcement to confirm the resumption of EGLD deposits and withdrawals . Typically, such suspensions last only for the duration of the upgrade and a short verification period. It’s a good practice to monitor Bithumb’s official announcements for the exact reactivation time. In summary, Bithumb’s decision to temporarily suspend EGLD deposits and withdrawals is a routine and user-protective action. It ensures the integrity of your assets during a core blockchain improvement. By understanding the limits of the suspension and planning your transactions accordingly, you can navigate this period without stress. This upgrade ultimately aims to enhance the MultiversX network, potentially benefiting all EGLD holders in the long run with improved performance and features. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is my EGLD safe on Bithumb during this suspension? A1: Yes, absolutely. The suspension only affects moving tokens in or out of the exchange. The EGLD held in your Bithumb wallet remains secure and unaffected. Q2: Can I still buy or sell EGLD on Bithumb? A2: Yes. The trading markets for EGLD will remain fully operational. You can continue to buy, sell, and trade EGLD against other supported currencies on the platform. Q3: How long will the EGLD deposit and withdrawal services be suspended? A3: The suspension begins at 1:00 p.m. UTC on Dec. 2. The duration depends on the MultiversX network upgrade. Services will resume once the upgrade is stable, as announced by Bithumb. These halts typically last a few hours. Q4: Will other cryptocurrencies on Bithumb be affected? A4: No. This announcement is specific to MultiversX (EGLD). Deposit and withdrawal services for other cryptocurrencies continue as normal unless stated otherwise in a separate notice. Q5: What should I do if I have a scheduled transaction around this time? A5: If you planned to deposit or withdraw EGLD, ensure you complete it before the deadline. If you miss it, you must wait until Bithumb officially resumes the service. Q6: Where can I get official updates on this situation? A6: Always refer to Bithumb’s official website or verified social media channels for the most accurate and timely updates regarding service status.

55243175,638079,1764667592,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55243175.jpeg,Next 1000x Crypto? Bitcoin Hyper’s Presale Reaches $28.8M,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hyper-presale-28m-next-1000x-crypto/,"Quick Facts: Bitcoin’s base layer still struggles with slow finality, high fees during congestion, and almost no native smart contract capabilities for modern dApps. As demand grows for Bitcoin-secured DeFi and payments, users face a gap between $BTC’s store-of-value role and real on-chain utility. The Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has raised over $28.8M in presale so far, with a current token price of $0.013365. The project is set for release between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026, which means that the opportunity window is closing fast. Bitcoin is back in the spotlight, but the same old limitations keep showing up: 10-minute blocks, fee spikes during hype, and no native smart contracts. As capital rotates into infrastructure plays, investors are hunting for projects that plug directly into Bitcoin while unlocking the scalability you expect from modern Layer-1s. That’s where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) plans to plant its flag. It’s pitching a simple yet aggressive idea – retain Bitcoin’s security and brand, bolt on Solana-style speed and programmability, and keep $BTC holders in the Bitcoin universe. The Bitcoin Hyper presale has already attracted serious attention, with a massive $28.8M+ already raised. $HYPER is currently priced at $0.013365 and staking is at 40% APY. Check out our guide to buying Bitcoin Hyper if you plan to join the presale. That’s meaningful traction for a network that hasn’t even launched its mainnet yet, which suggests considerable appetite for a Bitcoin-native execution layer that doesn’t feel like 2015 tech. If you’ve been watching the rise of Bitcoin Layer-2 narratives, from rollups to sidechains, Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself as the high-beta bet on that trend. Learn more about this Layer-2 in our Bitcoin Hyper review. Bitcoin Hyper Brings SVM Performance To Bitcoin Holders At a high level, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) wants to do one thing extremely well: make Bitcoin feel as fast and flexible as the chains you actually use every day. It will integrate the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to deliver ultra-low latency smart contracts, aiming for Solana-like throughput while settling back to Bitcoin for security and trust. For you as a user, that translates into high-speed payments in wrapped $BTC with low fees, DeFi apps for swaps, lending, and staking, plus NFT and gaming experiences – all anchored to the Bitcoin ecosystem rather than a separate altcoin island. Unlike the Stacks Layer-2 , Bitcoin Hyper explicitly targets Solana-level speed while staying tightly coupled to $BTC as its core asset. This upgrade is not only welcomed, but necessary, given Bitcoin’s current state. The Bitcoin network lags behind most high-profile ecosystems due to its performance cap of just 7 TPS, placing it 23rd on the list of the fastest blockchains . Solana, meanwhile, ranks second, with a practical TPS of around 1K and a theoretical one of 65K; this explains the marriage between Bitcoin Hyper and Solana’s SVM. Can $HYPER Really Be A 1000x Bitcoin Ecosystem Bet? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) shows massive post-launch potential when considering the project’s utility proposition and market support. Our price prediction for $HYPER puts the token at a potential $0.20 by end-2026 and $1.50 or higher by 2030. In terms of ROI, we’re talking numbers like 1,396% and 11,123% respectively. In other words, $HYPER could very well become the next 1000x crypto in 2026 and beyond, once Bitcoin Hyper sees successful implementation and breaches into the mainstream. Bitcoin Hyper’s bet is clear: if Bitcoin is going to host serious DeFi, gaming, and high-throughput apps, it needs an execution layer that feels like Solana, not a 2013 payment rail. With SVM integration, wrapped $BTC payments, and DeFi-ready primitives, $HYPER is positioning itself to be that execution engine. For investors, that makes Bitcoin Hyper less of a meme coin and more of a leveraged bet on Bitcoin’s infrastructure future. If the thesis plays out and Bitcoin-native liquidity chases speed and programmability, the upside for early $HYPER holders could be significant. The project targets a release window between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026, which brings a sense of urgency, given that we’re nearing the end of 2025. What’s more, the presale price increases in stages, while the staking APY lowers as more holders join the staking pool. Buy your $HYPER on presale while you still can.

In excess of 800M tokens have already been sold and Stage 6 now is 95% sold with only a small amount remaining below $0.04. The closer the token is to the point of launching with a price of 0.06, the more the interest of curious users is attracted. The 24-hour leaderboard also stimulates presale activity because the Mutuum Finance’s top contributor every day gets a reward in the form of $500 in MUTM. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is aiming to provide the opportunity to establish a fully decentralized lending ecosystem based on a dual lending model. This structure defends various lending tastes and this is to be stable, transparent interest behavior and predictable yield. The central point of the protocol is the mtToken system. In the case of supplying assets by users, they are rewarded with the use of mtTokens that improve in value as borrowers pay interests. This enables the users to gain yield as a result of actual activity rather than various inflation rent schemes. A buy-and-distribute model is also a part of Mutuum Finance where a percentage of the protocol revenue purchases MUTM on the open market. The open market purchases of MUTM are transferred to consumers holding stakes on the safety module with mtTokens. This system enhances long term token value and contributes to the network health. Security is also a big priority. The project went through a CertiK audit, during which it scored a 90/100 Token Scan, with the lending contracts completed being reviewed by Halborn Security . Stablecoin and Oracle Network Mutuum Finance is working on an in-house stablecoin that is meant to be minted and burned on demand and pegged to USD. The stablecoin will make the Mutuum Treasury generate interest and will bring revenues in the long run and will make borrowing more liquid. Lending platforms require the right pricing, and Mutuum Finance will rely on Chainlink oracles and fallback feeds as well as on-chain averages of the prices to ensure the liquidation conditions remain steady. This assists in shielding the users against volatility and consistency of borrowing. Due to mtTokens, the buy-and-distribute framework, stablecoin schemes and the growing framework of the project, some observers consider that MUTM may hit the $0.30-$0.50 range during its initial post-launch period. This may be seen as a robust growth opportunity in the market supported by increasing development trends and early growth at a stronger rate than $0.035. V1 Launch Approaching Based on the official account of Mutuum Finance X , V1 will be deployed to the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. Such a release will consist of the liquidity pool, mtTokens, the liquidation bot and ETH/USDT lending support. The Testnet will also enable the users to communicate with the system prior to the mainnet rollout and could become one of the most anticipated milestones in the roadmap of the project. Phase 6 is also approaching being fully allocated. Demand is surging up having only 5% left over in recent days. With the rest of the tokens decreasing and V1 coming closer, Mutuum Finance is becoming one of the most active leading crypto chances under $0.05.

The tech giant announced at the NeurIPS AI conference that it is further increasing its cluster of open AI models, tools, and datasets. Nvidia said its new open physical and digital AI models aim to support research in the AI industry and beyond. It touted that its Alpamayo-R1 is the world’s first-ever industry-scale open reasoning vision language action (VLA) model for self-driving cars. The chipmaker also hinted at the release of new datasets and models for AI safety and speech. The tech firm’s researchers have prepared over 70 papers, workshops, and talks for presentation at the conference. The company is sharing its innovative projects that span medical research, autonomous driving, and AI reasoning. Nvidia shows stronger commitment to open source The tech giant demonstrated a more substantial commitment to open source at the AI event, an effort recognized by AI benchmarking platform Artificial Analysis with its new Openness Index. The Artificial Analysis Open Index rated the company’s Nemotron family of AI tools as one of the best available. The rating is based on the amount of technical information shared, the ease of using model licenses, and the clarity of data use regulations. Meanwhile, AR1 (Alpamayo-R1) integrates chain-of-thought AI reasoning with path planning to enable level 4 autonomy and enhance AV (autonomous vehicle) safety in various road scenarios. The chipmaker said previous iterations of autonomous driving models struggled with situations such as a pedestrian-heavy intersection, a car double-parked in a bicycle lane, or an approaching road closure. However, reasoning gives autonomous vehicles the common sense to drive like humans. The AR1 model achieves this by breaking down scenarios and reasoning through each step to consider all possible outcomes. It then uses contextual data to determine the most effective course of action. Nvidia claims that the AR1 taps into the chain-of-thought reasoning that allows it to process data along its path and use the information to plan a trajectory, such as stopping for jaywalkers. The model’s open foundation is based on the tech firm’s Cosmos Reason, which allows researchers to customize it for their non-commercial use cases. Researchers can also customize the AR1 model for benchmarking or developing experimental applications for AVs, according to the chipmaker. Nvidia Drive Alpamayo-R1 will be available on Hugging Face and GitHub , while a subset of the data used to train and evaluate models is available on Nvidia Physical AI Open Datasets. Reinforcement learning proves effective for AR1’s post-training Nvidia researchers claimed that reinforcement training had proven effective for AR1’s post-training. They pointed out that developers can also learn how to use and post-train models based on Cosmos using step-by-step reasoning. The researchers said examples of quick-start inference and advanced post-training can be found in the Cosmos Cookbook . The comprehensive guide for physical AI developers covers step-by-step data curation, model evaluation, and the generation of synthetic data. Meanwhile, the chipmaker said the possibilities for Cosmos-based applications are virtually limitless. The tech giant provided examples of Cosmos-based applications, including LidarGen, Omniverse NuRec Fixer, Cosmos Policy, and ProtoMotions3. The tech firm boasted that LidarGen was the world’s first model to generate lidar data for autonomous vehicle simulations. It also mentioned that its Omniverse NuRec Fixer model for robotics and AV simulation taps into Nvidia’s Cosmos Predict. The ProtoMotions3 is an open-source, GPU-accelerated framework built on Nvidia Newton and Isaac Lab. The framework can be used to train physically simulated humanoid robots and digital humans, according to the chipmaker. The Cosmos world foundation models (WFMs) can be used to generate realistic scenes. Nvidia also mentioned that policy models can be trained in Isaac SIM and Isaac Lab. The data generated from the policy models can then be used to post-train the chipmaker’s Groot N models for robotics. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The ZK Secret Santa (ZKSS) system uses zero-knowledge proofs to establish gift sender-receiver relationships without revealing identities, addressing fundamental challenges in executing private transactions on public blockchains. The timing proves significant as Ethereum accelerates institutional privacy infrastructure following warnings from co-founder Vitalik Buterin that, without robust protections, the network risks becoming “ the backbone of global surveillance rather than global freedom. ” The Secret Santa protocol illustrates practical applications of privacy technology that Ethereum desperately needs to unlock enterprise adoption. Research Tackles Blockchain’s Transparency Problem The ZKSS protocol solves three critical challenges preventing private on-chain activities. Ethereum’s transparent ledger prevents concealing participant addresses, forcing researchers to deploy transaction relayers alongside zero-knowledge proofs to protect identities. The blockchain’s lack of true randomness requires outsourcing gift pair selection to participants with ZKP verification, preventing self-assignment. The “ double voting ” problem is resolved through nullifier-based mechanisms that verify participation without compromising confidentiality. Head of Solidity at Distributed Lab, Artem Chystiakov, proposed a three-step, non-peer-to-peer process that requires the involvement of all participants. Is it possible to play Secret Santa on-chain? Well, yes! Here is a formal specification of the ZK Secret Santa protocol that can be implemented in Solidity. It preserves the full privacy of gift senders while maintaining the game's trustlessness and correctness. Happy winter! pic.twitter.com/T3NC6eoty2 — Artem Chystiakov (@Arvolear) December 1, 2025 The algorithm leverages cryptographic primitives, including hash functions, ECDSA signature recovery, and Merkle proofs, to ensure the correctness of execution. Players register addresses in a Sparse Merkle Tree during setup, commit signature hashes, and then anonymously submit randomness values that serve as RSA public keys for encrypted delivery address transmission. The protocol draws parallels to physical Secret Santa mechanics, where participants secretly place random notes into a hat before drawing assignments. “ Each participant securely places a piece of paper containing their randomness into a hat ,” the research states, with transport mechanisms corresponding to relayers ensuring no one observes which note belongs to whom. The ZKP “ magic ” guarantees participants cannot retrieve their own notes during the drawing phase. Privacy Technology Transforms Ethereum Into Surveillance-Free Network Ethereum’s privacy upgrade fundamentally changes how transactions work by hiding sender and receiver information while still proving transactions are valid. Think of it like sending a sealed envelope through the postal system, where everyone can verify it was delivered correctly without knowing who sent it or what’s inside. Zero-knowledge proofs make this possible by proving something is true without revealing the underlying data. Source: Medium The technology addresses Ethereum’s core vulnerability, where every transaction becomes permanently visible to anyone with internet access. Current blockchain transparency enables competitors to track business deals, governments to monitor spending patterns, and hackers to identify wealthy targets by monitoring wallet balances. Companies handling millions in transactions face particular exposure since their entire supply chain and financial operations become public records. Privacy-preserving smart contracts now enable businesses to conduct confidential transactions while maintaining audit trails for compliance. Projects like RAILGUN and Aztec Network allow users to shield wallet balances and transaction details from public view while still settling on Ethereum’s secure base layer. Users can create “ shielded balances ” that function like private bank accounts, with transaction history visible only to the account holder. The Ethereum Foundation launched a 47-member Privacy Cluster in October , under the coordination of Blockscout founder Igor Barinov, to accelerate development across five key areas, including private transactions, portable verification, and selective identity disclosure. Regulatory Pressure Intensifies Privacy Development The Financial Stability Board warned in October that strict privacy laws hinder global crypto oversight, as confidentiality rules prevent data sharing across jurisdictions. “ Secrecy or data privacy laws may pose significant barriers to cooperation, ” the FSB wrote, noting delays in addressing cooperation requests that discourage participation in oversight arrangements altogether. Given the growing concern, the EU introduced sweeping crypto data-sharing rules in November under Implementing Regulation 2025/2263, requiring exchanges and wallet providers to report customer holdings in standardized formats from January 2026. EU’s new crypto data-sharing rules will force exchanges and service providers to share user data and transaction records. #EU #CryptoPrivacy https://t.co/YoIDXmgNvm — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) November 27, 2025 The framework extends the Transfer of Funds Regulation’s “ travel rule ” to crypto, mandating sender-recipient identification for all transfers, including self-hosted wallet interactions above €1,000. Most recently, Vitalik Buterin donated nearly $390,000 to the Session encrypted messaging app in November, highlighting that strong metadata privacy “ requires decentralization. ” Session Technology Foundation President Alex Linton explained that permissionless account creation prevents censorship by generating cryptographically secure Account IDs rather than requiring phone numbers or email addresses that introduce surveillance risks.

This alarming scenario has prompted the UK government to consider a dramatic move: banning cryptocurrency for political donations. According to recent reports from Politico, officials are actively discussing this measure to prevent potential interference in British democracy. Why Is the UK Government Targeting Cryptocurrency Political Donations? The discussion gained urgency after Reform UK became the first major British political party to accept donations in cryptocurrency. This groundbreaking move exposed a potential vulnerability in the country’s election security framework. While the government’s original election bill didn’t include such a ban, officials are now reportedly reconsidering their position. Foreign interference in elections has become a global concern. Cryptocurrency political donations present unique challenges because they can be: Difficult to trace to their original source Transferred across borders without traditional banking oversight Potentially anonymous depending on the cryptocurrency used What Prompted This Sudden Regulatory Scrutiny? The Reform UK decision to accept cryptocurrency political donations served as a wake-up call for regulators. Political parties typically rely on traditional banking systems where transactions are monitored and regulated. Cryptocurrency bypasses many of these established safeguards. Government officials worry that hostile foreign actors could use cryptocurrency to: Influence election outcomes without detection Circumvent existing donation limits and transparency rules Create hidden financial relationships with political figures This isn’t just theoretical. Several countries have already implemented restrictions on cryptocurrency political donations. The UK now faces pressure to address this potential security gap before the next general election. How Would a Ban on Cryptocurrency Political Donations Work? Implementing such a ban presents both technical and political challenges. Regulators must define what constitutes a cryptocurrency political donation and establish clear enforcement mechanisms. The proposed measure would likely: Prohibit political parties from accepting donations in any form of cryptocurrency Require parties to verify that traditional donations don’t originate from cryptocurrency conversions Establish penalties for violations, potentially including fines or criminal charges However, critics argue that a complete ban might be an overreaction. Some suggest that regulated cryptocurrency exchanges could provide the necessary transparency if proper reporting requirements were established. What Does This Mean for the Future of Political Funding? The debate over cryptocurrency political donations reflects broader tensions between innovation and security. On one hand, cryptocurrency represents financial innovation and accessibility. On the other, it creates potential vulnerabilities in democratic processes. This development could set important precedents for how governments worldwide approach cryptocurrency regulation. The UK’s decision may influence other democracies considering similar measures. Furthermore, it highlights the growing need for international cooperation on cryptocurrency regulation. The outcome of this discussion will shape not just UK politics but potentially global standards for political financing in the digital age. Conclusion: Balancing Innovation and Security The UK government’s consideration of banning cryptocurrency political donations represents a crucial moment for both politics and digital finance. While the move aims to protect democratic integrity, it also raises questions about how societies adapt to new technologies. The final decision will reveal much about how governments balance innovation with security concerns in an increasingly digital world. Frequently Asked Questions Why is the UK government considering banning cryptocurrency for political donations? The primary concern is preventing foreign interference in elections. Cryptocurrency transactions can be difficult to trace, potentially allowing foreign powers to secretly influence UK politics through financial support. Which political party started accepting cryptocurrency donations? Reform UK became the first major British political party to accept cryptocurrency political donations, which prompted the government’s current discussions about implementing a ban. Are cryptocurrency donations currently illegal in UK politics? No, cryptocurrency political donations are not currently illegal in the UK. However, the government is now considering legislation that would ban them to address security concerns. How do cryptocurrency donations differ from traditional political donations? Cryptocurrency donations can be more difficult to trace to their original source, can cross borders without traditional banking oversight, and may offer greater anonymity compared to bank transfers or checks. What happens if the UK bans cryptocurrency political donations? Political parties would be prohibited from accepting donations in any form of cryptocurrency. They might also need to verify that traditional donations don’t originate from recently converted cryptocurrency funds. Are other countries restricting cryptocurrency in politics? Yes, several countries have implemented or are considering restrictions on cryptocurrency political donations due to similar concerns about transparency and foreign interference.

As conservative ETF flows normalize $BTC exposure, traders increasingly look to higher‑beta infrastructure plays built around Bitcoin’s security model and brand. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) promises a faster, cheaper, and more scalable Bitcoin ecosystem as one of the fastest Layer 2 upgrades currently in presale. $HYPER raised over $28.8M in presale so far with a price of $0.013365 and is positioned for a potential 2026 ROI of 1,396%. Vanguard’s decision to let clients trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana ETFs marks a sharp break from its long-held crypto skepticism. The move will expose more investors to the crypto space , which will likely fuel the ecosystem as a whole moving into 2026. At the same time, easier ETF access mostly drives exposure to ‘Bitcoin beta’ – price action tied to $BTC itself. If you already hold spot Bitcoin or plan to stack via ETFs, that’s helpful, but it doesn’t fully capture the upside in the infrastructure being built around Bitcoin’s base layer. That’s why some traders are now scanning for higher‑octane ecosystem plays that can benefit from long‑term Bitcoin growth without competing with it. Layer 2 solutions, DeFi rails, and programmable environments connected to $BTC are increasingly viewed as leveraged expressions of the same macro thesis. In that context, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is drawing attention as an attempt to bolt a Solana‑style execution engine directly onto Bitcoin’s settlement layer. By positioning itself as a Bitcoin Layer 2 with Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) support, it targets the oldest critique of $BTC: slow, costly, non‑programmable base‑layer transactions. Learn more about what Bitcoin Hyper is right here. Why TradFi Adoption Is Pushing Traders Toward Bitcoin Infrastructure Vanguard’s ETF pivot adds to a roster of giants like BlackRock and Fidelity already funnelling retirement and brokerage capital into Bitcoin exposure. As institutional ETF flows normalize $BTC in traditional portfolios, attention often rotates to ‘picks and shovels’ plays. On the Bitcoin side, that includes Lightning Network providers, emerging Layer 2s like Merlin Chain and Bitfinity, and sidechain ecosystems experimenting with EVM compatibility, DeFi, and NFTs anchored to Bitcoin security. Within that mix, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) sits in the more aggressive bucket: a modular architecture that uses Bitcoin Layer 1 for settlement while executing smart contracts on an SVM‑powered Layer 2. For investors who see $BTC ETFs as the safe core position, projects like this become a way to express a higher‑risk view on Bitcoin’s eventual app layer. Buy your $HYPER today on the official presale page. How Bitcoin Hyper Tries to Turn $BTC into a High‑Speed App Chain Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) central claim is ambitious: a faster, cheaper, and more scalable Bitcoin ecosystem with near-instant finality and ultra-fast smart contract execution. Instead of pushing complex logic onto Bitcoin’s base layer, Bitcoin Hyper’s Layer 2 routes execution through a real-time SVM environment while periodically anchoring the state back to Bitcoin for security and final settlement. That design targets Bitcoin’s three classic pain points in one shot: slow base‑layer confirmation, rising fee pressure in congested markets, and a scripting model that was never built for rich DeFi or gaming. Under the hood, Bitcoin Hyper uses a single trusted sequencer, which batches and orders transactions before anchoring them to Bitcoin. The Canonical Bridge is the bone beneath the meat, producing the wrapped $BTC that the clients can use within the Bitcoin Hyper Layer 2 ecosystem. On the capital side, the $HYPER presale has raised over $28.8M, with a current price of $0.013365, signaling substantial early interest in a Bitcoin‑centric smart contract thesis. Based on investor interest and Bitcoin Hyper’s value proposition, our price prediction for $HYPER hints at a potential price point of $0.20 in 2026. By 2030, $HYPER could reach $1.50 once the project reaches its roadmap milestones and achieves mainstream adoption. In terms of profit, you’re looking at ROIs of 1,396% and 11,125% respectively, which is incentive enough for early coin hunters. An additional incentive comes from the presale’s projected end date, which should come between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026. Not much time left on the clock, so read our guide on how to buy $HYPER before it’s too late. Visit the presale page and buy your $HYPER before the presale ends. This isn’t financial advice.

Whether it be smartphones getting smarter, the iPad getting its first official release or Netflix shifting consumer habits, the rapid growth of all these changes can be attributed to the expansion of 4G networks. It was around this time, just under a decade into the new millennium, that crypto was introduced to the internet. Initially, though, it did not have the global backing amongst communities. Whilst digitalisation reverberated and interest surrounding corporate giants such as Apple, Facebook and Microsoft skyrocketed, the crypto phenomenon was slowly and quietly making its way to the front of the room. This surge in technology usage only propelled the narrative around crypto further into popularity. The bitcoin boom of 2017 is when we really began to see the explosion of approval, not only amongst the tech fanatics but also amongst people and businesses looking to get a piece of the pizza. Talking of pizza, we should all be familiar with the story of the gentleman who paid 10,000 BTC for two pizzas in 2010, valued at around $41 at the time of purchase. Today's value: approximately $1.1 billion. A seriously expensive slice of misfortune, one could say, but as digital currencies continue to dominate the digital landscape, companies across several sectors are harnessing their potential to innovate and enhance their services. So what industries are embracing crypto, and could it be used for everyday purchases in the near future? 1. Gaming: The Future of Online Entertainment The iGaming industry is an area that is enthusiastically adopting cryptocurrency. Crypto betting sites and Crypto casino sites are increasingly allowing users to deposit and withdraw using digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This move not only enhances security but also offers players greater anonymity and faster transactions. In the world of iGaming, the integration of cryptocurrency is particularly exciting for games that involve both chance and skill. Players can now play their way through various games without the laborious processes of traditional banking. This seamless experience is appealing to a younger, tech-savvy audience that values speed and efficiency in their online interactions. The Appeal of Crypto in iGaming Instant Transactions: Cryptocurrency transactions are processed quickly, allowing players to access their winnings without delay. Lower Fees: Traditional payment methods often come with high transaction fees. Cryptocurrencies can reduce these costs significantly, benefiting both players and operators. Global Reach: With cryptocurrency, players from different countries can participate without worrying about currency conversion or banking restrictions. 2. Finance: The Trailblazers The finance industry stands as the most significant proponent of cryptocurrency. Traditional banking has faced disruption from decentralised finance (DeFi) platforms, which offer innovative solutions for lending, trading, and investing without the need for intermediaries. One of the standout features of DeFi is its ability to provide financial services to unbanked populations. With blockchain technology, individuals can access loans and investment opportunities without a traditional bank account. This shift has the potential to democratise finance, making it accessible to everyone, everywhere. *A Stat to Consider* According to a report by Statista , the global market for cryptocurrency is expected to reach US$85.7bn by the end of 2025, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.01%, resulting in a projected total of US$95.1bn by 2026. This statistic underscores the rapid acceptance and integration of digital currencies in financial systems worldwide. 3. Retail: A More Seamless Experience Everything is becoming mainstream, easier, more seamless, and the retail industry is beginning to embrace digital currencies as a viable payment option. Major brands like Tesla and Overstock have already started accepting Bitcoin, paving the way for a broader acceptance of digital currencies in everyday transactions. As part of the customer psychology around retail, transactions via digital currencies could be easier, quicker and cheaper. Reduced fees, speedier transactions, and increased spending all contribute to a more efficient process. As well as attracting a new customer base, it enhances security by minimising the risk of fraud associated with credit card transactions. Additionally, accepting crypto can streamline cross-border transactions, making it easier for international customers to shop without currency conversion hassles. By embracing cryptocurrency, retailers position themselves at the forefront of innovation, potentially boosting customer loyalty and expanding their market reach. This interest could lead to a significant shift in how we think about money and payments in the future. 4. Real Estate: A Real Game Changer The real estate industry is also beginning to explore the possibilities of cryptocurrency. An already colossal asset globally, by collaborating with a force almost equally as immense, blockchain technology can simplify property transactions, making them more transparent and efficient. Buyers and sellers can use smart contracts to automate processes, reducing the need for intermediaries and lowering transaction costs. This trend could revolutionise the way properties are bought and sold, making transactions faster and more secure. Imagine purchasing a home using cryptocurrency, with all the paperwork handled digitally and securely on the blockchain. The Future of Real Estate Transactions As the topic of cryptocurrency becomes more familiar, we may see an increase in property transactions conducted entirely in digital currencies. This shift could attract a new wave of investors looking to diversify their portfolios with real estate. 5. Travel: The New Frontier Despite the rapid transformation associated with crypto, the travel sector is still somewhat lagging behind. Whether it’s the gradual pace of digitalisation in stagnant economies or the varying levels of awareness about cryptocurrency amongst different sub-communities, it is crucial that crypto is integrated into systems thoughtfully and effectively. One of its key strengths is the ability to access it from virtually anywhere, allowing you to manage your portfolio whether you're enjoying retirement in Rome or working on a case in Washington. Why Travel Needs Crypto Reduced Currency Exchange Hassles: Travellers can avoid the headaches of currency conversion and associated fees by using cryptocurrency. Enhanced Security: Digital currencies offer a secure alternative to carrying cash or using credit cards, reducing the risk of fraud. Loyalty Programs: Some travel companies or airport lounges are even integrating cryptocurrencies into their loyalty programs, allowing customers to earn and spend digital currency on future trips. Conclusion: A Crypto-Infused Future As we look ahead, it’s clear that cryptocurrency is poised to play a significant role in various industries. The potential for using digital currencies for everyday purchases is becoming more realistic, especially as consumer interest grows and businesses adapt to these new technologies. While there are still challenges to overcome, such as regulatory hurdles, market volatility and security issues, the future of cryptocurrency looks bright. There will be a day when paying with crypto is as common as using a credit card. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

This is no longer a futuristic concept. In a landmark move, Japanese financial giant Nomura Holdings has launched a revolutionary security token offering , tokenizing an 8 billion yen (approx. $54M) venture capital fund. This bold step signals a seismic shift in how institutional capital is raised and managed, leveraging blockchain’s power for unprecedented efficiency. What Exactly is Nomura’s Security Token Offering? Nomura isn’t just experimenting with crypto; it’s deploying a fully regulated, institutional-grade financial instrument. The fund is designed exclusively for professional investors. Crucially, it operates within Japan’s established J-Ships regulatory framework, which governs the issuance and distribution of security tokens. This provides legal clarity and investor protection, a cornerstone for mainstream adoption. The beneficiary certificates for investors are not traditional shares but digital tokens. These tokens will be recorded and transferred on the ‘ibet for Fin’ consortium blockchain platform, developed by BOOSTRY, a Nomura Securities subsidiary. Why is This Security Token Offering a Game-Changer? This move is far more than a technical upgrade. It represents a fundamental rethinking of private market investment. Tokenization through a security token offering solves long-standing challenges in venture capital and private equity. Let’s break down the transformative benefits: Enhanced Liquidity: Traditionally, venture capital investments are locked up for years. Tokenization can enable secondary trading on regulated platforms, giving investors a potential exit path without waiting for a company IPO or sale. Fractional Ownership: A high-value fund can be divided into smaller digital tokens. This lowers the barrier to entry, allowing a broader range of professional investors to participate in premium venture capital opportunities. Transparency and Automation: Every transaction is immutably recorded on the blockchain. Smart contracts can automate processes like dividend distributions, capital calls, and voting, reducing administrative overhead and errors. Global Accessibility: While currently for domestic professional investors, the infrastructure paves the way for cross-border investment, streamlining compliance and settlement across jurisdictions. Navigating the Future: Challenges and the Road Ahead Despite its promise, the path for institutional security token offering adoption isn’t without hurdles. Regulatory harmonization across different countries remains a complex puzzle. Widespread understanding and trust in the underlying technology from all market participants is still evolving. Furthermore, robust digital custody solutions for institutional-scale assets are critical. However, Nomura’s initiative, backed by the clear J-Ships rules, directly addresses these concerns by building within the existing regulatory perimeter. It acts as a powerful proof-of-concept for other global institutions. What Does This Mean for the Broader Crypto and Finance Landscape? Nomura’s move is a resounding validation of blockchain’s utility beyond cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. It highlights the growing ‘real-world asset’ (RWA) tokenization trend, where traditional assets like real estate, bonds, and funds are digitized. This convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized technology is creating a new hybrid system. For investors, it promises a future with more choices, greater efficiency, and improved market access. For the crypto industry, it underscores the importance of building compliant, institutional-grade infrastructure to support such transformative security token offering projects. In conclusion, Nomura’s tokenization of a ¥8 billion venture capital fund is a watershed moment. It’s not merely a pilot but a fully-fledged, regulated financial product that bridges the old world of finance with the new digital frontier. This pioneering security token offering demonstrates that blockchain’s true power lies in reinventing and streamlining the bedrock of global finance—one tokenized asset at a time. The era of digital securities has decisively begun. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a security token offering (STO)? A Security Token Offering (STO) is a method of raising capital where digital tokens, representing ownership or a stake in an underlying asset like equity, debt, or a fund, are issued. Unlike utility tokens, security tokens are regulated financial securities. How is Nomura’s fund different from an ICO? It’s fundamentally different. Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) often involved utility tokens with unclear regulatory status. Nomura’s fund is a regulated security token offered under Japan’s specific J-Ships framework, providing full legal protection for professional investors. Who can invest in this tokenized fund? Currently, the fund is targeted exclusively at professional investors in Japan, such as financial institutions, corporations, and high-net-worth individuals who meet specific regulatory criteria. What blockchain is Nomura using? Nomura is using the ‘ibet for Fin’ consortium blockchain platform, developed by its subsidiary BOOSTRY. A consortium blockchain is permissioned, meaning it’s controlled by a known group of entities, which suits regulatory compliance. What are the main benefits of tokenizing a VC fund? The key benefits are potential for increased liquidity through secondary markets, enabling fractional ownership to attract more investors, and automated compliance and administration via smart contracts, reducing costs and complexity. Does this mean the fund is a cryptocurrency? No. The tokens are digital securities representing a traditional financial asset (a venture capital fund). They are regulated like stocks or bonds, not like volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum used for speculative trading. Found this deep dive into the future of finance insightful? This move by Nomura is a huge leap for blockchain adoption.

His breakdown points to growing liquidity stress across traditional markets and suggests that these developments may soon affect digital-asset settlement systems. By linking today’s market disruptions with what could occur when institutions shift to distributed-ledger rails, he warns that XRP may face conditions very different from the ones used by traders. Market Strains and Liquidity Stress Stellar Rippler highlights a sequence of events that occurred concurrently across the traditional financial market. Trading on the CME reportedly paused at the same moment that signs of physical silver strain emerged. At that very time, major banks withdrew more than $24.4 billion from the Federal Reserve’s standing repo facility, a move interpreted as a quiet shift toward securing immediate liquidity. Something Huge Is Happening And Nobody Is Connecting The Dots. CME halts trading the moment physical silver stress shows up Then, at the exact same moment, banks quietly yank $24.4B from the Fed’s standing repo window? Banks scramble for emergency liquidity … pic.twitter.com/qs0Dnvjlxr — Stellar Rippler (@StellarNews007) November 28, 2025 According to his commentary, institutions appeared to seek emergency funding while attributing operational interruptions across multiple platforms to technical complications. He argues that these explanations serve as excuses for deeper deliverability constraints. The significance, he suggests, lies in the timing. These disruptions occurred on a shortened Friday session without the typical month-end factors that sometimes trigger unusual movements. To him, this indicates underlying stress rather than routine market behavior. Connecting Traditional Stress to Digital Settlement Stellar Rippler extends the argument by asserting that digital assets positioned for large-scale settlement roles may encounter similar liquidity dynamics once adopted. He emphasizes that when banks, payment service providers, liquidity hubs, and foreign-exchange desks begin using distributed ledger rails for real-time settlement, XRP will become a required resource. In his view, sudden institutional demand could exceed available exchange supply, producing effects that manifest as platform glitches, temporary freezes, or difficulty sourcing liquidity. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He characterizes this not as a typical price rally but as an environment where accessible supply tightens rapidly. Exchanges, he says, may experience a period where XRP does not rise first but instead becomes scarce before repricing. A Structural Shift Underway Stellar Rippler’s message suggests that traditional financial stress, reduced exchange liquidity, and the gradual movement toward distributed settlement frameworks may converge into a transformative moment for XRP. While interpretations may vary, his position is clear: the market may be approaching conditions that challenge legacy systems and highlight the role of digital assets designed for high-volume settlement.

55243940,https://square.htx.com/?p=47038,1764668807,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/100/default.png,"HTX DeepThink: With Macro Data Storm Ahead, Bitcoin Approaches a Directional Inflection Point",https://square.htx.com/htx-deepthink-with-macro-data-storm-ahead-bitcoin-approaches-a-directional-inflection-point/,"As we enter December, both macro and crypto markets are stepping into a key window characterized by dense data releases and policy-path uncertainty . In this edition of DeepThink, HTX Research analyst Chloe (@ ChloeTalk1 ) analyzes how the upcoming macro releases could heavily influence expectations for the Federal Reserve’s December meeting, and become the defining catalyst for risk sentiment across equities and digital assets. A Dense Cluster That Will Anchor Rate-Cut Expectations Although markets broadly expect the Federal Reserve to cut rates again in December, Powell emphasized last week that due to the government shutdown and resulting gaps in official data, policymakers may not have access to complete labor-market and inflation indicators before the meeting. Therefore, this week’s cluster of high-frequency data will directly determine whether the probability of a December cut falls back toward 50% or surges close to 100%. The first major release is the November ISM Manufacturing PMI . Manufacturing has been in contraction since March, with last month’s reading at just 48.7. Both new orders and employment sub-indices remained below 50, reflecting ongoing uncertainty from tariffs and weakening global demand. By contrast, the Services PMI held at a moderate 52.4 expansion, though its price sub-index stayed elevated near 70, showing that inflation pressure now comes more from domestic services rather than imports. If November services remain resilient, hawkish voices inside the Fed will be reinforced; if the index slips back to 50 or below, a December cut becomes almost assured. The labor market is the biggest swing factor. With October’s nonfarm payrolls cancelled and November NFP postponed until December 16 (after the FOMC meeting), this week’s ADP private-sector employment data becomes crucial. October ADP added 42,000 jobs, beating expectations. A stronger-than-expected November print would weaken the case for immediate easing; a softer reading would strengthen the argument for faster policy accommodation. Closely following is the Challenger layoffs report , which saw October layoffs surge to 153,074—the highest in 22 years. If November layoffs continue rising, markets will quickly reprice the risk of a U.S. labor-market downturn. On Friday, the spotlight shifts to PCE inflation and personal spending , the week’s most important macro event. Markets expect headline PCE for September to edge up from 2.7% to 2.8%, with core PCE holding at 2.9%. If the data continue to show inflation stuck near 3%, the Fed’s rate-cut pace will remain constrained; if PCE unexpectedly softens, markets will gain short-term relief. Risk Appetite Remains Compressed In U.S. equities, Goldman’s trading desk highlights that as volatility receded and market breadth rebounded from –150 to +150, systemic selling pressure was largely flushed out by mid-November. Institutional positioning models now expect a shift from net selling to roughly $4.7 billion in net buying in December . This means the traditional “Santa Rally” is not dead—the ignition simply depends on whether this week’s data support the rate-cut trajectory. In crypto , Bitcoin has bounced back above $85K, according to HTX data, after a nearly 30% drawdown from its October peak, but overall sentiment remains fragile amid thin liquidity. ETFs continue to see mild outflows, while the Coinbase premium stays weak, signaling institutional caution. Options markets display a classic risk-averse posture: near-term IV significantly higher than long-dated IV, and 25-delta put skew negative across maturities . Investors remain willing to pay for downside protection, reflecting expectations of short-term volatility spikes. Key Macro Data to Determine Whether a Reversal Takes Shape Overall, the crypto market is in a sensitive phase where the fundamental outlook is unclear, but bottom-forming characteristics are gradually emerging . If this week’s U.S. data show a combination of slowing growth without recession and softening inflation , Bitcoin and major assets may see a natural recovery, with IV compressing quickly and short-vol strategies regaining effectiveness. Conversely, if manufacturing, employment, or PCE surprise to the upside and suppress rate-cut expectations , thin holiday liquidity could trigger another sharp downward move. In the current environment, taking heavy one-sided bets carries elevated risk. Market structure tends to show gradual accumulation behavior near lower ranges, while elevated short-term IV provides room for hedging. The $80K–$82K zone remains a notable support, but a genuine trend reversal will depend on clearer signals from this week’s macro releases. *The above content is not an investment advice and does not constitute any offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product.

Citi’s analysts had argued that outflows from the investment vehicles have a measurable relationship with its negative price action, estimating that each US$1 billion withdrawn corresponds to an average 3.4% drop in Bitcoin’s value. Balchunas disputed the conclusion on X late Monday, saying the math was constricted to last month’s redemptions and did not apply to the spot ETFs year-to-date activity. “I just read that Citi analysts say that for every $1 billion pulled from Bitcoin ETFs it equals roughly a 3.4% drop in Bitcoin’s price. Ok, so then by that logic, since the ETFs have taken in +$22.5b of inflows YTD btc should be up 77% this year. Do I have that right?” he wrote. November sees record $3.7 billion in spot Bitcoin ETF outflows According to fund-data from SoSoValue, the eleven US-listed spot Bitcoin products saw $3.79 billion withdrawn over the month, surpassing the previous monthly record of $3.56 billion set in February. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust accounted for the largest share of the withdrawals with $2.47 billion exiting the product, while second-in-line Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund lost US$1.09 billion. Combined, the two issuers represented 91% of November’s redemptions, concentrating the liquidations among the largest investment vehicles. Alex Sonders, a strategist at Citi Bank, propounded that the movement of funds into or out of the products feeds directly into Bitcoin’s market value due to the creation and redemption mechanism used by ETF issuers. Bitcoin shed over 30% from its all-time high level above $126,000 achieved at the start of “Uptober.” By late November, heavy selling pressure had pulled the price down more than 33%, leaving it near $84,000 and inflicting heavy losses on investors who bought the presumed “Bitcoin end-of-year rally.” Sonders told investors that Bitcoin could trade near $82,000 when 2025 comes to a close if the products do not attract meaningful new inflows. At the same time, Bitcoin’s open interest on major derivatives exchanges fell 35% from October’s peak, as seen on CoinGlass. Traders who once relied on leverage to amplify exposure were instead abandoning positions in entirety out of fear of an October 10 liquidation event encore. Balchunas expanded on this point in a reply to his initial post bashing Citi Bank’s analysis, writing, “The point of this tweet wasn’t to check math but to push back on this blame the ETF. ETFs have been like 3% of the total selling tops.” Bitcoin ETF net flows record 4-day positive streak, price still below $90,000 After several weeks of heavy outflows, US spot Bitcoin ETFs posted a small net inflow at the start of this business week. Data from Farside Investors showed a $8.5 million net positive flow on Monday, leading to the fourth straight trading day of inflows. BlackRock’s IBIT recorded $74.03 million in redemptions yesterday, while Fidelity’s FBTC saw $67.02 million in net inflows. ARK Invest’s ARKB added US$7.38 million, helping offset the day’s losses from the largest spot BTC product AUM holder. Yet, Bitcoin failed to stand its ground at the $92,000 level it had reached last Friday, going back down to the $86,500 mark during early Tuesday’s trading sessions. The crypto market’s sentiment index is at extreme fear, and most of the king coin’s holders decided to cash in on profits over the weekend. Looking at the latest ETF news, Vanguard Group announced a policy change that will allow ETFs and mutual funds holding cryptos to be traded on its platform. According to Cryptopolitan’s insight , the decision reversed the firm’s previous position that deemed digital assets “too speculative and volatile” for its clients.

This action sends a powerful signal about the nation’s approach to fostering innovation while considering necessary oversight. For investors and builders in the space, the veto represents a crucial victory and a moment to breathe easier. What Did the Polish Crypto Regulation Bill Propose? The proposed Crypto-Asset Market Act, introduced in June, aimed to establish a strict regulatory framework. Its most contentious provision would have granted authorities sweeping power to block cryptocurrency websites with relative ease. This raised immediate concerns about censorship, market access, and the potential stifling of a growing technological sector. The bill’s broad scope indicated a shift towards a more restrictive environment for digital assets in Poland. Therefore, the president’s veto halts this trajectory. It suggests a recognition that such aggressive measures might do more harm than good, potentially driving innovation and investment to more welcoming jurisdictions. The decision underscores the ongoing global debate about how to balance consumer protection with the freedom necessary for technological progress. Why Did the President Veto the Bill? While the official reasoning will be detailed in a forthcoming statement, analysts point to several likely factors behind the veto of the Polish crypto regulation proposal: Innovation Stifling: Overly strict rules can crush the nascent crypto and blockchain startup scene. Market Freedom: The website-blocking power was seen as a draconian measure against free market principles. Legal Concerns: The bill may have faced constitutional challenges regarding overreach and digital rights. Economic Strategy: Poland may seek to attract, not repel, fintech talent and capital. This move aligns Poland more closely with nations adopting a ‘wait-and-see’ or innovation-friendly stance, rather than those pushing for immediate, heavy-handed control. It provides the local industry with valuable breathing room to mature and propose more collaborative regulatory frameworks. What Does This Mean for Crypto in Poland? The immediate effect is a stay of execution for the current operational freedom within Poland’s crypto regulation landscape. Exchanges, wallet providers, and blockchain projects can continue under existing rules. However, this is not the end of the road for Polish crypto regulation . Lawmakers are now compelled to go back to the drawing board. The goal will likely be crafting legislation that addresses real risks—like fraud and money laundering—without employing the blunt instrument of website blocking. The future of Polish crypto regulation will hinge on finding this delicate equilibrium. For users and investors, the veto means continued access to a wide range of services. It also fosters a more predictable environment in the short term, which is essential for both adoption and serious investment in blockchain infrastructure. The Global Context of Crypto Regulation Poland’s situation is a microcosm of a worldwide struggle. The European Union is finalizing its landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, which will eventually supersede national laws. Poland’s vetoed bill was arguably an attempt to get ahead of MiCA, but its methods were deemed too extreme. This event highlights a critical lesson for regulators everywhere: speed and severity are not substitutes for thoughtful, proportionate policy. A balanced Polish crypto regulation framework that protects consumers while enabling innovation could position the country as a regional leader in the digital economy. Conclusion: A Pause, Not a Full Stop President Nawrocki’s veto is a pivotal moment, but it is not a final resolution. It successfully blocks a threatening piece of Polish crypto regulation , providing the industry with a temporary shield. The real work begins now—to build a sensible, forward-looking regulatory model that supports safe growth. This decision reminds us that in the fast-evolving world of crypto, thoughtful governance triumphs over reactionary restriction. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly did the Polish President veto? A1: President Karol Nawrocki vetoed the “Crypto-Asset Market Act,” a bill that proposed strict regulations, including granting authorities the power to easily block cryptocurrency websites. Q2: Does this mean crypto is completely unregulated in Poland now? A2: No. Existing financial and anti-money laundering regulations still apply. The veto only stops this new, stricter set of proposed rules from becoming law. Q3: Will there be a new crypto regulation bill in Poland? A3> Almost certainly. The veto sends the legislation back to parliament. Lawmakers will likely need to revise it, especially to align with the upcoming EU-wide MiCA regulations. Q4: How does this affect the average crypto user in Poland? A4> For now, it means no sudden disruption. Users can continue accessing crypto websites and services as before, without the immediate threat of blocks under the proposed law. Q5: Is Poland now a “crypto-friendly” country? A5> The veto shows a willingness to protect the industry from overly harsh rules, which is a positive sign. However, the long-term friendliness will depend on the replacement legislation that is drafted. Q6: Could the parliament override the presidential veto? A6> Yes, but it requires a three-fifths majority vote in the presence of at least half of the statutory number of members of parliament, which is a high threshold and considered unlikely in this case.

For cryptocurrency traders and investors, this monetary policy shift creates both challenges and unprecedented opportunities in the forex market. As traditional safe-haven assets like the dollar weaken, digital assets may experience increased volatility and new capital flows. Why Is the US Dollar Under Pressure? The US dollar’s decline stems from growing consensus that the Federal Reserve will pivot from its hawkish stance to accommodative monetary policy. Recent economic data, particularly cooling inflation numbers, has fueled speculation that the central bank will cut interest rates sooner than previously anticipated. This fundamental shift affects currency valuations globally, creating ripple effects across all financial markets including cryptocurrencies. Federal Reserve Policy Shift Explained The Federal Reserve’s potential pivot represents a significant change in monetary policy direction. After aggressively raising interest rates to combat inflation, the central bank now faces different economic conditions that may warrant rate reductions. This policy shift directly impacts the US dollar’s strength and influences global capital flows. When the Fed cuts rates, the dollar typically weakens as yield differentials narrow between the US and other economies. Economic Indicator Current Status Impact on Fed Policy Inflation Rate Cooling towards target Supports rate cuts Employment Data Moderating job growth Allows policy flexibility GDP Growth Slowing but positive Enables dovish pivot Consumer Spending Showing resilience Provides economic cushion How Interest Rates Affect Currency Markets Interest rates serve as the primary driver of currency valuations in the global forex market. Higher interest rates typically strengthen a currency by attracting foreign capital seeking better returns. Conversely, lower interest rates tend to weaken a currency as investors seek higher yields elsewhere. The Federal Reserve’s expected rate cuts could trigger several market developments: Reduced demand for dollar-denominated assets Increased volatility in currency pairs Potential capital rotation into emerging markets Changed dynamics for carry trade strategies Forex Market Reactions to Monetary Policy Changes The forex market is experiencing heightened volatility as traders position for the Federal Reserve’s policy shift. Major currency pairs involving the US dollar show increased fluctuations, while safe-haven flows may redirect toward alternative assets. For cryptocurrency participants, understanding these forex market dynamics is crucial since digital assets often correlate with risk sentiment and dollar strength. Inflation Data Driving Fed Decisions Recent inflation reports have been the primary catalyst for changing Federal Reserve expectations. As price pressures moderate toward the central bank’s 2% target, policymakers gain flexibility to adjust monetary policy. The relationship between inflation data and interest rate decisions creates a feedback loop that continuously influences currency valuations and broader financial market conditions. Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors Market participants can navigate this shifting landscape by considering several strategic approaches. Monitoring Federal Reserve communications remains essential for anticipating policy changes. Diversifying currency exposure can help manage risk during periods of dollar weakness. Additionally, understanding correlations between traditional currencies and digital assets may reveal new trading opportunities as capital seeks alternative stores of value. FAQs: Understanding Dollar Weakness and Fed Policy What economic indicators most influence Federal Reserve decisions? The Federal Reserve primarily monitors inflation data, employment figures, and GDP growth when making interest rate decisions. Recent cooling in inflation has been particularly influential in shaping expectations for rate cuts. How does dollar weakness affect cryptocurrency markets? A weaker US dollar often correlates with stronger cryptocurrency performance as investors seek alternative stores of value. However, this relationship can vary based on broader market sentiment and risk appetite. Which Federal Reserve officials are most influential in setting policy? Chair Jerome Powell provides the most significant guidance on monetary policy direction. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) collectively makes decisions, with regional bank presidents like John Williams of the New York Fed and Raphael Bostic of the Atlanta Fed offering important perspectives. What historical precedents exist for Fed policy pivots? The Federal Reserve has executed several notable policy shifts, including the 2019 rate cuts following tightening in 2018, and the aggressive easing during the 2008 financial crisis and 2020 pandemic response. How can traders hedge against dollar volatility? Strategies include diversifying into non-dollar currencies, utilizing currency-hedged investment products, allocating to assets with negative correlation to the dollar, and employing options strategies for downside protection. The evolving monetary policy landscape presents both challenges and opportunities for market participants. As Federal Reserve expectations continue to shape currency valuations, staying informed about economic developments and central bank communications remains essential for successful navigation of global financial markets.

55244386,637864,1764669621,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55244386.jpeg,"War On Crypto, Now Targeting Trump’s AI And Crypto Czar, Expert Claims",https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-war-now-targeting-trumps-crypto-czar/,"Throughout the year, the crypto industry has undergone significant regulatory changes influenced by President Trump’s new policies, alongside a coalition of senators advocating for the adoption and growth of digital assets. However, tensions escalated when a group of Democratic senators began to challenge Trump’s policies, claiming that they reflect a significant conflict of interest, but this time, particularly concerning David Sacks, the White House’s AI and Crypto Czar. White House Crypto Czar Denies Conflicts Of Interest In a recent statement on social media site X (formerly Twitter), Sacks shared that five months ago, several reporters from The New York Times were assigned to investigate supposed conflicts of interest linked to his role. He described how the investigation persisted through numerous “fact checks,” during which they scrutinized various accusations against him. Despite presenting thorough rebuttals, Sacks noted that the published article only included fragments of their responses, while the foundation of the accusations remained largely speculative. According to the White House’s Crypto Czar, the allegations ranged from a “fabricated dinner” with a notable tech CEO to unfounded claims of promising access to the President and exerting influence over defense contracts. He argued that each time an accusation was disproven, the Times simply shifted to another claim. Sacks expressed frustration that, in their pursuit of a “sensational story,” The New York Times overlooked the fact that he has no genuine conflicts of interest to uncover. He described the final article as a “nothing burger,” asserting that it merely pieced together anecdotes that do not substantiate its headline. To counter what he deemed a misrepresentation of the facts, Sacks ultimately hired a law firm specializing in defamation law, to assist in addressing these allegations. New Bills Could Dismantle Century-Old Banking Practices Market expert Jack Sage later weighed in on these developments via social media, asserting that US bankers, including JPMorgan, are waging “TOTAL WAR” on Bitcoin. Sage pointed out several targets of this new onslaught, including Strategy (previously MicroStrategy), along with key figures such as Strike CEO Jack Mallers, and stablecoin issuer Tether (USDT). He indicated that David Sacks is now in the line of fire, characterizing this as a coordinated attack aimed at diminishing a crypto-friendly influence within Trump’s administration. Sage suggested that the Trump administration seeks to leverage Bitcoin and stablecoins to challenge the banks’ “longstanding monopoly” over the money supply. He pointed to potential legislative initiatives such as the GENIUS Act , the upcoming CLARITY Act, and possibly the BITCOIN Act as transformative measures that could shift money creation away from traditional banks and the Federal Reserve (Fed). These proposed bills, according to Sage, could dismantle the fractional reserve banking system that has existed for over a century. The response from traditional bankers and globalists, Sage noted, has been one of desperation as they confront a reality where they may lose control over monetary systems for the first time.

55244418,https://timestabloid.com/?p=91159,1764669653,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Best Crypto to Invest Today for Passive Income, MUTM 10x Target Beats ETH Staking",https://timestabloid.com/best-crypto-to-invest-today-for-passive-income-mutm-10x-target/,"Investors searching for reliable passive income in 2025 are exploring alternatives to Ethereum staking. ETH staking yields 3–4% APY, which no longer meets the growth expectations of many participants. Rising gas fees and a mature growth curve have made returns modest. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a fresh opportunity. It will offer passive income through lending, mtToken appreciation, and buy-and-distribute rewards. This structure will generate returns that surpass traditional ETH staking, positioning MUTM as the next big crypto for passive investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Presale Highlights and Early Adoption The MUTM presale has raised approximately $19.3 million across multiple phases. The project currently operates in Phase 6, priced at $0.035, with 170M tokens allocated. Phase 6 is already 95% sold out, showing strong community interest. The presale features more than 18,300 holders and a structured increase in pricing across phases, culminating in a projected listing price of $0.06. The gradual presale pricing ensures that early investors capture built-in upside while preparing for the token’s future utility. These fundamentals will encourage investors to engage early and take advantage of discounted rates before the token lists publicly. An investor swapped $1,000 BTC and $1,500 ETH into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during Phase 2 at $0.015. Their $2,500 allocation will now be valued at $6K at the current Phase 6 price of $0.035. This represents 133% growth. Considering the listing price of $0.06, the same holding will rise to $10,000 in value, illustrating a gain exceeding ETH staking returns by more than 10x. This example demonstrates how Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides superior passive-income potential. Lending and staking within the platform, combined with the buy-and-distribute system, allows investors to earn returns while retaining exposure to their preferred assets. Such structured passive-income growth is difficult to achieve through ETH staking alone. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Dual Lending Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) supports two lending models. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) allows users to lend stablecoins like DAI or major coins such as BTC, and ETH. Smart contracts hold liquidity while borrowers provide overcollateralized assets. Interest rates adjust automatically based on pool usage. For instance, a user lends $10,000 DAI and earns 18% APY, generating $1,800 in passive income annually. Borrowers can use $1,200 SOL as collateral and borrow $960 USDT, maintaining their SOL exposure. Interest accrues in mtTokens, providing another passive-income stream. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending offers higher-risk options with volatile assets. Users manually set rates and negotiate terms. Returns are higher than conventional DeFi, while isolated pools protect the main system from volatility. Experienced investors benefit more, yet risk remains contained, providing flexibility and additional growth potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enforces overcollateralization to protect lenders. Volatile assets require stricter caps to prevent instability. ETH can have LTV up to 95%, while volatile coins are capped between 35–95% depending on market swings. Liquidation bots stabilize the system and allow liquidators to earn discounted rewards. This mechanism ensures protocol safety while supporting high-demand trading and borrowing activity. Liquidity ensures smooth operations even during market swings. Volatile assets require higher reserve factors, up to 55%, while stablecoins need only 10%. Proper liquidation thresholds protect lenders and borrowers, maintaining confidence in the protocol. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) balances volatility with safety, offering predictable passive-income growth for participants. What 10X Seems Realistic: Key Growth Drivers Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shared on its official X page that the V1 release of its protocol is expected to launch on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. This early deployment will activate the protocol’s key infrastructure, including the liquidity pool, the mtToken and debt token frameworks, and an automated liquidator bot designed to maintain system integrity and protect collateral positions. During this stage, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as supported collateral types. Releasing V1 on the testnet gives the community hands-on access to the protocol before its transition to the mainnet. This phased introduction enhances transparency, encourages early engagement, and allows the team to gather meaningful feedback for fine-tuning the system. As user participation grows and more people explore the testnet, interest in the platform is likely to build, supporting long-term confidence and demand for the MUTM token. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will use revenue generated from operations to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market, which are distributed to mtToken stakers. This cycle creates continuous buy pressure while delivering real passive income, unlike ETH staking that relies on inflationary emissions. Higher platform usage leads to more buybacks, ensuring long-term growth and rewarding participants for active engagement. Launching MUTM tokens alongside the platform will generate immediate utility and liquidity. Traders and lenders will use the system from day one. Early usage boosts the probability of Tier-1 exchange listings and ensures that passive-income participants see tangible rewards instantly. The simultaneous launch creates a stronger market presence than a token-only launch. Security and Community Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is undergoing a comprehensive audit by Halborn, a reputable cybersecurity firm. The audit will verify the smart contracts against logic flaws, potential exploits, and vulnerability risks under stress conditions. The code is being thoroughly examined through formal analysis to ensure it meets the highest standards of security, precision, and dependability before going live. Audits improve confidence among both retail and institutional participants. They also enhance the likelihood of Tier-1 exchange listings by confirming that smart contracts operate as intended. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a $500 reward for the top daily user, resetting at 00:00 UTC. Participants need at least one transaction to qualify. This system stimulates activity, increases liquidity, and encourages staking of mtTokens. Active users contribute to volume and demand, which will enhance interest when MUTM eventually lists on exchanges. The leaderboard creates tangible incentives while fostering a lively ecosystem that benefits all participants. Conclusion: Last Chance for Passive Income and 10x Growth Phase 6 of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already 95% sold out. The next phase will raise the price to $0.040, a 15% jump. This is the last opportunity to acquire MUTM below $0.04. The platform’s lending, mtToken rewards, and buy-and-distribute model will position it to deliver passive-income growth 10x higher than ETH staking post launch. Investors seeking the next big crypto and a sustainable source of revenue will find MUTM compelling. Early adoption ensures participants maximize both utility and potential appreciation, making it one of the best crypto options in 2025.

The recent deleveraging is part of a longer process, with significant outflows of open interest on Binance. ETH open interest on Binance slid by 51% in the past three months, following the crash of October 11. Since then, open interest has made attempts to recover on other exchanges. On Binance, ETH open interest continued to decline, evaporating nearly $6.4B in positions in the past three months. ETH open interest declined on Binance, erasing 51% in the past three months as Ethereum started unwinding from its most speculative period in its trading history. | Source: CryptoQuant . The recent shift in open interest signals at a market reset and a re-evaluation of Ethereum’s potential. The past year turned into the most speculative period for ETH, raising open interest on Binance to a peak at $12.6B in August. Ethereum entered its most speculative period in history Ether got a boost from robust ETF interest, the growth of the L2 economy, and the continued recovery of DeFi, staking, lending, and stablecoin transfers. However, ETH failed to break out to a higher market range, and only triggered a short altcoin season. After an aggressively bullish period, ETH built a less sustainable market structure, which started unwinding with signs of a bear market. ETH briefly switched to spot trading as a compensation for weakening open interest, but the trading failed to sustain the market price. For years, ETH traded as a utility token, while most of its projects were small-scale or experimental. The confidence that Ethereum could become a global settlement platform for finance set expectations that the ETH token may be more valuable. Speculative open interest rode on the back of the bullish conviction, but quickly unraveled when ETH failed to rally. Other exchanges also lost their liquidity, with Gate dropping to $3.5B, and Bybit down to $2.3B from $6.1B. On Hyperliquid, ETH open interest declined to $1.3B. In total, ETH positions declined to $15B, with a balanced ratio of long and short positions. The slowdown of trading activity coincided with a 43% slide for ETH, from a peak of $4,830 to $2,800. ETH still trades at 0.032 BTC, as the leading coin abandoned its higher range. ETH records another month in the red Ethereum ended November with a total decline of 22.2%. In 2025 to date, despite the active speculative trading, ETH only had three months in the green. The token went through short-term rallies that proved unsustainable. November’s performance was the second-weakest since February, when ETH contracted by 32.2%. Despite the price fluctuations, DeFi space remains relatively healthy, as most loans have a lower liquidation price. However, the serial liquidations on centralized markets acted to discourage traders in building up long positions. At the current price levels, ETH has a lower probability of a short squeeze. Short positions are also declining, and only reach up to $2,900. The subdued derivative trading also lowered the ETH fear and greed index, which slid down to 27 points, indicating fear.

Bitcoin Hyper Presale Rides Market Shift ahead of CFTC Spot Era December 2, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Chicago-based Bitnomial is about to switch on the first CFTC-regulated spot crypto venue in the US, with self-certified rules under Regulation 40.6(a) taking effect after a 10-day review and going live from 1 December 2025. That means Bitcoin and other majors can trade on a federally supervised commodities exchange, not just state-licensed platforms like Coinbase, tightening market structure and compliance risk for you as a long-term holder. It’s a clear win for regulated liquidity. A venue like that pulls deeper liquidity, stricter surveillance, and cleaner price discovery into the Bitcoin stack, which supports any narrative built on transparent order books and institutional flow. If you like that direction but still want early-stage upside, you look further out on the risk curve. One option is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a presale aiming to unleash Bitcoin’s full potential by building a Bitcoin Layer‑2 network that enables faster, cheaper, and programmable $BTC transactions while preserving base‑layer security. Although it remains micro-sized, having raised only $28.84 so far at a token price of $0.013365 in its current phase, the project positions itself as a high‑risk, high‑reward play in the evolving Bitcoin ecosystem. Read more on what Hyper is here . Vanguard’s Bitcoin ETF Pivot and Maxi Doge Presale Ride the Same Adoption Wave December 2, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Vanguard, a $10T asset manager, is finally opening its platform to crypto ETFs and mutual funds tied to $BTC, $ETH, and $XRP, with access rolling out to more than 50M brokerage clients in the US. That move shifts Bitcoin from being a niche allocation to sitting alongside gold and broad equity funds in the same retail stack, and it strengthens the long-term adoption case for you as a patient allocator. At the same time, ETF flows tend to compress upside, because you buy exposure at scale only after the narrative is already validated. If you want Bitcoin-linked upside with more asymmetric risk and still stay early, you look at high-velocity meme exposure riding the same liquidity wave. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is one of those meme plays with enough energy to ride that wave. With $4.24M already raised and a current presale price of $0.000271, it’s catching attention from degen traders looking for the next alpha DOGE.

The biggest price losses come from ZEC, which has slumped by another 11% daily, CC (down by over 11%), and XMR (6.6% drop to $390). In contrast, PUMP and SKY have gained over 6%, while HASH has rocketed by 14% to $0.023. The total crypto market cap has remained above $3 trillion, but it’s still down by $150 billion since Sunday. Cryptocurrency Market Overview 02.12.

Could it surpass $250,000 by 2030? As the world’s first and most valuable cryptocurrency continues to evolve, investors and analysts are looking ahead with a mix of excitement and caution. This comprehensive Bitcoin price prediction analysis examines the key factors that could drive BTC’s value through 2030, from the upcoming halving event to institutional adoption and regulatory developments. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025: The Post-Halving Surge The 2024 Bitcoin halving represents a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency markets. Historical data shows that previous halvings have typically preceded significant price increases within 12-18 months. Based on current adoption trends and the supply shock created by reduced miner rewards, many analysts project BTC could reach between $80,000 and $120,000 by late 2025. Several factors support this BTC price 2025 forecast: Reduced new supply entering the market post-halving Continued institutional investment through ETFs and corporate treasuries Growing adoption as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation Technological improvements including the Lightning Network scaling solution The 2024 Bitcoin Halving: Catalyst for the Next Bull Run The Bitcoin halving 2024 event, expected in April, will reduce miner rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. This programmed scarcity mechanism has historically triggered bull markets. The table below shows historical halving impacts: Halving Year Price Before Price 18 Months After Percentage Increase 2012 $12 $1,100 9,067% 2016 $650 $19,700 2,931% 2020 $8,600 $69,000 702% While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, the pattern suggests significant upward pressure on prices following reduced supply issuance. Bitcoin Adoption: The Institutional Revolution The most significant change in recent years has been the acceleration of Bitcoin adoption among traditional financial institutions. Major developments include: Spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in the United States Corporate treasury allocations by companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla Integration into traditional payment systems by firms like PayPal and Square Growing acceptance as collateral in decentralized finance protocols This institutional embrace creates a more stable demand base that could support higher price floors during market downturns. Cryptocurrency Forecast 2026-2028: The Consolidation Phase Following the expected 2025 peak, the 2026-2028 period may see Bitcoin enter a consolidation phase. Historical market cycles suggest a potential correction or sideways movement as early investors take profits and the market digests previous gains. However, this period could also see important developments: Regulatory clarity in major economies Further technological improvements to scalability and privacy Integration with traditional financial infrastructure Potential central bank digital currency interoperability Price targets for this period range from $60,000 to $150,000, depending on adoption rates and macroeconomic conditions. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2030: The Long-Term Vision Looking toward 2030, Bitcoin’s trajectory will depend on several converging factors. Optimistic projections suggest BTC could reach between $200,000 and $500,000, while more conservative estimates place it in the $100,000 to $250,000 range. Key determinants will include: Global adoption as a reserve asset or digital gold Regulatory environment across major economies Competition from other cryptocurrencies and digital assets Macroeconomic factors including inflation rates and currency stability Technological advancements in blockchain scalability and security Risks and Challenges to Bitcoin’s Growth While the cryptocurrency forecast appears promising, several risks could impact Bitcoin’s price trajectory: Regulatory crackdowns in major markets Technological vulnerabilities or successful quantum computing attacks Environmental concerns affecting mining operations Competition from central bank digital currencies Macroeconomic factors like prolonged recession or deflation Investors should consider these factors when evaluating long-term Bitcoin investments. Frequently Asked Questions What is the most reliable Bitcoin price prediction for 2025? Most analysts agree that 2025 could see Bitcoin between $80,000 and $120,000, assuming continued adoption and favorable market conditions post-halving. How does the Bitcoin halving affect price? The halving reduces the rate of new Bitcoin creation, creating supply scarcity that historically has led to price increases as demand remains constant or grows. Which companies are most invested in Bitcoin? MicroStrategy holds the largest corporate Bitcoin treasury, followed by Tesla . Other significant holders include Block (formerly Square) and various Bitcoin mining companies. Who are the most influential Bitcoin analysts? Prominent voices include PlanB (creator of the Stock-to-Flow model), Adam Back (CEO of Blockstream), and traditional finance analysts who have embraced cryptocurrency analysis. What government regulations could impact Bitcoin’s price? Regulations from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission , Commodity Futures Trading Commission , and international bodies like the Financial Action Task Force could significantly affect Bitcoin’s adoption and price. Conclusion: The Future of Digital Gold Bitcoin’s journey from 2025 to 2030 promises to be transformative. While short-term volatility will continue, the long-term trend appears positive based on increasing adoption, technological improvements, and growing recognition as a legitimate asset class. The upcoming halving event, institutional adoption, and regulatory developments will be critical factors shaping Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Investors should approach these predictions with careful research and risk management, recognizing both the tremendous potential and significant risks in cryptocurrency markets.

As of press time, the asset is around $86,800, down slightly in the past 24 hours and almost 2% over the last week. The recent decline has brought the market close to an area that several analysts are calling an important support zone. Now, though, a major support level has come to play as it was tested yesterday. Analysts Focus on the $83K–$81K Zone Michaël van de Poppe, a well-followed crypto analyst, said Bitcoin is nearing a key area where buyers may step in. “Let’s see how prices are going to react when Bitcoin tests beneath that low at $83.4K,” he said. He added that if this level fails to hold, the market could move toward $81K to find support. Bitcoin recently failed to break through the $91,800 zone, which had been marked as an important resistance level. Following that rejection, the price dropped sharply on increased volume. The downtrend remains intact, with lower highs and lower lows visible on the daily chart. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Chart 02.12. Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Furthermore, Van de Poppe mentioned that the current price action between $80K and $90K is not ideal for short-term trades. He said a clear breakout above $90K would show strength. “Failing to sweep the low and find enough buyers… would be another indication that we’re going to see lower valuations,” he noted. Analyst Daan Crypto Trades also commented on the recent low, calling it a higher low at a major support area. He added, “ Wouldn’t want to see price go any lower than that ,” warning that another drop could point the market toward $80K again. He explained that early-month moves often reverse, and this month began with a sharp drop right from the new candle open. Long-Term Patterns Raise Caution Veteran trader Peter Brandt posted a chart showing five past Bitcoin bull cycles. Each one ended with a breakdown of its parabolic trend, followed by a correction of at least 75%. He warned that this pattern has played out every time so far. “You better have a great reason to bet against this pattern,” he wrote. Bitcoin is now trading below a parabolic trendline drawn on Brandt’s chart. The ADX value is around 22, showing weaker trend momentum. Volatility remains high, which could mean more price swings ahead. If the pattern repeats, a larger drop may still be on the table. Buyer Activity Near Current Levels Despite the broader concerns, recent data shows a dense cost basis cluster forming in the low-$80,000 range, as CryptoPotato reported . This suggests that many Bitcoin holders recently acquired coins at these levels, which could create buying interest and act as short-term support. Tom Lee of Fundstrat said he expects Bitcoin to reach a new all-time high in the coming months. Until then, traders are watching the $83K level to see if the market can hold or if more downside will follow.

Have you done your research, followed the news, and mastered analytical skills, only to watch helplessly as the gains from your long-term efforts are wiped out by a single news headline? Do you feel that your phone has become a source of anxiety, and your free time is being hijacked by the market? The tools that were supposed to give you control now seem to be controlling you instead. What if you could step away from this constant game, yet still stay in the market? Frankly speaking, in the trading game, the advantage of information and capital always lies with Wall Street. But the key is this: the smartest money doesn’t simply fight in trading, but rather seeks to obtain certain returns on the production side. This is the core of cryptocurrency investment— computing power . It’s not about predicting price fluctuations, but about directly participating in value creation . It’s like owning an oil well : oil prices fluctuate, but crude oil continues to flow. Now, isn’t this path, already considered a core asset allocation strategy by Wall Street, clearer to you now? Take CryptoEasily , a licensed and compliant digital asset mining company in London regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) , as an example. It allows investors to easily switch roles, much like buying REITs and holding real estate. The platform, through a compliant structure, converts professional-grade computing power into actual returns. This means: • Reclaim Time and Peace: Say Goodbye to 24/7 Monitoring, Let the System Run Automatically • Establishing a “crypto-based” safety net: ensuring stable accumulation of crypto assets regardless of price fluctuations. • Enhancing Portfolio Resilience: Adding a Productive Asset Dimension to Investment The platform’s CEO, Thomas Evans, explained the logic : “We aim to create a secure and transparent revenue stream. Through regulatory compliance, asset insurance, and automation, we deliver institutional-grade productive assets to individual investors.” To this end, CryptoEasily has built a five-layered protection framework: 1. PricewaterhouseCoopers’ annual audit and certification ensures transparency in finance and operations. 2. Digital assets are insured by Lloyd’s of London , providing world-leading custody insurance. 3. The platform uses Cloudflare enterprise-grade firewall and McAfee cloud security system, with a stability of up to 99.99%. 4. Cold and hot wallet separation and multi-layer encryption effectively prevent potential attacks. 5.AI-driven real-time risk monitoring systems identify and block suspicious transactions around the clock. Shifting Roles: From “Trader” to “Owner” 1. Register an account : New users receive a $15 bonus upon registration. 2. Deposit Assets : Supports major tokens such as XRP, BTC, ETH, and USDT. 3. Select a plan : Once a contract is selected, the system will begin fully automatic operation. Partial Revenue Plan： Beginner’s Plan: Contract period is 1 day, minimum investment is $15, total return is $15 + $0.6. Basic Plan: The contract period is 6 days, the minimum investment is $600, and the total return is $600 + $47.52. Stable Plan: Contract term is 10 days, minimum investment is $3,000, total return is $3,000 + $426. Premium Plan: Contract term is 28 days, minimum investment is $25,000, total return is $25,000 + $12,250. Click here to select a plan. Check your daily earnings anytime. As American user Eleanor personally experienced: “My stablecoin now has a stable return. Before, it was just sitting there doing nothing, but now it’s ‘producing’ itself, which has completely changed my investment logic.” Eleanor’s experience perfectly illustrates that a higher-level investment logic is taking effect. This is not only an optimization of personal strategy, but also a subtle alignment with the allocation ideas of top Wall Street capital. This reveals a rarely discussed aspect of their strategy: while speculating on price fluctuations through derivatives, they are allocating the “production rights” of cryptocurrency itself as a core real-world asset to capture a fundamental, continuous stream of value. This path is now open to individual investors. Choosing to participate means you are no longer merely a price taker, but can add a more fundamental, productive dimension to your portfolio, just like institutions—perhaps a key step in bringing your strategy closer to “smart money.” Claim your $15 welcome bonus and start your automated wealth future.

This popular idea suggests BTC prices climb to a top and then crash hard once every four years, matching up with its halving events. “Although the outlook is uncertain, we believe the four-year cycle thesis will prove to be incorrect, and that bitcoin’s price will potentially make new highs next year,” analysts at Grayscale wrote . The world’s biggest cryptocurrency has been through rough trading since early October. Prices fell 32% from their highest point through most of November. On Monday, Bitcoin dropped to $84,000 before climbing back to $86,909 by 2:20 a.m. ET Tuesday. Grayscale said investors who hold for the long haul usually see gains, but they have to “stomach sometimes challenging drawdowns” along the way. Price drops of 25% or more happen pretty regularly during bull markets and don’t always signal a long decline is starting, the firm said. Why this cycle looks different The research company laid out several reasons why Bitcoin might break from its usual four-year pattern this time. One big difference: this market run hasn’t seen the explosive price jump that normally shows up before a major reversal. Things also look different now because institutional investors are putting money into exchange-traded products and digital asset treasuries instead of retail buyers trading on regular exchanges, according to the report. Economic conditions look fairly good too, Grayscale noted. Possible rate cuts and bipartisan support for U.S. crypto laws could help prices. Industry leaders agree on bullish outlook Tom Lee, head of research and CIO at Fundstrat Capital, thinks December will be strong for markets. He’s calling for the S&P 500 to potentially reach 7,300 by year-end, a possible 10% gain from current levels. “7,000 is only 2% for S&P. From here, I think 5% or maybe even 10% is possible in December,” he said on CNBC. This comes even after a rocky start to December. Lee pointed to the Federal Reserve ending quantitative tightening as a major boost. “Today is the day that quantitative tightening ends. And as you know, the Fed’s been shrinking its balance sheet since April 2022,” Lee said. He compared things now to September 2019, when markets rallied more than 17% within three weeks after quantitative tightening ended. November’s volatility created a healthy reset in positions, Lee thinks. “And I think many fund managers we talked to in November, in the midst of all that, kind of threw in the towel,” he said. On cryptocurrencies, Lee stays optimistic despite recent disappointments. “Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and crypto have been disappointing because they really took it in the gut in mid-October and then kind of got hit again,” he said. But he thinks the highs aren’t in place yet for Bitcoin or Ethereum, suggesting a recovery could happen alongside equity market gains. Lee expects the Fed’s dovish stance will keep supporting both equities and crypto. “If we have a dovish Fed, that’s really a tailwind,” he said, noting the bond market looks “more dovish than the Fed” right now.

As Bitcoin rallies, traders increasingly look for high-beta infrastructure plays tied directly to $BTC’s success rather than disconnected altcoin narratives. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) introduces the first Bitcoin Layer 2 with SVM integration, aiming to deliver Solana-level performance while anchoring value to Bitcoin security. With SVM-based smart contracts and low-latency execution, Bitcoin Hyper targets wrapped BTC payments, DeFi, NFTs, and gaming as core utility drivers. Bitcoin’s rallies make one thing brutally clear: the base layer is still terrible for everyday usage. When fees spike above $20 and confirmation times stretch, the world’s largest network turns into a settlement chain, not a place for fast payments, DeFi, or gaming. That creates a massive opening. Traders hunting the best crypto to buy ahead of the next Bitcoin wave increasingly look beyond random alt narratives. The real upside, many argue, lies in infrastructure that can scale Bitcoin itself, letting you bet on throughput and programmability without abandoning $BTC as the core asset. That’s the lane Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is targeting: a Bitcoin Layer 2 that bolts Solana-style speed onto Bitcoin’s security. Instead of pitching yet another speculative ecosystem, it offers a direct wager on solving Bitcoin’s oldest pain points – slow transactions, high fees, and limited smart contract functionality. The presale is already underway, so if you want to know ‘ How to Buy Bitcoin Hyper ’, we’ve got you covered. With growing interest from traders and builders, Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself as a high-beta, infrastructure-focused play on the next major Bitcoin cycle, rather than a passing narrative trade. Bitcoin Hyper Turns Bitcoin Into a High-Speed Smart Contract Hub Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) delivers a simple promise for users: keep Bitcoin’s security, gain Solana-like performance. It uses Solana Virtual Machine technology to power a Bitcoin Layer 2, aiming for sub-second confirmation times and low-cost transactions. This means you can move wrapped $BTC through dApps without watching gas eat your margin. For everyday users, that means high-speed payments in wrapped $BTC, on-chain swaps, lending, staking, NFTs, and gaming that actually feel responsive. Developers get an SVM environment with Rust-based tooling and APIs, opening up Solana-style UX while still settling value back to Bitcoin’s battle-tested base layer. Unlike older Bitcoin scaling stacks that lean on slower virtual machines or clunky sidechain UX, Bitcoin Hyper explicitly targets Solana-level throughput and latency. If you want a deeper breakdown, check out our ‘ What is Bitcoin Hyper ’ guide for all the details. Buy $HYPER today for $0.013365 and take advantage of 40% staking rewards. Can $HYPER Ride The Next Bitcoin Cycle? Our experts predict that $HYPER could hit $0.08625 by the end of 2026. If you invested at today’s price, you’re looking at a potential ROI of over 545%. Momentum indicators are already emerging. Smart money is moving. High-net-worth wallets have bought in bulk across the presale, with the two largest buys being $500K and $379.9K . Early whale interest often acts as a signal that some capital is quietly positioning around a new infrastructure narrative before headlines catch up. From here, the bet is straightforward: if Bitcoin Hyper becomes a go-to venue for $BTC-based DeFi, payments, and gaming dApps, the network effect can compound quickly. As more developers ship SVM-based apps anchored to Bitcoin, demand for blockspace and governance exposure flows back into the token. The presale has already raised over $28.8M, showing massive backing and support. Bitcoin Hyper frames itself as a way to front-run the next big Bitcoin story: not ‘digital gold’ this time, but programmable, high-speed Bitcoin. If its SVM-powered Layer 2 gains traction with builders and liquidity, $HYPER could offer one of the cleaner, infrastructure-first ways to express a bullish thesis on Bitcoin scalability. If you’re looking for exposure beyond spot $BTC, but still want your thesis rooted in Bitcoin rather than a random theme coin, Bitcoin Hyper presents a more targeted bet. As always, size positions responsibly, but keep an eye on how quickly users, dApps, and liquidity start to populate this emerging Layer-2. Join the $HYPER presale today. Remember, this isn’t intended as financial advice, and you should always do your own research before investing.

At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $163 billion. TLDR: The crypto market capitalisation rose on Tuesday morning (UTC) by 0.5%; 63 of the top 100 coins and 3 of the top 10 coins have gone up today; BTC increased by 1% to $87,010, and ETH fell by 0.5% to $2,810; The bottom may not be in; ‘The market expects outsized swings as we head into the new year’; There were $1 billion in liquidations in 24 hours; Key factors imply ‘a meaningful probability of sub-$80K BTC to start 2026’; ‘Participants increasingly exit positions at a loss due to fading momentum and deteriorating sentiment’; ‘The marketʼs remaining leverage is relatively well-contained, reducing systemic fragility and improving the prospects for a more stable consolidation phase’; US BTC spot ETFs saw $8.48 million in inflows on 1 December, while ETH spot ETFs recorded $79.06 million in outflows; BitMine bought more ETH during the latest market downturn; Vanguard is opening its brokerage platform to crypto-focused ETFs and mutual funds; Crypto market sentiment has tumbled back into the extreme fear territory. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, 3 of the top 10 coins per market capitalization have seen their prices rise over the past 24 hours, while the rest remained in red. Bitcoin (BTC) appreciated by 1% since this time yesterday, currently trading at $87,010. This is the highest rise in the category. Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Ethereum (ETH) is down by 0.5%, now changing hands at $2,810. Two more coins are green this morning: Solana (SOL) and Binance Coin (BNB) . SOL is up by 0.7% to $127, while BNB appreciated 0.4% to $829. On the other side, the highest drop is 1.1% by XRP , currently standing at $2.02. It’s followed by Dogecoin (DOGE)’s 0.7%, which is now trading at $0.1359. In the top 100 coins, 37 recorded decreases. At the top of the red list we find Canton (CC) . It’s down 7.8% to the price of $0.07674. Zcash (ZEC) follows with a 7.5% decrease to the price of $332. On the green side, two coins saw double-digit increases. Rain (RAIN) is up 14.4%, now trading at $0.008129. Provenance Blockchain (HASH) appreciated 10.8% to $0.02348. Meanwhile, some of the latest economic data in the US suggest a softer tone , which has boosted expectations that the Federal Reserve is approaching a turn in policy. Market participants are awaiting a fresh batch of economic data releases this week and any comment by the Federal Reserve that would indicate its direction. Source: US Federal Reserve ‘Meaningful Probability of Sub-$80K BTC to Start 2026’ Nick Forster, Founder at onchain options platform Derive.xyz , commented that markets plunged overnight. This happened as global liquidity tightened and confidence in crypto deteriorated further following the Yearn hack.” Moreover, global risk assets were hit by the Bank of Japan’s signal that it may raise rates. This increased fears that liquidity could dry up. The market saw almost $1 billion in liquidations in 24 hours, with $400 million in BTC wiped out and $240 million in ETH perps liquidated. “Volatility surged in response,” Forster says, and skew collapsed. “The move reflects aggressive demand for downside protection as traders reposition for further weakness.” “Skew’s sharp step lower shows traders stacking puts, especially into the December 26 expiry, where open interest has concentrated at the $84K and $80K strikes. That positioning implies a meaningful probability of sub-$80K BTC to start 2026.” He concluded that “I don’t believe the bottom is in. Short-dated volatility now sits above long-dated BTC volatility, signalling that the market expects outsized swings as we head into the new year.” Moreover, Bitfinex analysts found that the scale of the losses surpasses the realised-loss waves seen at the two major lows earlier in the current cycle, notably during August 2024 and April 2025. This signals “a more pronounced erosion of confidence.” “Such heavy loss realisation is characteristic of a market under stress, and one actively seeking liquidity as participants increasingly exit positions at a loss due to fading momentum and deteriorating sentiment,” the analysts argue. They noted that these spikes in realised losses historically tend to occur near the later stages of corrective phases, as price drops flush out weaker hands before stability can be restored. “The market is now operating on a leaner leverage base, which reduces the likelihood of sudden, liquidation-driven volatility and reflects a more cautious, defensive stance across futures markets,” they said and added that “the marketʼs remaining leverage is relatively well-contained, reducing systemic fragility and improving the prospects for a more stable consolidation phase.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Tuesday morning, BTC stood at $87,010. The coin initially fell from the $86,800 level to the intraday low of $83,989. It subsequently and gradually increased to the intraday high of $87,155. Over the past week, the price fell by 1.3%, trading in the $84,553–$92,346 range. Should BTC continue rising, it could take back the $90,000 mark. This would open doors for a push to $97,000 and $100,000. On the other hand, a drop would lead below $83,000. Ethereum is currently changing hands at $2,810. It plunged from the day’s high of $2,844 to the low of $2,724. It has recovered to the current price since. It decreased by 4.3% in a week, trading between $2,736 and $3,072 over the past week. The price may now move below the $2,700 level and towards $2,500. If the tides turn, ETH has a chance to reclaim the $3,000 mark, followed by $3,130. Ethereum (ETH) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Meanwhile, after standing unchanged for three days, the crypto market sentiment has tumbled back into the extreme fear territory. The crypto fear and greed index stands at 16 today , compared to 20 yesterday. Market participants are getting more concerned about the market’s immediate trajectory. “Macro uncertainty continues to dominate. A BOJ tightening, ambiguity around a U.S. Fed cut, and softening demand from DATs like STRAT all weigh on sentiment,” Nick Forster said. ETFs Start December With Mixed Picture The US markets were closed on Thursday for the country’s Thanksgiving holiday, then worked shorter on Friday. On Monday, 1 December, the US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw inflows of $8.48 million . This hasn’t done much to change the total net inflow of $57.71 billion. Two of the 12 BTC ETFs recorded inflows, and one saw outflows. Fidelity added $67.02 million, while Ark&21Shares added $7.38 million. At the same time, BlackRock recorded outflows for the second day in a row of $65.92 million. Moreover, the US ETH ETFs broke the positive flows streak on the first day of this month, letting go of $79.06 million on Monday. With this, the total net inflow pulled back to $12.87 billion. One of the nine funds recorded inflows, and four saw outflows. BlackRock is the only green company on this list, adding $26.65 million. At the same time, Grayscale saw $49.79 million in outflows, followed by Fidelity’s $31.62 million. Meanwhile, Vanguard , the world’s second-largest asset manager, is opening its brokerage platform to crypto-focused ETFs and mutual funds. Starting Tuesday, the firm will let clients trade third-party funds that primarily hold cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, XRP, and SOL. According to Bloomberg, Vanguard will begin allowing ETFs and mutual funds that primarily hold Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, and other cryptocurrencies to trade on its platform starting December 2, 2025, ending its long-standing stance against supporting crypto products. Vanguard… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 1, 2025 Moreover, BitMine Immersion Technologies bought more ETH during the latest market downturn, adding nearly $70 million worth of the coin in three days. The company says it now holds around 3.7 million ETH at an average cost of $3,008 per token. It seems that Tom Lee( @fundstrat )'s #Bitmine just bought another 7,080 $ETH ($19.8M) 2 hours ago. https://t.co/yZbTCFm9GT pic.twitter.com/JHb3WYDa0a — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 2, 2025 Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? The crypto market has posted a small increase over the past 24 hours, while the US stock market closed the first session of this month lower. By the closing time on 1 December, the S&P 500 was down by 0.53%, the Nasdaq-100 decreased by 0.36%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.9%. Investors’ concerns about valuations of big tech firms and spending on AI is still quite high. Is this rally sustainable? This is not a rally, as the market barely moved today. What’s more, since the month began, the market is actually moving in a very tight range. While it may decrease in the short-term, analysts argue that it also has room to grow more.

This global consortium of institutional and crypto-native investors reflects growing conviction in regulated tokenization as the next major phase of digital asset adoption. The round follows OpenEden’s earlier fundraising with Yzi Labs in 2024 and will support the company’s expansion of its end-to-end tokenization-as-a-service infrastructure, enabling institutions, fintechs, and protocols to issue and manage regulated tokenized financial products. Institutional Backing for a Growing RWA Leader OpenEden’s strategic round secured investors spanning blockchain networks, trading firms, venture funds, and institutional infrastructure providers across North America, Europe, and Asia. The diversity of backers highlights OpenEden’s position as one of the most credible players in regulated RWA tokenization. “The growth of OpenEden mirrors the broader transformation we’re seeing in the RWA sector,” said Jeremy Ng, Founder and CEO of OpenEden. “As tokenization scales in adoption, institutions and protocols are seeking trusted, compliant infrastructure to bring traditional assets on-chain. This funding round boosts our capacity to provide regulated, market-ready products that fit both traditional and decentralized finance standards.” A Breakout Year for Tokenized Treasuries and Stablecoins Real-world assets have been one of the fastest-growing segments in crypto. In 2025, both tokenized RWAs and tokenized Treasuries doubled in market size, fueled by institutions seeking greater on-chain exposure. OpenEden has been a central contributor to this growth. Its flagship TBILL Fund — one of the earliest tokenized U.S. Treasuries products — has seen its peak AUM grow more than tenfold in under two years. The fund also received an investment-grade ‘AA+f/S1+’ rating from S&P Global, adding to its existing ‘A’ rating from Moody’s. The fund’s institutional profile was further strengthened after The Bank of New York (BNY) was appointed custodian and investment manager for its underlying Treasury assets. This institutional-grade foundation has directly supported the adoption of USDO, OpenEden’s regulated, yield-bearing stablecoin fully backed by tokenized Treasuries. USDO is now integrated across major DEXs, lending markets, yield protocols, and payment gateways. Meanwhile, cUSDO, USDO’s wrapped variant, became the first yield-bearing digital asset approved as off-exchange collateral on Binance, enabling institutional users to earn yield through off-exchange custody, while retaining full trading access on the exchange. Fueling the Next Phase of Tokenized Finance With its new strategic round, OpenEden plans to accelerate the rollout of several new institutional-grade tokenized products . These include: A tokenized Short-Duration Global High-Yield Bond Fund, developed with a leading global asset manager A multi-strategy yield token Tokenized structured products, replicating traditional payoff profiles on-chain Additionally, OpenEden will expand USDO’s integration into both consumer and institutional payment networks, and build a multi-currency stablecoin framework, as well as a cross-border stablecoin settlement network. These initiatives tie into OpenEden’s mission to deliver a regulated and composable infrastructure layer for the global tokenization market, enabling any institution, fintech, or developer to launch, integrate, and distribute tokenized products with regulatory safeguards. Industry Leaders Weigh In OpenEden’s focus on compliance and institutional trust has resonated strongly with investors. Markus Infanger, SVP of RippleX, said, “As regulated financial assets move onchain, institutional investors are looking for products that offer compliance, reliability, and the same controls they expect in traditional markets. OpenEden has shown a disciplined approach to how they operate, and we are pleased to support their growth as assets like tokenized T-bills emerge as practical ways for institutions to begin engaging with onchain markets.” Nathan McCauley, Co-Founder and CEO of Anchorage Digital, said, “RWAs are gaining strong institutional interest, and OpenEden is building the kind of platform the market needs right now—expanding access to tokenized financial products with a focus on trust and security. We’re excited to support projects like OpenEden that are driving the onchain ecosystem forward and creating pathways for more institutions to participate.”",Industry Thoughts,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-02 11:52:06

The company recently disclosed holdings worth $72.25 million in BTC, a figure that represents a jaw-dropping 83% of its total market capitalization. This isn’t just a portfolio diversification tactic; it’s a core strategic bet on the future of finance. What Does This Massive Bitcoin Investment Mean? Hyperscale Data’s disclosure, accurate as of December 2nd, sends a powerful signal to the market. For a publicly traded company to tie the vast majority of its value to a single volatile asset is unprecedented in traditional finance. However, it reflects a calculated shift in how some forward-thinking firms view treasury management. This Bitcoin investment strategy transforms the company’s balance sheet into a direct proxy for Bitcoin’s performance. Why Would a Company Bet So Heavily on Bitcoin? The rationale behind such a concentrated Bitcoin investment is multifaceted. Firstly, it acts as a potent hedge against currency debasement and inflation, a concern for many corporations. Secondly, it positions the company at the forefront of the digital asset revolution, potentially attracting investors who share this vision. Most compellingly, Hyperscale Data has publicly stated its ambition: to accumulate Bitcoin holdings equivalent to 100% of its market value. This isn’t a tentative experiment; it’s a full-scale commitment. Let’s break down the potential benefits and inherent challenges of this approach: Potential Upside: Direct exposure to Bitcoin’s historical long-term appreciation. Brand Positioning: Establishes the company as a crypto-native leader. Investor Appeal: May attract a new class of crypto-focused shareholders. Volatility Risk: Quarterly earnings will be heavily influenced by BTC price swings. Regulatory Scrutiny: Such a large allocation may draw attention from regulators. Market Perception: Traditional investors may view the strategy as overly risky. Is This a New Trend in Corporate Strategy? While companies like MicroStrategy pioneered the concept of a corporate Bitcoin investment as a treasury reserve asset, Hyperscale Data takes the concept further. Allocating 83% of market cap is a more aggressive stance, blurring the line between an operating company and a dedicated investment vehicle. This move could inspire other firms, especially in the tech and data sectors, to consider similar, albeit perhaps less concentrated, allocations. It raises a critical question: are we witnessing the early stages of a fundamental change in how companies store value? Actionable Insights for Observers For investors and market watchers, Hyperscale Data’s strategy offers key lessons. It demonstrates a high-conviction, long-term belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition beyond mere speculation. Monitoring the company’s progress toward its 100% goal will provide real-world data on the viability of such an extreme allocation. Furthermore, its stock performance relative to Bitcoin’s price will become a fascinating case study in crypto-correlated equities. In conclusion, Hyperscale Data’s $72.3 million Bitcoin investment is a landmark event in institutional crypto adoption. It represents a bold, all-in bet that challenges conventional corporate finance wisdom. Whether this strategy leads to spectacular success or serves as a cautionary tale, it undeniably marks a significant moment where a traditional market entity has chosen to deeply intertwine its fate with the future of cryptocurrency. The financial world will be watching closely. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Hyperscale Data’s ticker symbol? Hyperscale Data trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol GPUS . How much Bitcoin does Hyperscale Data own exactly? As of its December 2nd disclosure, the company holds Bitcoin valued at $72.25 million . What does “83% of market cap” mean? It means the total value of the company’s Bitcoin holdings is equal to 83% of the total market value of all its outstanding shares. If the company is worth $100 million on paper, $83 million of that value is in BTC. What is the company’s ultimate goal with Bitcoin? Hyperscale Data has stated its intention to accumulate Bitcoin equal to 100% of its market capitalization , making its treasury its primary asset. Is it risky for a company to hold so much Bitcoin? Yes, it introduces significant volatility risk. The company’s reported financial results and share price will likely experience greater fluctuations tied directly to the price of Bitcoin. Are other companies doing this? Yes, but rarely to this degree. Companies like MicroStrategy hold large Bitcoin treasuries, but Hyperscale Data’s 83% allocation relative to its size is exceptionally high.

The market's response has been subdued, yet signs of gradual momentum are emerging. Discover which digital currencies are poised for growth as the landscape begins to shift. Stellar (XLM) Shows Signs of Recovery Amidst Market Fluctuations Source: tradingview Stellar (XLM) is currently trading within a range of 23 to 26 cents. The coin has faced a tough month, dropping nearly 23%. In the past week, it also slipped by nearly 8%. However, it hovers close to its support level of 23 cents. If momentum picks up, it could break through resistance at 27 cents. From roughly 23 cents, this would mean a 17% rise. Another push might even see it approach 29 cents, adding around 26% from its lower range. While the path shows potential for gains, recent trends highlight a challenging environment. Stellar's indicators hint at possible movement but a cautious approach might be wise. Conclusion The launch of the new SDK hasn't caused a big market reaction for XLM. However, gradual growth in interest and use could be seen. While the immediate impact is small, this gradual build shows promise. XLM's development and potential use cases could lead to increased adoption over time. The muted response may change as more integrate and benefit from these updates.

At the end of November, the GameFi sector experienced a temporary bullish spell that saw its market capitalization rise by 7% in 2 weeks, approaching $10 billion, while trading volume surged 103% to reach $6.1 billion. The rally was rather short-lived, capped by a correction on December 1 that pushed the industry’s market value below $9 billion for the first time in over a year, according to CoinMarketCap charts. The decline comes amid a crypto winter that has failed to translate partnership announcements and platform developments into meaningful trading volumes. Web3 gaming is one of the most hyped segments of the blockchain industry that has been struggling to maintain relevance since its inception. Few tokens record over 30% profits, losses are heavier Only a few tokens survived the piercing breeze of the winter market in December, including the Game Company (GMRT) with a 142% increase, followed by Echelon Prime (PRIME) at 44.4%, Veracity (VRA) at 25.06%, and VisionGame (VISION) with a 20.45% uptick. Conversely, Web3 gaming tokens that recorded steep losses in the last 24 hours are My Lovely Planet (MLC) and CateCoin (CATE), which fell in value by 22% and 20% respectively. According to CoinMarketCap’s end-of-November report, GameFi landed at number 16 on DeFiLlama’s narrative tracker, a weakening influence compared to previous months, despite most DeFi markets having recorded positive inflows from the start of the second half of 2025. Amid the market downturn, several companies within the Web3 gaming ecosystem announced strategic partnerships last month. Cryptopolitan had reported on November 27 on Pi Network’s collaboration with CiDi Games to expand the real-world utility of its native Pi token. CiDi Games mentioned that the partnership plans to turn Pi into a payment medium for in-game purchases while scaling the blockchain’s gaming infrastructure. On the same day, EdgeAI Labs unveiled its partnership with PumpGame, previously known as SuiGame, to complete a brand upgrade and migrate its platform from the Sui blockchain to BNB Chain (BSC). Despite these partnerships and institutional ventures, Web3 gaming tokens are in an overall downturn, which is extending the gap between hype and actual market adoption. While companies like Pi Network, EdgeAI Labs, and Animoca Brands are trying to innovate and expand the market, developments have not yet offset declining investor confidence. Sentiment in the GameFi ecosystem is subdued, marked by subdued conversations on Crypto Twitter and some of the lowest enthusiasm levels in the last five years. Much of the Web3 gaming audience use these platforms for speculative purposes rather than their gameplay. This has led to at least 27 studios shutting down between January and October this year. Here’s the list of crypto games and studios That shut down in 2025 • Battlebound / Anterris • Blade of God • Blast Royale • Champions Ascension • Derby Race • Ember Sword • Goombles • JungleXYZ • Kryptomon • Hello Monster • Loot Legends • Metalcore • Mystery… — StarPlatinum (@StarPlatinum_) October 30, 2025 Venture capital interest has also cooled, with funding for new Web3 gaming initiatives drying up compared to previous cycles. It would take the intervention of triple-A gaming publishers’ interest in Web3 games, together with more funds, to revive Web3 games to levels the industry would consider unmissable. Animoca Brands branches into real-world asset tokenization While the gaming sector struggles, Hong Kong-based Web3 company Animoca Brands has signed a memorandum of understanding with Rayls to branch into tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs). Animoca Brands will use its network to identify asset classes and issuers suitable for tokenization on Rayls’ infrastructure. According to a press statement released by Animoca, chain-agnostic vault marketplace NUVA will distribute Rayls-tokenized assets, with Rayls providing technology, cross-chain bridges, and settlement infrastructure. “Now more than ever, institutional adoption is increasingly important to provide stability and reliability within crypto,” CEO of Rayls’ core developer Parfin Marcos Viriato noted. Animoca Brands’ Chief Strategy Officer Keyvan Peymani told CNBC the company also plans to launch its stablecoin, accompanied by an RWA marketplace in 2026. In August, the firm established a joint venture with Standard Chartered and Hong Kong Telecommunications named Anchorpoint Financial to apply for a stablecoin license from the Hong Kong authorities.

Full Price Analysis & Next Targets,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/12/solana-sol-bottom-finally-in-full-price-analysis-next-targets,"The $SOL price descended to $123, a slightly higher level than what could have been the bottom at $121. A potential double bottom here could signal that the swing low is now in place, and that the next big rally to the upside can now begin. $SOL price finds a double bottom? Source: TradingView The 4-hour time frame for $SOL shows that the price has been traversing inside a descending channel, forcing the price lower as it goes. However, that channel has now met with what could be the superior force of a major ascending trendline, plus a very strong horizontal support level. It can be observed that currently the price is battling to get back above these two major supports. With the Stochastic RSI indicators heading back to the top, signalling upside price momentum, it shouldn’t be too much of a problem for the price to regain these supports. $SOL next price targets Source: TradingView The daily chart gives more of a high time frame perspective, and enables one to see where the price could be going if a bottom has been found. Once, and of course, if, the $SOL price is able to consolidate above the major supports, the next targets would be in this order: the resistance at $142, the top of the descending channel, the $156 horizontal resistance, and then a higher high at $172 which would confirm a change in trend. At the bottom of the chart, the RSI indicator can be seen to have broken through the downtrend and is potentially testing and confirming this breakout. If this happens, it would be expected that the price action above would follow this lead and rally up. $SOL hugely bullish in weekly chart Source: TradingView The weekly view for the $SOL price looks very bullish indeed. The $126 horizontal support level is incredibly strong, and the fact that the price has met with this level at the same time as the major ascending trendline would point heavily towards a big bounce from here. Casting one’s eye down to the Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart totally reinforces this view. This indicator on the weekly time frame is very powerful, and it reveals that the indicator lines are at the bottom and ripe for a cross back to the upside. If one also takes into consideration that the 2-week Stochastic RSI indicators are coming down fast, and are likely to bottom in the next week or so, huge upside price momentum may not be too far off. If the $SOL price can set a higher high at the $175 level, as already mentioned, the macro swing high at $253 would be next. Stand by for a possible major eruption in the $SOL price.

This move has triggered considerable excitement in the crypto space. Could this approval propel LINK to a significant price surge? The article delves into potential growth coins and explores if LINK is set to make a remarkable upward move. Chainlink Edges Higher Amid Market Volatility Source: tradingview Chainlink (LINK) is navigating a price range between around $12.30 and $13.60. Despite recent setbacks, such as a nearly 29% drop over the past month, LINK is showing a slight upward momentum. The current support stands at about $11.70, offering a safety net, while the nearest hurdle is near $14.20. If it breaches this point, the next goal lies just above $15.40. This indicates a potential price increase of over 13% if it climbs from its current range to this next resistance level. However, with its relative strength sitting at a neutral 51.58, LINK seems poised for a gradual recovery rather than explosive growth in the coming weeks. Conclusion The approval of the Chainlink ETF might boost LINK's standing in the market. High interest in the token could lead to a surge in its value. With growing momentum, there is potential for LINK to reach toward $30. Investors' interest and market performance will be key factors.

You Need to See This,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-etf-volume-explodes-you-need-to-see-this/,"Trading for XRP just gained a powerful jolt. In the early hours of U.S. ETF trading, the new XRP ETFs booked a flurry of activity that grabbed attention — and may yet reshape market dynamics. In a post on X, Diana flagged a standout moment: combined XRP ETF volume had surged to $23.6 million within only three hours. That figure alone triggered renewed industry scrutiny of how these funds are influencing overall XRP liquidity and broader institutional interest. A Strong Debut The initial emergence of U.S.-listed XRP ETFs has already carried weight . On their first trading day, combined volume across the new funds hit around $85.7 million — one of the largest first-day totals seen among 2025’s ETF launches. Within that aggregate, distribution was uneven. The top-performing fund accounted for roughly $36.6 million, while another contributed the $23.6 million that matches the three-hour burst Diana observed. 𝐔𝐏𝐃𝐀𝐓𝐄: 𝐗𝐑𝐏 𝐄𝐓𝐅 𝐕𝐎𝐋𝐔𝐌𝐄 𝐄𝐗𝐏𝐋𝐎𝐃𝐄𝐒 𝐓𝐎 $𝟐𝟑.𝟔𝐌 — 𝐈𝐍 𝐎𝐍𝐋𝐘 𝟑 𝐇𝐎𝐔𝐑𝐒 We’re barely halfway through the session and combined $XRP ETF volume has already hit $𝟐𝟑.𝟔𝐌, even though the market is down. At this pace, a $𝟒𝟎–𝟓𝟎𝐌+ day is… pic.twitter.com/jonZ4svAfU — Diana (@InvestWithD) December 1, 2025 Thus, the $23.6 M three-hour volume fits cleanly within the broader pattern of early demand — not an isolated blip. Why It Matters: Liquidity, Price Pressure, and Institutional Signaling High ETF volume , especially in a concentrated burst, can reduce available spot liquidity. Large ETF trades may pull heavily from the bid‑ask order books, thinning sell‑side depth. In markets with thinner order books, large volume spikes tend to magnify price swings. That dynamic means even if spot XRP markets are weak, heavy ETF activity alone can create asymmetric pressure — possibly tightening spreads or causing short-term price distortions. For institutions and asset allocators, the volume signals serious intent. With ETFs, they gain regulated exposure to XRP without navigating direct custody or exchange-based crypto storage. The early surge in volume underscores demand for such vehicles. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What Could Come Next If the current pace holds — or intensifies — a $40–50 million day across XRP ETFs is now within reach. That would rank among the highest-volume days since launch and could test the resilience of liquidity providers and market-making desks. However, sustainability matters more than the spike. If inflows slow down, ETFs may redistribute existing XRP liquidity, resulting in limited long‑term price impact. On the other hand, persistent high volume could compress sell liquidity and amplify future rallies or drawdowns. Traders and analysts should therefore monitor volume-to-order-book ratios, intraday flow persistence, and changes in ETF holdings/AUM over the coming days. In conclusion, Diana’s observation of a $23.6 million surge in volume over three hours was not hype — it reflected a real and material wave of demand for XRP exposure. Coupled with a heavy first-day total and institutional interest, it underscores how XRP ETFs may now play a substantial role in shaping both liquidity and price dynamics. What happens next will depend on whether the flows ebb or continue. Either way, the era of “XRP via ETFs” appears to have truly begun.

However, right now, it is trading around $84,000, causing investors to look elsewhere for rewarding crypto investment opportunities. One name that is repeatedly coming up among investor and trader discussions on the best crypto to buy now is Remittix, a new PayFi altcoin on Ethereum that has been demonstrating incredible performance and momentum. Best Crypto To Buy Now: Bitcoin Breaks Its Trendline As Sentiment Turns Cautious After the major market decline in October, Bitcoin looked like it was finally starting to make a positive comeback. Price action was majorly positive in November, and experts expected that trend to continue. However, in a move that has shocked many analysts, Bitcoin has declined sharply again, with the price falling from over $91,000 to around $84,000 just within the past 24 hours. There are some claims that the Bitcoin price is currently being manipulated by institutions for bigger rewards, especially since ETF inflows look to be increasing. However, it should be said that it is all still speculation since there is nothing concrete yet. Meanwhile, analysts are no longer looking at Bitcoin as the best crypto to buy now. In fact, there are speculations that the BTC price could fall further. Technical analysis suggests that if Bitcoin manages to keep its token price above the $84,000 support level, then this could form the foundation it needs to start a recovery run. But if this support fails, then we might see a further drop to the $79,000 price level. Smart Money Backs Remittix As The Best Crypto To Buy Now While speculations about what the future holds for Bitcoin continue, on-chain analysis reveals that experts have already chosen their recommendation for the best crypto to buy now, and it is Remittix.

Analysts believe that Bitcoin still has a very important role to play, so even though the price is bearish now, it can still recover well.

Why is Remittix the best crypto to buy now? According to experts, Remittix is the best crypto to buy now because it offers genuine real-world utility combined with high momentum and global adoption. Remittix also has strong CEX listings and a mobile wallet on the App Store that should increase institutional and retail adoption. How important is a CertiK audit for an upcoming altcoin?

This vision is now a reality in Nigeria, as stablecoin payment firm RedotPay launches a groundbreaking crypto cash-out service powered by Ripple’s technology. This partnership marks a significant leap forward for financial inclusion and cryptocurrency utility in one of Africa’s largest economies. What Is This New Crypto Cash-Out Service? RedotPay, in collaboration with Ripple, has introduced a seamless platform built on Ripple Payments. This service allows Nigerian users to effortlessly swap popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), USD Coin (USDC), and Ripple’s native XRP for the Nigerian Naira. The converted funds deposit directly into the user’s linked bank account, bypassing traditional, often cumbersome, exchange processes. This initiative directly addresses a critical need for reliable off-ramps—services that convert crypto to fiat currency. For Nigeria’s vast and tech-savvy population engaged in the digital economy, a trustworthy crypto cash-out service is a game-changer. Why Is This Launch a Big Deal for Nigeria? Nigeria stands as a global leader in cryptocurrency adoption. However, users frequently face challenges when trying to access the real-world value of their digital assets. This new service tackles those pain points head-on. Speed and Efficiency: Leveraging Ripple’s blockchain technology, transactions are designed for speed, potentially reducing wait times from days to minutes. Enhanced Accessibility: It simplifies the process for everyday users, not just crypto experts. Financial Inclusion: It provides an alternative financial gateway, especially for those underbanked by traditional systems. Market Confidence: Partnerships with established names like Ripple can boost trust in crypto services. Therefore, this launch is more than a new product; it’s a vital piece of infrastructure for Nigeria’s digital finance ecosystem. How Does the Ripple-Powered Service Work? Understanding the mechanics helps users grasp the innovation. The process is streamlined for user convenience: A user initiates a withdrawal on the RedotPay platform, selecting their cryptocurrency (e.g., BTC, USDC, XRP). RedotPay’s system, integrated with Ripple Payments , facilitates the secure swap and currency conversion. The equivalent value in Nigerian Naira is calculated at a transparent rate. Funds are routed and deposited directly into the user’s pre-verified Nigerian bank account. This end-to-end integration removes the need for multiple intermediaries, which often increases cost and complexity. The focus is on creating a smooth, reliable crypto cash-out service experience. What Are the Potential Challenges? While promising, the service will navigate a complex landscape. Regulatory clarity around cryptocurrencies in Nigeria continues to evolve. The success of this crypto cash-out service will depend on: Regulatory Harmony: Operating within the guidelines of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and other financial authorities. Naira Stability: Managing conversions amidst local currency volatility. Market Adoption: Convincing a broad user base to trust and utilize the new platform. Technical Reliability: Ensuring consistent uptime and security against digital threats. Overcoming these hurdles is crucial for long-term, sustainable growth. A Compelling Step for Crypto’s Real-World Use The collaboration between RedotPay and Ripple is a powerful example of blockchain technology solving real-world problems. It moves cryptocurrency beyond trading and speculation into practical, everyday financial utility. For the Nigerian market, it represents a bridge between the innovative digital asset space and the established financial system. This service could set a precedent for similar rollouts across Africa and other emerging markets. It demonstrates how strategic partnerships can unlock cryptocurrency’s potential for payments and remittances on a massive scale.

According to a recent Wall Street Journal report, this crypto market plunges event is driven by a broader sell-off in high-risk assets across financial markets. Unlike previous crashes triggered by specific industry scandals, this decline presents unique characteristics that every investor should understand. What’s Driving the Current Crypto Market Plunge? The Wall Street Journal highlights that investors are actively reducing their exposure to risk assets amid growing economic uncertainty. Patrick Horsman, Chief Investment Officer of Nasdaq-listed BNB Plus, explains that this pessimistic outlook is causing significant pressure on cryptocurrency valuations. He suggests Bitcoin could potentially decline further to the $60,000 level if current trends continue. This situation differs markedly from previous bear markets in several key ways: No major exchange collapses triggering the downturn Broader market sentiment rather than industry-specific issues Institutional behavior changes affecting price movements How Are Institutional Players Reacting? The WSJ report reveals concerning developments among institutional cryptocurrency holders. MicroStrategy, known for its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy using convertible notes, has for the first time signaled the possibility of selling its BTC holdings. This represents a significant shift in sentiment among major corporate holders. When companies like MicroStrategy consider selling their cryptocurrency reserves, it creates additional downward pressure on the entire market. The report warns that the crypto market plunges could intensify if the net asset value of companies holding digital assets continues to decline. Shares of these related firms have already experienced substantial drops, reflecting investor concerns about their cryptocurrency exposure. Why Is This Downturn Different From Previous Crashes? Patrick Horsman emphasizes a crucial distinction between current conditions and past cryptocurrency bear markets. Previous downturns were often triggered by specific catastrophic events within the industry itself, such as: Large-scale fraud incidents Major exchange failures Regulatory crackdowns on specific platforms In contrast, the current crypto market plunges appears to be driven by broader macroeconomic factors and shifting risk appetites across all financial markets. This means the recovery path might follow different patterns than previous cycles, potentially requiring different investment strategies. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? For individual and institutional investors alike, understanding the nature of this downturn is essential for making informed decisions. The fact that this crypto market plunges event isn’t tied to industry-specific scandals could actually be a positive sign for long-term health, suggesting the market is maturing and becoming more integrated with traditional finance. However, the potential for further declines remains real, especially if: Economic conditions continue to deteriorate Institutional holders begin liquidating positions Risk aversion spreads throughout global markets Monitoring companies like MicroStrategy and their Bitcoin strategies will provide important signals about institutional sentiment and potential market direction. Navigating the Current Crypto Market Environment The current crypto market plunges presents both challenges and opportunities. While price declines can be unsettling, they also create potential entry points for long-term investors who believe in cryptocurrency’s fundamental value proposition. The key is to understand what’s driving the movement and position accordingly. Unlike past crashes where the problems were internal to cryptocurrency ecosystems, today’s downturn reflects cryptocurrency’s growing integration with global financial markets. This maturation brings both increased volatility during broader market stress and greater legitimacy as an asset class. Frequently Asked Questions What’s causing the current crypto market decline? The decline is primarily driven by a broader sell-off in high-risk assets across financial markets, as investors reduce risk exposure amid economic uncertainty, rather than specific cryptocurrency industry problems. How low could Bitcoin prices go according to analysts? Patrick Horsman of BNB Plus suggests Bitcoin could potentially decline to $60,000 if current market conditions persist, though this represents one analyst’s perspective rather than a certainty. Why is this downturn different from previous crypto crashes? Previous crashes were often triggered by industry-specific events like exchange failures or fraud scandals. The current decline is tied to broader macroeconomic factors affecting all risk assets. What does MicroStrategy’s potential Bitcoin sale indicate? MicroStrategy signaling possible Bitcoin sales represents a shift in institutional sentiment and could create additional selling pressure if other corporate holders follow suit. Should investors be worried about this market decline? While declines are never comfortable, the fact that this isn’t driven by industry scandals suggests cryptocurrency markets are maturing. Investors should assess their risk tolerance and investment horizon rather than reacting to short-term volatility. How can investors protect themselves during market downturns? Diversification, understanding investment time horizons, avoiding over-leverage, and focusing on fundamental value rather than short-term price movements can help investors navigate volatile periods.

Spreading accurate information helps everyone make better decisions during volatile market conditions.

55249967,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=871258,1764677738,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55249967.jpeg,"South Korea ramps up regulatory campaign, AML crackdown on crypto sector",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/south-korea-aml-crackdown-penalties/,"South Korea is reconsidering its approach to digital asset governance after a series of high-profile data hacks and compliance breaches in its rapidly growing crypto market. Authorities suspect the North Korea-linked hacking group Lazarus is behind the $32 million theft on South Korea’s largest crypto exchange, Upbit, on November 28. It’s the second time the group has hacked Upbit, making off with approximately $41 million in 2019. The hack comes as regulators from the Financial Services Commission (FSC) prepare for the most aggressive anti-money laundering (AML) reforms since 2008. Korean officials have been warning that criminals are exploiting loopholes faster than regulars can close them. The overarching concern is that crypto is being used to evade taxes, launder funds, and move money beyond regulatory visibility. “President Lee Jae Myung’s administration is taking a more aggressive approach to digital asset rules,” said So-Ye Yoon, who is a finance attorney at Dentons Lee law firm in Seoul. “Regulators appear intent on bringing virtual asset providers under tighter control in line with the administration.” Millions of violations found South Korea’s AML watchdog is preparing to sanction several major cryptocurrency exchanges after uncovering extensive lapses in AML safeguards. The Korean Financial Intelligence Unit (KoFIU) said it spent 18 months conducting on-site inspections at the country’s largest platforms and found millions of compliance failures. Dunamu, the operator of Upbit, faces one of the heaviest penalties. On November 7, it was slapped with an unprecedented $25 million fine tied to 8.6 million violations of transaction reporting rules. KoFIU also identified 5.3 million shortcomings in customer due diligence checks, 3.3 million cases in which trading was allowed to continue before verification was complete, and 15 missed reports of suspicious activity. KoFIU said other large exchanges recorded similar deficiencies and may also face penalties as the regulator moves to tighten oversight of the virtual asset sector. Inspection gray zone So-Ye Yoon said recent inspections on VASPs are the first time KoFIU has carried out large-scale onsite inspections. “These inspections would be routine for traditional financial institutions, but Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) aren’t treated as traditional financial institutions under the current regulatory regime,” said So-Ye. According to So-Ye Yoon, it could signal a broader attempt to align crypto trading platforms with the governance and risk-control obligations by banks and securities firms. Travel rule loopholes South Korea also moved to close what officials described as one of the most exploited gaps in its system. It’s a loophole that has allowed criminals to break up transfers below one million won to avoid identity checks. The government said it would now require identity verification for every crypto transaction, no matter how small, effectively ending the anonymity of micro-transfers. KoFIU officials will also gain the power to freeze accounts before court approval when they suspect funds are linked to serious crimes. It’s a measure the government argues is needed to curb illicit money from vanishing across borders in seconds. As part of the overhaul, South Korea plans to block access to what it calls “high-risk” overseas crypto exchanges. On November 28, FSC Chairperson Lee Ok-won said domestic rules have little effect if users can shift assets to platforms operating outside the country’s regulatory reach. Regulators turn scrutiny on self-custody Dr Deokyoon Ko, CEO of blockchain startup Nonce Lab, said real name checks, the Travel Rule, and round-the-clock monitoring are raising the bar to entry. The latest cyberattack adds new pressure on an industry under heightened scrutiny. AML obligations for VASPs have become significantly stricter to the point where compliance costs are squeezing out smaller exchanges, said Dr Ko. “Rather than avoiding crypto entirely, many Korean users are turning to self custody as a way to retain sovereignty over their assets without being bound by centralized compliance burdens.” But Korea’s national tax agency is planning to conduct home searches for users suspected of hiding crypto assets offline. Korean authorities are treating offline storage, traditionally seen as “safe”, from seizure as an accessible target in enforcement. South Korea’s main financial regulator, the FSC, is undertaking an ambitious internal reorganization. It is planning to reshuffle staff and adjust its internal structure to improve operational efficiency, particularly around virtual asset providers. The FSC is in charge of market stability, advancing South Korea’s financial policy, and directs the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS). In September, it narrowly survived the Lee administration’s push to consolidate the FSC and FSS after criticizing a lack of transparency in Korea’s stock markets. According to local reports, the FSC said its workload has increased while budget restrictions prevent it from hiring new staff. The review, scheduled for completion in April next year, will redesign its structure and reallocate staff in a bid to do more with less. More specifically, it plans to streamline operations, shift responsibilities and reorganize departments to improve oversight. “The FSC has around 342 staff members. It’s relatively small for an agency in charge of policy and they have to deal with all these issues too,” said So-Ye Yoon, finance attorney at Dentons Lee law firm in Seoul. For Seoul, the message is clear: digital assets are no longer just a financial product, but a matter of national security that the government can no longer leave unguarded.

(DFDV) strengthened its Solana-focused strategy by integrating Harmonic’s open block-building framework into its validator operations. The company aims to boost validator revenue, improve operational control, and reinforce Solana’s decentralization. Harmonic Brings Competition and Control to Solana Validators According to the press release , Harmonic offers validators multiple block options each slot. DFDV can now select higher-value blocks, which improves validator rewards. Additionally, the system gives operators more transparency by allowing customized builder preferences. DFDV aligns these preferences with standards expected from a public company. Consequently, this setup increases control over order flow while supporting broader network stability. The company already runs Harmonic within its validator stack. It expects better revenue capture and improved performance in the coming weeks. Moreover, its multi-builder participation strengthens Solana’s resilience, which aligns with DFDV’s long-term plan to expand its SOL holdings and SOL-per-Share value. Solana Price Holds Key Support as Analysts Watch Trend Signals Solana trades near $128 after recording a slight daily increase and a weekly decline. Market data shows a circulating supply near 560 million tokens. This places the asset’s market capitalization above $71 billion. Market data shows SOL holding the $122–$127 zone, which attracted buyers during earlier corrections. Ali Martinez noted a new TD Sequential “9” buy setup on the weekly chart. This indicator marked major reversals near $20, $60, and $120 in previous cycles. Hence, traders now watch for another potential pivot. A weekly close above $145 would confirm renewed momentum. However, losing $122 could open a path toward $105. Long-Term Trendline Retest Becomes a Decisive Point Source: X Martinez also highlighted Solana’s retest of a long-term ascending trendline that sparked strong rallies in 2023 and 2024. Price now sits near $125–$130, a region that triggered rebounds of more than 70% and 160% during earlier cycles. Additionally, holding this area keeps Solana’s broader uptrend intact. A rebound could target $150 first, then $175–$185 if momentum increases.

That future is now here. In a significant move for decentralized finance, the prediction market platform Myriad has launched a seamless integration with the popular Trust Wallet app. This collaboration, first reported by Decrypt, brings speculative forecasting into the daily crypto experience for millions of users. What Does This Prediction Market Integration Actually Do? This feature eliminates the need to switch between multiple applications. Users of the Trust Wallet app can now access Myriad’s prediction market directly within the wallet interface. Think of it as adding a powerful new tab alongside your token balances and swap functions. The goal is to make participating in decentralized forecasting as simple as checking your portfolio. This integration tackles a common user experience hurdle in Web3. Typically, interacting with a prediction market dApp requires connecting your wallet, navigating to a separate website, and approving transactions across platforms. Myriad and Trust Wallet have streamlined this into a single, cohesive flow inside a trusted environment. Why Is This a Big Deal for Crypto Users? This partnership signals a shift towards more integrated and utility-focused crypto wallets. It’s not just about storage anymore; it’s about providing access to a suite of financial tools. For the everyday user, the benefits are clear: Unmatched Convenience: Forecast and trade on real-world events without leaving your primary wallet. Enhanced Security: Interactions happen within the secure framework of Trust Wallet, reducing phishing risks from unknown sites. Mainstream Gateway: It introduces the concept of a prediction market to a vast, established user base in a familiar setting. How Do Prediction Markets Work, and Why Should You Care? If you’re new to the concept, a decentralized prediction market lets people trade shares based on the outcome of future events. Prices reflect the crowd’s collective probability of an event happening. For example, a share trading at $0.70 for “Team A to win the championship” suggests a 70% perceived chance. Beyond speculation, these markets are powerful information aggregation tools. They can provide uncensored forecasts on everything from election results to project launch dates, often outperforming traditional polls or experts. Myriad’s integration makes tapping into this “wisdom of the crowd” remarkably straightforward. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Wallets as Super Apps? While this integration is a leap forward, it introduces new considerations. Wallets becoming all-in-one hubs must maintain: Performance: Adding complex features shouldn’t slow down the core wallet functions. Regulatory Clarity: Prediction market platforms operate in a nuanced legal space globally. User Education: New users need clear guides to understand the risks and mechanics of forecasting. However, the potential is immense. This move could set a precedent, encouraging other wallets to integrate niche DeFi applications, from insurance to derivatives, creating a more robust and accessible financial ecosystem. Conclusion: A Seamless Step Towards a DeFi Future The Myriad and Trust Wallet collaboration is more than a simple feature update. It’s a practical step towards dissolving the barriers between different segments of decentralized finance. By embedding a fully-functional prediction market into a mainstream wallet, they are normalizing advanced DeFi participation. This integration doesn’t just make forecasting accessible; it weaves it into the fabric of everyday crypto management, paving the way for wallets to become the primary portals to the entire Web3 world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Do I need to download a new app to use Myriad’s prediction market? A: No. If you already have the Trust Wallet app, you can access the Myriad prediction market feature directly within it. No separate download is required. Q: Is my cryptocurrency safe when using this new feature? A> Your assets remain in your self-custodied Trust Wallet.

According to Qiao Wang, founder of the prominent crypto accelerator AllianceDAO, a strategic allocation to Layer 1 cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) might be the intelligent hedge you need. While Bitcoin remains the digital gold standard, Wang highlights critical challenges that savvy investors cannot ignore. Why Experts Believe Layer 1 Cryptocurrencies Are a Strategic Hedge In a recent statement, Qiao Wang made a compelling case for diversifying beyond Bitcoin. He maintains that BTC is the prime candidate to replace gold as a store of value. However, he identifies two fundamental long-term risks where other blockchain platforms offer solutions. This perspective positions Layer 1 cryptocurrencies not as competitors, but as complementary assets that strengthen an overall crypto portfolio. What Are Bitcoin’s Primary Long-Term Challenges? Wang points to two specific issues that could impact Bitcoin decades from now. First is the security budget. Bitcoin’s network is secured by miner rewards. After all BTC is mined, security will rely solely on transaction fees. This creates an uncertain economic model. The second challenge is quantum resistance. Future quantum computers could theoretically break Bitcoin’s cryptographic encryption. While this threat is not immediate, it requires forward-thinking solutions. Wang argues that next-generation Layer 1 cryptocurrencies are actively building architectures to address these very problems. How Can Layer 1 Blockchains Provide Solutions? Ethereum and other modern Layer 1s are not static. They are designed for evolution. Their active developer communities and more flexible governance allow them to adapt to new threats. Consider these key advantages: Adaptive Security Models: Many new Layer 1 cryptocurrencies use Proof-of-Stake or hybrid models, which are not tied to a finite mining reward schedule. Roadmap for Upgrades: Platforms like Ethereum have formal processes for implementing major upgrades, including post-quantum cryptography. Diverse Utility: Their functionality for DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts creates inherent value and fee markets beyond simple transactions. Are Layer 1 Cryptocurrencies Overvalued Today? A common concern is that altcoins, especially major Layer 1 cryptocurrencies , are in a bubble. Wang counters this, suggesting they are not currently overvalued when viewed as a hedge. Their value is partially derived from their role as insurance against systemic risks in the broader crypto economy. Holding them is a bet on the continuous innovation and resilience of the blockchain space as a whole. Actionable Insights for Your Crypto Portfolio What does this mean for you? Think of your portfolio like a balanced financial ecosystem. Bitcoin can serve as your foundational, high-conviction store of value. Allocating a portion to leading Layer 1 cryptocurrencies acts as a strategic diversifier. This approach manages risk while maintaining exposure to the growth of blockchain technology. It’s a pragmatic strategy that acknowledges both Bitcoin’s dominance and its potential vulnerabilities. Conclusion: Building a Future-Proof Crypto Strategy The narrative is shifting from ‘Bitcoin versus everything else’ to ‘Bitcoin and everything else.’ Qiao Wang’s analysis provides a crucial framework: view top-tier Layer 1 cryptocurrencies as essential hedges in a long-term, thoughtful investment strategy. They address the existential risks that could challenge Bitcoin decades from now, making them a prudent part of a future-proof portfolio. Embracing this dual approach may be the key to navigating the next era of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does ‘hedge’ mean in this context? A hedge is an investment made to reduce the risk of adverse price movements in another asset. Here, holding Layer 1s is suggested to reduce the long-term systemic risks associated with Bitcoin’s design. Is Ethereum the only Layer 1 hedge mentioned? While Ethereum (ETH) was the primary example, the principle applies to other major Layer 1 blockchains with strong security, active development, and plans for quantum resistance. Does this mean I should sell my Bitcoin? No. The insight recommends diversification, not replacement. The view is that Bitcoin remains the core store of value, with Layer 1s acting as a complementary, risk-mitigating allocation. What is the ‘security budget’ problem? It refers to the concern that after all 21 million Bitcoin are mined, network security will rely only on transaction fees, which may or may not be sufficient to incentivize miners to protect the network. When is quantum computing a threat to Bitcoin? Experts believe practical, crypto-breaking quantum computers are likely decades away. However, the blockchain industry must prepare in advance, which is why it’s considered a long-term risk. How much of my portfolio should be in Layer 1 cryptocurrencies? There is no one-size-fits-all answer. It depends on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and conviction. It’s always wise to conduct your own research or consult a financial advisor.

The same cannot be said about other crypto-focused funds, such as ETH, SOL, and DOGE, which saw mostly outflows on Monday. XRP ETFs Take the Lead Recall that the first spot XRP ETFs with 100% exposure to the asset launched in the United States in mid-November. At the time, Canary Capital’s XRPC broke the 2025 record for highest trading volume on day one. Since then, Bitwise’s XRP, Grayscale’s GXRP, and Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ have seen the light of day, but XRPC remains the market leader with the highest cumulative net inflows. Yesterday, on December 1, the four products attracted $89.65 million, bringing the total inflows to $756.26 million since XRPC’s inception. This made the spot XRP ETFs the best-performing funds from the entire cryptocurrency fleet. The Bitcoin ETFs were the only ones in the green by gaining a more modest $8.48 million. In contrast, the Ethereum funds saw more than $79 million in net outflows, and the SOL-focused products were drained by $13.55 million in withdrawals. The two spot DOGE ETFs recorded zero activity for the second consecutive trading day. It’s worth noting that the XRP funds have not seen a day in the red since November 13. The record for highest daily net inflows was on November 14 ($243.05 million), followed by $164.04 million on November 24, and $118.15 million on November 20. No other crypto-focused ETF can say the same within this timeframe. But XRP Still Down? Despite the promising numbers on the ETF scene, the underlying asset has failed to capitalize on the bullish momentum. Just the opposite, XRP is down by 8% weekly and even dipped below $2.00 yesterday. The asset has turned red on a YTD basis, despite Ripple’s highly successful year. Analysts remain bullish on the asset, though, especially since it managed to defend two critical support levels at $1.75 and $2.00. Some believe XRP has not peaked yet during this cycle and predicted that another rally might be on its way.

This futuristic vision just took a monumental leap forward. OpenMind, a pioneer in decentralized robot operating systems, has announced a groundbreaking partnership with Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin. Together, they are building a revolutionary AI payment infrastructure designed to allow Embodied AI to conduct real-world transactions. This collaboration merges cutting-edge robotics with robust blockchain-based finance, potentially reshaping how intelligent machines interact with our economy. What Is This New AI Payment Infrastructure? The core of this initiative is a seamless integration between two powerful technologies. OpenMind provides the “brain” and body—its decentralized operating system that allows robots to perceive, decide, and act autonomously in physical spaces. Circle contributes the “wallet” and payment rails—its widely trusted USDC stablecoin and the programmable x402 payment protocol. The resulting AI payment infrastructure acts as a financial nervous system for robots, enabling secure, instant, and auditable transactions without constant human oversight. This system is not about replacing human jobs but augmenting machine functionality. For example, a warehouse robot could detect a low stock of batteries, autonomously source a vendor, negotiate a price, and complete a purchase using USDC—all while logging an immutable transaction record on the blockchain. This level of operational independence was previously confined to science fiction. Why Is This Partnership a Game-Changer? The fusion of embodied AI and programmable money solves several critical challenges in robotics and automation. First, it addresses the trust problem. How do you ensure a machine’s financial actions are correct and secure? Blockchain technology provides a transparent and tamper-proof ledger for every transaction. Second, it overcomes currency and border limitations. USDC, being a digital dollar, offers a stable, globally accepted medium of exchange, perfect for machines operating in international supply chains. The benefits of this new AI payment infrastructure are profound: Autonomy & Efficiency: Robots can perform time-sensitive transactions instantly, 24/7, reducing operational delays. Transparency & Auditability: Every payment is recorded on-chain, creating a perfect audit trail for businesses and regulators. Global Scalability: A single, stable currency (USDC) allows robots to transact anywhere in the world without forex complexity. Programmable Finance: The x402 protocol allows for complex conditional payments, like paying for a service only upon verified completion. What Are the Real-World Applications? This technology has immediate and future applications across numerous sectors. In logistics, delivery drones could pay landing fees or recharge their batteries at automated stations. In smart cities, maintenance robots could order replacement parts for public infrastructure. In healthcare, hospital assistant robots could manage inventory and restock medical supplies autonomously. The underlying AI payment infrastructure provides the foundational layer for these machine-to-machine (M2M) and machine-to-business (M2B) economies to flourish. However, challenges remain. Regulatory frameworks for autonomous machine transactions are still nascent. Furthermore, ensuring the absolute security of the robots’ digital wallets against hacking is paramount. The partnership must navigate these hurdles carefully to achieve widespread adoption. Despite this, the potential is staggering, offering a glimpse into a more interconnected and automated future. The Future Powered by AI and Stablecoins The OpenMind and Circle partnership is more than a technical integration; it’s a bold statement about the future of automation. By building a dedicated AI payment infrastructure , they are laying the groundwork for a new economic layer where intelligent agents are active participants. This move could accelerate the development of truly autonomous systems, from self-managing factories to independent service robots, all transacting on a global, digital financial network. In conclusion, this collaboration marks a pivotal moment where robotics meets decentralized finance. It transforms AI from a tool that performs tasks into an agent that can manage resources and engage in commerce. The successful deployment of this infrastructure could redefine efficiency, create new business models, and bring us closer to a world where intelligent machines are not just workers, but economically independent actors. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Embodied AI? A1: Embodied AI refers to artificial intelligence that is integrated into a physical body or robot, allowing it to interact with and manipulate the real world, unlike purely software-based AI. Q2: Why use USDC instead of other cryptocurrencies? A2: USDC is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Its price stability is crucial for robots conducting transactions, as it eliminates the volatility risk associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, ensuring predictable costs. Q3: Is this AI payment infrastructure secure? A3> The infrastructure leverages blockchain technology, which provides inherent security benefits like encryption and immutability. However, the overall security will depend on the implementation of the robot’s operating system, wallet safeguards, and the x402 protocol itself. Q4: Will robots replace human jobs with this capability? A4: The primary goal is to handle repetitive, transactional tasks that humans currently oversee, freeing them for more complex work. It’s designed for augmentation, not replacement, automating logistical purchases rather than creative or strategic roles. Q5: When will we see this technology in use? A5> While the partnership is announced, widespread commercial deployment will take time. We will likely see pilot programs in controlled environments like warehouses or logistics hubs within the next few years. Q6: Can any robot use this payment system? A6: Initially, it will be integrated into robots using OpenMind’s decentralized operating system. For broader adoption, the AI payment infrastructure would need to be standardized and made compatible with other robotics platforms. Found this glimpse into the future of robot commerce fascinating? This fusion of AI and finance is just beginning. Share this article on social media to discuss with your network how intelligent machines might soon be our new economic partners!

A Major Strategic Pivot Vanguard has initiated a sweeping change in its stance toward digital assets by allowing customers to trade cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds on its brokerage platform. The move, reported by Bloomberg, represents a landmark shift for the investment giant, which oversees approximately $11 trillion in assets for more than 50 million clients. For years, Vanguard maintained a strict distance from crypto-related products, characterizing them as too speculative for long-term portfolios. The abrupt policy change places the firm in alignment with growing investor demand and the broader mainstreaming of regulated digital asset exposure. Rationale Behind the Shift According to Andrew Kadjeski, Vanguard’s head of brokerage and investments, several operational and market factors helped drive the decision. Kadjeski told Bloomberg, “Cryptocurrency ETFs and mutual funds have been tested through periods of market volatility, performing as designed while maintaining liquidity. The administrative processes to service these types of funds have matured; and investor preferences continue to evolve.” His comments highlight the increasing confidence among traditional financial institutions in the resilience and structure of regulated crypto investment vehicles. Investor Demand and ETF Growth The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 marked a turning point for institutional engagement with digital assets. The products quickly attracted billions of dollars in inflows, validating long-standing investor interest in regulated crypto offerings. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust became the most prominent of these funds, at one point nearing $100 billion in assets before stabilizing around $70 billion. Its growth demonstrated how investors could gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding or managing the cryptocurrency, a model that continues to draw considerable attention despite recent market declines. Crypto-linked ETFs now rank among the fastest-expanding categories in US fund history, reinforcing a clear appetite for compliant and accessible digital asset exposure. New Leadership and Evolving Strategy Vanguard’s policy reversal follows the appointment of its new CEO, Salim Ramji, who is a former BlackRock executive and vocal blockchain proponent. His leadership has coincided with a modernization push across the firm, including a reassessment of emerging asset classes previously deemed unsuitable for its platform. Under the updated guidelines, Vanguard will permit trading of select ETFs that hold Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Solana (SOL), provided the funds meet regulatory standards. This treatment mirrors the firm’s approach to other non-core assets such as gold. Restrictions and Clear Boundaries While the platform now supports a curated set of digital asset funds, Vanguard has emphasized that its shift does not include launching proprietary crypto products. It also continues to enforce restrictions against high-risk offerings, including those tied to meme coins as they have drawn repeated warnings from the SEC. Kadjeski revealed, “While Vanguard has no plans to launch its own crypto products, we serve millions of investors with diverse needs. Our aim is to provide a brokerage platform that gives clients the ability to invest in the products they choose.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Bank of America’s latest analysis points toward what they’re calling a “long December ahead” for the greenback—a forecast that carries significant implications for forex traders, crypto markets, and global economic stability. Understanding these currency dynamics becomes crucial when navigating volatile digital asset markets. Why Bank of America Sees U.S. Dollar Strength Through December Bank of America’s currency strategists have identified several converging factors that could propel the U.S. dollar through the final month of the year. Their analysis suggests that while cryptocurrencies often move independently of traditional markets, sustained dollar strength typically creates headwinds for risk assets globally. The bank’s research team points to monetary policy divergence, geopolitical tensions, and seasonal patterns as primary drivers. Federal Reserve Policy: The Primary Driver of Dollar Momentum The Federal Reserve remains the most influential force shaping U.S. dollar trajectory. Unlike other central banks that have signaled potential easing, the Fed maintains a hawkish stance that continues to support dollar valuation. This policy divergence creates what forex market analysts call “carry trade advantages”—where investors borrow in low-yielding currencies to invest in higher-yielding dollar assets. Central Bank Current Stance Impact on Currency Federal Reserve (U.S.) Hawkish/Higher for longer Strengthens U.S. dollar European Central Bank Moderately dovish Weakens Euro Bank of Japan Ultra-dovish Weakens Yen Bank of England Cautiously hawkish Mixed impact on Pound Global Currency Trends Creating Perfect Conditions for Dollar Strength Currency trends across major economies are aligning in ways that historically benefit the U.S. dollar. The euro faces pressure from economic stagnation in Germany, while the Japanese yen struggles with the Bank of Japan’s yield curve control policies. Emerging market currencies face additional pressure from dollar-denominated debt servicing costs. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where dollar strength begets more dollar strength. What Does This Mean for the Forex Market and Traders? For participants in the forex market, Bank of America’s forecast suggests several actionable insights: Long dollar positions against European and Asian currencies may outperform Carry trade strategies could see renewed interest Volatility may increase around key economic data releases Hedging strategies become more expensive as dollar strength persists How Currency Analysis Informs Broader Market Understanding Sophisticated currency analysis provides more than just forex trading signals—it offers a window into global capital flows, risk appetite, and economic health. When the U.S. dollar strengthens persistently, it typically indicates: Reduced global risk appetite among institutional investors Capital flowing toward perceived safe-haven assets Potential pressure on dollar-denominated emerging market debt Changed dynamics for commodities priced in dollars Bank of America’s Track Record and Methodology Bank of America employs a multi-factor approach to currency forecasting that combines quantitative models with qualitative analysis. Their methodology examines: Interest rate differentials and expectations Purchasing power parity calculations Technical analysis of currency pairs Geopolitical risk assessments Seasonal patterns and historical precedents Challenges and Risks to the Dollar Strength Narrative While the case for dollar strength appears compelling, several factors could disrupt this forecast: Unexpected dovish pivot from the Federal Reserve Sharp improvement in European or Chinese economic data Geopolitical developments that reduce safe-haven demand Technical resistance levels that trigger profit-taking Coordinated central bank intervention to weaken the dollar Actionable Insights for Market Participants Based on Bank of America’s analysis, market participants might consider: Monitoring dollar index (DXY) technical levels for entry and exit points Assessing portfolio exposure to dollar-sensitive assets Reviewing hedging strategies for international investments Watching for divergences between currency forecasts and actual price action Considering how dollar strength affects specific sectors and asset classes Conclusion: Navigating the Currency Landscape Bank of America’s forecast for a “long December ahead” for the U.S. dollar represents more than just another currency prediction—it reflects deep structural trends in global finance. The convergence of Federal Reserve policy, economic divergences between major economies, and seasonal patterns creates a potent mix that could extend dollar strength through year-end. For traders, investors, and analysts across all asset classes, understanding these currency dynamics provides valuable context for decision-making in increasingly interconnected global markets.

Frequently Asked Questions What specific factors is Bank of America citing for dollar strength? Bank of America points to Federal Reserve policy divergence from other central banks, geopolitical uncertainty driving safe-haven flows, and technical factors supporting the dollar’s upward trajectory. How does U.S. dollar strength typically affect cryptocurrency markets? Historically, sustained dollar strength has created headwinds for risk assets including cryptocurrencies, though the relationship has become more complex with crypto’s maturation as an asset class. Which Bank of America analysts are behind this forecast? The analysis comes from Bank of America’s global currency strategy team, though specific analyst names vary by publication. How reliable have Bank of America’s currency forecasts been historically? Like all major banks, Bank of America has a mixed track record on currency forecasts, though their research is widely respected in institutional circles. What would cause the Federal Reserve to change its current policy stance? The Federal Reserve would likely pivot if inflation data consistently surprised to the downside or if labor market conditions deteriorated significantly.

A recent analysis from crypto investor CW highlights this development, framing XRP’s current position within a multi-phase pattern that has historically preceded major expansions. The update is linked directly to a chart comparing the 2014–2017 cycle to the ongoing 2018–2025 structure. This emphasizes how each phase has repeated in shape and duration. $XRP is gradually setting up to break above its ATH. Sub indicators have already begun to rise from the bottom, and ETFs are starting to be listed. This rally will likely surpass the ATH and head towards the peak of Phase 4. pic.twitter.com/300AEkMUd0 — CW (@CW8900) November 30, 2025 The Multi-Phase Framework and Current Positioning CW’s post outlines the view that XRP is moving closer to a breakout that could take it above its previous all-time high. The shared chart divides the market cycle into four distinct phases, each defined by contracting price action and eventual acceleration. According to the analysis, XRP appears to be entering the point where Phase 3 transitions into Phase 4, mirroring earlier historical movements that led to significant upside. The chart further highlights that various sub-indicators, including momentum signals, positioning data, and long-range trend formations, are beginning to turn upward. CW describes these shifts as emerging from extended lows, indicating that the structural foundation for upward continuation may already be forming. An additional component of the argument is the introduction and listing of XRP-related exchange-traded products in certain markets. CW notes that these listings are developing at the same time the technical structure is tightening, presenting a combination of macro and technical factors that could reinforce directional bias. Investor Perspectives on Market Dynamics Community reactions to CW’s analysis reinforce the idea that the present consolidation is not being viewed in isolation. One commenter, ALBEEE, pointed out that Ripple’s ongoing infrastructure development has contributed to a long-term foundation that larger institutions may eventually key into. Their view suggests that institutional participation tends to precede mainstream attention, with the break of the all-time high serving as the potential trigger for more retail involvement. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another observer, X Finance Bull, focused on the strength of current indicators. They argued that XRP’s movement toward its previous high is not occurring without underlying support, stating that signals traditionally associated with early-stage momentum shifts are already active. In their assessment, a confirmed trend expansion could propel the asset beyond prior resistance levels in a direct fashion. CW’s analysis presents a structured interpretation of XRP’s long-term price behavior, supported by historical comparison and developing technical indicators. The viewpoints from other market watchers add context to how investors are interpreting institutional engagement, momentum data, and the broader cycle. Whether XRP ultimately confirms a Phase 4 breakout remains dependent on market conditions, but the combination of technical alignment and emerging external catalysts continues to draw interest to its current position.

The OECD warned that this resilience is still brittle and that any renewed trade disputes or unfulfilled AI aspirations could jeopardize the future. In the OECD Economic Outlook, the organization estimated that global growth would decline moderately from 3.2% in 2025 to 2.9% in 2026, leaving its forecasts unchanged from those in its prior estimates in September. The OECD projected that global growth would recover to 3.1% in 2027. OECD projects global growth amid tariff challenges OECD forecasts that near-term activity will decrease as higher effective tariff rates progressively feed through, weighing on investment and trade, amid continued geopolitical and economic uncertainty. The organization claimed that growth is likely to firm again later in 2026 as the impact of tariffs fades, financial conditions recover, and lower inflation stimulates consumption, with rising Asian economies being the leading drivers of global growth . According to OECD, the U.S. economy is expected to fall from 2.8% in 2024 to 1.8% in 2025 and then drop to 1.7% in 2026. In 2027, the U.S. economy is projected to be at 1.9% The OECD said that AI investment, fiscal support, and predicted Federal Reserve rate cuts are helping counter the drag from tariffs on imported products, lower immigration, and federal employment cutbacks. The Paris-based organization revised its prediction for the euro zone’s 2025 growth to 1.3% from 1.2%, underpinned by strong labor markets and increasing public investment in Germany. According to the organization, growth is expected to slow to 1.2% in 2026, down from 1% previously due to financial constraints in France and Italy. According to the OECD Economic Outlook, China’s growth is forecast to remain stable at 5% in 2025, up from 4.9% in the previous forecast. The organization expects China’s growth to drop to 4.4% in 2026, unchanged from the last outlook, as fiscal assistance expires and new U.S. tariffs on products imported from China take effect. Japan’s GDP is predicted to rise 1.3% in 2025, up from 1.1%, driven by strong corporate earnings and investment, before dropping to 0.9% in 2026. OECD warns of persistent global inflation risks The Paris-based organization said that inflation is forecast to drop in most G20 economies as economic growth moderates and labor market pressures ease. The OECD stated that headline inflation remains sticky in some locations but is predicted to return to its goal by 2027 in almost all major economies. According to the International Economic Organization, global trade growth is predicted to decrease from 4.​2% in 2025 to 2.3% in 2026 as the full effects of tariffs weigh on investment and consumption. The OECD Economic Outlook revealed that most major economies are expected to return to their inflation targets set by central banks by mid-2027. In the U.S., inflation is expected to peak in mid-2026, following a period of tariff pass-through, and then decline. In China and certain emerging countries, inflation is predicted to rise gradually as excess production capacity is eliminated. The Paris-based organization stated that countries need to discover ways of participating cooperatively within the global trading system. Additionally, the organization stated that countries need to work together to make trade policy more predictable and secure a lasting resolution to trade disputes. According to OECD, most major central banks are likely to hold or cut borrowing prices during the coming year as inflation pressures recede. The Federal Reserve is expected to lower rates somewhat by the end of 2026, barring any inflation surprises from tariffs. The international economic organization said that central banks should remain sensitive to fluctuations in inflation dynamics. The financial watchdog further claimed that steady policy rate reductions can continue if underlying inflation continues to decline and expectations remain anchored. The OECD warned that countries experiencing tariff-driven price pressures may need to be more cautious, adjusting the pace of interest-rate cuts to avoid reigniting inflation.

That vision just became reality. Lisk, a prominent blockchain platform, has joined forces with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) to launch the ScaleX Web3 Incubator. This groundbreaking initiative aims to bring the transformative power of decentralized technology to industries and supply chains in emerging markets. Let’s explore what this means for the future of global innovation. What Is the ScaleX Web3 Incubator? The ScaleX Web3 Incubator represents a strategic partnership between blockchain technology and international development. As part of UNIDO’s broader ScaleX global accelerator program, this incubator focuses on practical, real-world applications. It connects the innovative potential of Web3 with the urgent needs of growing economies. Therefore, it’s not just about funding ideas; it’s about building sustainable solutions that leverage decentralization for tangible impact. Why Focus on a Web3 Incubator for Emerging Markets? Emerging markets face unique challenges, from inefficient supply chains to limited access to capital. A dedicated Web3 incubator addresses these issues head-on. Decentralized technology offers tools for transparency, security, and financial inclusion that traditional systems often lack. For instance, blockchain can streamline agricultural supply chains, enabling farmers to receive fairer prices. Moreover, it can create new digital economies where local entrepreneurs thrive. This initiative recognizes that the next wave of Web3 adoption may very well come from these regions. What Are the Key Benefits of This Partnership? The collaboration between Lisk and UNIDO brings together technical expertise and on-the-ground experience. Key benefits include: Expert Mentorship: Startups gain access to Lisk’s blockchain developers and UNIDO’s industry specialists. Real-World Application: A focus on solving actual problems in sectors like agriculture, logistics, and finance. Sustainable Growth: Projects are designed for long-term viability, not just short-term hype. Global Network: Participants connect with a worldwide community of supporters and potential partners. How Will This Web3 Incubator Work in Practice? The incubator will identify and support promising startups that can benefit from decentralized solutions. Selected teams will receive funding, technical resources, and strategic guidance. The goal is to help them build minimum viable products (MVPs) and integrate blockchain into their core operations. For example, a company creating a transparent marketplace for artisan goods could use Lisk’s technology to verify authenticity and track shipments. This hands-on approach ensures the Web3 incubator delivers concrete results. What Challenges Might This Initiative Face? While promising, the path forward has hurdles. Regulatory uncertainty around blockchain in some countries poses a significant challenge. Additionally, there’s the task of bridging the digital literacy gap to ensure local communities can effectively use these new tools. However, the combined authority of UNIDO and the technical prowess of Lisk provide a strong foundation to navigate these issues. The partnership is committed to working within local frameworks to foster acceptance and adoption. What Does This Mean for the Future of Web3? This partnership signals a major shift. It moves Web3 beyond speculative finance and into the realm of impactful, socially-driven technology. By proving that decentralized systems can solve critical problems in emerging economies, this Web3 incubator could inspire similar projects worldwide. It demonstrates that blockchain’s true value lies in its ability to create more equitable and efficient systems for everyone. In conclusion, the Lisk and UNIDO ScaleX Web3 Incubator is more than a program; it’s a beacon for the future. It combines visionary technology with humanitarian goals to empower entrepreneurs where it matters most. This initiative has the potential to unlock unprecedented economic opportunities and redefine how we think about technological progress in a global context.

The privacy narrative was not enough to redirect liquidity beyond the short-term pumps. ZCash (ZEC) led the decline among privacy coins, showing the short-term appeal of the entire narrative. ZEC led the losses, wiping out over 25% of its value in a single day, after spending weeks as the most active asset. ZEC extended its recent streak of losses and long liquidations . ZEC is down 60% from its peak, after losing another 25% of its price in the past 24 hours. | Source: Coingecko The ZEC rally showed several signs of slowing down, but finally ended following the overall market correction. Privacy tokens as a whole erased their value, for a total market cap of just over $15B. ZEC also became the second-largest asset, leaving the top spot to XMR. Currently, Monero traded closer to its usual range, erasing just 4% in the past day. In total, 98 out of 104 privacy coins and tokens are in the red, based on Cryptorank data . The decline of the narrative showed that the enthusiasm was short-lived, mostly linked to the price pumps. Despite the real-world usage of privacy tools, the coins mostly failed to recover their all-time peaks. Can ZEC return with a relief rally? ZEC sank to $324.31, trading near an all-time high. At this point, ZEC is around 60% from its peak, entering the range for relief rally predictions. In its initial run, ZEC failed to conquer the $1,000 level, despite expectations that it could reach that price early next year. ZEC trading is highly concentrated, with 35% of all activity going through Binance. This means a ZEC pump is possible based on the concentrated USDT liquidity. In early November, ZEC demonstrated it could dip to the $440 range and recover to new peaks above $700. This time around, ZEC lost its previous support level, spending a longer time unraveling its previous price levels. ZEC has lost some of the confidence of traders, and retail remains underwater, which may lead to a capitulation. There are many skeptics of the narrative that ZCash can replace Bitcoin, inviting a rotation of liquidity. However, in the short term, ZEC may still recover to a higher price range. Shielded ZEC remains at a high level One of the main narratives for ZCash is that shielded coins may provide a baseline of holders. A total of over 4.79M ZEC are shielded in three main pools, and those coins may not be sent to exchanges. Additionally, Cypherpunk Technologies has accumulated a small treasury of 233,644 ZEC. The total supply of ZEC is at around 16.41M, still leaving enough supply for trading. However, ZCash can hardly compete with BTC’s infrastructure in both mainstream and decentralized trading. Only 1,412 ZEC have been wrapped in the form of ZenZec tokens, to be used in Solana-based DeFi. ZEC also registers around 7K daily transactions, a significant drop in activity since the coin’s price peaked. Soon after the transaction record, ZEC activity returned closer to its baseline.

The figure was the second-largest liquidity injection since the COVID-19 era and surpasses even the Dot Com Bubble peaks, according to data Finbold retrieved from Barchart. Treasury Securities Submitted. Source: Federal Reserve As a result, investors and analysts have been left wondering whether risk assets such as equities and cryptocurrencies are going to be affected, especially as liquidity begins to loosen. Analysts bullish on crypto and stocks Fundstrat’s Tom Lee remains optimistic on crypto and stocks, noting in a CNBC interview that the central bank is going to provide the biggest tailwind in the following weeks. “I think the biggest tailwind that’s gonna emerge in the next couple of weeks is around the central bank. The Fed is set to cut in December, but also today’s the day that quantitative tightening ends, and as you know, the Fed has been shrinking its balance sheet since April 2022. It’s been a pretty big tailwind for market liquidity,” said Lee. With liquidity no longer being drained from the system, capital flows could begin accelerating into risk assets. “The last time we had an end to quantitative tightening was September 2012, and if you look back at that period, the markets really responded well,” he further noted. New Bitcoin all-time high in January? Lee appears especially convinced when it comes to Bitcoin ( BTC ), arguing that higher liquidity historically correlates with stronger performance in risk-on assets. Accordingly, he believes that a new all-time high for “digital gold” is possible by late January, even though the effects of the October slump are still noticeable and the Bank of Japan seems “hawkish.” When it comes to the S&P 500 , he argued that 7,200-7,300 is likely in December. All attention is, of course, on the December Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which the market hopes will clarify the Fed’s upcoming rate-cut path.

On-chain data from Arkham and wave analysis from Man of Bitcoin now point to a market where deep-pocket accumulation meets a potential inflection zone on the ETH chart. Bitmine Adds 96,800 ETH as Tom Lee Keeps Buying the Dip Blockchain analytics platform Arkham reported that ETH treasury company Bitmine bought 96,800 Ether in the past week, spending about $273.2 million at recent prices. The purchases came as ETH traded near $2,800, extending a steady accumulation pattern during recent market pullbacks. Bitmine Ethereum Treasury Dashboard. Source: Arkham/X The Arkham dashboard shows Bitmine now holding roughly 3.44 million ETH in its main wallets, with the position valued at around $10 billion. The portfolio screenshot lists ETH as the dominant asset, far ahead of smaller allocations to tokens such as IMAGE, IMPT, ELMO and MKR. Arkham linked the activity to strategist Tom Lee, noting that Bitmine still has about $880 million in dry powder earmarked for additional ETH purchases. Consequently, the on-chain data indicates that the firm has been buying into each downward move, with capacity to continue adding if the price weakens again. Analyst Says Ethereum Holds 78.6% Fib as Chart Signals Possible Wave-C Start Meanwhile, Ethereum reacted to the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level, according to trader Man of Bitcoin, who highlighted the move inside a corrective Elliott Wave structure. His chart shows ETH pulling back sharply from the November recovery, then finding support near $2,716 before recovering toward the $2,800 area. The rebound formed at the exact 78.6% zone marked for wave B, which he treats as the key point that must hold for the structure to stay intact. Ethereum Elliott Wave Analysis Chart.

At the same time, the chart outlines the three main Fib retracement levels of 0.5 ($2,849), 0.618 ($2,794) and 0.786 ($2,716). ETH briefly dipped through the first two levels before responding at the lowest one, suggesting the broader market still respects the deeper retracement band during this correction. His wave count labels the recent upward move as wave A and the current pullback as wave B within a larger wave iv. Because of that, he noted that ETH “should ideally remain above the last swing low” for the start of wave C to unfold.

Markets are shifting toward crypto assets that support clear, repeatable real-world actions – payments, gaming, and creator monetization – instead of pure hype. AI creator platforms keep running into the same problems: huge fees, random bans, clunky tools, and payments that change depending on your passport. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) mixes Web3 payouts, token-gated content, and AI tools to cut fees for creators and give fans programmable ways to access and support content. More than 1M XRP payments between unique wallets in a single day is the kind of number that slices through all the market noise. Prices can wander. Sentiment can swing like a kid on too much sugar. But real on-chain usage shows where actual product-market fit is forming under the surface. This jump in activity shows something very simple: when a network handles payments at scale without breaking a sweat, people use it. XRP has spent years proving it can move money fast and cheap for cross-border payments, even while its price deals with macro pressure and regulatory drama. And now, the same filter is starting to shape the rest of the crypto market. Capital is moving away from ‘vibes first, utility later’ tokens toward projects with obvious, repeatable on-chain actions. Payments, gaming, real-world assets, and especially creator monetization are where users are actually clicking buttons instead of just tweeting memes. That’s the setup for SUBBD Token ($SUBBD), an AI-powered, Ethereum-based content platform token. As networks like XRP show how to move value at scale, projects like $SUBBD are trying to give that value a destination: tokenized content, AI creators, and programmable fan worlds. Why Payments-Scale Activity Is Repricing Utility Narratives 1M daily XRP payments between unique wallets highlight how fast real demand can settle on a chain once latency, fees, and reliability are solved. For builders, the lesson is almost boring in its simplicity: keep finality close to real-time and fees next to zero, and users will show up, even when the macro backdrop looks gloomy. The same pattern is showing up in the creator economy. Web2 platforms often take 30%-50% of earnings once you add up fees, revenue splits, and the joy of unpredictable algorithms. Creators get reach, but they lose control of their money and sometimes even their accounts. A random ban can shut down income overnight. It’s like building a business on quicksand. AI creator platforms are rising to fight this. Some Web3 projects offer token-gated content and NFT drops. Pure AI startups deliver fancy creation tools but keep payments centralized. The SUBBD platform aims to be the middle option: a hybrid that believes creator earnings, AI productivity, and on-chain payments belong together, not scattered across five apps and two spreadsheets. How SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) Turns AI, Web3 and Fans Into One Revenue Engine Most platforms tape crypto or AI on top like an afterthought, but the SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) sits at the center of everything this platform does. SUBBD is a new crypto project designed in a way that AI tools, creator features, and on-chain payouts all flow through the token instead of being bolted on later. On the infrastructure side, the SUBBD platform uses Ethereum-compatible smart contracts that power tokenized access, staking, and governance. On the AI side, creators get tools for content generation, chatbots, voice cloning, and object recognition, which help them work faster without losing their minds. The main problem $SUBBD tackles is simple and painful: creators losing up to 70% of their income to platforms, payment processors, and every middleman who wants a slice. Add the constant fear of bans or demonetization, and the whole thing becomes a stressful business model. SUBBD solves this by routing earnings through the $SUBBD token, giving creators crypto payouts, global reach without banking friction, and token-gated exclusives they fully control. Experience is where SUBBD tries to stand out. The AI Personal Assistant handles automated DMs, fan chats, and custom replies. AI voice cloning and AI influencer creation let creators experiment with new personas and new languages without hiring extra help. Fans, meanwhile, receive subscriptions, access to exclusive content, pay-per-view drops, NFT sales, tipping, and even AI-only experiences in one place. In other words, it’s a win-win for both creators and their fans. Why $SUBBD Matters Right Now The SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) design tries to keep users engaged. The presale has already raised $1.3M+, which signals early demand for a creator-focused token instead of just another meme coin. Right now, you can buy $SUBBD for just $0.0571. ➡️ Check out our guide to buying $SUBBD if you plan to join the presale. A fixed 20% APY staking rate in year one rewards early holders with exclusive livestreams, in-house content, daily behind-the-scenes drops, and XP boosts for future perks. To explore more possible upside scenarios and market positions, take a look at our SUBBD price prediction and compare it with your own view before deciding whether to invest in SUBBD Token. On-chain, holders can vote on new features, creator onboarding, themes, events, and which AI creators get highlighted. This governance layer pushes SUBBD closer to a programmable content marketplace rather than a static subscription site. As more value flows through high-throughput networks, the bet is that creator tokens like $SUBBD become one of the main places that value wants to land. 🚀 Join the $SUBBD presale before the next price increase.

Grayscale Investments, a titan in digital asset management, has launched the first-ever spot LINK ETF. This new fund, trading under the ticker GLNK on the NYSE Arca, represents a monumental leap for Chainlink and its ecosystem. For investors, it’s a game-changer, offering a regulated, familiar path to gain exposure to LINK’s price without the complexities of direct crypto ownership. What Exactly Is the Grayscale Spot LINK ETF? Let’s break it down simply. An ETF, or Exchange-Traded Fund, is a basket of assets you can buy and sell on a traditional stock exchange. A spot LINK ETF is unique because it holds the actual LINK cryptocurrency itself. This differs from futures-based ETFs, which deal in contracts. Therefore, GLNK’s value is directly tied to the live, or ‘spot,’ price of Chainlink’s LINK token. This direct backing is a significant vote of confidence in the asset’s underlying value. Why Does This Spot LINK ETF Matter for Investors? The launch of a spot LINK ETF solves several key challenges for mainstream and institutional investors. First, it provides a secure, custodial solution. Grayscale handles the storage and security of the LINK tokens. Second, it offers unparalleled convenience. You can now buy and sell LINK exposure through your existing brokerage account, just like you would with Apple or Tesla stock. Regulated Access: It brings Chainlink into the heavily regulated world of traditional finance, attracting cautious capital. Simplified Process: No need for crypto wallets, private keys, or navigating decentralized exchanges. Enhanced Liquidity: Trading on a major exchange like NYSE Arca ensures high trading volume and easier entry/exit. Institutional Gateway: It paves the way for pensions, hedge funds, and other large entities to allocate funds to Chainlink. How Could This Impact the Future of Chainlink? The introduction of a spot LINK ETF is more than just a new financial product; it’s a powerful validation signal. Chainlink’s core technology provides real-world data (oracles) to smart contracts on blockchains like Ethereum. This ETF debut highlights its perceived maturity and long-term viability as a critical piece of Web3 infrastructure. Increased institutional investment could lead to greater network development and adoption. However, it’s crucial to maintain perspective. While the ETF provides easier access, LINK’s price will still be subject to the volatility inherent to the crypto market. The fund’s success will also depend on investor demand and broader market sentiment. What Should You Do Next as a Crypto Enthusiast? This launch is a pivotal moment to assess your strategy. If you’ve been interested in Chainlink but hesitant about custody, the spot LINK ETF offers a compelling alternative. For existing LINK holders, it represents a new source of potential demand and legitimacy. Monitor the trading volume and assets under management (AUM) of GLNK in its early days—these will be key indicators of its traction. In conclusion, Grayscale’s launch of the first spot LINK ETF is a landmark event that bridges decentralized oracle networks with the traditional financial system. It underscores Chainlink’s foundational role and provides a streamlined, secure investment vehicle. This move likely heralds a new phase of institutional engagement with select crypto assets beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is the ticker symbol for Grayscale’s spot LINK ETF? A: The ETF trades under the ticker symbol GLNK on the NYSE Arca exchange. Q: How is a spot ETF different from a futures ETF? A: A spot ETF holds the actual physical asset (in this case, LINK tokens). A futures ETF holds contracts that bet on the asset’s future price, which can lead to tracking error. Q: Do I own actual LINK tokens if I buy shares of GLNK? A: No, you own shares of the fund that owns the LINK tokens. This gives you financial exposure to LINK’s price without you needing to hold the crypto directly. Q: What are the benefits of investing through this spot LINK ETF? A: Key benefits include regulated oversight, ease of use through a brokerage account, professional custody of assets, and integration with traditional investment portfolios. Q: Does this mean Chainlink is now an officially approved security? A: No. The ETF is a regulated product, but it does not change the regulatory classification of the underlying LINK token itself. Q: Are there any fees associated with the GLNK ETF? A: Yes, like all ETFs, GLNK has an expense ratio to cover management and operational costs. Investors should check Grayscale’s official documentation for the specific fee structure. Join the Conversation This launch is a major talking point for the future of crypto and traditional finance.

The move garnered applause from members of the cryptocurrency community, but also drew criticism from government representatives and industry stakeholders. According to the president’s office, the 100-page bill “genuinely threatens the freedoms of Poles, their property, and the stability of the state,” citing that many provisions lacked proportional safeguards. A clause granting authorities the power to block websites of crypto firms became by far the most contentious element to discuss, with the president warning that these could be used at will and could limit users’ access to funds. Crypto community applauds veto while government officials sound alarm First proposed in June, the bill has drawn pushback from industry advocates, such as Polish politician Tomasz Mentzen, who had predicted that the president would not push it forward by signing even when it received a green light from parliament. The bill had already cleared a major legislative hurdle when the lower house, the Sejm of the Republic of Poland, approved it in late September 2025 with 230 votes in favor and 196 against. The bill was then sent to President Nawrocki on 12 November 2025. The president’s veto thus concludes a long and complex legislative process involving multiple readings, revisions, and mounting concern from crypto-friendly politicians and businesses that Poland’s “local MiCA” could become far stricter than necessary. While crypto supporters hailed the veto as a win for the market, several government officials condemned the move, claiming the president had “chosen chaos” and must bear full responsibility for the outcome. One of the main reasons cited for the veto was a provision that would have allowed authorities to block websites operating in the cryptocurrency market easily. “Domain blocking laws are opaque and can lead to abuse,” the president’s office said in an official press release . President Nawrocki vetoes the crypto bill, citing overregulation The president’s office also cited the bill’s widely criticized length, saying its complexity reduces transparency and leads to “overregulation,” especially when compared with simpler frameworks in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. The president stated that overregulation is an easy way to drive companies to the Czech Republic, Lithuania, or Malta, rather than creating conditions for them to operate and pay taxes in Poland. Nawrocki also highlighted the excessive amount of supervisory fees, which may prevent startup activity and favor foreign corporations and banks. “This is a reversal of logic, killing off a competitive market and a serious threat to innovation,” he stated. The Polish president’s refusal to approve the bill has triggered a strong backlash from top Polish officials, including Finance Minister Andrzej Domański and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Radosław Sikorski. Domański warned on X that already now, 20% of clients are losing their money as a result of abuses in this market. He accused the president of having “chosen chaos” and shouldering full responsibility for the fallout. Sikorski concurred with the criticism and noted that the bill was intended to regulate the cryptocurrency market. “When the bubble bursts and thousands of Poles lose their savings, at least they’ll know who to thank,” he wrote on X. However, crypto advocates, including Polish economist Krzysztof Piech, countered, arguing that the president should not be blamed for the authorities’ failures to pursue scammers. Piech also pointed out that the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) will grant investor protections to every member state starting July 1, 2026.

Data shared by popular analyst CW shows that the XRP spot volume has calmed lately, which, history suggests, could mean a price bottom and a subsequent rally.

In general, cooling phase indicates oversold and it is most appears in the bottom state. $XRP ETFs are being continuously listed, and global liquidity is increasing. With the continued listing of ETFs, $XRP is… pic.twitter.com/tfkW8ZsfFr — CW (@CW8900) December 2, 2025 The bubble map above aligns with previous reports indicating that the overall market calamity that took place since early October has mostly been influenced by leveraged trading. For XRP, in particular, this map shows that when the spot volume overheats (red dots), the asset enters a prolonged correction phase. However, this hasn’t been the case for the past few months, as the last sizeable red dots came after the late 2024/early 2025 rally to $3.40. Consequently, CW determined that the current spot volume levels mean XRP is in a “state of cooling,” which “indicates oversold” and has historically appeared during the price bottom phases. The analyst believes this period won’t last long as new XRP ETFs launch almost every week and the inflows are quite impressive. In fact, the spot Ripple funds have performed a lot better than their BTC, ETH, and SOL counterparts since the first one hit the US markets in mid-November. CW added that global liquidity is increasing, which, alongside the growing inflows into the spot XRP ETFs, could result in a significant price expansion for the underlying token. For now, though, XRP remains just inches above the pivotal $2.00 support. It’s still in the red on a yearly scale, although the company behind it has recorded its best year to date.

Strategy now trades below the value of its bitcoin stack, while critics question whether its high-cost funding model can hold. Strategy Builds $1.44B USD Reserve as Bitcoin Stockpile Hits 650,000 BTC Strategy Inc. said it has created a $1.44 billion US dollar reserve and lifted its bitcoin holdings to 650,000 BTC after a new purchase of 130 coins. The company disclosed that it bought the latest batch for about $11.7 million at an average price of roughly $89,960 per bitcoin, bringing its total bitcoin investment to $48.38 billion at an average cost of $74,436 per BTC. The firm explained that the US dollar reserve will support dividend payments on its preferred stock and interest on its outstanding debt. Strategy funded the reserve with proceeds from sales of Class A common shares through its at-the-market offering program. Management said its current intention is to keep enough cash on hand to cover at least 12 months of these obligations and to build the buffer toward 24 months or more, depending on market conditions and liquidity needs. According to the company, the dollar reserve now complements Strategy’s bitcoin reserve, which represents about 3.1% of the eventual 21 million BTC supply. Executives said the structure is meant to give the firm flexibility to meet fixed payments without selling bitcoin, while they continue to treat BTC as a long-term treasury asset. Strategy noted that the size and terms of the reserve remain at its sole discretion and may change as funding costs, bitcoin prices and capital-market windows shift. Schiff Slams Saylor After STRC Dividend Jumps to 10.75% Michael Saylor said in a post on X that Strategy’s STRC preferred stock now carries a 10.75% rate after “another rate hike last night.” The increase follows recent changes to Strategy’s capital structure. Soon after, long-time bitcoin critic Peter Schiff attacked both the move and Strategy’s business model. He wrote that this marks “the beginning of the end” for MSTR and argued that Saylor sold stock not to buy more bitcoin but to raise U.S. dollars to meet interest and dividend obligations. Schiff said the stock is “broken” and called the business model a fraud, while accusing Saylor of misleading investors. In a follow-up post, Schiff said Strategy now sells equity to raise cash and then uses that money to buy U.S. Treasuries yielding about 4%, while paying between 8% and 10% on its own debt and preferred stock. He questioned how long investors will view this as a viable strategy rather than a leveraged way to speculate on bitcoin. MicroStrategy Trades at Steep Discount to Its Bitcoin Stack MicroStrategy shares fell about 12% on the day and are now down 57% since Oct. 6, pushing the company’s market capitalization to roughly $45 billion. At the same time, the firm holds 650,000 bitcoin valued at about $55 billion, according to The Kobeissi Letter, which noted that the stock now trades around $10 billion below the headline value of its bitcoin reserves. MicroStrategy Bitcoin Valuation Gap. Source: The Kobeissi Letter Even after subtracting MicroStrategy’s reported $8.2 billion debt load, the firm’s net bitcoin position stands near $46.8 billion. That figure still sits about $1.8 billion above the company’s market cap and does not include any cash on its balance sheet. The Kobeissi Letter framed the gap as a sign of how sharply investors have repriced the stock and asked whether executive chairman Michael Saylor can continue adding to the firm’s bitcoin holdings under these conditions.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-02 13:56:36

Why The Crypto Sell-Off Is “Strange” In a post on X, Dorman notes that traditional risk assets are behaving exactly as textbooks would suggest: “equity, credit and gold/silver markets are launching to ATHs every month because the Fed is cutting rates, QT is ending, consumer spending is strong, record earnings, AI demand still incredibly strong.” Yet crypto continues to grind lower, even as most of the usual bearish narratives have been invalidated. “MSTR isn’t selling, Tether isn’t insolvent, DATs aren’t selling, NVDA isn’t blowing up, the Fed isn’t turning hawkish, the tariff wars aren’t restarting,” he writes, before admitting: “I still have no idea why crypto is down.” In his accompanying essay “The Selling Nobody Can Explain” (Dec. 1, 2025), Dorman details a market that has fallen in seven of the past eight weeks, with only a brief Thanksgiving rally before renewed selling as Japanese markets reopened. The first leg lower followed the October 10 exchange outages at Binance and others, weeks ahead of the FOMC meeting. Much of November’s weakness was retrospectively ascribed to Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s hawkish tone, which drove December rate-cut odds from “almost a 100% chance” to “as low as 30%.” Related Reading: $300 Million Crypto Bet: Kazakhstan’s Central Bank Gears Up What makes the late-November continuation unusual, he argues, is that the macro backdrop has since turned supportive again. Core PPI printed at 2.6% versus 2.7% expected, early post-shutdown labor data point to a cooling jobs market, and December cut odds have rebounded to around 90%. Equities “staged a fierce rally to close November in positive territory,” and betting markets are effectively pricing in Kevin Hassett, a known policy dove, as the next Fed chair. Against that backdrop, Dorman asks, “why are digital assets still selling off on every piece of bad news but failing to rally with good news?” His answer is stark: “I have no idea.” One working explanation is that the marginal seller is no longer crypto-native. Dorman cites Bill Ackman’s remark that his Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac positions are trading in sympathy with crypto, despite orthogonal fundamentals. The comment, he argues, reflects the growing overlap between TradFi, retail and digital-asset investors. What was “a pretty isolated industry” is now deeply integrated into multi-asset portfolios, and in those structures “investments in crypto seem to be the first to go.” The crypto ecosystem itself is highly transparent; by contrast, “TradFi remains more of a black box. And that black box is dominating flows and activity right now.” Wall Street Is Coming Dorman revisits Arca’s framework that token value is a mix of financial, utility and social components. With sentiment at cycle lows, it is no surprise that assets whose value is mostly social – Bitcoin, L1s, NFTs, memecoins – are under pressure. The surprise is that tokens with stronger financial or utility anchors have not consistently outperformed. “While some do (BNB), most do not (DeFi tokens, PUMP). So that’s a bit odd.” Equally unusual, he says, is the absence of “cavalry” buyers; instead, more players are “piling into the weakness, expecting more weakness,” leaning on momentum rather than fundamentals. Related Reading: 30% Of Crypto Market Makers Got Wiped, Mike Novogratz Says On MicroStrategy, Dorman reiterates that the firm “will never be forced sellers,” despite recurring headlines. On Tether, he pushes back against a rapid narrative shift from mega-valuation to supposed insolvency. With USDT roughly 70% backed by cash and equivalents and 30% by gold, bitcoin and loans, he argues that “any questions about their liquidity are just silly,” given the implausibility of 70% same-day redemptions. Solvency risks would require large losses across that 30% sleeve, which he sees as manageable given the parent company’s profitability. Ultimately, Dorman reduces the puzzle to flows and market structure. “There are no buyers within the crypto walls today,” he writes. Crypto-native investors are “exhausted,” and the Wall Street firms that are “coming” into the asset class “aren’t here today.” Until crypto assets can be purchased seamlessly within existing mandates and systems at institutions like Vanguard, State Street, BNY, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, “they just won’t do it.” For now, he concludes, the persistent weakness “certainly has us scratching our heads.” At press time, the total crypto market cap was at $2.9 trillion.

Some altcoins are flashing early signs of recovery, while others continue to trade under pressure. Pi (PI) and Cardano (ADA) both show tentative bullish indicators, yet neither has broken out of their downtrends. Meanwhile, one project stands out with strong fundamentals, a live product, and a fast-moving presale: Reactor ($REACT). With nearly 10 million tokens already sold and a 66% early-bird discount still available, $REACT has become one of the most talked-about presales of the month. Here’s why it’s gaining traction while PI and ADA attempt to stabilize. Reactor Is Live, Trading, and Delivering: Why $REACT Is Selling Out Fast Many presales make promises. Reactor ($REACT) is already delivering. Reactor provides a unified terminal that aggregates spot markets on Perp DEXes, memecoin launchpads, and yield opportunities across DeFi — all in one professional-grade interface. It’s built for traders who want a faster, smarter, and cleaner way to navigate crypto without juggling ten different dashboards. And while the platform keeps expanding, early buyers can still access $REACT at a 66% presale discount before exchange listing. A Token With Real Utility and Real Revenue Behind It $REACT powers an entire trading ecosystem designed for simplicity, speed, and sustainable value. As more traders use Reactor’s tools, the platform earns commissions — and that revenue fuels buy-backs and token burns, reducing circulating supply over time. This creates a direct link between platform activity and token demand. Momentum is building fast: nearly 10 million tokens have already been sold in the presale. Why Early Buyers Are Rushing In Presale participants receive meaningful advantages that directly impact returns: Reduced platform fees (down to 0%) Staking boosted from 10% to 28% APY Early access to new platform apps Priority for new pools, features, allowlists, and partner drops These incentives give early holders clear utility from day one. The ecosystem is audited by Hacken and featured on top ICO rating platforms including CoinGabbar and ICOAnnouncement, adding a layer of trust rarely seen in early-stage projects. At the current discount, buyers are securing $REACT at the best price before demand escalates. Buy $REACT — Lock In Your 66% Early-Bird Discount PI Struggles Despite a Technical Bounce Pi (PI) recently rebounded from a critical support area at $0.2235, the November 30 low. Momentum indicators show signs of recovery, but the trend remains fragile. PI printed a hidden bullish RSI divergence on the 24-hour chart — a potential early reversal signal. Traders may interpret this as a dip-buying opportunity, but resistance remains heavy. Key Levels $0.2316: Immediate resistance $0.2486: 7-day SMA acting as dynamic resistance Until PI breaks through these levels, upside remains limited. The bounce is encouraging, but the larger structure shows consolidation rather than a decisive trend shift. ADA Faces Oversold Conditions but Fights Strong Resistance Cardano (ADA) has had a challenging month, dropping 35% in the last 30 days. Momentum indicators hint at early bullish interest, yet ADA remains trapped below key moving averages. As the RSI (14-day) stands at 26.91, ADA is hovering near historic reversal zones associated with past trend recoveries. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram at 0.0028 marks the first bullish crossover since November 2025, signaling improving momentum beneath the surface. Dip-buyers are showing interest, but structural resistance still caps any meaningful upside. Critical Barriers $0.465: 61.8% Fibonacci retracement — immediate resistance $0.487: 30-day SMA — must be reclaimed to confirm a trend reversal Until ADA breaks above these levels, rallies remain vulnerable to rejection. Conclusion: $REACT Leads December’s Opportunities PI and ADA both show early signs of stabilization, but neither has reclaimed their key resistance levels. Their trend structures remain bearish despite encouraging momentum signals. Meanwhile, Reactor stands out with a live product, strong revenue-driven token utility, presale discounts, and a rapidly expanding user base. With nearly 10 million tokens sold and a 66% discount still active, $REACT presents a clearer, more compelling opportunity for December than assets still battling their downtrends.

Source: Lookonchain On-chain tracker Lookonchain reported that the address starting with 0x2dCA woke up after long dormancy and began transferring ETH in batches to a new wallet. From there, the coins flowed in multiple 32-ETH transactions to the Beacon Deposit Contract, which is used to activate Ethereum validators. Because each validator requires 32 ETH, the 40,000 ETH position is enough to run around 1,250 validators. As the screenshot from Etherscan indicates, the new wallet repeatedly sent 32 ETH “Deposit” transactions to the Beacon contract over the past few minutes. The original wallet received its ETH during Ethereum’s 2014 initial coin offering and had not shown activity since then. Now, instead of sending the coins to trading venues, the owner has locked them into Ethereum’s proof-of-stake system, shifting the funds from liquid supply into long-term staking. Whale Sends 10,176 ETH to Kraken After 100-Day sETH Hold An Ethereum whale moved 10,176 ETH, worth about $28.69 million, to Kraken after unwinding a large stETH position, on-chain data shows. The address converted the staked ETH (sETH) back to ETH, then sent the full stack to the exchange in two large deposits. Whale ETH Deposit to Kraken. Source: Onchain Lens The wallet, tagged “Token Millionaire” and identified as 0xd908995fd431eb0078cd35e912ff14e45043818f, can be tracked for roughly five years, according to Nansen. Back in 2019, the same entity withdrew 21,086 ETH valued at $7.35 million and has since been slowly returning coins to exchanges. Now, with this latest 10,176 ETH transfer following a 100-day hold in sETH, the whale has pushed a major chunk of its historical stash back toward trading venues. ETH Breakout Accelerates as Price Clears Key Resistance Levels Ethereum’s chart shows a decisive breakout after reclaiming two major horizontal zones that capped price action through the second half of the year. The move above the first resistance near the 3,000–3,100 USD area shifted momentum, while the clean push through the 3,600–3,700 USD band confirmed strength and removed the last major supply block before higher targets. Ethereum Breakout Structure. Source: GordonGekko The chart highlights how ETH built a base around 2,650 USD, where buyers repeatedly absorbed sell pressure. That zone acted as the cycle’s main demand layer. Each rebound from this region strengthened the structure and narrowed the distance to the overhead levels. Once ETH drove through the upper resistance, candles extended vertically. This shows aggressive follow-through, with very little pause between sessions. The current trend reflects strong market conviction, as the breakout did not face meaningful rejection after retesting the range. Gordon’s post frames the move as a setup for a broader upside continuation. His chart underscores that ETH has removed the major barriers visible on the daily timeframe. With both resistance shelves now behind price, the structure points to open air above, although traders still watch for potential retests or consolidation phases after such a steep run.",News|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-02 14:04:53

It can unlock new opportunities or slow innovation for years. XRP now stands at a critical moment where policy choices may determine how far the asset can advance in institutional markets. The discussion intensified after a post from Versan Aljarrah, founder of Black Swan Capitalist, highlighted a regulatory irony shaping XRP’s future. His observation revived an important debate about rule-making, power, and the timeline for true institutional adoption. Why Regulatory Clarity Matters for XRP Regulatory clarity reduces legal uncertainty for global banks and payment firms . Institutions cannot scale operations around XRP without defined rules. Clear guidelines help custodians, exchanges, and settlement platforms manage compliance risks. Once those risks shrink, adoption becomes easier and faster. For XRP to truly thrive, you need clear regulations. The funny thing is the very same people stalling the regulations are the ones writing the rules that will eventually enforce it. — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) December 1, 2025 XRP’s use case in global payments depends on trust. Trust improves when institutions understand the legal boundaries for holding and transferring digital assets. Defined rules also encourage long-term investment from firms that avoid unregulated markets. Shifts in Global Policy and Their Impact Several jurisdictions are pushing clearer frameworks for digital assets. Countries in Europe and Asia already recognize the value of structured oversight. These frameworks help shape a global environment where Ripple and XRP can operate more efficiently. Regulatory progress in major markets usually sparks renewed interest in enterprise blockchain solutions. As clarity expands, more financial institutions explore settlement tools that reduce costs and improve transaction speed. The Policy Paradox Versan noted a striking contradiction within the regulatory process. Many officials delaying crypto rules are also the ones drafting future enforcement policies. This paradox slows innovation while granting those same officials ultimate authority over the final framework. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Their hesitation affects institutions waiting for certainty before committing large capital. Once these regulators finish drafting rules, they become the same entities responsible for enforcing them. That shift alters the balance of power and opens the door to broader adoption. The Key Milestone XRP Needs to Thrive XRP will thrive when regulators clearly define asset classification , custody standards, and settlement rules. The market needs guidance that supports institutional use without ambiguity. Clear legal definitions help exchanges, liquidity providers, and enterprise users adopt XRP with confidence. With rules in place, capital can flow more freely into compliant XRP products. Payment firms can integrate XRP without fear of sudden enforcement or policy changes. Clear regulation becomes the foundation for global scaling. What Comes Next for XRP XRP’s long-term narrative remains strong, but regulation will decide its pace of growth. Once policymakers finalize clear rules, institutional interest can accelerate. Versan Aljarrah’s insight captures this reality with precision. The pathway to XRP’s success starts with regulatory clarity , and that clarity is slowly taking shape. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Fed reserve balances are stabilizing, signaling potential easing of market tensions and improved outlook for risky assets like BTC. Long-term holders’ selling pressure has subsided, with signs of renewed accumulation supporting a bullish continuation. Current conditions present a high-volatility window viewed as an opportunity to accumulate more Bitcoin within an ongoing uptrend. To determine whether we are facing a Bitcoin (BTC-USD) correction that may end in the short term or a macro trend change that would turn us bearish over the medium and long term, analyzing the narratives that move the market will help us assess whether what is happening can really affect economic growth, which would be a bearish signal or on the contrary we are facing a mere corrective phase within an upward cycle. Bticoin Price Weekly (Seeking Alpha) Macro: Liquidity Tightening It is undeniable that since 2023, the entire crypto sector (with Bitcoin as the main gateway) has taken a big step forward in terms of adoption at the political/legal level and, especially, at the institutional level with the launch of ETFs and their connection to TradFi. And with that, Bitcoin has also evolved and its behavior right now is closely linked to global liquidity. US - SOFR Minus IORB Spread (MacroMicro Web) This correction started after the all-time high (ATH) set in early October. In the image above, we have the SOFR–IORB spread. SOFR is the rate on overnight repo transactions backed by Treasury collateral while the IORB is the interest that the Fed pays to banks to hold their reserves at the Fed. The spread serves as a reference to determine how tight liquidity is in the system. Since the end of August, tensions have been rising but especially since the low of 8 October, the spread has soared and since then has been in the positive range and in recent weeks (20 NOV) has rebounded strongly. In other words, this shortage of reserves puts banks in an “uncomfortable” position to comply with regulations and increases the risk of falling short in making payments/settlements, so they demand a higher premium for providing liquidity to the repo market. These requirements affect all repo operations: more haircuts, reduced maturities, lower “rehypothecation” of collateral, etc. All in all, operations become less profitable and the volume traded falls, with risky assets suffering the most from these tensions. FRED: WRESBAL (FRED Web) If we look at the data on reserve balances at the Fed, they currently stand at around 2.8–2.9 trillion dollars, which is roughly the same as the previous floor of January 2023. However, since December 1 the Fed has already implemented the end of QT, and therefore this suggests that reserve levels are forming a floor and that, from now on, they will most likely start to increase again, alleviating market tensions and improving expectations for risky assets. Bitcon vs DXY (Node Analytica) On the other hand, the dollar has been rebounding since September from its summer 2025 low. A strong dollar is negative for bitcoin and risky assets because it implies less liquidity (of dollars) in the market, which in turn reinforces their demand and increases the supply of other currencies, reinforcing the appreciation of the dollar itself. On the other hand, it also makes government funding more expensive and increases hedging costs. However, in recent weeks it seems to be encountering resistance that, if not exceeded, could mark the limit of the rise and a rejection with a return to lower levels that serve as a boost for risky assets and specifically, bitcoin. Onchain: LTH Selling Pressure LTH Spending Binary Indicator (Node Analytica) Finally, the LTH Spending Binary Indicator graph compares the volume of coins spent by addresses identified as LTHs (coins that have been held for more than 155 days) with the total supply of coins held by LTHs. This helps us to identify if the sales of these entities are being very aggressive (level 1) or conversely the expenditure is not being significant (level 0). LTH Spending Binary Indicator (Node Analytica) If we zoom in, we see the accumulation behavior on the rise and how they start a strong distribution from July's ATH. This behavior is common in this type of cohorts and they are part of the bullish cycles: when bitcoin reaches new price zones, the LTH usually take profits, these coins are usually absorbed by the STH (short term holders) and when demand is stifled, corrections begin that are aggravated by “weak hands” that panic and sell at a loss and internal market mechanics (excessive leverage, etc.). Currently, the worst seems to be over and we consider another rebound in the indicator unlikely, given that supply (orange line) has fallen below levels earlier this year. In recent days, a turn in the accumulation of LTH can be seen that may indicate the end of the correction and mark the beginning of the consolidation of this support level, which is a stage of accumulation that pushes the price higher again. Conclusion The market is mainly reacting to liquidity tensions in the repo markets and to the Fed’s recent policy moves. While it is true that the SOFR-IORB spread has recently picked up again, it is a structural factor that depends on the Fed’s monetary policy and Treasury account movements (as major proxies), the US economy is doing well, so I see no reason to turn bearish in the medium term. On the other hand, as long as the DXY does not overcome that resistance, it will most likely turn around again. Similarly, the selling pressure from big holders has evaporated, and the worst is over. Not only that, but it seems that a change in behavior is happening and they are starting to accumulate again, a classic sign of capitulation during corrections within a broader bull market. From all angles, the common insight is that the worst seems to be over, that the current situation is a market correction within an uptrend, not a trend change. From the points of view analyzed, we are likely to be already in the final phase and starting a new accumulation trend that drives the price up. For all these reasons, and assuming that we are now in a period of high volatility in the short term, we consider the current moment an opportunity to accumulate more Bitcoin.",BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-02 14:07:36

The indicator dropped below 10 on the 100-point scale, reaching levels last seen during previous bear market conclusions. On-Chain Mind, a cryptocurrency analyst, highlighted the development in a social media post . The velocity RSI on Bitcoin's three-day chart recorded its lowest reading since the bottom of the last three bear markets. This metric tracks recent price momentum changes and serves as a widely monitored indicator of exhaustion. The velocity RSI on Bitcoin's three-day chart. Source: On-Chain Mind/X Historical Context Points to Cyclical Reset The current reading mirrors chart patterns from Bitcoin's 2018 bear market bottom. Similar conditions also emerged in mid-2022, approximately six months before the most recent bear market established its long-term floor. Traders consider this one of the more reliable momentum indicators for identifying cyclical turning points. The signal arrives as Bitcoin price comparisons to previous bear markets have intensified in recent weeks. Extreme oversold conditions typically indicate that selling pressure has reached unsustainable levels. These readings have consistently preceded significant market recoveries in Bitcoin's trading history. A separate development has caught the attention of market analysts. Bitcoin's long/short ratio has entered unprecedented territory, displaying behavior that deviates from past cycles. Joao Wedson, founder of crypto analytics platform Alphractal, observed an unusual pattern. The long/short ratio typically rises above the average of major altcoins at price bottoms. This relationship has served as a reliable indicator for years. However, the current cycle presents a different scenario. Bitcoin maintained extremely elevated long/short ratios for an extended period throughout November. Despite this, the price continued declining while generating false bottom signals. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $87,498, representing a 2.02% increase over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap Potential Risks for Bullish Traders This deviation from historical patterns carries implications for market participants. Traders attempting to establish long positions during the downturn may face increased risk. The elevated long/short ratio suggests an abundance of bullish positions in the market. Large-volume players could exploit this positioning by driving prices lower to trigger liquidations. This dynamic creates a challenging environment for traders attempting to time a market bottom. The concentration of long positions at elevated levels provides liquidity for further downside moves. The combination of an oversold velocity RSI and unusual long/short ratio behavior creates a complex technical landscape. While the velocity RSI suggests exhaustion conditions typical of market bottoms, the long/short ratio pattern indicates potential vulnerability for bullish positioning.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|SECURITY INCIDENTS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-02 14:09:11

The Crypto Fear and Greed Index sits near 16 after dropping from 20 , yet Bitcoin has climbed back towards $90,000, recovering about 6% from the previous session’s lows. Bitcoin Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) The contrast between a lagging sentiment reading and a modest intraday rebound captures the uncertainty that still shapes early December after two difficult months for risk assets. Most altcoins continue to struggle, and liquidity remains concentrated in Bitcoin and stablecoins. Still, a few tokens show green numbers today. SKY, Pump.fun’s PUMP token, and the Pudgy Penguins linked PENGU coin each move higher, giving a view into where capital still participates when sentiment remains defensive. Pudgy Penguins Supported By Brand Interest PENGU is now trading above $0.011 , up by around 22% today. Liquidity is thinner than in larger meme names, but price has remained firm as renewed attention around the Pudgy Penguins brand and related licensing efforts continues to circulate in community channels. The link between a well-known NFT collection and the Solana-based token helps explain why PENGU shows strength when many smaller meme tokens remain under pressure, since traders often gravitate toward recognisable themes during risk-off stretches. Sky Protocol Buybacks Lift Token SKY is currently trading near $0.57 , up by about 18% in 24 hours, with volume running ahead of recent averages. Market data show the token holding above the support zone formed during last week’s decline, which indicates that buyers have not stepped away immediately after the first bounce. In November, Sky Protocol bought back 154 million SKY using 7.8 million USDS. This brings total buybacks to over 88 million USDS since the program began. pic.twitter.com/yqfgt1HQ3U — Sky (@SkyEcosystem) December 1, 2025 Sky Protocol disclosed that it bought back 154 million SKY in November using 7.8 million USDS, lifting total buyback spending above 88 million USDS since the program began. These steady purchases help absorb supply during fearful phases and maintain focus on the protocol’s stablecoin and collateral model, providing a clear explanation for today’s move without relying on speculation. Pump.fun Sees Consistent Solana Activity Pump.fun’s PUMP token is trading around $0.003 , up by roughly 16% in 24 hours. Trading screens show active participation across several venues, supported by steady issuance on the Pump.fun launchpad and strong traffic in Solana’s meme markets. The constant flow of new pairs and reliable engagement across social channels keeps the token visible even on days where risk appetite is thin. These factors give PUMP a degree of resilience during broader market pullbacks, and today’s move fits that pattern. Altcoin Season Still Out Of Reach SKY, PUMP, and PENGU show that isolated gains can occur even in extreme fear, but they do not signal a wide altcoin recovery. Bitcoin’s drop toward $80,000 this week and a sentiment reading near record lows keep trading conditions tight, with most flows concentrated in high liquidity assets rather than mid-caps. Until fear subsides for more than a single session and rotation improves across a wider set of large altcoins, these moves will remain pockets of strength rather than evidence that altcoin season has returned.

Here’s What 4 AIs Expect for Bitcoin,https://cryptopotato.com/50k-or-120k-by-christmas-heres-what-4-ais-expect-for-bitcoin/,"November was not a good month for the Bitcoin (BTC) bulls, since the asset’s price tumbled by approximately 17%. Instead of bringing some hope, December delivered even more pain, and now the big question is whether the valuation will collapse to $50,000 or stage a resurgence to $120,000 by Christmas. To gain a clearer perspective, we decided to ask four of the most popular AI-powered chatbots for their take on the matter. What’s More Likely? ChatGPT suggested that a sharp decline to $50K before December 25 is possible but would require a major negative catalyst. Such events would be a meltdown of a popular crypto exchange (similar to what happened with FTX in 2022) or a new military conflict across the globe. The chatbot assumed that an unexpected Federal Reserve interest rate hike could also have the same effect. America’s central bank will decide on December 10 whether to cut, raise, or keep the benchmark unchanged, and as of this writing, the odds of a 0.25% decrease stand at 90%. Fed Decision in December, Source: Polymarket ChatGPT sees a slightly bigger chance of a pump to $120K before Christmas. Nonetheless, such a price explosion would depend heavily on factors like renewed institutional inflows into spot BTC ETFs, a massive buying spree by whales, and overall macro optimism. In conclusion, the chatbot estimated that the most likely scenario for the leading digital asset is to hover between $70,000 and $95,000 through December. Grok took a far more bullish stance, insisting that a collapse to $50,000 before Christmas is simply off the table for BTC. “That level implies a 43% plunge from here, defying the liquidity floodgates opening this month (QT end, stimulus). Expect consolidation around $86K-$90K early December, then a push to $110K-$120K by December 25 if resistance cracks. A true bear market feels premature in this bull cycle; we’re in “teenage volatility” en route to maturity.” Other Opinions Perplexity also leaned toward the bullish target. It claimed BTC is more likely to test $120,000 than plummet to $50,000 based on technical setups and macro tailwinds outweighing short-term consolidation risks. For its part, Google’s Gemini said both levels represent “extreme ends of the spectrum” with strong arguments for both. At the same time, the chatbot estimated that a return to $50K is less probable than a jump to $120K despite the current bearish sentiment. The post $50K or $120K by Christmas?

The Fusaka upgrade is almost here. PeerDAS (EIP-7594) is one of the key features helping Ethereum securely scale. It unlocks up to 8x data throughput. For rollups, this means cheaper blob fees and more space to grow. pic.twitter.com/0AUv3e7QP5 — Ethereum (@ethereum) December 2, 2025 Today, the majority of economic activity generated by rollups—including MEV extraction, sequencing revenue, and transaction ordering—remains siloed at the L2 level, accruing to independent operators rather than to Ethereum itself. New analysis from on-chain intelligence firm Nansen suggests that Fusaka may shift this balance. A New Foundation for Based Rollups Fusaka introduces the technical infrastructure required for “based rollups,” a model where Ethereum validators take over the responsibility of sequencing transactions for L2s. Instead of relying on external or proprietary sequencers, L2s could integrate directly with Ethereum’s validator set, aligning their incentives more tightly with the base layer. “Fusaka itself does not guarantee value accrual to ETH, but it enables it,” said Nicolai Søndergaard, Research Analyst at Nansen. “The upgrade introduces the base infrastructure for based rollups, where Ethereum validators take over L2 sequencing.” Søndergaard explained that if rollups adopt this structure, L2 MEV would begin flowing to ETH stakers, fee burn would increase due to higher blob demand, validator rewards would rise through pre-confirmation revenue, and Ethereum would start capturing a greater share of the economic activity that currently accumulates at the L2 level. He explains, however, that none of this is automatic. The long-term impact depends entirely on whether L2 teams choose to abandon their existing sequencing models. Capital Markets Anticipate Structural Improvements The potential benefits of Fusaka extend beyond validator economics. According to Edwin Mata, CEO and co-founder of enterprise tokenization platform Brickken, the upgrade represents a material improvement to Ethereum’s settlement architecture. With reduced data loads for rollups and validators, the network becomes more predictable in both performance and cost, a key requirement for regulated institutions assessing whether a public blockchain can support issuance and post-trade processes at scale. Mata notes that this predictability is essential for capital-market participants who need reliable settlement environments. By strengthening Ethereum’s consistency, Fusaka enhances its appeal as a venue for institutional-grade financial activity. A More Efficient Environment for Tokenized Assets For the growing real-world asset sector, Fusaka could streamline key operational mechanics. Lower fees and increased throughput on L2s create a more efficient sector for the lifecycle of tokenized instruments, allowing for smoother transfers, faster reconciliations, and greater dependability during distribution events. Mata also pointed out the upgrade’s impact on network resilience. Fusaka lowers the operational threshold for node participation, which broadens the validator base and reduces concentration risk. For financial markets that depend on systems with no single point of failure, greater decentralization is a fundamental advantage. As the Ethereum ecosystem prepares for Fusaka, analysts and industry leaders will be watching whether L2s embrace the base-rollup model. If they do, the upgrade could mark a turning point in how Ethereum captures value from the ecosystem it anchors.

The partnership introduced a new service that allows users to send digital assets and deliver Nigerian naira to local accounts within minutes. This development gives Nigeria, Africa’s largest market, another on-chain payment path at a time when demand for low-cost cross-border options continues to rise. Moreover, users face rising pressure from slow settlement systems, expensive fees, and limited access to modern payout channels. Hence, the new integration arrives as a timely response to the sector’s need for faster digital solutions. RedotPay Targets Faster NGN Transfers Through Stablecoins and XRP According to the press release , RedotPay expanded its stablecoin utility by integrating Ripple Payments into its multi-market payout stack. The company introduced the “Send Crypto, Receive NGN” feature for verified users with Nigerian bank accounts. The service supports USDC, USDT, BTC, ETH, SOL, TON, S, TRX, XRP, and BNB. Additionally, RLUSD will join the list later. Users now convert digital assets into naira within minutes, reducing friction across Nigeria’s high-demand remittance market. Michael Gao, RedotPay’s CEO and Co-Founder, said the company wants digital assets to function like local currency in practical payments. He noted that the expansion strengthens RedotPay’s cross-border utility and supports users seeking faster payouts. Besides, RedotPay aims to address rising global remittance challenges. Traditional transfers often charge average fees of 6.49% and take up to five business days. Consequently, users increasingly shift toward digital alternatives that offer transparent pricing and faster delivery. Addressing Regional and Global Remittance Barriers Chainalysis data shows strong growth across Asia Pacific for on-chain stablecoin transfers. However, Africa also records rising interest as users seek efficient payout channels. Nigeria anchors much of this demand due to its large youth population and strong digital adoption rates. Moreover, friction in traditional remittance pipelines drives users toward faster settlement layers. Nigeria’s regulatory environment continues to evolve. The Nigerian SEC updated marketing rules for crypto firms and highlighted concerns around harmful activities during past enforcement actions. However, regulators later clarified that compliant services can continue operations. This environment gives digital payment providers space to introduce responsible products. Multi-Market Expansion Strengthens Ripple’s Utility RedotPay already supports payouts in Brazil and Mexico. Hence, the Nigeria rollout expands its footprint across emerging markets. Young professionals, freelancers, and global workers form the core user base for these services. The company continues to build solutions that meet multi-currency demands. Conclusion Ripple’s partnership with RedotPay adds significant momentum to Africa’s growing crypto-enabled remittance economy. Additionally, the NGN payout option strengthens both firms’ strategies in building faster, cheaper, and more reliable global payment tools.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|SPONSORED|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-02 17:19:17

This will enable crypto projects to issue tokens without full SEC registration. During a CNBC interview , Atkins asserted that the agency is looking to move forward with the innovation exemption rules for crypto firms in the next month or so. This, he said, is part of the plan for the crypto industry to move away from the anti-crypto stance under the previous administration. Crypto firms are to launch products even faster This policy was first proposed in July 2025 to foster blockchain innovation. Initially, Atkins hinted that the innovation exemption would be established before the end of the year. However, Atkins explained during the interview that the US government shutdown, which lasted throughout October and into November, derailed their plans as they were unable to do anything during that period. The innovation exemption rules will enable crypto firms to launch products more quickly, particularly in the DeFi space. As reported by Cryptopolitan, Atkins aims to provide people with a fair opportunity to work on new technologies without fear of the SEC taking sudden action against them. We’ve had four years of repression in that industry, and it pushed innovation abroad rather than keeping it here My goal now is to make people feel they can build in the United States without fearing unclear regulations. Paul Atkins. To that end, the exemptions will allow a slew of decentralized projects and platforms to test their ideas without burning millions on lawyers first, while giving regulators a front-row seat to see how this stuff actually works. In this way, these companies will be able to circumvent these laws until Congress passes the crypto market structure bill, which establishes a comprehensive set of laws for regulating cryptocurrencies. The SEC works on the technical part of the crypto bill Atkins mentioned the crypto bill, stating that they were assisting lawmakers with the technical aspects. However, he stated that the SEC has enough power to authorize the innovation exemption. However, as previously stated, companies that participate may be required to report periodically to the SEC in exchange for the flexibility to innovate within defined guardrails. In addition, Atkins stated that the Commission aims to transform many of the ideas discussed in 2025 into formal rules. This will happen by adding a token taxonomy, making specific exemptions, and changing the market-structure rules that are already in place. Although these events show real progress toward clearer regulations, there are still important questions that need to be addressed. The direction of the US digital asset market in 2026 and beyond will depend on when and how much the upcoming “Regulation Crypto” plan is coordinated with Congress, as well as how the SEC and CFTC interact with each other. When asked about prediction markets, Atkins stated that the sector is regulated by the CFTC, but he noted that Americans are generally risk-takers. Make IPO’s great again The SEC chair also stated that the commission plans to implement policies next year to boost initial public offerings. He stated that the agency is looking to modernize the rule book to make the regulation fit for purpose. This marks a positive for crypto firms such as Kraken, Grayscale, and BitGo that are looking to go public in the US. Additionally, he stated that the agency is also looking at the US litigation situation. This is in order to set free companies that have been delayed from going public. He also mentioned that corporate governance issues that have been weaponized by a group of people to delay innovations will be looked into. Atkins will join Nasdaq’s CEO, Adena Friedman, for a discussion today on how to make IPOs great again. He also hinted at a major speech today as he rings the bell at the NYSE, which could border on crypto regulations and the commission’s plans to create a more friendly regulatory environment for the crypto industry.

Confirmed in a statement shared with Yahoo Finance, the move marks a major integration of Bitcoin products into the banking sector to date and indicates a rising appetite for digital assets among large U.S. institutions. BofA’s New Crypto Access Marks Turning Point Ahead of Potential Stablecoin Launch Until now, Bank of America’s wealthiest clients could only access Bitcoin ETFs by directly requesting them, leaving advisers unable to initiate any crypto-related recommendations. However, starting January 5, clients of Merrill, Bank of America Private Bank, and Merrill Edge will gain streamlined access to four spot Bitcoin ETFs. These include the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust, and BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust. The bank is pairing this access with formal guidance that encourages clients to consider a small crypto allocation. Bank of America’s chief investment officer, Chris Hyzy, said clients with an interest in innovation and an understanding of market swings could consider a 1% to 4% allocation to digital assets. He noted that the lower end of the range may be suitable for conservative investors, while those with a higher tolerance for portfolio swings may consider the upper end. Hyzy stressed that the bank’s guidance remains focused on regulated investment vehicles and informed decision-making. Source: Forbes Bank of America, which holds roughly $2.67 trillion in consolidated assets and operates more than 3,600 branches, said the shift reflects rising demand from its client base. The decision arrives as several other major U.S. financial institutions move deeper into crypto markets. Morgan Stanley, in October, suggested that investors consider a 2%–4% allocation to crypto . Morgan Stanley’s Global Investment Committee advises investors to keep a cautious 2%–4% of portfolios in crypto, tied to risk appetite. #MorganStanley #CryptoPortfolio https://t.co/Y9lycldVbs — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 6, 2025 In January, BlackRock told clients that a 1%–2% Bitcoin allocation falls within a reasonable range, arguing that Bitcoin now carries a risk profile comparable to major tech stocks such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Nvidia. Fidelity has also made a similar recommendation, stating that a 2%–5% Bitcoin allocation could offer upside while managing downside exposure. Additionally, in June, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said the firm has completed substantial groundwork on launching its own stablecoin , though the timeline will depend on regulatory clarity. He added that the bank intends to meet customer demand when conditions allow. Major Banks Deepen Crypto Push as Vanguard, Goldman, and JPMorgan Expand Services Beyond investment guidance, several major banks have accelerated their broader crypto plans. Vanguard, after years of hesitation, has begun allowing customers to trade crypto-focused ETFs and mutual funds on its U.S. brokerage platform. Vanguard will allow trading of crypto-focused ETFs and mutual funds starting Tuesday, opening access to Bitcoin, Ether and other tokens for millions of investors. #Vanguard #CryptoETFs https://t.co/mmU1DdIi7s — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 2, 2025 Goldman Sachs recently agreed to acquire Innovator Capital Management , adding a set of defined-outcome ETFs, including a Bitcoin-linked product, to its asset-management division. JPMorgan Chase has ramped up crypto integrations as well, allowing customers to fund Coinbase accounts using Chase credit cards. Meanwhile, regulators in the United States and abroad are shaping the environment in which these institutions will operate. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency recently confirmed that national banks may hold crypto on their balance sheets for activities such as paying blockchain transaction fees.

A survey from crypto payments firm Zerohash found that 35% of young, high-earning Americans have already moved money away from advisers who do not offer crypto exposure. More than 80% said their confidence in digital assets increased as major institutions adopted them. The study also found strong demand for access to a wider range of digital assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum.

The platform announced the listing of DASH perpetual futures , expanding its derivatives offerings and providing new opportunities for market participants. This development marks another step in the institutionalization of cryptocurrency trading. What Are DASH Perpetual Futures and Why Do They Matter? Perpetual futures represent a popular derivative product in crypto markets. Unlike traditional futures with expiration dates, these contracts continue indefinitely. The listing of DASH perpetual futures on Coinbase International provides traders with several advantages: Continuous exposure to DASH price movements Ability to hedge existing DASH positions Access to leverage for amplified trading strategies Increased liquidity for the DASH ecosystem This move demonstrates Coinbase’s commitment to expanding its product suite beyond spot trading. Moreover, it signals growing institutional interest in alternative cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. How Does This Benefit the DASH Ecosystem? The introduction of DASH perpetual futures creates multiple positive effects for the DASH network. First, it increases overall visibility and trading volume for the cryptocurrency. Second, it provides institutional traders with more sophisticated tools to interact with DASH markets. Finally, it enhances price discovery mechanisms through derivative markets. Coinbase International’s decision follows careful consideration of market demand and regulatory compliance. The exchange has established itself as a trusted platform, therefore this listing carries significant weight in the crypto community. Traders now have access to DASH derivatives through a regulated international exchange. What Should Traders Consider Before Trading DASH Perpetual Futures? While the listing of DASH perpetual futures presents exciting opportunities, traders should approach with proper understanding. Derivative trading involves unique risks compared to spot trading. Key considerations include: Leverage risks and potential for amplified losses Funding rate mechanisms in perpetual contracts Market volatility specific to DASH price movements Platform-specific trading rules and fees Successful traders typically combine technical analysis with fundamental understanding of the DASH ecosystem. They also implement proper risk management strategies when trading derivatives. Remember that perpetual futures require monitoring of funding rates that periodically transfer between long and short positions. The Future of Crypto Derivatives on Major Exchanges Coinbase International’s listing of DASH perpetual futures represents a broader trend in cryptocurrency markets. Major exchanges continue expanding their derivative offerings to meet growing institutional demand. This development potentially paves the way for more alternative cryptocurrency derivatives on regulated platforms. The crypto derivatives market has experienced tremendous growth in recent years. However, regulatory clarity remains an evolving landscape. Coinbase’s approach suggests careful navigation of these waters while expanding product offerings. This balance between innovation and compliance will likely shape future exchange developments. Conclusion: A Strategic Expansion for Both Platform and Token Coinbase International’s decision to list DASH perpetual futures benefits multiple stakeholders. Traders gain access to new financial instruments, the DASH ecosystem receives increased attention and liquidity, and Coinbase expands its market position. This move reflects the continuing maturation of cryptocurrency markets toward more sophisticated financial products. As the crypto industry evolves, such developments bridge traditional finance mechanisms with blockchain innovation. The listing demonstrates how established cryptocurrencies like DASH continue finding new avenues for growth and adoption through strategic exchange partnerships and product expansions. Frequently Asked Questions What are perpetual futures? Perpetual futures are derivative contracts without expiration dates that track an underlying asset’s price. They use funding rate mechanisms to maintain alignment with spot prices. Why did Coinbase International choose DASH for this listing? Coinbase likely selected DASH based on market demand, trading volume, and the cryptocurrency’s established position in the market as a privacy-focused digital currency with a strong community. Can US-based traders access these DASH perpetual futures? Coinbase International serves non-US customers. US-based traders should check Coinbase’s US platform for available products and comply with local regulations. How do funding rates work in perpetual futures? Funding rates are periodic payments between long and short position holders that help perpetual contract prices track spot prices. Rates typically fluctuate based on market conditions. What risks should I consider before trading DASH perpetual futures? Key risks include leverage amplification of losses, funding rate costs, market volatility, liquidity constraints, and platform-specific risks. Always conduct thorough research first.

Analysts indicate that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is displaying emerging signs that may see the company emerge as one of the best cryptocurrencies to purchase by the year 2026. The token is already up 250%, and the milestones of development achieved, and the interest in MUTM is gaining traction – and the clock is now running. Presale Growth and Increasing Rates of Participation Mutuum finance began its token sale in early 2025, starting at $0.01. This gradual demand in all stages propelled the price to $0.035 thus indicating a gradual not a sharp increase. Over $19M has been raised so far and the community has expanded to above 18,300 holders making MUTM one of the busiest early-stage offerings of the year. More than 800M MUTM tokens have been sold already. It is at Phase 6 which is already more than 95% allocated and only little is left at the $0.035 level before the price is brought nearer to the launch price of $0.06. The frequency of user activity is maintained with a 24-hour leaderboard, with the best contributor winning $500 in MUTM. Coupled with direct payments with the cards, this framework ensures simplicity in onboarding even to new guests and has contributed to faster remaining allocation. As demand increases and supply decreases, MUTM has become the currency under study of many investors than the majority of other leading crypto competitors. What Mutuum Finance is Constructing Mutuum Finance is building a red-tailed borrowing protocol to provide stability, regularized borrowing and structured yield. The system works based on the two lending markets where borrowers and lenders can deal with each other with precise collateral protocols, interest frameworks and inbuilt guarantees. One of the main peculiarities of the platform is the mtToken system. In cases where users provide assets, they are provided with mtTokens which will grow in value whenever the borrower makes interest payments. This enables users to receive APY on the actual protocol activity rather than the rewarding of inflation. A priority has been on security. Mutuum Finance received a 90/100 rating with a CertiK audit along with their lending contracts still being revisited by Halborn Security . These measures promote confidence with the project on the verge of being released to the public. Stablecoin and Oracle Framework Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to launch a native USD-pegged stablecoin that will assist in increasing the liquidity and enabling predictable borrowing. The stablecoin is going to be minted and burned on demand. Precise pricing is vital in the DeFi lending business, and Chainlink oracles, fallback feeds, and on-chain price indices will be incorporated in Mutuum Finance to ensure safe liquidations and stable collateral responses according to the official Roadmap. This will cushion the platform in cases of unstable markets. Since the protocol integrates as a yield-generating underground token, buyback design, stablecoins usefulness and precise price feed, analysts pursuing early lending sites like MUTM are optimistic that this protocol might shift into the $0.30 range in a robust 2026 cycle. Out of the existing price of $0.035, this is a potential multi-X move. V1 Launch and Phase 6 Pressure Mutuum Finance affirmed that V1 will be deployed on the Sepolia Testnet in the Q4 of 2025 in line with its official X account. This launch will bring the liquidity pool, mtToken characteristics, liquidation bot, debt-tracking system and ETH and USDT support. Prior availability of a working Testnet will present a stark difference between the project and most other altcoins at the early development stage who roll out their systems with no functional technology. Phase 6 allocation has also increased with the approach of the V1 launch. Demand has risen twenty-fold as more than 95% of tokens were filled and the remaining small share costing less than $0.04. A recent allocation of whales of over $100K dropped the remaining supply to even lower. Whaling during this period is frequently an indication of a high level of confidence in the future release and tends to move the momentum during the last phases of a presale. To people following the top crypto to purchase in 2026, the wealth of diminishing supply, robust security audit, efficient Testnet planning and increasingly active community involvement have seen MUTM become one of the most observed early-stage projects in Q4 2025.

In a post shared via the official BubbleMaps page on X, they called the token, which recently saw explosive growth, a “ticking time bomb.” BubbleMaps called the memecoin a dead meme that suddenly “pumped 1,000%.” The following line of the post revealed “insiders control half the supply, worth $120M.” According to BubbleMaps, $PIPPIN’s story started in 2024 when it was launched by the community in response to a VC identified as Yohei on X posting an AI-generated unicorn called “pippin.” Yohei also endorsed the memecoin after the launch as the token hit $330M FDV before crashing 90%, unable to sustain degen attention. By 2025, BubbleMaps claims most had written it off, and it stayed that way most of the year. However, in the past two weeks, $PIPPIN’s price pulled a 10x, from a $20M to $220M market cap, though there has been no major news, team updates, or posts on X in the past couple of months. PIPPIN/SOL price chart on Raydium. Source: BubbleMaps Why $PIPPIN could be a ticking time bomb BubbleMaps claims to have found up to 50 connected wallets that bought $19M worth of $PIPPIN. According to the platform, the wallets were found to have been funded by HTX in tight time windows, received similar amounts of SOL, and had no prior on-chain activity. 26 addresses that withdrew 44% of $PIPPIN from Gate over 2 months, worth $96M, were also tagged. BubbleMaps noted that most of the withdrawals occurred on October 24 and November 23, and most wallets were freshly funded. “The timing, amounts, and funding patterns suggest these wallets were coordinated,” BubbleMaps wrote, adding that they have escalated the case to their Intel Desk for a community-voted investigation. The high-profile warning from BubbleMaps aligns with general sentiment on Crypto Twitter. The shock from the sudden pump is still coloring perception, but there are already voices of reason amid the chaos calling attention to the numbers and the sheer volume of insiders. One user wrote that a crash was inevitable, and another, who believes the pico-top is in, claims there will be a dump to the $60M range. In the meantime, the team has remained quiet, and even the character that inspired it has kept mute. BubbleMaps sounded the Hawk Tuah insider trading alarm What is happening with $PIPPIN is a common theme in the memecoin space. A case that is currently in litigation, the HAWK token reportedly launched by Hailey Welch, the Hawk Tuah girl who went viral because of a TikTok meme. At the time of launch, Welch promoted the token as her official project, claiming 10% would be locked for the team and vested over three years, while 3% would be burned into LPs like Meteora and Raydium, and the rest would go to presale/community. The token launched at a $20M FDV and surged to a $490M–$500M market cap within minutes, triggering FOMO from retailers looking to make a quick buck. It was a trap because hours after the launch, the $HAWK token dropped by over 95% to hover between $25M and $40M. As it did with the $HAWK token, the frenzied PIPPIN rally has been flagged by BubbleMaps again. The first Hawk Tuah warning came minutes after launch, and another update about insider control and manipulation risks followed. What is happening with PIPPIN is a little different in that it is a meme that has survived a year in the trenches. However, BubbleMaps is convinced there is manipulation involved and a dump is imminent. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

On Tuesday, the EU’s top court said the company can be sued in the Netherlands for antitrust damages tied to its App Store practices. That decision opens the door for a massive €637 million claim filed by two Dutch consumer groups: Right to Consumer Justice and App Stores Claims. The groups argue that Apple’s app commission fees were abusive and unfairly hiked costs for millions of users. The lawsuit, which focuses on Apple’s 30% cut on in-app purchases, targets the company’s alleged dominance and how it charges developers using its system. According to lawyer Rogier Meijer from the law firm Hausfeld, who’s repping App Stores Claims, the estimated damage covers seven million iPhone users and seven million iPad users. That’s 14 million Dutch users in total. “On the basis of the available information, in the writ of summons the damage… was estimated at around €637 million (including statutory interest),” Rogier said. Dutch court allowed to proceed after Apple challenged jurisdiction Apple had tried to block the case by arguing that Dutch courts had no right to handle it. The company said the alleged harm didn’t happen in the Netherlands. But the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) completely rejected that. The judges ruled that since the App Store is localized for Dutch users, using the Dutch language and linking to Dutch Apple IDs, the impact was tied directly to the Netherlands. “The damage allegedly suffered when purchases are made in that virtual space can therefore occur in that territory, irrespective of the place where the users concerned were situated at the time of the purchase,” the judges said . That statement confirmed that territorial jurisdiction belonged to the Dutch court, and that international jurisdiction was valid, too. The two consumer foundations behind the case accuse Apple of abusing its dominant position and charging app makers excessive fees, which they claim was illegal. They say those fees were passed down to users, which inflated prices for millions of Dutch customers. The CJEU’s ruling came after a Dutch court asked the Luxembourg-based court for clarity on whether such a damages claim could go forward. Now that the green light has been given, the full hearing on the substance of the lawsuit is expected to take place in the Netherlands by Q1 2026, according to Rogier. If the Dutch court sides with the foundations, it could result in one of the biggest damages payouts Apple has ever faced in Europe. The lawsuit is now locked in, and Apple will have to defend its App Store fee model in front of a Dutch judge.

This Federal Reserve Chair nomination represents one of the most consequential economic decisions of his presidency, with potential ripple effects across traditional and cryptocurrency markets alike. For crypto investors, understanding this transition is essential, as Federal Reserve policies directly impact inflation, interest rates, and market liquidity. Why Does This Federal Reserve Chair Nomination Matter? The Federal Reserve Chair serves as the chief architect of U.S. monetary policy. This person controls interest rates, manages inflation targets, and oversees banking regulations. Therefore, the upcoming Federal Reserve Chair nomination will determine the economic direction for years to come. A hawkish chair might raise interest rates to combat inflation, potentially cooling risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a dovish chair could maintain accommodative policies, possibly fueling further market speculation. Trump’s previous appointments to the Fed have already shaped current policy. However, this nomination comes at a critical juncture. The global economy faces persistent inflation, geopolitical tensions, and technological disruption from digital assets. The new chair’s philosophy on digital currencies and financial innovation will be particularly relevant for crypto markets. What Are the Potential Impacts on Cryptocurrency? The connection between Federal Reserve policy and cryptocurrency valuations is becoming increasingly clear. Consider these key relationships: Interest Rate Decisions: Higher interest rates typically strengthen the U.S. dollar, creating headwinds for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that often trade inversely to dollar strength. Quantitative Tightening: If the new chair accelerates balance sheet reduction, it could drain liquidity from financial markets, affecting crypto trading volumes and investor sentiment. Regulatory Stance: The Fed chair influences banking regulations that affect cryptocurrency custody, banking partnerships, and institutional adoption. Historical patterns show that periods of monetary easing have correlated with crypto bull markets, while tightening cycles have often preceded corrections. Therefore, monitoring the Federal Reserve Chair nomination process provides valuable insight for strategic portfolio positioning. How Should Crypto Investors Prepare? While the nomination won’t be finalized until next year, forward-thinking investors can take several proactive steps. First, research the leading candidates’ published views on digital assets and financial technology. Second, consider diversifying across different crypto sectors that might respond differently to various monetary policies. Third, maintain a balanced portfolio that can withstand potential market volatility during the transition period. Remember that cryptocurrency markets often anticipate policy changes months in advance. The announcement of this Federal Reserve Chair nomination timeline itself may trigger market movements as investors position themselves for different potential outcomes. Staying informed through reliable sources will be crucial in the coming months. The Bigger Picture: Monetary Policy in the Digital Age This nomination occurs as central banks worldwide explore digital currencies and blockchain technology. The next Federal Reserve Chair will likely confront questions about a potential U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC) and appropriate regulatory frameworks for decentralized finance. Their approach could either accelerate or hinder cryptocurrency innovation in the United States. Moreover, the Fed’s credibility in managing inflation directly affects cryptocurrency’s appeal as an alternative store of value. When traditional monetary policy appears uncertain or ineffective, investors often turn to assets like Bitcoin as potential hedges. Thus, the success or failure of the next chair’s policies may indirectly influence cryptocurrency adoption rates. In conclusion, President Trump’s planned Federal Reserve Chair nomination represents more than a routine personnel change. It signals a potential shift in America’s economic stewardship with meaningful consequences for cryptocurrency investors. By understanding the connections between monetary policy and digital assets, informed investors can navigate this transition strategically rather than reactively. Frequently Asked Questions When exactly will Trump nominate the new Federal Reserve Chair? President Trump stated he would make the nomination early next year, though no specific date has been announced. The process typically involves consideration of multiple candidates before a formal announcement. How does the Federal Reserve Chair affect cryptocurrency prices? The Fed Chair influences interest rates and monetary policy, which affect the U.S. dollar’s strength, market liquidity, and investor risk appetite—all factors that significantly impact cryptocurrency valuations. Can the President directly control Federal Reserve decisions? No, the Federal Reserve operates independently to maintain monetary policy credibility. However, the President appoints the Chair and board members, indirectly shaping the Fed’s direction over time. What characteristics might Trump look for in a Fed Chair candidate? Based on previous statements, Trump has favored policymakers who support lower interest rates and express skepticism about overly restrictive regulations, particularly regarding financial innovation. How long does the confirmation process take? After nomination, the Senate Banking Committee holds hearings before a full Senate vote. This process typically takes several months, during which markets closely analyze the candidate’s likely policy direction. Will this affect Bitcoin’s status as “digital gold”? Potentially yes. If the new Fed Chair struggles with inflation management, Bitcoin’s narrative as an inflation hedge could strengthen. Conversely, successful inflation control might reduce this particular investment thesis. Found this analysis helpful?

55260665,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=225294,1764697510,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Strategy: MicroStrategy Eyes Bitcoin-Backed Loans for Future Growth,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/microstrategy-bitcoin-backed-loans-strategy/,"BitcoinWorld Revolutionary Strategy: MicroStrategy Eyes Bitcoin-Backed Loans for Future Growth In a bold move that could reshape corporate finance, MicroStrategy (MSTR) is reportedly considering using its massive Bitcoin holdings as collateral for future loans. This potential strategy represents a groundbreaking approach to leveraging cryptocurrency assets, signaling how traditional companies might integrate Bitcoin into their core financial operations. As one of the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holders, MicroStrategy’s exploration of Bitcoin-backed loans could set a powerful precedent for institutional adoption. What Are Bitcoin-Backed Loans and Why Do They Matter? Bitcoin-backed loans allow cryptocurrency holders to borrow traditional currency while using their Bitcoin as collateral. Instead of selling their Bitcoin holdings, companies can access liquidity while maintaining exposure to potential price appreciation. This approach represents a sophisticated financial strategy that acknowledges Bitcoin’s growing role as a legitimate corporate asset class. The concept has gained traction among individual crypto investors, but MicroStrategy’s potential adoption would mark a significant milestone for institutional acceptance. Walter Bloomberg’s report suggests MicroStrategy may consider this strategy for future financing needs. The company, led by Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, currently holds approximately 214,400 Bitcoin worth billions of dollars. By leveraging these holdings through Bitcoin-backed loans , MicroStrategy could access capital without diluting shareholder equity or selling its prized Bitcoin assets. How Could This Strategy Benefit MicroStrategy? Several compelling advantages make this approach attractive for MicroStrategy and potentially other corporations: Preserve Bitcoin exposure : The company maintains ownership of its Bitcoin while accessing needed capital Tax efficiency : Borrowing against assets typically avoids capital gains taxes that would accompany selling Strategic flexibility : Access to liquidity for potential acquisitions or operational needs Market signaling : Demonstrates confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value as collateral This strategy aligns perfectly with MicroStrategy’s established position as a corporate Bitcoin pioneer. The company has consistently added to its Bitcoin treasury through various market conditions, demonstrating remarkable conviction in the cryptocurrency’s future. Exploring Bitcoin-backed loans represents the next logical step in their comprehensive Bitcoin strategy. What Challenges Might MicroStrategy Face? Despite the potential benefits, this approach comes with significant considerations that MicroStrategy must address: First, Bitcoin’s price volatility presents a major challenge for lenders and borrowers alike. Traditional lenders typically require over-collateralization to account for price swings, meaning MicroStrategy might need to pledge Bitcoin worth significantly more than the loan amount. Second, regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency collateral could complicate loan agreements and increase legal costs. Third, finding institutional lenders comfortable with Bitcoin collateral might limit options initially. However, as cryptocurrency adoption grows, more traditional financial institutions are exploring crypto-backed lending products. Finally, there’s operational complexity in securely managing collateralized Bitcoin and meeting lender requirements for custody and monitoring. Could This Spark Wider Institutional Adoption? MicroStrategy’s potential move into Bitcoin-backed loans could serve as a catalyst for broader corporate adoption. Other companies holding cryptocurrency on their balance sheets might follow suit if MicroStrategy successfully implements this strategy. This development could accelerate the maturation of cryptocurrency financial products and services tailored to institutional needs. The implications extend beyond corporate finance. Successful implementation could validate Bitcoin’s role as productive collateral, potentially increasing its attractiveness to conservative investors and traditional financial institutions. Moreover, it could encourage development of more sophisticated cryptocurrency financial instruments, bridging the gap between traditional finance and digital assets. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Future? MicroStrategy’s exploration of Bitcoin as loan collateral represents more than just a corporate financing decision—it signals growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. When major corporations consider using cryptocurrency for sophisticated financial strategies, it reinforces Bitcoin’s evolution from speculative asset to legitimate financial instrument. This development could potentially increase demand for Bitcoin as corporations seek to accumulate holdings not just for appreciation, but for strategic financial utility. The ability to use Bitcoin as productive collateral adds another dimension to its value proposition beyond simple price speculation. As more companies recognize these strategic advantages, we may see accelerated institutional adoption and new financial products built around cryptocurrency collateral. Conclusion: A Strategic Evolution in Corporate Bitcoin Adoption MicroStrategy’s potential move toward Bitcoin-backed loans represents a sophisticated evolution in corporate cryptocurrency strategy. Rather than simply holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset, the company appears to be exploring how to actively leverage its holdings for strategic advantage. This approach demonstrates maturing institutional understanding of cryptocurrency’s potential role in corporate finance. While challenges remain regarding volatility, regulation, and lender acceptance, MicroStrategy’s exploration could pave the way for broader adoption. As traditional finance and cryptocurrency continue to converge, strategies like Bitcoin-backed loans may become increasingly common for forward-thinking corporations. The ultimate impact could extend far beyond MicroStrategy’s balance sheet, potentially accelerating institutional adoption and validating Bitcoin’s role in modern corporate finance. Frequently Asked Questions What are Bitcoin-backed loans? Bitcoin-backed loans allow borrowers to use their Bitcoin holdings as collateral to secure traditional currency loans. This enables access to liquidity without selling cryptocurrency assets. Why would MicroStrategy consider this strategy? MicroStrategy could access capital while maintaining its Bitcoin exposure, potentially avoiding capital gains taxes and demonstrating confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value as collateral. What risks do Bitcoin-backed loans present? Major risks include Bitcoin’s price volatility, regulatory uncertainty, limited lender options, and operational complexity in managing collateralized assets. How might this affect Bitcoin’s price? Successful implementation could increase demand for Bitcoin as corporations recognize its utility as productive collateral, potentially supporting long-term price appreciation. Are other companies likely to follow? If MicroStrategy successfully implements this strategy, other corporations with cryptocurrency holdings might explore similar approaches, potentially accelerating institutional adoption. What lenders offer Bitcoin-backed loans? Currently, specialized cryptocurrency lenders and a growing number of traditional financial institutions are developing products for cryptocurrency-backed lending to institutional clients.

The crash triggered multiple trading halts as the miner, co‑founded by Eric Trump, got dragged down with the rest of the crypto market, as Bitcoin dropped more than 30% from its October peak, slamming every risky crypto bet still standing. The wipeout followed Monday’s massive liquidation event, where nearly $1 billion in leveraged crypto positions vanished. By Tuesday, markets had temporarily steadied. But that meant nothing for American Bitcoin. The damage was done. Crypto miner sinks after early rally fizzles American Bitcoin launched earlier this year as a spinout from Hut 8 Corp. The mining venture gained early hype. Traders pushed the stock up fast. But since its September peak, the company has now lost over 78% of its value. By November, American Bitcoin reported a net income of $3.5 million and $64.2 million in revenue for the third quarter. The earnings didn’t matter. The market was already punishing anything linked to crypto. That includes the Trumps. Donald Trump Jr., who holds shares in American Bitcoin, has also seen losses stack up. The family’s other crypto plays are hurting too. WLFI, the token tied to the Trump-backed DeFi platform World Liberty Financial, is down more than 30% from September. ALT5 Sigma, which holds WLFI, is down over 80% from its high. Eric, who helped launch the miner, didn’t flinch. He told Bloomberg News that he’s not backing off. “What a great buying opportunity,” he said. “People who buy dips and embrace volatility will be the ultimate winners. I have never been more bullish on the future of cryptocurrency and the modernization of the financial system.” Bitcoin’s history is full of deep drops, but the Trumps don’t just hold coins. They’ve embedded themselves across the crypto industry. That spread helps blunt some of the financial hits. But the bleeding hasn’t stopped. Trump Media takes on losses as Bitcoin gamble turns red Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., which runs the Truth Social platform, hit a record low on Wednesday.The company’s dive lines up with its increasing exposure to crypto. Donald Trump, who’s back in the White House as President, holds the largest stake in the company. That stake, controlled by a trust overseen by Donald Jr., has now lost around $800 million since September. Trump Media is not profitable, but that didn’t stop it from going deeper into crypto. In a July filing, the company revealed it had spent roughly $2 billion buying Bitcoin and related assets. Its holdings include 11,500 Bitcoins, which were bought at around $115,000 each. With prices down, that position is now sitting on a 25% paper loss. And the bets didn’t stop there. Trump Media also bought a big stash of CRO, a token created by Crypto.com, a Singapore-based crypto exchange. By the end of September, the value of that holding was about $147 million.

The proposal, now under active discussion inside Whitehall, is being considered as part of the forthcoming Elections Bill, according to multiple people familiar with the talks. Although the government did not confirm the plan outright, it said more details would be set out when the bill is published. Calls Grow to Restrict Digital Asset Contributions to UK Political Parties The possibility of a prohibition comes as Reform UK continues to position itself as the most crypto-friendly political force in the country. Earlier this year, Farage opened the door to digital asset contributions and launched a dedicated donations portal . Source: Reform Party He has described the move as part of a broader “crypto revolution” in Britain and has repeatedly told industry audiences that he is the “only hope” for UK crypto businesses. In October, he told Reuters the party had already received “a couple” of crypto donations after notifying the Electoral Commission, showing the first time such a contribution had ever been recorded in British politics. For now, the value of those donations has not been disclosed. The debate over crypto political financing has also grown more intense as Reform surges in national polls and the Labour government faces mounting questions about foreign interference. Source: Electoral Reform Transparency experts have warned that digital assets, while publicly traceable on-chain, can mask the true origin of funds when moved through multiple wallets. Tom Keatinge, director at RUSI, noted that crypto transfers allow money to cross borders into the UK “much easier” than through traditional banking, raising concerns about illicit financing, especially under a system that already bans foreign political donations in almost all circumstances. Calls for stricter oversight have come from multiple quarters, including former Cabinet Office Minister Pat McFadden , Business Select Committee Chair Liam Byrne, and Phil Brickell, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Anti-Corruption and Fair Tax. UK Cabinet Office Minister Pat McFadden has called for election officials to consider banning political donations made in digital currencies. #Crypto #UK https://t.co/qhoReMm5hG — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 18, 2025 Lawmakers have argued that existing regulations are insufficient to prevent misuse of cryptocurrency in political donations, noting the potential for anonymity and the difficulty in tracing the original source of funds. High-Profile MEP Case Sparks Calls for Tighter Electoral Finance Rules in UK Their warnings have been amplified by recent national security concerns, particularly after former Reform Wales leader Nathan Gill was jailed for more than ten years for accepting payments to make pro-Russian statements while serving as an MEP. Farage has distanced himself from Gill, calling him a “bad apple,” but the case has intensified calls for tougher rules on political funding. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, responsible for the Elections Bill, stated that the political finance system inherited by the U.K. had left democracy vulnerable to foreign influence. Officials emphasized that new rules, including those potentially targeting crypto donations, would aim to protect electoral integrity while allowing parties to fund their campaigns responsibly. The Elections Bill is expected to include new requirements for parties and donors, including restrictions on shell-company contributions and mandatory risk assessments for donations that could expose campaigns to foreign interference. The UK’s caution stands in sharp contrast to the United States, where digital asset donations have become a major force in federal elections. American crypto-backed PACs poured more than $190 million into the 2024 cycle, aided by clear reporting rules under the Federal Election Commission. A cryptocurrency-backed super PAC, Fairshake, is heading into the upcoming midterm elections with more than $140 million in the bank. #Fairshake #PAC https://t.co/7AE1JZjV2Y — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 15, 2025 In Britain, crypto’s political footprint remains minimal.

This figure represents a 28% decrease compared with the 79 deals made in October and a decline of 41% over November 2024’s 96 projects, according to data from RootData. While deal volume contracted, the total funding surged to $14.54 billion, up 219% from October’s $4.556 billion. The sharp increase has come from one single transaction of Naver acquiring Upbit operator Dunamu for $10.3 billion, the largest financing event ever in crypto. Crypto VC deal volume drops across sectors November’s decline in crypto VC activity serves as a continuation of the downward flow of volume over the past year. Announced transactions for November 2025 dropped to 57 projects, nearly 41% below last year’s figure of 96 during the similar period in 2024. Monthly totals can grow because not all financings are reported in a given month. There were 79 deals in October 2025, and the volume for November at 57 was a 28% drop month-over-month. Crypto VC data | Source: Wu Blockchain Sector-wise, DeFi projects also took the largest slice of investment deals, as decentralized finance occupied 30.4% of all disclosed crypto venture capital transactions in November and was the most active category. Centralized finance infrastructure followed close behind with 12.5% of the deals, which include exchanges, lending platforms and other centralized cryptocurrency services. AI-centered crypto projects, in addition to RWA/DePIN efforts, both made up 7.1% of the investment totality. Tool and wallet development projects raised 5.4% of the deals, while Layer 1 & Layer 2 blockchain infrastructure projects saw only 1.8%. NFT and GameFi projects saw 1.8% of deals in aggregate, too. Naver’s $10.3 billion Upbit acquisition dominates funding Naver has agreed to acquire Upbit operator Dunamu in an all-stock deal valued at about $10.3 billion. The transaction puts the value of Naver Financial at about 4.9 trillion won, and that of Dunamu at about 15.1 trillion won. Through the share swap, Naver Finance will become Dunamu’s wholly-owned parent company. For the first nine months of 2025, consolidated revenue for Dunamu rose 22% year-over-year at 1.19 trillion won, with trading platform operations, including Upbit, comprising approximately 97.9% of the total revenue. The acquisition dwarfs all other crypto VC deals in November and accounts for 70.8% of the month’s total funding. Without the Upbit transaction, November funding would have totaled approximately $4.24 billion. Kalshi raises $1 billion at $11 billion valuation Kalshi , a prediction market platform, raised $1 billion in November, raising its total worth to $11 billion. Sequoia and CapitalG returned as lead investors, with Andreessen Horowitz, Paradigm, Anthos Capital, and Neo also participating. According to Bloomberg, Kalshi’s biggest competitor, Polymarket, is in talks with investors to raise capital at a valuation of $12 billion to $15 billion. DRW Holdings and Liberty City Ventures have inked a subscription agreement for a private placement of approximately $540 million through publicly traded Tharimmune Inc. Tharimmune will store the Canton token from the Canton public blockchain for usage in financial transaction scenarios. DRW and Liberty City previously contributed to Digital Asset’s $135 million fundraising round in June. Ripple and Kraken secure major crypto VC rounds Ripple closed a $500 million funding round last November, giving the company a valuation of $40 billion. Fortress Investment Group and Citadel Securities-related entities were among those who took the lead on the round, joined by Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital, Brevan Howard and managed funds by Marshall Wace. Citadel Securities invested $200 million in Kraken to become the company’s strategic partner, giving it a post-money valuation of $20 billion. The exchange had previously raised $600 million at a $15 billion valuation in September. Both of those rounds combined are $800 million. Strategic acquisitions shape November activity Singh’s monad raised $188 million in a public sale on Coinbase. The sale offered 7.5% of the supply of MON at a rate of 0.025 USDC per token, which would have sent the ETH-compatible Layer 1 blockchain to a fully diluted valuation of $2.5 billion. US-listed crypto wallet company Exodus Movement announced the $175 million acquisition of W3C Corp, which includes crypto card and payments businesses Baanx and Monavate. The transaction is funded through company cash reserves and BTC-collateralized financing provided by Galaxy Digital. The deal is expected to close in 2026 pending customary approvals. Lloyds Banking Group, the UK’s largest retail bank, signed a 120 million pound acquisition agreement with digital wallet provider Curve. Curve had raised more than 250 million pounds cumulatively. Paxos Trust Company acquired crypto wallet startup Fordefi Inc. in a deal valued at more than $100 million. The acquisition price exceeds the $83 million valuation Fordefi received after its most recent funding round last year. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Crypto analyst Camol claims that advanced quantum computing could eventually crack Nakatomo’s wallet, draining it entirely. The analyst’s argument has sparked heated debate across the crypto community, with many critics dismissing the claims as unfounded and misleading. Will Quantum Computing Crack Nakamoto’s Bitcoin? In an X post released on Monday, December 1, Camol predicted that Nakamoto’s BTC wallet will be drained within the next 10 years as quantum computing power advances exponentially. He called this rapid, annual double acceleration Neven’s Law, warning that the Bitcoin creator’s over $131 billion BTC stash could eventually be exposed to unprecedented risks and hacks. Camol’s argument focuses on Bitcoin’s secp256k1 elliptic curve and ECDSA signatures, which are used to secure wallets. He claims that these could eventually be reversed using Shor’s Algorithm , a quantum algorithm that, in theory, can break elliptic curve cryptography once sufficiently powerful quantum hardware exists. The analyst warns that if such a technology becomes viable, it could compromise the security of even the most well-protected Bitcoin holdings—in this case, Nakamoto’s. In his post, Camol also stated that Satoshi’s 1 million BTC fortune could face additional vulnerability because the wallet address is protected by a 160-bit hash that has never been exposed through spending activity. He claims that a powerful quantum attack could crack the hash and reveal the public key, eventually uncovering the private key through multiple attempts. The analyst also pointed out that sophisticated bad actors , such as state-sponsored groups and wealthy cybercriminals, could access Nakamoto’s BTC wallet. Experts And AI Dismiss BTC Quantum Hacking Claims Crypto analyst @level941 on X sharply rebuked Camol’s claims, emphasizing that Satoshi’s BTC holdings are fundamentally more secure than most coins in circulation. He surmised that because Satoshi’s BTC is stored in early P2PKH addresses, the public keys will remain hidden and the wallet will stay locked unless the Bitcoin creator manually removes his coins. @level941 called Camol’s statements “false” and “incorrect,” noting that Quantum computers can only break RSA or ECC systems when the public key is known. This means that Satoshi’s BTC is protected by a 160-bit RIPED160 hash that quantum machines cannot brute force in any foreseeable timeline. The analyst also argued that if the Bitcoin network ever migrated to a quantum-safe signature scheme , Satoshi’s unmoved coins would become permanently locked rather than hacked or drained. Independent analysis from advanced AI systems further rejects Camol’s quantum-hacking narrative as scientifically unsupported. According to reports, present-day quantum computers have fewer than 1,000 noisy qubits, far short of the millions of error-corrected qubits required to break Bitcoin’s cryptography . AI systems also highlight that there is no evidence suggesting that a Bitcoin-breaking quantum machine will appear within ten years. It also revealed that Neven’s Law, which Camol referenced, is no longer considered a reliable predictor of long-term growth in quantum computing. In conclusion, the odds of Nakamoto’s BTC fortune being hacked are extremely low for at least the next few decades.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY|SECURITY INCIDENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-02 18:00:26

The weekly candle has managed to close slightly green for the first time in more than a month, yet the rebound has not erased the weakness created by the recent sell-off. The latest technical analysis from Guy on the Earth focuses on this exact moment, noting that XRP’s entire structure now depends on whether this $2 zone can keep functioning as the pivot that stops further downside. Holding $2 As The Important Bull Support Guy on the Earth describes the $2 price level as the line separating resilience from a potentially long period of stagnation. His analysis shows XRP holding this level despite several weeks of bearish candles, a sign that sellers have not managed to gain full control even after the broader market’s pullback. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Below $50,000? Analyst Reveals Why 2026 Will Be The ‘Best Year’ The weekly chart he shared displays a cluster of past support zones roughly aligned between $2 and $1.95, making this area the foundation of the current trend. According to the analyst, losing the $2 price level could leave XRP drifting for months or even years with little upside movement, aside from isolated opportunities when temporary lows form. For now, the fact that XRP ended the past week in the green, even slightly, keeps the structure intact. XRP’s reaction around $2 cannot be understood without watching Bitcoin. In his view, the best scenario for XRP is for Bitcoin to bounce back above $100,000, and a subsequent fall in BTC dominance. The chart’s declining RSI on the XRP weekly timeframe also hints at momentum changing, but its path will ultimately follow whatever direction Bitcoin chooses next. XRP Price Chart. Source: @guyontheearth On X Two Diverging Paths From Here Guy on the Earth outlines two possible outcomes as the market enters a critical phase. The first is a recovery from current levels that allows altcoins to outperform again, opening the door for XRP to revisit the mid-range zone around $2.60 before making any attempt at its previous highs. Related Reading: Dogecoin Just Suffered An 80% Crash In This Major Metric The second is a deeper market drop that drags XRP below the $2 price level. This move would flip its most important support into resistance and set up a prolonged stretch of declining price action. Nothing inspiring will happen below there except well-timed buys when the lows appear to be in. Both scenarios are realistic, and $2 is the dividing point that will determine which one unfolds. The analyst’s bias leans toward a move higher, but he warns that traders must be aware of the risks if Bitcoin does not stabilize soon. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.02 after a 1.2% fall in the past 24 hours and is at risk of losing this $2 support level.

While traders’ attention remains glued to price movement, Ripple, the company behind XRP, is quietly transforming institutional liquidity flows. According to analyst Skipper, Ripple has received expanded approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), upgrading its Major Payment Institution license. This allows Ripple to manage end-to-end digital token payment flows using XRP and RLUSD for institutional clients. Singapore now serves as a regulated hub for XRP-based payments. Global Crypto Hub Singapore has long been Ripple’s Asia-Pacific headquarters. The MAS expansion allows Ripple to onboard banks, fintechs, and crypto firms in a fully compliant manner. It can now handle collection, exchange, settlement, and payout of digital tokens across regulated channels. This positions Singapore as a strategic hub for cross-border payments, offering institutional clients clarity and regulatory certainty.

RLUSD is used for settlement and liquidity, enabling corporate treasuries to trade and manage these assets efficiently. Ripple’s acquisitions of Hidden Road (now Ripple Prime) and GTreasury integrate corporate treasury workflows. Treasuries can originate flows, process them through Ripple Prime, settle on XRPL, and route liquidity using XRP and RLUSD — all within a regulated environment. The Bigger Picture for XRP Skipper notes that most market participants miss the significance of these developments. The combination of regulatory clarity, tokenized funds, and corporate treasury adoption could create unprecedented institutional demand. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If XRP reaches high valuations, it will likely result from multi-trillion-dollar treasuries managing liquidity through XRPL and tokenized assets settling on XRP Ledger. Singapore’s regulatory hub may become the continent’s central switchboard for global trade using XRP. Long-Term Implications The MAS approval highlights Ripple’s potential to unify corporate cash management, tokenized asset trading, and digital liquidity channels. This structural shift could underpin XRP’s long-term adoption and market relevance. Investors should watch Singapore as a testbed for XRP’s institutional applications. Regulatory clarity, combined with integrated treasury workflows, may turn XRP into a critical tool for cross-border liquidity. Ripple’s strategic moves suggest institutional adoption, rather than retail speculation, will drive the next phase of XRP growth. Singapore’s MAS license is the keystone in this transformation.

This isn’t science fiction—it’s the new reality of e-commerce. New data reveals that ChatGPT referrals to retailer mobile apps skyrocketed by 28% year-over-year during the critical Black Friday shopping weekend. While this signals the growing influence of AI in commerce, the data also uncovers a startling concentration of power, with tech giants reaping the majority of the benefits. For those watching the intersection of technology and market dynamics, this trend offers crucial insights into how AI is beginning to reshape digital consumer behavior. How ChatGPT is Becoming a Gateway for E-commerce According to a detailed analysis by mobile app insights provider Apptopia, a significant shift is occurring in how consumers discover products. The firm tracked referral sessions, defined as a retail mobile app session that directly followed a ChatGPT session within 30 seconds. This method captures the moment a user transitions from seeking advice in a chat to taking action in a store. The 28% year-over-year increase from Thanksgiving through Sunday highlights ChatGPT’s expanding role as a discovery tool. However, this growth represents a fascinating paradox: while overall usage is climbing, it remains a niche channel. Last year, only 0.64% of all ChatGPT sessions on Black Friday resulted in an e-commerce referral. This year, that figure grew to just 0.82%. This indicates that while AI-driven shopping is on the rise, it’s still in its early stages compared to traditional search engines and social media. The Black Friday Data: A Tale of Two Retail Giants The most compelling part of the story isn’t just the growth, but where the traffic is going. The data shows a dramatic consolidation of referral power. Retailer 2024 Share of ChatGPT Referrals 2025 Share of ChatGPT Referrals Change Amazon 40.5% 54% +13.5% Walmart 2.7% 14.9% +12.2% All Other Retailers 56.8% 31.1% -25.7% This table reveals a stark reality. Amazon and Walmart aren’t just growing; they are capturing an overwhelming majority of the new AI-driven traffic. Their combined share jumped from 43.2% to nearly 69%. This suggests that ChatGPT, perhaps through its underlying models and training data, may be inherently biased toward suggesting well-known, mass-market retailers. For smaller retailers and niche brands, breaking into this AI-powered recommendation loop presents a significant challenge. The data was collected from Apptopia’s U.S. panel, which estimates consumer activity, meaning these figures provide a strong directional signal rather than absolute totals. Why AI Chatbots Are a Powerful New Shopping Engine The appeal of using AI like ChatGPT for shopping is clear. Unlike a standard search engine that returns a list of links, a chatbot can: Provide Personalized Recommendations: It can ask follow-up questions about budget, style, or use-case to refine suggestions. Offer Direct Comparison: Users can ask it to compare features, prices, and reviews of multiple products in a conversational format. Simplify Complex Searches: Finding “a durable backpack under $100 for a college student that has a laptop sleeve” is a natural query for an AI chatbot. Deliver Instant Links: When a user decides, they can often click a direct link from the chat to the product page, creating a seamless referral. This shift from a search-based model to a conversation-based discovery model is a fundamental change in user behavior. Apptopia’s analysis counted a referral session anytime ChatGPT gave a shopping idea or the user clicked a link directly from the chat. The Broader Impact of AI on Holiday E-commerce Traffic Apptopia’s findings are part of a larger trend confirmed by other industry analysts. Adobe reported this week that AI traffic to U.S. retail sites—measured by shoppers clicking on a link from an AI tool—exploded by an astonishing 805% year-over-year on Black Friday alone. Even more telling, shoppers who landed on a retail site from an AI chatbot were 38% more likely to make a purchase. This indicates that AI referrals are not just window-shopping; they are high-intent traffic. The trend continued on Cyber Monday, with AI traffic up 670%. For the entire holiday season so far (November 1 to December 1), AI traffic to retail sites is up 760%. This data paints a picture of rapid, mainstream adoption of AI as a shopping assistant, far surpassing the growth rate of ChatGPT’s specific referral slice. What This Means for the Future of Retail Apps and AI The convergence of AI chatbots and e-commerce is creating a new battleground. The current data suggests a “winner-takes-most” dynamic is emerging early. For Amazon and Walmart, their vast product catalogs, strong brand recognition, and likely prevalence in the AI’s training data create a powerful flywheel. For other players, the strategy must involve: Optimizing for AI Discovery: Ensuring product data is structured and detailed enough for AI models to understand and recommend accurately. Building Direct AI Integrations: Exploring partnerships or plugins that allow AI assistants to directly access a retailer’s inventory and deals. Focusing on Niche Authority: Becoming the undisputed best source for specific product categories so that AI models learn to recommend them for specialized queries. The key takeaway is that influence over the AI’s “suggestions” will become as important as search engine rankings once were. The referral path is becoming more conversational, more assisted, and, as the data shows, potentially more concentrated. Conclusion: A Seismic Shift in Early Stages The 28% jump in ChatGPT referrals is a clear signal that AI is beginning to actively guide consumer spending, particularly during high-stakes shopping events like Black Friday. However, the dramatic skew of this traffic toward Amazon and Walmart reveals that the benefits of this new channel are not being evenly distributed. While the overall percentage of ChatGPT sessions leading to shopping remains below 1%, the explosive growth rates reported by Adobe confirm this is a trend with immense momentum. The landscape of e-commerce discovery is being quietly but powerfully rewritten by AI chatbots, and the retailers that understand and adapt to this new referral paradigm will be best positioned for the future.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Apptopia and how did they collect this data? Apptopia is a mobile app insights provider. Their data comes from a U.S. panel that observes consumer activity on mobile devices. They defined a referral as a retail app session occurring within 30 seconds of a ChatGPT session. How significant is ChatGPT’s role in e-commerce referrals currently? While growing rapidly, it is still a small fraction. Only 0.82% of ChatGPT sessions on Black Friday 2025 led to a retail app referral, up from 0.64% in 2024. Which companies benefited the most from ChatGPT referrals? The data shows a dramatic consolidation. Amazon saw its share grow to 54%, and Walmart ‘s share increased to 14.9%. Together, they captured nearly 70% of all ChatGPT shopping referrals. What does Adobe’s data say about AI and e-commerce? Adobe reported that AI-driven traffic to U.S. retail sites grew 805% year-over-year on Black Friday, and those visitors were 38% more likely to purchase. What is OpenAI’s role in this trend? OpenAI is the company behind ChatGPT. The behavior of its AI model directly influences which retailers and products are suggested to users during shopping conversations.

Crypto-to-NGN Transfers The new NGN payout feature allows verified users with local bank accounts to convert supported digital assets directly into NGN, with settlement typically taking place within minutes. According to RedotPay, the integration is intended to simplify the user experience and provide a more cost-effective alternative to traditional remittance channels. Michael Gao, CEO and Co-Founder of RedotPay, said near-instant NGN payouts mark milestone for the platform. He notes that the company’s goal is to make stablecoin-based payments “as easy to use as local currency,” allowing users to send XRP or other supported assets and receive NGN securely and quickly. Gao adds that the partnership with Ripple will extend RedotPay’s global reach while improving the reliability and accessibility of its services. Targeting Long-Standing Remittance Inefficiencies Global remittances continue to face structural challenges. Traditional transfers often involve high fees—averaging 6.49% globally—and settlement times ranging from one to five business days. These inefficiencies have helped accelerate adoption of digital alternatives, with Chainalysis identifying Asia Pacific as the fastest-growing region for on-chain stablecoin usage, particularly for trading and remittances. RedotPay said it aims to address these issues by leveraging Ripple Payments’ underlying blockchain infrastructure to deliver transparent pricing and accelerated settlement. The NGN payout feature currently supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies including USDC, USDT, BTC, ETH, SOL, TON, S, TRX, XRP, and BNB, with Ripple’s RLUSD slated for future integration. Once a user sends a supported asset through RedotPay, the designated bank account receives NGN directly. Jack Cullinane, Head of Commercial for Asia Pacific at Ripple, said the partnership highlights the real-world utility of Ripple Payments in reducing friction in cross-border transactions and improving accessibility for both consumers and businesses. “Send Crypto, Receive NGN” expands on RedotPay’s existing multi-market offerings, which include BRL and MXN payouts. The service targets globally mobile users such as digital nomads, freelancers, and entrepreneurs, as well as individuals working abroad who require efficient ways to send funds back home. By extending its stablecoin-powered payout channels, RedotPay aims to broaden access to emerging markets where traditional remittance services remain slow and expensive. Stablecoins for Wider Global Use RedotPay said with the Ripple partnership strengthening its settlement infrastructure, the company plans to further scale its regional offerings and bring faster, more affordable crypto-enabled remittances to underserved markets.

Garman highlighted the impressive adoption of the original Nova models, noting they’ve grown to serve tens of thousands of customers ranging from marketing giants to tech leaders like Infosys, Blue Origin, and Robinhood. The new AWS Nova AI models include: Nova 2 Lite: A cost-effective reasoning model for everyday tasks Nova 2 Pro: A reasoning agent for complex tasks like coding Nova 2 Sonic: A speech-to-speech model for conversational AI Nova 2 Omni: A multimodal model processing images, text, video, and speech Nova Forge Service: Enterprise AI Customization Revolution The most significant announcement came in the form of Nova Forge, a service that fundamentally changes how enterprises can customize AI models. For $100,000 annually, AWS cloud customers can now build their own frontier versions of AWS Nova models, called Novellas. This service addresses a critical pain point in enterprise AI implementation: the challenge of incorporating proprietary data into pre-trained models without compromising core capabilities. Garman explained the technical challenge using a human analogy: “The more you customize models, the more you add a bunch of data in post training, these models tend to forget some of that interesting stuff that it learned earlier the core reasoning. It’s a little bit like humans trying to learn new language. When you start when you’re really young, it’s actually relatively easy to pick up, but when you try to learn a new language later in life, it’s actually much, much harder. Model training is kind of like this too.” Why AWS Re:Invent 2025 Matters for Enterprise AI The announcements at AWS Re:Invent 2025 represent more than just product updates—they signal a strategic shift in how cloud providers approach enterprise AI. By offering both enhanced base models and sophisticated customization tools, AWS is positioning itself as a comprehensive AI solutions provider rather than just an infrastructure vendor.
