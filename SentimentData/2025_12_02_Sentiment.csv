That’s a 200,000 increase from Wednesday and a 15% spike overnight, signaling a notable surge in XRP Ledger usage. This jump could be driven by increased automation, whale movements, or early institutional interest following the rollout of XRP-related ETFs in the U.S. market. But despite the spike in network activity, XRP has dropped 6.7% in the past 24 hours, falling back to $2.04 after briefly reclaiming higher levels last week. Trading volumes have nearly doubled to $4 billion, suggesting that sellers are becoming more aggressive. Whether this payment surge is the start of a larger move or a warning sign remains to be seen. XRP Price Prediction: Will $1.90 Hold or Trigger a Deeper Crash? XRP found temporary support at $1.90 in late November after a strong U.S. jobs report and dovish comments from the New York Federal Reserve helped lift risk sentiment. While that level provided a short-term bounce, buyers failed to follow through with enough momentum to spark a full recovery. Source: TradingView Now, despite the increase in XRP Ledger usage, the XRP price prediction looks rather bearish. The price appears to be on track to retest the $1.90 zone once again. If it breaks below this key level, a sharper correction toward $1.65 could follow, marking a potential 19% downside from current levels. If support holds at that level, we may see bulls re-enter to push prices to new highs in 2026. In this kind of environment, where uncertainty dominates, early-stage presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) may offer better upside than legacy tokens, especially as attention shifts to faster, more scalable networks. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): Solana Technology Unlocks Real Scaling for Bitcoin Bitcoin has the trust and liquidity, but it has struggled to support the kind of innovation seen on faster chains. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) solves this by using Solana technology to build the first true Layer 2 for Bitcoin, bringing speed, scalability, and smart contract support to the network. With this upgrade, developers can finally launch DeFi platforms, payment systems, and even meme coins that run fast, cost less, and stay connected to Bitcoin’s underlying value. It’s Solana-level performance, built directly on top of the world’s most trusted blockchain. As a result, BTC investors can start earning yield, staking, and lending their assets right away after sending their tokens to the Hyper Bridge. As wallets and exchanges adopt the solution, the demand for $HYPER is expected to increase over time. To buy $HYPER before the next price increase, you can head to the official Bitcoin Hyper website and link up a compatible wallet like Best Wallet . Simply swap USDT or ETH to buy or use a bank card instead.

55222050,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=224791,1764631510,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Massive Bitcoin Whale Transfer: 4,683 BTC Moves from Kraken in $405 Million Mystery",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-whale-transfer-kraken-unknown-wallet/,"BitcoinWorld Massive Bitcoin Whale Transfer: 4,683 BTC Moves from Kraken in $405 Million Mystery In a move that instantly captured the cryptocurrency community’s attention, blockchain tracker Whale Alert reported a staggering Bitcoin whale transfer . A colossal 4,683 BTC, worth approximately $405 million, was moved from the major exchange Kraken to a private, unknown wallet. This single transaction highlights the immense scale at which major players, or ‘whales,’ operate within the Bitcoin ecosystem, often sending ripples through the entire market. What Does This $405 Million Bitcoin Whale Transfer Mean? When a Bitcoin whale transfer of this magnitude occurs, analysts and traders scramble to interpret its implications. A transfer from an exchange to a private wallet is typically seen as a ‘withdrawal’ from the trading platform. This action generally suggests the holder is moving their assets into long-term storage, a strategy often referred to as ‘HODLing.’ Therefore, this move could signal strong conviction in Bitcoin’s future value, as the whale chooses to secure their holdings offline rather than keep them readily available for sale. However, the ‘unknown’ nature of the destination wallet adds a layer of intrigue. It could belong to: A wealthy individual securing their fortune. A cryptocurrency fund or institution rebalancing its cold storage. A custody solution for a corporate treasury. This ambiguity is what fuels market speculation after every major Bitcoin whale transfer . Why Should Everyday Investors Care About Whale Movements? You might wonder why a single transaction between two wallets matters to you. The answer lies in market psychology and liquidity. Large Bitcoin whale transfer events can influence market sentiment in several key ways. First, removing such a significant amount of Bitcoin from an exchange reduces the immediate sell-side pressure. Fewer coins are available on the order books, which can contribute to price stability or even upward momentum if demand remains constant. Conversely, a transfer *to* an exchange often signals an impending sale, which can worry the market. Second, these movements serve as a high-profile indicator of what the largest and often most informed players are doing. While not a guaranteed signal, a withdrawal of this size suggests confidence, which can have a trickle-down effect on retail investor sentiment. The Security and Transparency of Blockchain This event perfectly showcases the dual nature of Bitcoin’s blockchain: transparent yet private. Anyone can see the transaction hash, amount, and wallet addresses involved thanks to the public ledger. This transparency allows services like Whale Alert to exist and provides a level of auditability unmatched in traditional finance. However, the identity of the wallet owner remains protected. We know *what* happened and *where* the coins went, but not *who* was behind it. This balance is a foundational principle of cryptocurrency, ensuring financial privacy while maintaining a verifiable record of all transactions. What’s Next After a Major Bitcoin Whale Transfer? Following a Bitcoin whale transfer , the market typically watches for two things. The first is any immediate impact on Bitcoin’s price. The second, and often more telling, is the wallet’s future activity. Will it remain dormant, signaling long-term holding? Or will it become active, potentially moving funds to other wallets or back to an exchange? The community will be monitoring this ‘unknown wallet’ closely, as its next move could provide further clues about the whale’s strategy. In conclusion, the movement of 4,683 BTC from Kraken is more than just a large number on a screen. It is a powerful reminder of the scale of the Bitcoin economy, the behavior of its most significant holders, and the transparent yet private nature of its underlying technology. While the exact intent behind this Bitcoin whale transfer remains a mystery, it underscores a narrative of accumulation and long-term belief that continues to define the asset’s journey. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a “Bitcoin whale”? A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Bitcoin. Their transactions are significant enough to potentially influence the market price due to the sheer volume of assets they move. Why transfer Bitcoin from an exchange to an unknown wallet? The primary reasons are security and long-term holding. Private wallets (especially cold storage) offer greater security against exchange hacks. Moving coins off an exchange signals an intent to hold rather than trade in the short term. How can we track these large transfers? Blockchain analysis firms and bots like Whale Alert monitor the public Bitcoin ledger in real-time. They flag transactions that exceed a certain value threshold and publish alerts on social media. Does a whale transfer always mean the price will go up? Not necessarily. While a withdrawal from an exchange is often viewed as bullish, it is not a guaranteed price indicator. Many other macroeconomic and technical factors drive Bitcoin’s price. What is an “unknown wallet”? An unknown wallet is simply a cryptocurrency address that has not been publicly linked to a known identity, exchange, or institution. Its owner remains anonymous. Is my Bitcoin safe if I keep it on an exchange like Kraken? While major exchanges invest heavily in security, the principle “not your keys, not your coins” applies. For maximum security, especially for large holdings, transferring to a self-custody wallet is recommended. Found this deep dive into the recent whale movement insightful?

55222170,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=224790,1764631811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Resilient Yearn.finance Hack Recovery: How $2.4M Was Reclaimed,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/yearn-finance-hack-recovery-explained/,"BitcoinWorld Resilient Yearn.finance Hack Recovery: How $2.4M Was Reclaimed In a stunning display of resilience, the decentralized finance protocol Yearn.finance has successfully recovered a significant portion of assets stolen in a recent security breach. This Yearn.finance hack recovery effort represents a crucial victory for the DeFi community, showcasing that even in the face of sophisticated attacks, protocols can fight back. Let’s explore how this recovery happened and what it means for the future of decentralized finance security. How Did the Yearn.finance Hack Unfold? The attack on Yearn.finance exploited specific vulnerabilities in the protocol’s smart contract code. According to the team’s investigation, the perpetrator manipulated an “unchecked arithmetic” logic flaw combined with a design defect. This combination created a dangerous loophole that allowed the attacker to mint unlimited amounts of yETH tokens. Once the attacker created these tokens, they used them to repeatedly withdraw the underlying collateral from the protocol. The total losses from this sophisticated attack reached approximately $9 million, making it one of the more significant DeFi security incidents in recent months. What Made the Yearn.finance Hack Recovery Possible? The successful Yearn.finance hack recovery of $2.4 million didn’t happen by accident. Several factors contributed to this positive outcome: Rapid response team activation immediately after detecting the exploit Collaboration with security partners who specialize in blockchain forensics Transparent communication with the community about the incident Strategic tracking of the stolen assets across blockchain addresses So far, the recovery team has successfully reclaimed 857.49 pxETH from some of the attacker’s addresses. This represents about 27% of the total stolen funds, with recovery efforts continuing through coordinated security partnerships. Why Does This Recovery Matter for DeFi Security? The Yearn.finance hack recovery sets an important precedent for the entire decentralized finance ecosystem. While security breaches remain a significant concern, this incident demonstrates that protocols can implement effective response strategies. The recovery shows that DeFi platforms are maturing in their approach to security incidents. Moreover, this event highlights the importance of having robust security partnerships and response plans in place before incidents occur. The speed and coordination displayed by Yearn.finance likely prevented further losses and enabled the partial recovery of stolen assets. What Are the Key Takeaways for Crypto Investors? For investors participating in decentralized finance, the Yearn.finance hack recovery offers several important lessons: Protocol resilience matters – How a platform responds to security incidents is as important as preventing them Transparency builds trust – Clear communication during crises maintains community confidence Security is an ongoing process – Even established protocols must continuously audit and improve their code Recovery is possible – Not all stolen crypto assets disappear forever While the full $9 million hasn’t been recovered yet, the $2.4 million reclaimed represents a significant achievement in the ongoing battle against DeFi exploits. How Will This Impact Future Yearn.finance Development? The Yearn.finance hack recovery effort will likely influence the protocol’s future development roadmap. Security audits will probably become more rigorous, and the team may implement additional safeguards against similar attack vectors. This incident serves as a powerful reminder that even experienced DeFi protocols must remain vigilant about potential vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the recovery process itself provides valuable data about how attackers operate and how stolen funds move through the blockchain ecosystem. This information can help strengthen not just Yearn.finance but the entire DeFi space against future attacks. Conclusion: A Testament to DeFi Resilience The successful Yearn.finance hack recovery of $2.4 million demonstrates that decentralized finance protocols are developing the maturity to handle security crises effectively. While the incident revealed vulnerabilities that need addressing, the coordinated response and partial asset recovery show promising progress in DeFi security practices. This event ultimately strengthens the argument for continued innovation in decentralized finance while emphasizing that security must remain a top priority. The recovery serves as both a cautionary tale and an inspiring example of resilience in the face of adversity. Frequently Asked Questions How much did Yearn.finance recover from the hack? Yearn.finance recovered approximately $2.4 million worth of assets from the $9 million hack, representing about 27% of the total stolen funds. What vulnerability did the hacker exploit? The attacker exploited an “unchecked arithmetic” logic flaw combined with a design defect that allowed unlimited minting of yETH tokens, which were then used to withdraw collateral. Is my money safe on Yearn.finance now? While the protocol has recovered some funds and is addressing vulnerabilities, all DeFi investments carry inherent risks. Users should conduct their own research and consider security practices before investing. How did Yearn.finance track and recover the stolen assets? The protocol worked with security partners specializing in blockchain forensics to trace the stolen funds across addresses and successfully recover 857.49 pxETH from some attacker-controlled wallets. Will there be compensation for affected users? Yearn.finance has not announced specific compensation plans, but the recovery of $2.4 million may help mitigate losses. Users should monitor official announcements for updates. What measures is Yearn.finance taking to prevent future hacks? The protocol is likely implementing more rigorous security audits, code reviews, and potentially new safeguards based on lessons learned from this incident.

His view is that this development will help reveal how aggressively issuers intend to build long-term XRP positions now that several funds are operating simultaneously. Expanded ETF Lineup Marks a New Phase The latest entrant, the 21Shares XRP ETF (TOXR), begins trading today and joins existing products from Bitwise, Canary Capital, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton . According to Steingraber, having these issuers participate in the market at the same time offers the clearest opportunity yet to assess institutional appetite for XRP. Even before the fifth fund came online, the combined inflows were considerable. Over the past month, total net inflows exceeded $666 million without a single day of outflows. Bitwise increased its holdings to 80.5 million XRP last week, while Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, and Canary Capital also expanded their positions. Steingraber argues that these early figures represent only a preliminary stage and anticipates stronger accumulation as more U.S. issuers complete their launches. Next week is a big milestone for XRP. We will have the first full week of trading with 5 pure spot ETF's running in competition. It's going to tell us ALOT by the end of week what we can expect for these funds acquiring XRP for the long term. https://t.co/S3TENqa4PP pic.twitter.com/LQ48QLKcgh — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) November 30, 2025 Analyst Simulation Suggests Limited Available Supply Financial analyst Mohamed Bangura conducted a sensitivity model that attempts to project how ETF participation may influence market dynamics. His model used several assumptions: an average daily ETF demand of 74.5 million XRP, a circulating exchange supply of roughly 2.7 billion XRP, a scheduled escrow release of 300 million XRP every 30 days, and elasticity values of 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 across a 180-day window. Bangura concluded that when elasticity is on the lower end, available exchange supply diminishes rapidly. At higher elasticity levels, prices respond more sharply because additional liquidity must be sourced from OTC markets. He emphasized that even without assuming strong emotional trading behavior, the projected outcomes indicate significant upward pressure on the market. Steingraber highlighted the model to support his argument that ETF-related demand may be absorbing liquid XRP more quickly than previously assumed. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Concerns About OTC Liquidity Intensify Parallel to this analysis, Digital Ascension Group CEO Jake Claver has expressed concerns that OTC and dark-pool liquidity may already be strained. He estimates that approximately 800 million XRP of private-market liquidity was acquired during the first week of ETF accumulation, representing almost half of the supply he believes was previously accessible off-exchange. Currently, XRP ETFs collectively manage more than $687 million in assets, equivalent to slightly over 300 million XRP. Since most ETF accumulation occurs away from public exchanges, the price has not yet reflected the reduction in available tokens. Claver argues that more pronounced market volatility will likely emerge when ETFs are compelled to source XRP directly from exchanges rather than from private channels. The launch of the 21Shares fund, which begins with a 0.50% management fee and a $500,000 seed basket, introduces additional competition among issuers. With five spot XRP ETFs now active and two more expected to enter the market, Steingraber maintains that the coming days will be a critical period for understanding how institutional investors intend to position themselves. According to him, this week represents a significant milestone for XRP and could offer early indications of longer-term demand trends.

Moreover, this technology helps to develop different stages of more advanced AI technology within the blockchain. Bittensor also uses its TAO token to incentivize node operators and AI developers. What’s next for Bittensor and TAO in 2025 and beyond? Let’s get into the TAO price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Bittensor Ticker TAO Current price $267.44 Market cap $2.51B Trading volume (24-hour) $185.72M Circulating supply 9.59M TAO All-time low $30.40 on May 14, 2023 All-time high $767.68 on Apr 11, 2024 24-hour low $255.66 24-hour high $290.34 TAO price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Volatility (30-day variation) 17.31% (Very High) 14-day RSI 38.96 (Neutral) 50-day SMA $377.03 200-day SMA $343.44 Sentiment Bearish Fear and greed index 24 (Extreme Fear) Green days 9/30 (30%) Bittensor price analysis TL;DR Breakdown : TAO is testing major support around $260, where sellers seem to be tiring. A short-term bounce is forming, but the broader trend remains bearish. On December 1, 2025, Bittensor’s price analysis indicates a clear bearish trend as TAO drops to $266.6, representing a 7.75% decline over the past 24 hours. Sellers remain in control, though the price hovering near the $260 support may attract short-term traders looking for intraday volatility. TAO/USD 1-day chart analysis Tao’s daily candle shows the coin sinking 7.75% and pressing directly onto the lower Bollinger Band at $263, which often signals a stretched downside and can trigger short-term relief bounces. The price remains firmly below $308, confirming that the broader trend structure remains decisively bearish. The wick rejection near $254 reinforces that sellers attempted but failed to extend a breakdown, suggesting early fatigue at these levels. TAO/USD 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The MACD remains negative, with the histogram easing slightly, creating a subtle flattening that suggests weakening downside momentum rather than an imminent reversal. Meanwhile, the RSI, hovering near 37, shows Bittensor approaching oversold territory without fully entering it, indicating that while bearish pressure persists, sellers may soon lose efficiency if sub-$260 liquidity is tested again. TAO/USD 4-hour chart analysis On the 4-hour chart, TAO shows a decisive green candle closing at $266.8, reclaiming almost all of the previous session’s sell-off and producing the first meaningful bullish reaction in several sessions. Even so, the price remains below all three Alligator lines, which continue sloping downward. This layout confirms that while buyers have stepped in, the dominant intraday trend is still bearish, and rallies into those moving averages are likely to encounter resistance. TAO/USD 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView The MACD histogram remains negative but is shrinking noticeably, reinforcing the idea that intraday sellers are losing strength. The strong reversal candle off the $258–$260 zone marks a credible short-term demand area that aligns with the lower band region on the 1-day chart. Bittensor technical indicators: Levels and actions Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $307.41 SELL SMA 5 $308.35 SELL SMA 10 $306.14 SELL SMA 21 $322.36 SELL SMA 50 $377.03 SELL SMA 100 $353.41 SELL SMA 200 $342.44 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $332.73 SELL EMA 5 $344.97 SELL EMA 10 $349.15 SELL EMA 21 $349.99 SELL EMA 50 $357.85 SELL EMA 100 $363.10 SELL EMA 200 $369.96 SELL What can we expect from Bittensor price analysis next? TAO appears primed for a relief bounce rather than a trend reversal, with buyers likely to defend $260 while overhead resistances slow any sustained breakout. If bulls fail to reclaim $280–$285, the downtrend will resume. If they succeed, TAO can extend to over $300. Is Bittensor TAO a good investment? TAO coin continues to trade higher, indicating growing adoption among crypto investors. Despite this, the coin faces uncertainties and volatility like all other cryptocurrencies. Our Cryptopolitan price prediction explores its expected movements from 2025 to 2031. Why is TAO down? TAO is down primarily due to high volatility, sell pressure from validators, and weak market sentiment surrounding speculative AI tokens. Recent breakdowns below key support levels also accelerated the decline. How much is the Bittensor stock worth? Bittensor (TAO) powers the Bittensor Network and is not a stock. Stocks are usually traded on stock exchanges, and stock ownership represents a stake in a company. Buying TAO tokens gives the buyer certain rights within the Bittensor Network, for example, governance participation but not ownership in a company. However, Bittensor (TAO) tokens can be purchased and traded on different exchanges, including Binance, Bitget, Coinbase, KuCoin, and Kraken.

Despite a small bounce earlier in the week, ADA failed to build any lasting momentum, leaving the risk of new lows on the table, something big wallets appear to be avoiding.

A breakdown of the channel eyes another 35% crash to $0.24, a support level that has acted as a firm bottom throughout this market cycle. However, with a catalyst for demand like Spot ETF approval or favourable macro conditions for a U.S. interest rate ease in December, a false breakdown could put the bullish case back in focus.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is poised to release its first draft of proposed stablecoin rules under the groundbreaking GENIUS Act before the month ends. This move signals a pivotal step toward formal federal oversight for dollar-pegged digital currencies, directly impacting issuers and the entire market’s future stability. What Are the New FDIC Stablecoin Rules? According to a report from CoinDesk, the FDIC has officially started the regulatory process. Commissioner Travis Hill outlined the timeline in written testimony to the House Financial Services Committee. The agency plans to publish the draft application rules for potential stablecoin issuers by year’s end. However, the core of the framework—the prudential standards—will come early next year. These standards will define the crucial capital and liquidity requirements that FDIC-supervised issuers must meet to operate legally. Why Do These Stablecoin Regulations Matter? For years, stablecoins have operated in a regulatory gray area. The lack of clear federal stablecoin rules created uncertainty for businesses and risks for consumers. The GENIUS Act and the FDIC’s forthcoming regulations aim to change that by establishing a clear playbook. This matters because: Consumer Protection: FDIC involvement suggests a focus on safeguarding user funds, potentially increasing public trust. Market Legitimacy: Clear rules can attract more institutional investment and traditional finance players into the crypto space. Financial Stability: By ensuring issuers hold sufficient reserves, the rules aim to prevent a “run” on a stablecoin that could ripple through the broader economy. What Challenges Lie Ahead for Regulators and Issuers? While the path forward is clearer, implementing these stablecoin rules won’t be simple. The FDIC must balance innovation with safety. Key challenges include determining the exact level of reserves needed and defining what qualifies as high-quality liquid assets. For existing issuers, adapting to these new capital and compliance requirements may be a significant operational hurdle. Moreover, how these federal rules interact with existing state-level money transmitter licenses remains a critical question. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community What should you do as this regulatory process unfolds? First, closely monitor the FDIC’s draft release later this month—it will be the first concrete look at the government’s vision. Second, understand that compliance will become a primary competitive advantage for stablecoin projects. Finally, recognize that well-crafted stablecoin rules could ultimately be a positive catalyst, transforming stablecoins from a crypto niche into a mainstream financial tool integrated with traditional banking. The Bottom Line on the New Regulatory Push The imminent release of the FDIC’s draft marks a watershed moment. The era of the “wild west” for dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies is ending. The proposed stablecoin rules under the GENIUS Act will set the foundational standards for a safer, more transparent, and potentially more widely adopted stablecoin ecosystem in the United States. The coming months will define the practical reality of this new framework. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is the GENIUS Act? A: The GENIUS Act is a proposed U.S. federal law designed to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for payment stablecoins, assigning oversight roles to agencies like the FDIC. Q: When will the final stablecoin rules be in effect? A: The FDIC plans to propose prudential standards (like capital rules) early next year. The final rules will follow a public comment period, so they are likely not to be fully implemented until late 2025 or beyond. Q: Will this affect stablecoins like USDC and USDT? A: Yes, if they wish to operate as “payment stablecoins” under U.S. jurisdiction and seek federal approval, they will need to comply with these new FDIC rules. Q: Does this mean stablecoins will be FDIC-insured? A: Not necessarily. The FDIC is acting as the prudential regulator for issuers. It does not automatically mean individual user holdings will receive FDIC deposit insurance; that is a separate determination. Q: How will this impact crypto exchanges? A: Exchanges will likely need to list and support stablecoins from FDIC-approved issuers, which could change the competitive landscape of which stablecoins are most widely used.

He will be replaced by Amar Subramanya, a former Microsoft researcher and a former member of Google’s DeepMind AI team. Giannandrea has been in the lead position since joining the iPhone maker in 2018. According to the company, he will remain the company’s advisor until retiring next spring. Giannandrea steps down following delays in Siri and AI projects The shift comes amid mounting frustrations over missed milestones — most notably, the delayed relaunch of the company’s virtual assistant, Siri, and the underwhelming initial reception of Apple’s broader AI efforts. In March 2025, the tech firm removed Siri from its oversight and reassigned it to other executives; just weeks later, a secretive robotics division also slipped out of its purview. The company’s change in AI leadership comes as experts this year have said Apple has fallen behind its tech peers in artificial intelligence. This technology field has been reinvigorated since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in 2022. Apple Intelligence, which aimed to position the company alongside AI leaders such as OpenAI and Google, has not been well-received by users and critics. Earlier this year, one of its most critical aspects, a significantly improved Siri assistant, was delayed until 2026 , showing major development struggles. Apple seeks to recalibrate AI strategy as competition heats up Subramanya will serve as Vice President of AI, reporting to Craig Federighi, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Software Engineering. Cook noted that Federighi already played a key role in the company’s AI efforts. Federighi is Apple’s top software executive. “In addition to growing his leadership team and AI responsibilities with Amar’s joining, Craig has been instrumental in driving our AI efforts, including overseeing our work to bring a more personalized Siri to users next year,” Cook said in a statement. Subramanya, who has spent 16 years at Alphabet Inc.’s Google and most recently served as Microsoft Corp.’s corporate vice president of AI, is expected to lead Apple’s core “foundation models,”. He will also be in charge of machine‑learning research and AI safety efforts, indicating a renewed push at the firm to recalibrate its AI strategy. In a brief statement, Apple CEO Tim Cook thanked Giannandrea for “the role he played in building and advancing our AI work,” while expressing optimism for the road ahead under Subramanya’s leadership. Subramanya will lead teams at the iPhone maker working on the company’s foundation models, research, and AI safety. Other teams initially under Giannandrea will be moved under Chief Operating Officer Sabih Khan and Services Chief Eddy Cue, Apple said. Apple shares, which are up 16% in 2025 so far, have lagged behind many other big technology companies, as investors have perceived the tech firm as falling behind those investing billions in AI chips and frontier model chatbots. In August, the company announced a “significant increase” in its spending on AI, and Cook has labeled it a “profound” technology. Apple has struck a deal with OpenAI, the leader in AI, to integrate ChatGPT into some of its products, such as Siri. But Apple is playing a different game than companies like Microsoft, Google, and Meta. It is spending much less on infrastructure for the technology. The company also prefers its AI to run on its devices, instead of communicating back to more powerful computers in the cloud. Giannandrea’s departure highlights the struggles in Apple’s AI plans. What was once expected to make the company a leader in AI now appears to be a project facing challenges that require new ideas and direction. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

55223051,637612,1764633618,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55223051.jpeg,"Crypto Lending Rebuilds From The Rubble, Reaching $25B In New Activity—Study",https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-lending-rebuilds-from-the-rubble-reaching-25b-in-new-activity-study/,"Reports have disclosed that centralized crypto lending climbed to roughly $25 billion in outstanding loans in the third quarter, a figure that signals renewed activity among centralized platforms. Activity has picked up this year, and some firms that survived the recent shake-out are growing their loan books again. CeFi Surges According to Galaxy Research , the broader crypto lending market totaled about $36.5 billion as of Q4 2024, down from a high of $64.4 billion in Q4 2021. That drop reflects the fallout from earlier platform failures and bankruptcies that cut into both supply and demand. The makeup of the market has shifted. Based on reports , the largest centralized lenders — including Tether, Galaxy and Ledn — now account for a large share of CeFi loans. Those three together held close to $10 billion of CeFi outstanding loans, equal to roughly 88.6% of that segment by the end of last year. Tether alone represented the biggest single slice. DeFi Borrowing Sees A Strong Comeback DeFi borrowing has recovered sharply from the lows of the 2022–2023 downturn. Open borrows on decentralized platforms climbed from about $1.8 billion in the trough to $19 billion by the end of 2024, an increase of 959% over the period. This shows many users moved back to on-chain solutions as centralized options contracted. Why Numbers Matter Now Market watchers say the new totals matter because they reveal where activity lives today: more on chain, and concentrated among fewer centralized players. Some lenders appear to be operating with higher collateral levels and clearer reporting than some of the failed firms of past years. That has calmed some investors. Still, the total lending market is far below its 2021 size. Risks Remain The concentration of CeFi loans in a handful of firms raises questions about single-point stress. If one large lender faces trouble, contagion could spread. Price swings in major cryptocurrencies also leave loans vulnerable to rapid liquidations. Regulators are watching the sector closely, and policy changes could reshape where and how loans are made. What To Watch Next Observers will be watching quarterly loan books, the pace of on-chain borrowing, and any signals of new capital flowing into lending desks. The market is rebuilding, but it is rebuilding in a changed form — smaller than the peak in 2021 and more split between centralized players and DeFi protocols.

Related Reading: $300 Million Crypto Bet: Kazakhstan’s Central Bank Gears Up The decline occurs amid outflows, a weakening market structure, and fading speculative interest, raising questions about whether a deeper correction may be underway. DOGE's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview Dogecoin Breaks Key Supports as Selling Pressure Mounts Dogecoin slipped below important support areas after breaking a bullish trend line on the hourly chart, continuing a multi-day downtrend. The price now trades below the 100-hour simple moving average, near $0.13, with MACD momentum strengthening in the bearish zone and the RSI remaining below 50. The coin declined more than 8% in 24 hours, falling through multiple Fibonacci retracement zones and failing to regain footing above the 23.6% level of the latest swing move. Analysts note that immediate resistance lies near the 50% retracement of the recent decline. A close above that threshold is needed to ease short-term downside pressure. Failure to break above these resistance areas has kept momentum tilted toward sellers, with a retest of recent lows likely if the market does not stabilize. Weak Flows and Derivatives Contraction Deepen Market Strain Spot market flows show persistent distribution. Recent data revealed a $5.7 million outflow, extending the multi-month trend of reduced accumulation from large holders. Earlier inflows that supported rallies toward $0.30 have given way to steady red prints, reflecting waning confidence among major players. Derivatives markets reinforce the weakening structure. Open interest has dropped more than 9% as traders unwind positions rather than add exposure during declines. Long-short ratios show a mild long bias, but price action has repeatedly invalidated those positions, triggering waves of long-side liquidations whenever DOGE attempts to rise above short-term moving averages. These repeated failed rallies have kept Dogecoin locked beneath declining EMAs between $0.154 and $0.202, a structure analysts say remains firmly bearish. DOGE ETF Disappointment and Market Rotation Add Further Pressure Dogecoin’s recently launched ETFs have not provided support. Combined inflows from major issuers barely surpassed $2 million, far below expectations and significantly weaker than the debut flows seen in Bitcoin or Ethereum funds. The soft demand has signaled limited institutional appetite for the memecoin, contributing to negative sentiment.

Several analysts argue that XRP may still be undervalued relative to its expanding relevance in international payments. A major point of debate is whether the global financial messaging network SWIFT could adopt XRP as a component of its settlement infrastructure or use it to complement its existing processes. Ripple Leadership Weighs In Ripple executives have addressed this topic for nearly a decade. In 2015, Ripple Chairman Chris Larsen explained that Ripple’s technology is designed to interconnect diverse payment systems and facilitate immediate settlement across different currencies. He emphasized that the company’s objective is not to displace networks such as SWIFT or ACH but to function alongside them to improve the efficiency of international transfers. In 2018, Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz stated that SWIFT’s exploration of blockchain could enhance competition with RippleNet. However, he also noted that such developments could create an opportunity for XRP to be incorporated as a settlement option for payments initiated through SWIFT. RippleNet's perhaps. But one obvious pivot would be to positioning XRP to settle Swift payments. — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) March 24, 2018 Years later, in 2025, SWIFT confirmed its intention to develop a blockchain-based ledger, further renewing industry interest in potential coordination between the two systems. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has expressed a more assertive view. He argued that SWIFT’s modernization efforts have been limited in scope and has predicted that the XRP Ledger (XRPL) could capture a significant share of SWIFT-related payment flows within several years. How XRP Could Function as a Liquidity Asset for SWIFT A scenario where SWIFT relies on XRP for liquidity does not require SWIFT to alter its messaging architecture. Financial institutions would continue using their existing formats for sending payment instructions. The main difference would arise during settlement. Under this model, funds would be converted from the originating currency into XRP, transferred instantly, and then converted into the destination currency. This process would reduce operational delays, lower costs, and reduce the amount of capital tied up in nostro-vostro accounts held across international banks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Price Outlook if SWIFT Utilizes XRP for Settlement Liquidity SWIFT facilitates approximately $150 trillion in annual global payment flows. If XRP were to serve as the liquidity asset enabling these transfers, its market valuation would likely need to expand significantly to support daily volume. To gauge the scale, the Google Gemini model was consulted for an illustrative calculation. The model noted that daily SWIFT volume averages around $411 billion. With XRP’s circulating supply at roughly 60.25 billion tokens, Gemini applied a conservative liquidity multiple of 100, resulting in an estimated required market capitalization of about $41.1 trillion. Dividing this figure by the circulating supply produced an implied utility-driven price of approximately $682 per token. Gemini added that speculative activity during a major adoption phase could raise the valuation further. Under a multiplier of up to 2.5, the projected range extended from $1,000 to $1,500 per token . If XRP were to reach the high-end estimates in this model, current holders would see substantial increases in portfolio value. For example, an individual with 5,000 XRP valued at around $10,300 today would hold approximately $5 million at a price of $1,000 per token, and around $7.5 million at $1,500. The projections presented by Gemini demonstrate how substantial the market impact could be if such an arrangement were ever implemented. However, the actual outcome would depend heavily on regulatory conditions, competing technologies, and the readiness of major financial institutions to adopt an alternative settlement framework.

On-chain analysts report the purchase, which points to growing institutional confidence in the second-largest cryptocurrency. This move raises important questions about market sentiment and the identity behind the wallet. What Did This Crypto Whale Address Actually Do? According to data from Onchain-Lenz, the unidentified crypto whale address purchased 7,080 ETH from the institutional exchange FalconX. The transaction, valued at approximately $19.89 million, significantly boosted the wallet’s holdings. Consequently, the address now possesses a total of 23,772 ETH, worth roughly $66.77 million at current prices. This is not a random retail investor. The scale of the purchase suggests a sophisticated entity with substantial capital. Furthermore, the use of FalconX, a platform catering to institutions, adds weight to this theory. Who Is Behind the Mysterious Crypto Whale Address? Suspicion points towards two potential owners: Bitmine (BMNR) or the Nasdaq-listed company SharpLink Gaming (SBET). Both entities have shown interest in digital assets, making them plausible candidates. Bitmine (BMNR): A company involved in cryptocurrency mining and blockchain technology. SharpLink Gaming (SBET): A gaming company that has previously explored integrations with cryptocurrency and blockchain. However, the true identity remains unconfirmed. This mystery highlights a key trend: large, traditional companies are increasingly moving capital into crypto assets like Ethereum. Therefore, tracking a major crypto whale address provides valuable insights into institutional behavior. Why Does a Large ETH Purchase Matter? A single crypto whale address moving tens of millions of dollars is a powerful market signal. It demonstrates several key points about the current landscape. Institutional Confidence: Large purchases often signal long-term belief in an asset’s value, beyond short-term price speculation. Market Liquidity: While whale activity can cause volatility, it also adds substantial liquidity to the market. Network Validation: Significant investment acts as a vote of confidence in the Ethereum network’s future utility and security. For everyday investors, monitoring this activity is crucial. It doesn’t mean you should blindly follow, but understanding the “why” behind such moves can inform better decisions. What Are the Risks of Following Whale Activity? While fascinating, tracking a crypto whale address comes with caveats. Whale movements can create misleading signals if taken out of context. For instance, a large buy might be part of a complex trading strategy or portfolio rebalancing, not purely bullish sentiment. Moreover, whales can also sell, potentially triggering market downturns. The key is to use this data as one piece of a larger puzzle, not as a standalone investment thesis. Always combine on-chain analysis with fundamental research and sound risk management principles. Conclusion: Decoding the Signal from the Noise The recent $19.9 million ETH acquisition by a suspected institutional crypto whale address is a noteworthy event. It underscores the deepening integration of traditional finance with the digital asset ecosystem. Whether the wallet belongs to Bitmine, SharpLink Gaming, or another entity, the message is clear: major players are accumulating Ethereum. For the savvy observer, this isn’t just a transaction; it’s a testament to Ethereum’s enduring appeal as a core holding in the future of finance. Keep an eye on this crypto whale address , but remember to build your strategy on a foundation of diverse information and personal financial goals. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a crypto whale address? A crypto whale address is a wallet that holds a large enough amount of a cryptocurrency to potentially influence its market price through trades. Why is the identity of this whale address important? Identifying the entity (like a public company) can provide context on the investment’s motive—whether it’s strategic holding, treasury diversification, or something else—which influences market interpretation. How can I track whale activity myself? You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan or dedicated on-chain analytics platforms that track large transactions and wallet movements. Does a large purchase always mean the price will go up? Not necessarily. While it can indicate confidence, it is just one factor. Market prices are influenced by a wide array of variables including global sentiment, regulatory news, and broader economic conditions. What is FalconX? FalconX is a cryptocurrency prime broker and trading platform designed primarily for institutional investors, offering services like large trade execution and credit. What’s the difference between ETH and Ethereum? Ethereum is the name of the broader blockchain network and ecosystem. ETH (Ether) is the native cryptocurrency token used to pay for transactions and services on that network. Found this deep dive into the mysterious crypto whale address helpful?

This crucial market thermometer, compiled by data provider Alternative, has dropped another point from yesterday, signaling deepening anxiety among cryptocurrency investors. For anyone holding Bitcoin, Ethereum, or altcoins, understanding what this index reading means could be the difference between panic selling and strategic positioning. What Exactly Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as the market’s emotional barometer, measuring investor sentiment on a scale from 0 to 100. At zero, you find extreme fear dominating trading decisions, while 100 represents extreme greed and overconfidence. Today’s reading of 23 places us squarely in the red zone where fear dictates market movements. But how does Alternative calculate this crucial number? The index uses six weighted metrics that together paint a comprehensive picture of market psychology: Volatility (25%) : Measures price swings and market instability Trading Volume (25%) : Tracks the amount of cryptocurrency changing hands Social Media Mentions (15%) : Analyzes cryptocurrency discussions across platforms Surveys (15%) : Gathers direct investor sentiment through polling Bitcoin Dominance (10%) : Measures Bitcoin’s share of total crypto market cap Google Search Volume (10%) : Tracks public interest through search trends Why Should You Care About Extreme Fear Readings? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index hits extreme fear levels, several important market dynamics come into play. Historically, these periods have often preceded significant buying opportunities for patient investors. However, they also signal increased risk and potential for further declines. The current reading suggests that many investors are reacting emotionally rather than strategically, which can create both dangers and opportunities. Consider this: during previous extreme fear periods, we’ve witnessed some of the best long-term entry points for cryptocurrencies. The key is distinguishing between temporary panic and fundamental breakdowns. Right now, with the index at 23, we’re seeing classic fear-driven behavior including reduced trading volumes and negative social media sentiment. How Can Investors Navigate This Fearful Market? Navigating a market dominated by extreme fear requires discipline and perspective. First, recognize that sentiment indicators like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index measure emotions, not fundamentals. While Bitcoin’s technology remains unchanged and Ethereum’s development continues, investor psychology has shifted dramatically. This disconnect between sentiment and substance creates potential opportunities. Here are three actionable strategies for current market conditions: Dollar-cost average : Instead of timing the market perfectly, consider regular, smaller purchases Reassess your risk tolerance : Ensure your portfolio matches your actual comfort level with volatility Focus on fundamentals : Look beyond price movements to technology adoption and development progress What Historical Patterns Tell Us About Recovery Historical analysis of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reveals interesting patterns. Extreme fear readings often cluster around market bottoms, though timing the exact turnaround remains challenging. The index spent extended periods in fear territory during 2018-2019 and again in 2022, both times preceding significant recoveries. However, each market cycle differs, and past performance never guarantees future results. Currently, the index’s sustained presence in extreme fear territory suggests we may be approaching a sentiment extreme. When everyone feels fearful, sometimes the smartest move is to think differently. This doesn’t mean blindly buying, but rather conducting thorough research and preparing for potential opportunities. The Bottom Line on Today’s Market Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 23 clearly signals that fear dominates cryptocurrency markets. While this creates short-term challenges, it also sets the stage for potential opportunities when sentiment eventually improves. Successful investors often profit by going against extreme emotional currents, buying when others are fearful and selling when others are greedy. Remember that market sentiment represents just one piece of the investment puzzle. Combine insights from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index with fundamental analysis, technical indicators, and your personal investment goals. Markets move in cycles, and today’s extreme fear will eventually give way to another emotional extreme. The question isn’t if sentiment will change, but when and how prepared you’ll be when it does. Frequently Asked Questions What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 23 mean? A reading of 23 indicates extreme fear in cryptocurrency markets. This suggests most investors are pessimistic, potentially leading to panic selling and reduced trading activity. Historically, such extreme readings have sometimes preceded market recoveries. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index updates daily, providing a current snapshot of market sentiment. You can track changes over time to identify trends and potential turning points in investor psychology. Can the Crypto Fear & Greed Index predict price movements? While the index measures sentiment rather than predicting prices directly, extreme readings often correlate with potential turning points. However, it should be used alongside other analysis tools rather than as a standalone predictor. What’s the difference between fear and extreme fear on the index? The index categorizes readings: 0-24 as extreme fear, 25-49 as fear, 50-74 as greed, and 75-100 as extreme greed. Moving from fear to extreme fear indicates intensifying negative sentiment. How reliable is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index provides valuable sentiment data but has limitations. It reflects current emotions rather than future fundamentals, and its multi-source methodology helps reduce individual metric biases. Should I buy cryptocurrency when the index shows extreme fear? Extreme fear can signal potential buying opportunities, but shouldn’t be your sole decision factor. Consider your investment strategy, risk tolerance, and conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions. Found this analysis helpful?

It is now reportedly permitting the trade of mutual funds and ETFs that primarily invest in cryptocurrencies on its platform. This change in stance illustrates a substantial shift from their previous beliefs . Following this announcement, the asset manager clarified that it would grant its users the opportunity to trade ETFs and mutual funds that focus on specific cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, and Solana, starting Tuesday. Several crypto firms shift their focus towards ETF trading Vanguard’s recent decision to allow trading of ETFs and mutual funds demonstrates a significant shift for a firm that once expressed its belief that digital assets were highly volatile and posed substantial risks to major investment portfolios. Notably, this shift in stance was adopted despite the cryptocurrency market experiencing a loss of more than $1 trillion in value since early October. This move drew the attention of reporters, who reached out to the asset manager in an attempt to uncover the main motivators behind this decision. Responding to a request for comment, Vanguard mentioned that the surging demand from both individual and institutional investors led them to embrace the move. To support this claim, analysts weighed in on Vanguard’s comment, noting that since the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, these ETFs have managed to capture billions in investments. On the other hand, reports from reliable sources indicate that the asset manager’s decision aligns with the current industry trend. This finding was drawn after it was discovered that its competitors are now allowing the trade of ETFs on their platforms. An example is BlackRock , Vanguard’s main rival. BlackRock was reported to still hold about $70 billion in its IBIT ETF despite some withdrawal cases and a decline in the price of BTC. However, this number reflects a decline from approximately $100 billion held just two months ago. Meanwhile, sources acknowledged that Vanguard’s new approach makes regulated crypto investments available to over 50 million brokerage clients, who collectively manage more than $11 trillion in assets. It is worth noting that crypto-linked ETFs are considered one of the quickly expanding fields in the history of US funds. Crypto analysts also highlighted that cryptocurrency supporters may view Vanguard’s decision as an indication that traditional finance cannot ignore the influence of digital assets. As the topic of discussion sparked heated debates among individuals, Andrew Kadjeski, who leads brokerage and investments at Vanguard, decided to weigh in on the situation. Kadjeski stated that a test was conducted on cryptocurrency ETFs and mutual funds during market fluctuations. According to him, the results showed that they function as intended, while investors found it easy to purchase or sell them. “The way we manage these funds has improved over time, and what investors want keeps changing,” Kadjeski added. Vanguard vows to support most crypto ETFs and mutual funds Vanguard has shifted its focus towards mutual funds and ETFs trading over a year after Salim Ramji assumed the role of the asset manager’s CEO. Notably, Ramji is a former executive at BlackRock and a strong supporter of blockchain technology. Following his pro-crypto stance, Vanguard recently made public its intention to back most crypto ETFs and mutual funds that strictly adhere to regulatory rules set. This strategy will take place similarly to how the company manages other asset types, such as gold. However, reports noted that Vanguard has no plans to introduce its own digital assets in the near future. Additionally, it will still exclude funds connected to memecoins, as defined by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. “Even though Vanguard doesn’t plan to create its own crypto products, we serve millions of investors with different needs and risk levels. We aim to offer a trading platform that allows our clients to invest in the products they choose,” Kadjeski added.

A recent PBOC warning on illicit crypto activities has sent shockwaves through digital asset prices, highlighting the fragile balance between innovation and oversight. According to a CNBC report, this move by China’s central bank has directly contributed to negative market sentiment and significant liquidations. Let’s break down what happened and why it matters for your portfolio. What Did the PBOC Actually Say About Illicit Crypto Activities? The People’s Bank of China (PBOC), in coordination with other agencies, announced a strict crackdown on illegal operations involving virtual assets. This specifically targets activities around stablecoins and other digital tokens operating outside the legal framework. The announcement wasn’t about banning cryptocurrency outright for individuals but focused squarely on illicit crypto activities like unlicensed trading, fraud, and money laundering. However, the market often reacts to the tone as much as the content. The firm language triggered immediate risk-off behavior among traders. How Did the Market React to the PBOC Warning? The reaction was swift and severe. Experts cited by CNBC point to a cascade of effects: Heightened Anxiety: Ben Emons of Fedwatch Advisors noted market participants remain anxious following a major Bitcoin sell-off. Massive Liquidations: The price decline was likely influenced by approximately $400 million in exchange liquidations. Leverage Unwind: The impact was magnified because some exchanges offer extreme leverage, up to 200x, on a large scale. This created a perfect storm where the PBOC warning on illicit crypto activities acted as a catalyst, forcing over-leveraged positions to be sold off rapidly, which pushed prices down further. Why Does a PBOC Warning Still Hold So Much Power? China has maintained a strict stance on cryptocurrencies for years. Therefore, you might wonder why a new PBOC warning on illicit crypto activities still carries such weight. The answer lies in scale and precedent. China represents a massive pool of both historical and potential market activity. Any regulatory signal from its central bank reminds global investors of the 2021 crackdown that profoundly reshaped the industry. It reinforces the ongoing regulatory uncertainty that hangs over the crypto space, making large investors nervous and triggering automated selling. What Can Traders Learn From This Volatility? Events like this are not just news items; they are critical learning opportunities. The market’s violent reaction to the PBOC warning on illicit crypto activities offers clear lessons: Regulatory News is Key: Always monitor major regulatory announcements from significant economies. Understand Leverage Risk: High leverage can amplify gains but also catastrophic losses during volatility. Sentiment Drives Short-Term Moves: Often, the market’s perception of risk changes faster than fundamentals. Moving forward, watching how other global regulators respond will be crucial. Will they echo the PBOC’s concerns or strike a different tone? Conclusion: Navigating a Regulated Future The recent market dip fueled by the PBOC warning on illicit crypto activities is a potent case study. It underscores that cryptocurrency is no longer a wild west asset class detached from traditional finance and governance. While innovation continues, the path to mainstream adoption is paved with regulatory milestones. For savvy participants, this means developing a strategy that respects both the technological potential of crypto and the evolving reality of global oversight. The market’s recovery will depend on its ability to absorb such shocks and demonstrate resilience. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Did China ban cryptocurrency again? A1: No, this was not a new blanket ban. The PBOC warning specifically targeted illicit crypto activities like illegal trading and fraud, not individual ownership. Q2: Why did Bitcoin’s price fall so much? A2: The price fell due to a combination of the negative sentiment from the PBOC warning and the forced selling of over $400 million in leveraged positions on exchanges. Q3: What are “illicit crypto activities” according to the PBOC? A3> These typically include unlicensed financial services, money laundering, fraud schemes, and the unauthorized issuance or trading of stablecoins and other assets. Q4: Should I sell my crypto because of this warning? A4: This is not financial advice. However, such events highlight the importance of having a risk management strategy, understanding your investment horizon, and not investing with high leverage you can’t afford to lose. Q5: Will this affect crypto markets long-term? A5: Single events often cause short-term volatility. The long-term impact depends on whether this signals a broader global regulatory trend or remains a specific action by China. Q6: Where can I get reliable updates on crypto regulation? A6> Follow official communications from major central banks and financial authorities, and rely on reputable financial news outlets for analysis.

This is the powerful, and potentially invasive, future Google is building. For users navigating the complex world of Web3 and decentralized values, this centralization of intimate data presents a stark contrast. Google’s biggest Google AI advantage isn’t just its models—it’s the vast, detailed dossier it has on you. How Google AI Plans to Know You Intimately In a recent podcast, Robby Stein, VP of Product for Google Search , laid out the vision. The goal is to move beyond generic answers to deeply personalized ones. “We think there’s a huge opportunity for our AI to know you better and then be uniquely helpful because of that knowledge,” Stein stated. This personalization engine is already being built through connected services like Gmail, Calendar, and Drive, feeding data into Gemini . Consider this comparison of how AI responses could evolve: Generic AI Response Personalized Google AI Response “Here are the top 5 running shoes.” “Based on your past purchases from Brand X in your Gmail and your recent search for ‘arch support,’ here are 3 models that fit your profile.” “Suggest a weekend getaway.” “Given your photos from previous mountain hikes and your Calendar showing a free weekend, here are cabins available in your preferred region.” The Fine Line Between Service and Surveillance The ambition is clear: an AI that anticipates needs. Stein gave the example of a push notification alerting you when a product you’ve researched for days goes on sale. However, this requires Google to ingest a staggering amount of personal data: emails, documents, photos, location history, and browsing behavior. The risk is creating an experience that feels less like a helpful assistant and more like constant surveillance. This centralizes immense power, a concept at odds with the decentralized ethos of blockchain and crypto communities who prioritize sovereignty over their personal information. Data Privacy in the Age of Gemini This is where significant data privacy concerns emerge. Google states that users can control which apps Gemini accesses via “Connected Apps” in settings. The Gemini privacy policy also warns users not to share confidential information, as human reviewers may see some data. Yet, the opt-out path becomes murkier as AI becomes core to Google’s ecosystem. The company’s solution, according to Stein, is transparency: indicating when a response is personalized versus generic. The Promise: Uniquely helpful, time-saving AI that understands your context. The Peril: A loss of anonymity, potential for manipulation, and a feeling that you are constantly being analyzed. The Parallel: This mirrors the dystopian “Others” in Apple TV’s Pluribus , a hivemind that knows characters intimately without their consent, creating comfort that feels like intrusion. Actionable Insights: Managing Your Digital Footprint For the privacy-conscious, especially those in tech and crypto, proactive steps are essential. Audit Connected Apps: Regularly check the “Connected Apps” setting in Gemini and Google account settings to see what data is being shared. Use Incognito/Private Browsing: For research you don’t want influencing your AI profile, use private browsing modes. Consider Data Separation: Be mindful of what information you store in connected Google services versus more private, encrypted alternatives. Stay Informed: Privacy policies and AI features evolve rapidly. Make it a habit to review updates. FAQs: Google’s AI and Your Data Who is Robby Stein? Robby Stein is the Vice President of Product for Google Search, leading product development and strategy. What is Gemini? Gemini is Google’s flagship suite of AI models and assistants, formerly known as Bard, now integrated across Workspace apps. Can I stop Google AI from using my data? You can limit data sharing through Gemini’s settings and general Google account privacy controls, but core services may still collect data for personalization. Does Apple have a similar AI? Apple’s approach with its AI initiatives typically emphasizes on-device processing, which can offer different data privacy trade-offs compared to Google’s cloud-centric model. The trajectory of Google AI is a masterclass in leveraging existing infrastructure for competitive advantage. For users, the trade-off is stark: unprecedented convenience at the potential cost of profound intimacy. The future of search isn’t just about answering questions—it’s about which entity gets to know the questioner best. As these systems grow more embedded, the community that values decentralization must critically examine where to draw the line between helpful personalization and digital overreach.

Short-term EMAs between $2.18 and $2.33 continue to cap every bounce inside the multi-month triangle. Options open interest surges 184 percent as traders position for a major volatility event. By Jainam Mehta XRP ( XRP-USD ) enters December at one of its most consequential technical levels of the year, with price hovering just above a long-term ascending support trendline that has absorbed every major decline since early spring. The broader structure has tightened into a large multi-month triangle, where a pattern of lower highs is now converging with a rising base that has repeatedly anchored the asset during periods of heavy selling. The market is bracing for a decisive breakout after nearly six months of compression. Price continues to struggle below the declining 20-day and 50-day EMAs, both clustered between $2.18 and $2.33, where sellers mounted a firm defense throughout November. The 100-day and 200-day EMAs form a heavier ceiling between $2.48 and $2.50, reinforcing the view that upside attempts remain corrective unless price can reclaim this broader resistance zone. Technical structure tightens as buyers defend long-term trendline XRP’s daily chart shows the asset moving deeper into the apex of its multi-month triangle. Sellers maintained pressure throughout November, driving each bounce into another lower high along the descending arm of the formation. Monday’s decline toward $2.04 underscored lingering hesitation among buyers, though demand continues to emerge near the long-term trendline that sits just above $1.98. XRP price dynamics (Source: TradingView) The RSI mirrors this cautious stance. Momentum has spent weeks stuck in a weak mid-range zone, failing to break above 55 or register any meaningful bullish divergence. The indicator now sits near 41, signaling mild bearish pressure without entering extreme conditions. Historically, RSI bounces from the 35–40 region have provided short-term relief, but without a break above the descending trendline, momentum remains capped. Spot flow data, however, introduces a notable shift. While many major assets saw persistent outflows in recent weeks, XRP recorded a $3.5 million inflow on its latest reading. Though modest, the timing coincides with price retesting a critical long-term support, suggesting that selective accumulation may be beginning to reappear. The magnitude of inflow remains shallow compared to earlier accumulation phases, meaning buyers are cautious but not absent. Derivative markets signal preparation for a major move The derivatives landscape reinforces the view that traders are positioning ahead of a significant breakout. Open interest has fallen more than 6 percent to $3.87 billion, reflecting a measured reduction in leveraged exposure as volatility narrows inside the triangle. This type of contraction typically precedes explosive moves, as traders step aside before momentum expands. At the same time, futures volume jumped more than 68 percent, and options activity surged. Options open interest is up 184 percent, while volume increased more than sixfold, showing that volatility bets are rapidly building. Traders are clearly positioning around the apex, expecting the next directional move to carry meaningful momentum. Liquidation patterns add another layer to the evolving picture. Nearly $16 million in short liquidations were recorded in the past 24 hours, indicating that sellers may be losing control near the trendline. While shorts dominated throughout November, the sudden spike in short-side wipeouts signals vulnerability and suggests that bears may be overextended as price tests major support. What comes next for XRP The broader setup leaves XRP at a make-or-break point. A break below the rising trendline near $1.98 would expose deeper support at $1.87 and $1.72, marking a shift into a broader corrective cycle. On the upside, reclaiming the $2.33 to $2.40 region would invalidate the descending arm of the triangle and open the door toward $2.58 before testing the wider range near $2.90. With spot inflows improving, options activity soaring, and short liquidations rising, the market appears to be preparing for a high-momentum move. Whether buyers can convert these early signals into a sustained reversal remains the key question heading into early 2026. Previously, we highlighted XRP’s tightening triangle structure and the risk that repeated failures at the short-term EMAs would constrain momentum. The current behavio r near long-term support reinforces those themes, with rising options interest now signaling that traders are preparing for a decisive breakout.

Right now, that number is 25. CoinMarketCap’s crucial Altcoin Season Index sits firmly at this level, sending a clear signal to every investor: we are in a Bitcoin season. But what does this metric really mean for your portfolio, and how should you interpret this phase of the market cycle? Let’s break down the implications. What Exactly Is the Altcoin Season Index? Think of the Altcoin Season Index as the crypto market’s thermometer. It measures the temperature of investor sentiment towards alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, relative to Bitcoin. The index performs a simple but powerful calculation: it compares the 90-day price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin’s performance over the same period. The rule is straightforward. If 75% of these major altcoins are beating Bitcoin’s returns, the market is officially in an “altcoin season.” This condition would give the index a perfect score of 100. Therefore, the current reading of 25 is far from that threshold. It indicates that the vast majority of altcoins are struggling to keep pace with the original cryptocurrency. Why Does a Score of 25 Signal a Bitcoin Season? A score of 25 on the Altcoin Season Index isn’t just a low number; it’s a definitive declaration. This reading means market conditions overwhelmingly favor Bitcoin. Capital is flowing into BTC, often seen as a safe-haven asset within the volatile crypto space, rather than being spread across riskier altcoin bets. Historically, crypto markets move in cycles. We typically see: Bitcoin Season: Bitcoin leads the rally, often driven by institutional adoption, macro-economic factors, or ETF approvals. Altcoin Season: After Bitcoin’s price stabilizes at a higher level, investor confidence grows, and capital rotates into altcoins seeking higher percentage gains. The current index data suggests we are firmly in the first phase. The momentum belongs to Bitcoin. What Should Crypto Investors Do Now? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index is one thing; acting on it is another. This data provides context, not a crystal ball. However, it offers valuable insights for structuring your strategy. First, recognize that Bitcoin dominance often brings stability to the broader market. It can be a period of consolidation for altcoins. This is not necessarily a time to panic-sell your altcoin holdings, but rather a time for disciplined evaluation. Ask yourself: Is my altcoin portfolio built on strong fundamentals? Am I overexposed to highly speculative tokens? Should I rebalance to reflect the current market leadership? Many seasoned investors use Bitcoin seasons to accumulate quality altcoin projects at relatively lower prices, anticipating the next rotation. The key is to have a plan based on data, not emotion. The Bottom Line: Reading the Market’s Rhythm The Altcoin Season Index is a powerful tool for cutting through market noise. A score of 25 provides a data-driven confirmation of what price charts may already show: Bitcoin is in the driver’s seat. This phase highlights the importance of Bitcoin as the market’s bedrock. While altcoin projects continue to build, investor capital is currently rewarding the proven store of value and network security that Bitcoin represents. Ultimately, successful crypto investing involves understanding these cycles. The index doesn’t tell you what will happen tomorrow, but it clearly tells you what is happening today. By paying attention to these signals, you can align your strategy with the market’s prevailing trend, managing risk and positioning yourself for future opportunities when the season eventually changes. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Where can I find the current Altcoin Season Index score? A: You can find the live Altcoin Season Index on CoinMarketCap’s website, typically within their research or market analysis tools. Q: Does a Bitcoin season mean altcoin prices will fall? A: Not necessarily. It primarily means Bitcoin is outperforming them. Altcoins can still rise in value during a Bitcoin season, but typically at a slower rate. Q: How long do these seasons typically last? A: There’s no fixed duration. Bitcoin seasons can last for several weeks or months. The transition to an altcoin season often depends on Bitcoin’s price stability and broader market sentiment. Q: Should I sell all my altcoins when the index is low? A: A low index score is a market condition, not an automatic sell signal. Your decision should be based on your individual investment thesis, risk tolerance, and the fundamentals of the specific altcoins you hold. Q: Has the index ever been wrong? A: The index is a lagging indicator based on past performance. It accurately reports what *has* happened over the last 90 days. It does not predict the future, so a shift can begin before the index score fully reflects it. Found this breakdown of the Altcoin Season Index helpful?

Burniske Thinks The Market Still Has To Break",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/56000-bitcoin-bottom-burniske/,"Placeholder VC’s Chris Burniske sees one of the best long-term setups for Bitcoin building in the background – but he is clear that the real opportunity likely lies lower, with a potential test of levels near $56,000 still ahead. On X, Burniske argues that the current sentiment environment is exactly what eventually produces outsized returns, while warning that it is still early for aggressive deployment. “There’s so much pessimism and short-term thinking on crypto assets these days that the R/R is tilting towards optimism and long-term, sized, high-conviction positions in distressed, public, cryptoassets,” he writes. “That said, the time isn’t yet now, imo.” Bitcoin Bear Market Not Over Yet He reiterates a framework he first shared when Bitcoin was trading at $109,000: “I shared my view @ $109K that BTC only starts to get interesting < $75K, and a revisit of the 200W SMA is always possible (~$56K currently, will trend higher), with all of those numbers still representing a mellow bear.” For Burniske, a move into that band – and even a touch of the 200-week simple moving average – would not mean a structural breakdown, but a more orderly, “mellow” bear market reset. He adds a blunt caveat: “Can we go lower? Sure. Pay your taxes and let’s see what 2026 brings.” Related Reading: Analyst Sets Bitcoin Next Target At $95k-$96k – Here’s Why That patience extends beyond Bitcoin to the broader crypto complex. As an example, he highlights Monad’s MON token, where Placeholder is a venture investor. He describes MON as “one of the highest quality teams to launch in the last few years,” arguing it “sits at a tenth of the FDV of previous high-flyers in its category, while having superior tech & design choices across the board.” For him, MON’s price action is symptomatic of the broader reset: “Observing discourse & price-action around MON … shows how much repricing is happening.” Burniske sees that repricing as necessary rather than catastrophic. “More broadly, the vicious repricing happening in crypto is cathartic,” he says. “Everyone is taking their licks, and smart ones will learn and adapt.” In his framework, tokens are “liquid venture,” and the failure rate should be treated accordingly: “Most crypto assets should go to zero — this is liquid venture, what did you expect?” Related Reading: Newbie Bitcoin Whales Capitulating, But Old Hands Stay Silent The flip side is that a small minority of assets will, in his view, be marked down far too aggressively as “babies are thrown out with the bathwater.” For those, timing and conviction matter more than ever: “there are going to be a handful that reprice far too low … and having the conviction, at the right time, to be optimistic when the consensus is pessimistic will once again yield 10-100X’s.” For now, Burniske’s message to would-be Bitcoin bottom fishers is straightforward: the structural risk–reward is improving, but a convincing bottom may still require a deeper break – potentially toward the rising 200-week moving average around $56,000 – before long-term, high-conviction capital truly steps in. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $85,872.
