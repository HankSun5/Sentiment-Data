The company's most recent acquisition of 3,459 BTC , valued at over $285 million at the time of purchase, on April 14, brought Strategy's total holdings to 531,644 BTC, valued at over $44.9 billion. Saylor followed up on the BTC chart, which he typically posts on Sundays to signal an imminent BTC acquisition, with a breakdown of investor exposure to the company. The executive wrote in an April 20 X post : ""Based on public data as of Q1 2025, over 13,000 institutions and 814,000 retail accounts hold MSTR directly. An estimated 55 million beneficiaries have indirect exposure through ETFs, mutual funds, pensions, and insurance portfolios."" Strategy's growing popularity among retail and institutional investors is significant due to the company siphoning capital from traditional financial markets and into Bitcoin. Increased capital flows translate into the company accumulating and holding more BTC, slowly increasing the price of the supply-capped digital asset. Strategy’s chart of Bitcoin acquisitions. Source: SaylorTracker Related: Has Michael Saylor’s Strategy built a house of cards? Michael Saylor's stock market-to-BTC pipeline Strategy issues corporate debt and equity to finance its Bitcoin acquisitions , giving holders indirect exposure to BTC and feeding capital from traditional financial markets into the Bitcoin market. In December 2024, Strategy was added to the Nasdaq 100 , a weighted stock market index that tracks the 100 largest companies by market capitalization on the Nasdaq exchange. The inclusion of Strategy in the Nasdaq 100 will draw in even more capital to BTC from passive investors holding the tech-focused index in their portfolios. Strategy’s stock is currently trading at around $317. Source: TradingView In February 2025, Bitcoin analyst Julian Fahrer reported that 12 US states had exposure to Strategy , including California, Florida, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, Texas, and Utah. Bloomberg exchange-traded fund (ETF) analyst Eric Balchunas recently said that inflows from Bitcoin ETFs and institutional inflows from companies like Strategy have shored up the Bitcoin market against dumping by short-term speculators. The analyst added that Bitcoin ETFs recorded approximately $2.4 billion in capital flows year-to-date, helping to cushion the price of the digital asset.

Each coin offers unique features and growth potential, but which one is the better investment right now? This article delves into the strengths and future prospects of both cryptocurrencies, guiding readers toward a more informed decision. Cardano Shows Mixed Performance: Gains and Recent Declines ADA dropped 12.55% in the last month and fell 5% over the past week. However, the half-year performance saw a significant increase of 74.17%. These mixed short-term losses coupled with a strong long-term recovery indicate that while the coin can rebound, it is currently facing selling pressure. Traders have experienced fluctuations that highlight both potential risks and opportunities. ADA is currently trading between $0.47 and $1.02, with resistance at $1.37 and support at $0.27. Momentum indicators show a slight bearish sentiment in the short term, yet the overall trend is still unclear. Traders may find buying opportunities near the support level while considering profit-taking close to resistance, which suggests a cautious approach in the current market environment. Polkadot Market Snapshot: Recent Swings and Key Levels Past month activity shows a near 11 percent drop while the six-month performance is down about 10.5%. DOT experienced a slight rally over one week with a 5.38% gain, yet overall figures reveal a cautious market and varied price reactions. Current prices range from $3.38 to $4.96 with support at $2.73 and resistance at $5.89, while a further barrier exists at $7.47. The market lacks a clear trend as oscillators point to a balanced fight between bulls and bears. Traders may consider buying near support and taking profit near resistance, keeping positions flexible amid the sideways range. Conclusion ADA and DOT both show strong potential. ADA boasts a robust ecosystem and an active development team focused on innovation. DOT, on the other hand, excels in enabling interoperability and supports a huge number of projects. The choice between them depends on the specific goals and risk tolerance. Those valuing innovation may favor ADA, while those prioritizing range and interoperability might lean towards DOT. Both coins present unique opportunities for different investment strategies. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This year’s celebrations feel extra special, with hopes rising around upcoming Dogecoin ETF approvals. The phrase Dogeday first began circulating in 2021, associating itself with International Weed Day, April 20, a date long associated with pleasure and counterculture. Since then, Dogecoin fans have made it a tradition to use the day to show their support for the coin, share memes, and highlight key milestones in Dogecoin’s ongoing journey. Originally starting as a joke in 2013, Dogecoin has grown into one of the largest cryptocurrencies. It is now the eighth largest by market cap, with a valuation of roughly $23.3 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data. DOGEUSDT 15-minute price chart. Source: TradingView Dogecoin’s success comes down, in large part, to its sense of community, experts say. Its model, adding around 5 billion new coins yearly, keeps it low-cost to the average new investor. “Bitcoin or Ethereum has a fixed supply, while Dogecoin’s inflation allows small investors to hold large amounts,” said Anndy Lian, a blockchain advisor. On this year’s Dogeday, hashtags such as #Dogeday2025 and #DogecoinToTheMoon trended on X. There were memes of Doge in space suits, jokes about “becoming billionaires,” and videos celebrating the resilience of Dogecoin . Investors pin hopes on Dogecoin ETF approvals As the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) analyzes several exchange-traded funds (ETF) applications associated with the meme coin, the Dogecoin community remains optimistically focused. Major players, including Bitwise, Grayscale, 21Shares , and Osprey Funds, have proposals pending. The decision on its Dogecoin ETF comes as soon as May 18. Grayscale’s application has a May 21 deadline, although the SEC could still push back a final decision until October. The 21Shares and Osprey Fund’s filings are still waiting on a response date. This is why the approval of a Dogecoin ETF would be monumental. This would essentially expose more conventional investors to the meme crypto in the stock markets. The SEC recently delayed its decisions on several crypto ETF proposals. However, since the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, there’s cautious optimism for meme coins, like Dogecoin, to follow. If approved, a Dogecoin ETF would enable conventional investors, such as pension funds and banks, to invest in Dogecoin via regular stock exchanges. This would open up a huge new pool of money to the Dogecoin market and might be enough to increase prices. Elon Musk’s influence continues to power Dogecoin’s hype A big reason for Dogecoin’s continued success is the continued support of Elon Musk. The billionaire who founded the carmaker Tesla and the aerospace company SpaceX has several times called Dogecoin “the people’s crypto.” Whenever Musk tweets or jokes about Dogecoin, the coin price usually spikes. When he temporarily switched Twitter’s logo to the Doge image last year, it sent Dogecoin soaring 20% in hours. In November 2024, after Musk once again endorsed Dogecoin, the world’s seventh most valuable cryptocurrency surpassed luxury carmaker Porsche’s overall market value. Critics say Dogecoin’s dependence on social media buzz is a risky proposition. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, Dogecoin lacks smart contracts, staking, and other technical features. Of course, this is all culture, memes, and community passion. With 2025 looking more and more like the year and the ETF decision looming sooner than we can imagine, there is hope in the $DOGE community. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Buying momentum has turned positive in the past 24 hours, but an interesting technical analysis of the current price action points to a looming downside risk. Related Reading: BNB Weathers The Storm Better Than Altcoins, Stats Show Crypto analyst Xanrox laid out a bearish case for Bitcoin in an analysis on the TradingView platform, arguing that the ongoing falling wedge pattern, often seen as a bullish indicator, may actually be a calculated trap set by whales. According to his analysis, Bitcoin could crash to $67,000 before another strong move upwards. Bitcoin’s Falling Wedge That Might Not Be Bullish After All Xanrox’s main argument centers on the widespread belief that falling wedges are bullish reversal patterns. Although this is often true when the wedge forms at the start of a trend, the current wedge is forming at the end of a broader trend, which is a different scenario altogether. The daily candlestick timeframe chart shows the Bitcoin price moving inside a clean wedge structure while trading well below the 20, 50, 100, and 200 daily moving averages. This setup, according to Xanrox, paints the picture of a clear downtrend rather than a setup for a reversal. The bearish outlook is not just about chart patterns; it’s also about market psychology and the mechanics of liquidity. Such a setup is likely being exploited by whales in institutions and banks with enough liquidity to influence price action. These whales need retail buyers to create enough volume for them to offload or accumulate positions. By painting the illusion of a breakout, they can push retail participants into a false sense of opportunity, only to reverse the market and trigger stop losses across the board. This outlook plays into the growing notion that Bitcoin is increasingly becoming more of an asset among institutions, primarily due to the rise of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Chart Image From TradingView: Xanrox 20% Price Move For Bitcoin This Week Xanrox predicted a 20% move for Bitcoin this week. A 20% move to the upside from the current $85,000 range would see Bitcoin trading back above $100,000 and somewhere around $102,000. However, this predicted 20% move isn’t an upside move but a downside move. Particularly, the analyst identified $67,000 as the level Bitcoin is most likely to test in the coming weeks. The $67,000 price level is the primary target if the current wedge fails as expected, as it is the major support on the way down if $75,000 is broken. Related Reading: Today’s $1K XRP Bag May Become Tomorrow’s Jackpot, Crypto Founder Says Even if the predicted 20% downside move fails to materialize this new week, there is still the possibility of the move taking place in the coming weeks. The analyst suggests Bitcoin may attempt to retest the upper zone between $108,000 and $91,000 before heading lower. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $84,280.

Analysts tracking early-stage asset cycles now place the token in the 33x ROI target range based on key metrics, including: Market cap-to-volume acceleration Pre-discovery phase retention rates Structural tokenomics and controlled circulating supply These aren’t speculative data points—they reflect patterns that closely mirror those seen in other high-performing assets before they surged.

Among the 12 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, only three showed activity, with BlackRock’s IBIT leading the inflows at $80.96 million. Fidelity’s FBTC also contributed to the positive movement. Year-to-date, BlackRock’s IBIT has attracted $2.4 billion in inflows, indicating a stable investor base supported by consistent buying from ETFs and figures like Michael Saylor during market dips. Public companies increased their Bitcoin holdings by 16.1% in the first quarter of 2025, adding 95,431 BTC to reach a total of 688,000 BTC valued at $56.7 billion. This amount represents 3.28% of Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins. Additionally, U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) have accumulated 529,325 BTC, surpassing the 249,725 BTC mined since their launch, reflecting strong institutional interest. The total assets under management (AUM) for Bitcoin ETFs stood at approximately $92.5 billion as of April 20, 2025, with these ETFs owning 5.52% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Meanwhile, gold ETFs saw record inflows, with about $8 billion entering in the past week alone, contributing to a total of $80 billion in net inflows year-to-date, nearly triple the previous record set during the 2020 crisis. This surge in gold ETF inflows signals waning trust in the current financial system and has raised concerns about a potentially crowded trade. Ethereum ETFs, by contrast, experienced outflows of 16,240 ETH over the past week, with a total AUM of $5.33 billion, representing 2.72% of Ethereum’s supply. Market data as of April 20, 2025, showed Bitcoin trading at around $85,040, with March 2026 Deribit Bitcoin futures priced at approximately $89,838 and an annualized basis rate of 6.59%.

From borderless transactions to tokenized assets and smart contract-powered apps, blockchain is solving real problems, especially across Latin America where inflation, limited financial access, and cross-border constraints are part of daily life. For backers eyeing the top cryptos to join now, timing is everything. The biggest gains often go to those who move early—before the headlines, before the hype. Three projects are standing out this week for their ability to blend real-world utility with serious community momentum: Qubetics , Litecoin, and Tezos. One is setting a new benchmark in asset tokenization. The others are long-standing, battle-tested platforms with unique value in the decentralized economy. Let’s start with the frontrunner. Qubetics – Real World Asset Tokenization Made Seamless Qubetics isn’t trying to copy what others are doing—it’s rewriting the rules. Its biggest draw right now is its Real World Asset (RWA) Tokenization Marketplace, which is making it easier for businesses, professionals, and everyday buyers to digitize and trade real assets on-chain. Picture this: a small firm in Monterrey wants to tokenize its machinery for leasing agreements. Or a real estate developer in Medellín wants to turn property shares into tradeable, fractional digital tokens. Even independent consultants in Mexico City can tokenize invoice receivables for instant liquidity. Qubetics makes all of that happen—legally, securely, and across chains. It’s not just about blockchain for the sake of blockchain. Qubetics is building tools for people who want to put assets to work, without red tape or banking delays. The marketplace is audit-ready, compliant, and deeply customizable—whether you’re issuing financial instruments or managing tokenized inventory. For Latin American economies, where trust in institutions can fluctuate and access to capital is uneven, this kind of decentralized asset management hits home. That’s why Qubetics is considered one of the top cryptos to join now. It offers real-world functionality that helps everyday businesses, freelancers, and side hustlers get more control over their finances while opening up new revenue models across borders. Qubetics Presale Stats and ROI Projections That Matter The current Qubetics crypto presale is in its 30th stage, and it’s flying. Over 508 million $TICS tokens have already been sold to 24,900+ holders, raising a total of $16.2 million. Right now, community members can still buy in at $0.1729 per token. Those who came in at stage one, when $TICS was just a penny, are now looking at a wild 1629% return. But here’s the thing—it’s not too late to enter. Based on current projections, getting in at $0.1729 could still net a 477% ROI if the token reaches $1 post-presale. At $5, that’s 2789%. At $10? Try 5678%. And if it surges to $15 after the mainnet launch, that’s a mind-blowing 8567% return. These aren’t pipe dreams. Analysts are crunching the numbers based on real infrastructure, strong demand, and rising use cases across global markets. The presale’s still live—but spots are getting tighter every day. Qubetics delivers real value, offers extraordinary growth potential, and solves concrete problems for a region that’s hungry for financial freedom. For anyone asking what are the top cryptos to join now, this one’s got to be on the radar. Litecoin – Speed, Simplicity, and Staying Power Litecoin is a name that’s been around the block—and that’s exactly why it’s still here. Created in 2011 as a lighter, faster version of Bitcoin, Litecoin has earned a rep as one of the most dependable cryptos in the game. It’s not flashy. It’s not hyped. But when people need a network that processes payments quickly and cheaply, they go with Litecoin. It’s especially popular across Latin America, where folks use it for remittances, peer-to-peer transfers, and even direct merchant payments. Thanks to its fast block time and low fees, Litecoin functions more like a traditional payment rail—but without the limitations of banks, borders, or approvals. Behind the scenes, Litecoin has consistently updated its core tech, integrating privacy features like MimbleWimble to give users more control over their transaction data. Plus, it’s widely accepted across thousands of merchants, online platforms, and payment processors. Litecoin isn’t trying to do everything. It’s laser-focused on being sound money—a digital alternative to cash that people can use with ease. That singular focus has helped it build one of the most trusted brands in the crypto world. Litecoin is one of the top cryptos to join now for those looking to balance high-growth plays like Qubetics with steady, practical blockchain tech that gets real-world usage every day. Tezos – Smart Contracts With Self-Upgrading Power Tezos is one of those projects that quietly builds while others make noise. Known for its self-amending blockchain, Tezos can upgrade without forks—meaning no community splits or downtime when key features roll out. That’s rare and powerful in a space often shaken by protocol wars and governance disputes. What makes Tezos attractive to developers and institutions alike is its clean design. It supports smart contracts, NFTs, and scalable apps, all while using a liquid proof-of-stake system that’s energy-efficient and secure. And the on-chain governance model?

What’s Next for Dogecoin, Shiba Inu & PEPE After the Correction",https://bitzo.com/2025/04/memecoin-comeback-whats-next-for-dogecoin-shiba-inu-pepe-after-the-correction,"Memecoins have recently faced a downturn, making many wonder about their future. This article delves into the potential next moves for Dogecoin , Shiba Inu , and PEPE after their recent correction. Could they be poised for another surge? This exploration offers insights into whether these popular digital coins are on the verge of a comeback. Dogecoin Price Analysis: Short-Term Dips versus 6-Month Gains DOGE dropped by about 7.27% over the last month while showing an overall gain of roughly 8.88% in the past six months. The coin has experienced short-term declines against a backdrop of more positive midterm recovery. This behavior reflects a period of volatility with recent setbacks outweighing long-term recovery trends. The current price ranges between $0.12 and $0.22 with major resistance near $0.28 and a secondary barrier around $0.38. Support is seen at around $0.08 with a lower level at zero. Short-term indicators and recent weekly losses nearing 6.60% suggest cautious trading. Bears currently dominate the price action, so traders may seek a clear breakout within these key levels before initiating new positions. Shiba Inu Price Action Amid Mixed Trends SHIB has shown a modest drop over the past week at -0.56% and a slight pullback of -3.78% for the month. Over the past six months, the performance reveals a steeper decline of -32.08%. The price has fluctuated within a range from $0.00001024 to $0.00001509. Indicators present a mixed picture, with a modest positive momentum of 0.00000086 contrasted by a negative Awesome Oscillator reading of -0.000000399. Current prices are trading between key support levels at $0.00000811 and $0.00000325, with resistances at $0.00001781 and $0.00002265. The market lacks a clear trend, as oscillators indicate neutrality. However, slight bullish signals from the momentum indicator suggest potential buying opportunities within these defined ranges. Upbeat Pepe Momentum Amid Mixed Trends PEPE price action shows a slight drop over the past month of 1.06% and a sharper decline over the last six months of 25.91%. Price moves have been volatile, reflecting short-term recovery attempts contrasted with a longer-term bearish sentiment. Data hints at alternating pressures with modest weekly gains of 1.48% that have not been sustained to overcome the extended downturn. Current price ranges from $0.0000052 to $0.0000092 with key support identified at $0.0000032 and resistance near $0.0000112. Price action is balanced with near-neutral RSI levels at 54.08, indicating mild buying pressure but no clear trend. Trading within these levels could involve testing the support zone before looking to make moves toward established resistance. Conclusion DOGE , SHIB , and PEPE have shown resilience despite the recent correction. DOGE's established presence keeps interest high. SHIB draws attention through its strong community and frequent updates. PEPE remains popular due to its meme appeal. Future movements depend on broader market trends and continued interest in meme-based tokens. Staying informed about these coins will be key to understanding their next steps.

Standard Chartered predicts it will reach $55 by year end due to its subnet architecture. This is a game changer for scalability and cost reduction. Avalanche is a serious competitor to Ethereum and Bitcoin. After the December upgrade, developer interest in the ecosystem has gone through the roof. Avalanche is on a roll. But while Avalanche is tackling the scalability problem, another project is taking a different approach. Ruvi AI is carving out its own space in the blockchain ecosystem by combining artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to deliver real world impact and tangible benefits to users across industries. Introducing Ruvi AI Unlike Avalanche which is addressing structural inefficiencies, Ruvi AI is combining blockchain with AI to deliver practical and effective solutions. Its superapp is intuitive and supports workflow automation, creative process enhancement and operational streamlining. This makes Ruvi AI a must have platform for creators, businesses and developers to stay ahead of the curve. At the heart of this ecosystem is the $RUVI token , a fundamental part of the platform that enables secure interactions and is a promising investment opportunity. Backed by a transparent roadmap and huge growth potential, $RUVI token is more than just a utility token; it’s a gateway to a tech driven revolution. Ruvi AI’s Presale Success The presale of Ruvi AI has been phenomenal, the level of trust and excitement in the market is huge. Within days of launch 10 million tokens were sold, raising $100,000. The token was priced at $0.01 during presale and will be listed at $0.07, making it a very attractive opportunity for investors. Forecasts suggest the token could hit $1 post listing, which makes Ruvi AI one of the best investment in the blockchain space today. VIP Tier 3 Benefits One of the best things about Ruvi AI is its VIP tier system, a well thought out system that rewards presale participants with awesome benefits. VIP Tier 3 has gotten a lot of attention especially from mid to high level investors. The minimum investment to qualify for it is 100,000 tokens, which is $1,000 during the presale, participants in this tier get a 60% bonus. This bonus adds 60,000 tokens to the original purchase, making it 160,000 tokens. At the listing price of $0.07 this would be worth $11,200 and if the $1 valuation is hit, the value would be $160,000. The combination of accessibility and high returns makes Tier 3 impossible to resist for those who want to maximize their investment in a game changing innovation. Leaderboard Rewards for Dedicated Investors To further drive participation, Ruvi AI has a leaderboard rewards program that rewards top presale contributors with big bonuses. The top 10 most loyal supporters get 500,000 tokens, worth $500,000 at the $1 valuationThe top 50 get 250,000 tokens, worth $250,000 and 1,000 participants get 20,000 tokens each, worth $20,000 at peak projections. This rewards system is designed to not only create excitement around the project but also a sense of community and shared vision among Ruvi AI’s early adopters. Why Ruvi AI Isn’t Just Another Blockchain Project Avalanche is laying the groundwork for blockchain scalability with its subnet strategy but it’s focused on structural inefficiencies. Ruvi AI is taking a more practical approach by targeting usability and tangible results for its users. By combining blockchain and AI, Ruvi AI delivers solutions that are not just theoretical but already having real world impact on people and businesses. And with Ruvi AI’s VIP rewards and leaderboard incentives it’s even more attractive for investors. The roadmap is transparent and focused on short and long term value creation so you get practical innovation not hype. Why RUVI AI is The Future? Avalanche’s scalability strategy will reshape blockchain infrastructure over the next few years but Ruvi AI is redefining how blockchain can solve real world problems today. With its presale success and VIP tiers and leaderboard rewards, it’s a leader in blockchain and AI innovation. Now is the time to act. Ruvi AI gives you the opportunity to invest in future thinking technology and be part of a community that’s driving real change. Don’t just watch the future happen. Be part of it with Ruvi AI. Invest now and secure your spot at the forefront of blockchain and AI.

This Altcoin Is A Strong Pick,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/looking-to-buy-the-next-solana-sol-before-everyone-else-this-altcoin-is-a-strong-pick/,"Investors search for the upcoming Solana (SOL) to experience rapid price increase. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been grabbing investor interest through its ongoing presale which entered phase 4 while raising $6.9 million by selling more than 412 million tokens. With 8,400 holders already on board, the current price of $0.025 offers a narrow window before a 20% jump to $0.03 in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) phase 5. This DeFi project connects lending and borrowing methods and a buyback system to replicate early Solana functionality but introduces original features. The crypto market currently searches for utility-driven tokens, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers itself as a leading solution. Does this new token Mutuum Finance (MUTM) hold potential to surpass the skyrocketing success of Solana? Let’s explore. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) surges in phase 4 out of 11 phases of its presale process. Phase 5 of the presale is set to launch at $0.03 instead 20% from current $0.025 which provides a quick profit for people who buy tokens now. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokenomics feature a mechanism that will generate a 140% profit opportunity based on the $0.06 listing price. Initial investors have the chance to accumulate potential returns of 9,900% after Mutuum Finance (MUTM) soars to a $2.50 token value. An ongoing Certik audit for smart contracts will provide audit results on social media platforms to enhance trust in the project. The recent Mutuum Finance (MUTM) dashboard introduction of a top 50 holder reward system has added new drive to the project. Solana (SOL) Faces Stiff Competition During 2021 Solana (SOL) hit unprecedented heights because of its fast blockchain but lost momentum in 2025. The current market price of $126 positions SOL at a disadvantage for reaching previous peak levels since market participants choose alternative investments. The scalability advantage of Solana faces diminishing momentum because Mutuum Finance (MUTM) among other new projects bring innovative DeFi services to the marketplace. Mutuum’s lending model, with mtTokens accruing interest and a buyback system fueling demand, contrasts with Solana’s broader focus. As Mutuum Finance (MUTM) builds a loyal user base, it’s poised to challenge Solana’s dominance in the altcoin space. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Shines The primary focus of MUTM stands alone from market hype because it provides practical product features. The overcollateralized structure ensures stable operations by permitting users to borrow ETH and lenders earn adjustable interest payments. The platform revenue channels through a buy-and-distribute mechanism that performs both token repurchases and rewards for stakeholders while minimizing token sell-offs. The Phase 4 token sale experienced a speedy complete sell-off which reflects the intense investor interest because people wanted to secure assets before future price appreciation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates from a clear strategy following upcoming exchange listing which positions the platform for future success in 2025 despite Solana continuing to experience stagnation. Seize the Moment Mutuum Finance (MUTM) leads the crypto market through its merger of useful DeFi technology with features that support investors. People should understand that Phase 4’s entry price of 0.025 USDT will not stay available because Phase 5 will introduce elevated costs for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) altcoin stands out because it brings investors 140% growth upon its exchange listing alongside post-launch potential values of $2.50. Step forward because the crowd is likely to discover this opportunity. You can access Mutuum Finance’s official website to join the presale and acquire your stake position before the token prices rise.

In the video, van Miltenburg referred to Ripple’s payment product as “kind of a SWIFT update or replacement.” Van Miltenburg’s statement points to Ripple’s intent to go beyond incremental improvements. He clarified that Ripple provides core infrastructure in the form of a messaging system, positioning it as a direct evolution of traditional systems like SWIFT. Ripplenet ""…kind of SWIFT update or replacement"" – Eric van Miltenburg, SVP of Strategic Initiatives, @Ripple I saw your convo earlier today @krippenreiter with @XrpArthur and others and remembered this clip. I hope it adds to the discussion. Goes contrary to a ""compliment"". pic.twitter.com/IQKkNnzqjM — 🌸Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) April 19, 2025 This positioning highlights Ripple’s long-held ambition to streamline cross-border payments and improve efficiency across global finance. A prominent crypto expert recently debunked rumors that Ripple and SWIFT were collaborating, but Ripple’s vast XRP-backed payment network remains a viable competitor to SWIFT’s slow and inefficient network. Van Miltenburg noted that Ripple works closely with clients and maintains regulatory compliance throughout its development cycle. He also acknowledged that the company works at the pace of its partners and revealed that the institutions are beginning to accelerate how they operate and innovate. Implications for XRP and SWIFT The comment about Ripple’s product being an “update or replacement” for SWIFT confirms the absence of a partnership between the two parties. Van Miltenburg’s words suggest Ripple is actively working to provide a full-scale alternative that addresses key shortcomings of current systems—namely, speed, cost, and transparency. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The discourse of XRP taking over SWIFT’s role in the cross-border payment space is new, as it fixes all of SWIFT’s bottlenecks with its unparalleled speed and efficiency. SWIFT has been the backbone of cross-border messaging for decades, but its inefficiencies have led to growing demand for more modern solutions. Ripple’s approach integrates messaging and settlement in a single framework, especially when using XRP for liquidity, offering a more comprehensive solution. Reasserting Ripple’s Strategic Direction By sharing the clip, Crypto Eri reinforced Ripple’s original messaging and strategic direction. Rather than allowing softened or diluted interpretations to shape the conversation, she used van Miltenburg’s words to recenter the narrative. Experts have projected that XRP could reach $35.86 by capturing just $1 of SWIFT’s daily volume. Replacing the network entirely could send the asset to triple and even quadruple-digit targets. The video serves as a reminder that Ripple is building infrastructure designed to transform global payments. According to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, SWIFT’s network is outdated , and he expects XRP to usher in a new era for cross-border payments.

The program ran a three-week pilot phase but failed to meet its goals. The initial pilot phase did not bring in strong projects or much activity. This poor performance led the BNB Chain Foundation to make a major overhaul. This fresh start aims to improve results and attract strong blockchain projects. BNB Chain Changes Plan to Bring Better Projects The incentive program was designed to help the BNB Chain grow by attracting new projects. However, early results showed weak on-chain activity and a lack of solid participants. Core metrics fell short of targets, and the program did not deliver the impact the team expected. BNB Chain’s $100M Incentive Program Gets an Upgrade! ⬆️ After a 3-week pilot, feedback showed the current program wasn’t effective. Now, BNB Chain is testing a new direct token acquisition method to improve the program metrics. Here’s what you need to know: 🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/kqNqB22mVn — BNB Chain (@BNBCHAIN) April 18, 2025 So, instead of continuing down the same path, the BNB Chain Foundation has decided to improve the program by setting stricter rules and clearer standards. The focus is now on quality projects that can help the protocol grow more meaningfully. The platform hopes to boost on-chain activity and attract more useful and secure assets by making the selection process tighter. The goal now is to attract better projects, make smarter investments, and improve the ecosystem’s growth. This reward program change comes shortly after BNB Chain finished upgrading its test networks. The upgrade was made to make transactions faster and easier. New Rules for Projects to Get Support Under the new structure, BNB Chain has launched a new token acquisition strategy. Tokens must have a market cap of at least $1 million, over 300 daily active traders, and daily trading volume above $200,000. Tokens must have more than $20 million in value locked in the platform. These changes are meant to attract real users and useful services rather than projects that rely on hype or quick profits. Security is also a top concern. Projects must prove that just a few wallets do not control their tokens. The top 10 wallets must own less than 10% of the total tokens, unless they belong to Binance or trusted companies. This rule is to stop cheating and help people trust the projects more. Every token must follow a clear release plan, and the smart contracts must be checked and safe to use. BNB Chain Will Invest in Selected Projects The foundation will carefully review and select projects that meet all the new rules. Each chosen project will receive an investment of at least $100,000. The foundation will announce every investment publicly on its official BNB Chain X account to ensure transparency and community participation.

Some predict a spectacular rally, while others forecast a sharp decline before there can be any rally. Related Reading: Today’s $1K XRP Bag May Become Tomorrow’s Jackpot, Crypto Founder Says Analyst Predicts 500% Price Jump Based On Chart Pattern From crypto commentator “Steph is Crypto,” Dogecoin looks primed for an epic price surge in excess of 500%. That’s the estimate based on a chart pattern seen before a preceding market cycle during which Dogecoin surged 501% after trending down in the last few weeks. “Bottom signal flashing,” Steph tweeted on social media site X, implying that the same pattern is developing again following another 129-day downtrend. If this trend holds, Dogecoin will rise as much as $0.73583 within the next few weeks. 💥 SIGNAL:$DOGE BOTTOM SIGNAL FLASHING. PREPARE FOR +500% IN THE NEXT WEEKS! #DOGECOIN pic.twitter.com/qGI9Sea4ZJ — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) April 19, 2025 The Drop Before Reversal Not everyone agrees with this optimistic view, though. An alternative prediction from SwallowAcademy on TradingView is that Dogecoin may first see a dramatic fall before it can go up. Their study of the price action of Dogecoin relative to Tether (USDT) indicates a possible 40% drop to the $0.09 support level. SwallowAcademy’s analysis observes that following a brush with close to $0.23 earlier this year, Dogecoin dropped to $0.09 before rising above $0.45. The analyst foresees the same trend happening, with a sharp drop followed by a four times jump that might ultimately retest the $0.45 level. When this report was made, Dogecoin was trading above $0.15. Short-Term Trader Numbers Spike Market intelligence company IntoTheBlock’s data shows dramatic shifts in the behavior of Dogecoin holders. Long-term holders who owned the cryptocurrency for more than a year fell by 2.67% last month. Medium-term holders (one to 12 months) fell by nearly 12%. Meanwhile, short-term traders with holding time of less than one month rose by over 100%. This radical movement toward short-term speculation might signify greater price volatility since these traders will respond rapidly to changes in the market.

VOXEL’s trading volume rose to $12.71 billion in a 24-hour period, significantly higher than Bitcoin’s $4.76 billion volume, raising suspicions of a possible bot malfunction or market manipulation. The exchange acknowledged the anomaly in an official statement, confirming that it detected “abnormal trading behavior” regarding the VOXEL/USDT contract and initiated an investigation. Bitget stated that some user accounts were temporarily restricted as part of risk control measures.

The decision to suspend user accounts and reverse transactions has sparked controversy within the crypto community, with users expressing concerns about centralized risk control mechanisms and the potential impact on trust in the platform.

This happened after trade tariffs were announced for China, underscoring the deepening clash between Washington and Beijing. The single‑aisle jet landed at Boeing Field at 6:11 p.m. after a 5,000‑mile journey that included refueling stops in Guam and Hawaii. CNN reported that it had been waiting at Boeing’s Zhoushan completion center for final checks before handover, but rising duties turned the handover into a financial dead end. Earlier this month, the United States increased baseline tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%. China retaliated with 125% duties on American goods. At a market value near $55 million, a new 737 MAX would cost a Chinese buyer well over twice that figure once the extra charges were added. The abrupt return is the clearest sign yet that commercial aircraft’s long‑standing duty‑free status has been disrupted. Boeing had only just resumed preparing 737 MAX deliveries to China after an almost five‑year freeze linked to safety reviews and a previous round of trade friction. The tariffs have impacted the market on Tuesday after Bloomberg reported that Chinese authorities told domestic carriers to halt all Boeing deliveries. The news sent Boeing shares , a Dow component, down about 1% by midday. The White House and Boeing stayed silent, but President Donald Trump wrote on social media that China “just reneged on the big Boeing deal, saying that they will ‘not take possession’ of fully committed to aircraft.” Airline chiefs and industry analysts warn that aircraft deliveries will stay uncertain due to shifting tariffs. Some carriers say they would rather defer deliveries than pay tariffs. Boeing’s China business is at risk amidst the company’s losses The 737 MAX is Boeing’s best‑selling model and a vital revenue source. Yet the company has been fighting strong headwinds. The company has lost $51 billion in operating losses since 2018, the last year it shared annual profit. China is the world’s largest buyer of passenger jets. In its latest long‑term forecast, Boeing estimated that Chinese airlines will need 8,830 new planes over the next 20 years. With a 125% import duty in place, any U.S.‑built aircraft is out of reach financially. Boeing still builds every commercial plane in the United States and ships almost two‑thirds of them abroad. The company employs about 150,000 people and supports an estimated 1.6 million U.S. jobs, contributing roughly $79 billion to the American economy each year. Several other 737 MAX jets with Chinese branding remain at Zhoushan. Trade specialists say the dispute could still be settled by negotiation, but every day of doubt adds to airlines’ and manufacturers’ expenses. Flying an empty jet halfway around the world, only to park it again, cuts deep into already thin margins for an industry still recovering from pandemic losses.

The Portuguese-language media outlet Livecoins reported that officers served multiple warrants in several cities in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Police think that the gang’s ringleaders are all prisoners, and that the entire racket was orchestrated from Brazilian jails. Protection Racket: Suspects ‘Used Crypto to Launder Funds’ The raids come as part of a wider crackdown named Operation Timeo. The state’s Polícia Civil (PCRS) officers have said they seized tokens from crypto wallets and blocked suspects’ bank accounts. The state of Rio Grande do Sul on a map of Brazil. (Source: TUBS [CC BY-SA 3.0]) The PCRS said that the suspects launched a fraud network to blackmail the owners of small automobile trading garages. Officers added that the suspects also operated a “money laundering scheme.” This scheme reportedly used crypto to process the money they made from their fraud operations. The PCRS added that one suspect has also been charged with carrying a firearm without a permit. Porto Alegre, Brazil. (Source: Bruna Cabrera [CC BY-SA 2.0]) Suspects ‘Targeted Auto Traders in Several Cities’ A police spokesperson confirmed that officers had seized coins from multiple wallets in “several cities.” The PCRS probe saw a total of 60 agents execute 11 search and seizure warrants against suspects in the cities of Porto Alegre, Novo Hamburgo, São Leopoldo, Portão, Cachoeirinha, and Imbé. The São Leopoldo organized crime-fighting department orchestrated the operation. The PCRS said it also froze a total of 13.3 million reais ($2.3 million) in bank accounts belonging to 11 suspects. The police did not disclose the methods they used to seize the crypto. Nor did they reveal the type of coins the suspects used. Officers think that the gang targeted auto garage owners in Estância Velha, Novo Hamburgo, Ivoti, Sapiranga, and Portão. The garages in question were owned by individuals who trade and repair second-hand vehicles. The ringleaders allegedly sent individuals to order the business owners to hand over money “to avoid attacks on their businesses.” Brazil’s government said it will seek a budget surplus next year, likely setting up a clash with investors who are skeptical about the president’s commitment to fiscal responsibility https://t.co/mCU0zdAMbH — Bloomberg (@business) April 15, 2025 Operation Timeo: Ongoing Investigation Officers said they were investigating 10 suspects and one company.

33767162,[object Object],1745191809,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Here Are The Bitcoin Levels To Watch For The Short Term – Analyst,https://bitcoinist.com/here-are-the-bitcoin-levels-to-watch-short-term/,"Bitcoin has produced a range-bound movement recently, with prices oscillating between $83,000 and 86,000 . Interestingly, popular crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci has identified the important price levels for any short-term action. Support At 82,800, Resistance At 92,000 – But Where Is Bitcoin Headed? In a new post on X, Kesmeci shared an interesting on-chain analysis of the Bitcoin market. Using the short-term investor cost basis, the analyst identified two key price levels that could prove critical to Bitcoin’s next major move . Firstly, Burak Kesmeci focuses on the average cost prices of new traders over the past 1-4 weeks, which are likely the most reactive to price changes. The realized price for these traders currently stands at $82,800, forming a near-term support that indicates many recent buyers are still in profit and may defend this level as a psychological floor. Meanwhile, Kesmeci also highlights the $92,000 price level, which marks the average cost basis for BTC holders for 1-3 months. This price point has emerged as an important resistance zone, as investors are likely to exit the market once they break even. Furthermore, the $92,000 price level is also marked by a confluence with various technical indicators. The interplay between these two levels is significant. Historically, short-term bullish trends in BTC tend to begin when the cost basis of more recent investors, 1–4 weeks, crosses above that of the 1–3 BTC holders. This shift signals increased confidence and willingness to buy at higher levels, which often fuels broader rallies. However, that dynamic remains to play out in the current market. As of now, Bitcoin is trading around 85,000, positioning it above its support at the 1–4 week average of $82,800 but still below the 1–3 month resistance of $92,000. Furthermore, both cost basis levels have been declining over the past two months, reflecting hesitation or a lack of aggressive buying from new entrants.Notably, Kesmeci states that BTC must surge above $92,000 to confirm a strong bullish momentum for a price reversal. Bitcoin ETFs Offload 1,725 BTC In other news, Ali Martinez reports that the Bitcoin ETFs have suffered withdrawals of 1,725 Bitcoin, valued at $146.92 million, over the past week. This development illustrates a high level of negative sentiment among institutional investors, adding to market uncertainty around the BTC market. Meanwhile, Bitcoin trades at $85,249 following a price change of 0.89% in the past day. The premier cryptocurrency also reflects a 0.58% loss on the weekly chart and a 1.06% gain on a monthly chart.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin average cost basis|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Burak Kesmeci,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-20 23:30:09

For investors, this isn’t just a token, it’s a way to participate in one of the most revolutionary advancements in blockchain technology. Presale Success Ruvi AI’s presale has already made a big splash in the crypto space. In just a few days the project has moved forward by selling over 10 million tokens and the presale is at $0.01 per token. The $RUVI token is listed at $0.07 and the technology is top notch with even the experts in the field saying one token will be worth more than $1 by this summer. These numbers show how much investors believe in Ruvi AI’s roadmap especially since the project delivers real world utility and financial upside.Ruvi AI’s VIP system is designed to reward its early backers. Of the tiers available VIP Tier 2 is the best for moderate level investors who want to maximize their returns. To qualify for this tier investors need to buy 50,000 $RUVI tokens, with a minimum investment of $500 during the presale. The benefits? You get a 40% token bonus, which is an extra 20,000 tokens, making it 70,000 tokens in total. At the confirmed listing price of $0.07 this would be worth $4,900. If Ruvi AI reaches $1 this would be $70,000. Leaderboard Incentives for Investment Beyond the VIP tiers, Ruvi AI has unique leaderboard rewards to create a competitive and collaborative investment community. The program ensures high-contribution participants are rewarded for their trust and early support. For example, the top 10 investors will each get an extra 500,000 tokens, which would be worth $500,000 if $RUVI reaches $1. The top 50 will get 250,000 tokens and even investors in the top 1,000 will get 20,000 bonus tokens each. This incentivizes bigger participation while creating a sense of belonging among Ruvi AI’s community of backers. Ruvi AI vs XRP While XRP’s liquidity dominance and ETF buzz are great achievements in the financial space, Ruvi AI has a broader vision for blockchain utility. XRP’s value is tied heavily to its role in cross-border payments and potential ETF approval which, while important, is very niche compared to the bigger picture. Ruvi AI is already changing how industries collaborate, innovate and grow by tackling inefficiencies with its blockchain-AI hybrid. From its practical superapp tools to its investment ecosystem, Ruvi AI isn’t about following a trend; it’s about creating one.

Pseudonymous analyst TechDev tells his 520,200 followers on the social media platform X that two macroeconomic factors are flashing bullish for altcoins based on historical precedent. The trader shares a chart suggesting that altcoins tend to explode whenever global liquidity surges and the business cycle bottoms out. Global liquidity refers to the amount of money sloshing in the world’s financial system, while the business cycle tracks the rise and fall of economic activity over time. Says TechDev, “Altcoins don’t run until liquidity breaks out. It’s time.” Source: TechDev/X Based on the trader’s chart, he appears to suggest that altcoins have sparked steep rallies in 2016 and 2020 following a business cycle bottom and a global liquidity breakout. Turning to Bitcoin ( BTC ), the trader predicts that the crypto king will also rally due to the bullish alignment of the two macro factors. “Are you ready?” Source: TechDev/X Zooming in on BTC, the trader predicts that Bitcoin will hit a massive price target this cycle after breaking out from a cup-and-handle pattern, which is typically viewed as a bullish continuation structure, indicating that buyers are stepping in without waiting for the asset to drop to its price lows. “After all the rigorous analysis, will be amusing if it ends up this simple…” Source: TechDev/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that BTC can surge to as high as $500,000 by 2026. At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $85,165.

Buterin proposed replacing ETHE’s current Virtual Machine (EVM) contract language in April 2025 with upgradeable RISC-V instruction set architecture versions. For context, RISC-V is an open-standard, free processor architecture known for its efficiency and flexibility. Buterin makes the case that RISC-V adoption could significantly expedite Ethereum’s execution layer. Buterin identified several bottlenecks responsible for entrenching the growth of Ethereum. He mentioned better availability sampling, a more competitive atmosphere between block producers, and ZK-proving improvements. Thanks to zero-knowledge proofs, key technologies for fast, cheap, and more private transactions. Buterin said Ethereum would have to take “radical steps” to remain competitive. “The beam chain initiative is a very promising way to simplify the consensus layer of Ethereum by a large margin,” he wrote. “But radical changes of this kind could be the only way to drive similar improvements for the execution layer.” The Ethereum community has struggled to find solutions for scaling issues for some time. This latest proposal indicates that a full reworking of the execution layer may be required for Ethereum to survive the next wave of blockchain innovation. Ethereum struggles to boost revenue amid fee collapse Ethereum is facing economic pressure , with transaction fees—the network’s largest source of revenue— falling to their lowest levels in years . Transaction fees on the Ethereum base layer averaged approximately $0.16 per transaction in April 2025. This is the lowest figure the network has seen since 2020. Blob fees — the special fees created by Ethereum’s layer-2 solutions — have collapsed. For the week ending March 30 , blob fees amounted to just 3.18 ETH, roughly $5,000 at current prices. That’s a staggering 95% decline since mid-March. Experts say the fees have declined not because of economic conditions but because users are migrating to the Ethereum base layer. Instead, they select cheaper and quicker layer-2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism. Layer-2s have made transactions cheap, but they’ve also eviscerated the core revenue of Ethereum. Many fear Ethereum’s base layer is being “cannibalized” by its scaling solutions. This means fewer users are completing normal transactions, said Brian Quinlivan, a director at Santiment. Instead, they’re using smart contracts or layer-2s that charge less. Should this continue, Ethereum may have dire financial issues. Investor sentiment is already brittle. Some analysts expect Ether (ETH) prices to collapse to near $1,100 if things go south. Ethereum community responds to RISC-V proposal Vitalik Buterin’s RISC-V concept is rocking the Ethereum Community. Some developers applaud it as a bold step that could help future-proof Ethereum. They think the move to RISC-V will make Ethereum more competitive with newer and speedier blockchains such as Solana and Sui. However, others are worried that the redesign of the execution layer would be a huge project that is fraught with risks. It would involve building portions of Ethereum from the ground up. That can take years at a minimum, require tons of resources, and present new vulnerabilities. It also raises questions about how developers and projects would port over old smart contracts to the new system. This can cause a lot of trouble when it comes to backward compatibility. The proposal has led many to conclude that Ethereum needs to evolve to stay relevant. As next-gen blockchains tempt users and developers onward with minuscule wait times and snap-popper speeds, Ethereum must move forward while innovating to retain its essential ethos. The community has drafted a proposal for public comment in response to the proposal. If accepted, it could signal the start of a new chapter for Ethereum — when the network redeems itself for a future where competition will abound.

The decentralized finance project Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates in phase 4 of its presale at $0.025 per token while it establishes itself as a major competitor against Cardano (ADA). Potential buyers rush to acquire MUTM tokens as the price is set to jump 20% to reach $0.03 in phase 5. The multisegment tokenomics design of the project delivers a 140% return when the tokens list at $0.06 and analysts expect its value to reach $3 following release. The innovative lending model offered by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has become notable after Cardano has faced challenges because of whale sell-offs. This rapid surge in demand establishes MUTM as the DeFi sector’s signature investment opportunity for alert investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) speeds up its 11-stage presale during phase 4 by already selling 412 million tokens. The existing price of $0.025 gives experienced investors a strategic starting point although buyers need to act fast because phase 5 will push the value toward $0.03. Current buyers who participate will obtain a 20% financial advantage from this impending price surge. Analysts predict Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens will reach $3 during 2025 which will produce a substantial ROI of 11,900%. Additionally the project’s tokenomics enable investors to achieve a 140% return when trading at $0.06 after presale. Recent updates show the team has launched a dashboard system which features the top 50 holders who gain bonus tokens from keeping their standings. The new initiative has generated substantial momentum which causes more investors to take part since the phase approaches completion. Cardano (ADA) market struggles ADA token is encountering market pressure because its price dropped to $0.6362 on April 17, 2025 while facing an 1.87% decrease. The token movement analysis of whales showed they sold more than 100 million units during the previous week which could reflect they either took profits or their confidence decreased. The analysts identify the $0.63 price mark as significant support that might trigger an ADA decline to $0.54 if broken. Cardano recorded a 6% weekly price increase but a monthly decline of 10% demonstrates the market sensitivity of its value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) demonstrates superior short-term investment potential through its pre-sale format as founder Charles Hoskinson fails to match the growth seen in this emerging project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) security focus The team of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) actively seeks online smart contracts verification through CertiK while placing trust as their primary focus. The project will publish audit findings throughout its official social presence to underline its dedication to transparent outcomes. The presale becomes increasingly relevant because phase 4 approaches its total capacity. The audit confirms Mutuum Finance (MUTM) places lead priority on investor fund security which differentiates the platform from market participants who operate in an environment of uncertainty. The project’s commitment to security strengthens its position for exchange trading which increases participation of investors seeking the affordable entry point. Seize the opportunity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) works to take down Cardano (ADA) through its forecast that its price will exceed $10 by 2025. Investors in phase 4 can seize the opportunity to obtain 140% returns upon launch while the price could scale to 11,900% after reaching $3 post-launch through the $0.025 entry point. As Cardano stumbles under whale pressure, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is sprinting ahead, blending real-world utility with robust tokenomics.
