The company's most recent acquisition of 3,459 BTC , valued at over $285 million at the time of purchase, on April 14, brought Strategy's total holdings to 531,644 BTC, valued at over $44.9 billion. Saylor followed up on the BTC chart, which he typically posts on Sundays to signal an imminent BTC acquisition, with a breakdown of investor exposure to the company. The executive wrote in an April 20 X post : ""Based on public data as of Q1 2025, over 13,000 institutions and 814,000 retail accounts hold MSTR directly. An estimated 55 million beneficiaries have indirect exposure through ETFs, mutual funds, pensions, and insurance portfolios."" Strategy's growing popularity among retail and institutional investors is significant due to the company siphoning capital from traditional financial markets and into Bitcoin. Increased capital flows translate into the company accumulating and holding more BTC, slowly increasing the price of the supply-capped digital asset. Strategy’s chart of Bitcoin acquisitions. Source: SaylorTracker Related: Has Michael Saylor’s Strategy built a house of cards? Michael Saylor's stock market-to-BTC pipeline Strategy issues corporate debt and equity to finance its Bitcoin acquisitions , giving holders indirect exposure to BTC and feeding capital from traditional financial markets into the Bitcoin market. In December 2024, Strategy was added to the Nasdaq 100 , a weighted stock market index that tracks the 100 largest companies by market capitalization on the Nasdaq exchange. The inclusion of Strategy in the Nasdaq 100 will draw in even more capital to BTC from passive investors holding the tech-focused index in their portfolios. Strategy’s stock is currently trading at around $317. Source: TradingView In February 2025, Bitcoin analyst Julian Fahrer reported that 12 US states had exposure to Strategy , including California, Florida, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, Texas, and Utah. Bloomberg exchange-traded fund (ETF) analyst Eric Balchunas recently said that inflows from Bitcoin ETFs and institutional inflows from companies like Strategy have shored up the Bitcoin market against dumping by short-term speculators. The analyst added that Bitcoin ETFs recorded approximately $2.4 billion in capital flows year-to-date, helping to cushion the price of the digital asset.

Each coin offers unique features and growth potential, but which one is the better investment right now? This article delves into the strengths and future prospects of both cryptocurrencies, guiding readers toward a more informed decision. Cardano Shows Mixed Performance: Gains and Recent Declines ADA dropped 12.55% in the last month and fell 5% over the past week. However, the half-year performance saw a significant increase of 74.17%. These mixed short-term losses coupled with a strong long-term recovery indicate that while the coin can rebound, it is currently facing selling pressure. Traders have experienced fluctuations that highlight both potential risks and opportunities. ADA is currently trading between $0.47 and $1.02, with resistance at $1.37 and support at $0.27. Momentum indicators show a slight bearish sentiment in the short term, yet the overall trend is still unclear. Traders may find buying opportunities near the support level while considering profit-taking close to resistance, which suggests a cautious approach in the current market environment. Polkadot Market Snapshot: Recent Swings and Key Levels Past month activity shows a near 11 percent drop while the six-month performance is down about 10.5%. DOT experienced a slight rally over one week with a 5.38% gain, yet overall figures reveal a cautious market and varied price reactions. Current prices range from $3.38 to $4.96 with support at $2.73 and resistance at $5.89, while a further barrier exists at $7.47. The market lacks a clear trend as oscillators point to a balanced fight between bulls and bears. Traders may consider buying near support and taking profit near resistance, keeping positions flexible amid the sideways range. Conclusion ADA and DOT both show strong potential. ADA boasts a robust ecosystem and an active development team focused on innovation. DOT, on the other hand, excels in enabling interoperability and supports a huge number of projects. The choice between them depends on the specific goals and risk tolerance. Those valuing innovation may favor ADA, while those prioritizing range and interoperability might lean towards DOT. Both coins present unique opportunities for different investment strategies. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This year’s celebrations feel extra special, with hopes rising around upcoming Dogecoin ETF approvals. The phrase Dogeday first began circulating in 2021, associating itself with International Weed Day, April 20, a date long associated with pleasure and counterculture. Since then, Dogecoin fans have made it a tradition to use the day to show their support for the coin, share memes, and highlight key milestones in Dogecoin’s ongoing journey. Originally starting as a joke in 2013, Dogecoin has grown into one of the largest cryptocurrencies. It is now the eighth largest by market cap, with a valuation of roughly $23.3 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data. DOGEUSDT 15-minute price chart. Source: TradingView Dogecoin’s success comes down, in large part, to its sense of community, experts say. Its model, adding around 5 billion new coins yearly, keeps it low-cost to the average new investor. “Bitcoin or Ethereum has a fixed supply, while Dogecoin’s inflation allows small investors to hold large amounts,” said Anndy Lian, a blockchain advisor. On this year’s Dogeday, hashtags such as #Dogeday2025 and #DogecoinToTheMoon trended on X. There were memes of Doge in space suits, jokes about “becoming billionaires,” and videos celebrating the resilience of Dogecoin . Investors pin hopes on Dogecoin ETF approvals As the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) analyzes several exchange-traded funds (ETF) applications associated with the meme coin, the Dogecoin community remains optimistically focused. Major players, including Bitwise, Grayscale, 21Shares , and Osprey Funds, have proposals pending. The decision on its Dogecoin ETF comes as soon as May 18. Grayscale’s application has a May 21 deadline, although the SEC could still push back a final decision until October. The 21Shares and Osprey Fund’s filings are still waiting on a response date. This is why the approval of a Dogecoin ETF would be monumental. This would essentially expose more conventional investors to the meme crypto in the stock markets. The SEC recently delayed its decisions on several crypto ETF proposals. However, since the approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, there’s cautious optimism for meme coins, like Dogecoin, to follow. If approved, a Dogecoin ETF would enable conventional investors, such as pension funds and banks, to invest in Dogecoin via regular stock exchanges. This would open up a huge new pool of money to the Dogecoin market and might be enough to increase prices. Elon Musk’s influence continues to power Dogecoin’s hype A big reason for Dogecoin’s continued success is the continued support of Elon Musk. The billionaire who founded the carmaker Tesla and the aerospace company SpaceX has several times called Dogecoin “the people’s crypto.” Whenever Musk tweets or jokes about Dogecoin, the coin price usually spikes. When he temporarily switched Twitter’s logo to the Doge image last year, it sent Dogecoin soaring 20% in hours. In November 2024, after Musk once again endorsed Dogecoin, the world’s seventh most valuable cryptocurrency surpassed luxury carmaker Porsche’s overall market value. Critics say Dogecoin’s dependence on social media buzz is a risky proposition. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, Dogecoin lacks smart contracts, staking, and other technical features. Of course, this is all culture, memes, and community passion. With 2025 looking more and more like the year and the ETF decision looming sooner than we can imagine, there is hope in the $DOGE community. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Buying momentum has turned positive in the past 24 hours, but an interesting technical analysis of the current price action points to a looming downside risk. Related Reading: BNB Weathers The Storm Better Than Altcoins, Stats Show Crypto analyst Xanrox laid out a bearish case for Bitcoin in an analysis on the TradingView platform, arguing that the ongoing falling wedge pattern, often seen as a bullish indicator, may actually be a calculated trap set by whales. According to his analysis, Bitcoin could crash to $67,000 before another strong move upwards. Bitcoin’s Falling Wedge That Might Not Be Bullish After All Xanrox’s main argument centers on the widespread belief that falling wedges are bullish reversal patterns. Although this is often true when the wedge forms at the start of a trend, the current wedge is forming at the end of a broader trend, which is a different scenario altogether. The daily candlestick timeframe chart shows the Bitcoin price moving inside a clean wedge structure while trading well below the 20, 50, 100, and 200 daily moving averages. This setup, according to Xanrox, paints the picture of a clear downtrend rather than a setup for a reversal. The bearish outlook is not just about chart patterns; it’s also about market psychology and the mechanics of liquidity. Such a setup is likely being exploited by whales in institutions and banks with enough liquidity to influence price action. These whales need retail buyers to create enough volume for them to offload or accumulate positions. By painting the illusion of a breakout, they can push retail participants into a false sense of opportunity, only to reverse the market and trigger stop losses across the board. This outlook plays into the growing notion that Bitcoin is increasingly becoming more of an asset among institutions, primarily due to the rise of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Chart Image From TradingView: Xanrox 20% Price Move For Bitcoin This Week Xanrox predicted a 20% move for Bitcoin this week. A 20% move to the upside from the current $85,000 range would see Bitcoin trading back above $100,000 and somewhere around $102,000. However, this predicted 20% move isn’t an upside move but a downside move. Particularly, the analyst identified $67,000 as the level Bitcoin is most likely to test in the coming weeks. The $67,000 price level is the primary target if the current wedge fails as expected, as it is the major support on the way down if $75,000 is broken. Related Reading: Today’s $1K XRP Bag May Become Tomorrow’s Jackpot, Crypto Founder Says Even if the predicted 20% downside move fails to materialize this new week, there is still the possibility of the move taking place in the coming weeks. The analyst suggests Bitcoin may attempt to retest the upper zone between $108,000 and $91,000 before heading lower. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $84,280.

Analysts tracking early-stage asset cycles now place the token in the 33x ROI target range based on key metrics, including: Market cap-to-volume acceleration Pre-discovery phase retention rates Structural tokenomics and controlled circulating supply These aren’t speculative data points—they reflect patterns that closely mirror those seen in other high-performing assets before they surged.

Among the 12 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, only three showed activity, with BlackRock’s IBIT leading the inflows at $80.96 million. Fidelity’s FBTC also contributed to the positive movement. Year-to-date, BlackRock’s IBIT has attracted $2.4 billion in inflows, indicating a stable investor base supported by consistent buying from ETFs and figures like Michael Saylor during market dips. Public companies increased their Bitcoin holdings by 16.1% in the first quarter of 2025, adding 95,431 BTC to reach a total of 688,000 BTC valued at $56.7 billion. This amount represents 3.28% of Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins. Additionally, U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) have accumulated 529,325 BTC, surpassing the 249,725 BTC mined since their launch, reflecting strong institutional interest. The total assets under management (AUM) for Bitcoin ETFs stood at approximately $92.5 billion as of April 20, 2025, with these ETFs owning 5.52% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Meanwhile, gold ETFs saw record inflows, with about $8 billion entering in the past week alone, contributing to a total of $80 billion in net inflows year-to-date, nearly triple the previous record set during the 2020 crisis. This surge in gold ETF inflows signals waning trust in the current financial system and has raised concerns about a potentially crowded trade. Ethereum ETFs, by contrast, experienced outflows of 16,240 ETH over the past week, with a total AUM of $5.33 billion, representing 2.72% of Ethereum’s supply. Market data as of April 20, 2025, showed Bitcoin trading at around $85,040, with March 2026 Deribit Bitcoin futures priced at approximately $89,838 and an annualized basis rate of 6.59%.

From borderless transactions to tokenized assets and smart contract-powered apps, blockchain is solving real problems, especially across Latin America where inflation, limited financial access, and cross-border constraints are part of daily life. For backers eyeing the top cryptos to join now, timing is everything. The biggest gains often go to those who move early—before the headlines, before the hype. Three projects are standing out this week for their ability to blend real-world utility with serious community momentum: Qubetics , Litecoin, and Tezos. One is setting a new benchmark in asset tokenization. The others are long-standing, battle-tested platforms with unique value in the decentralized economy. Let’s start with the frontrunner. Qubetics – Real World Asset Tokenization Made Seamless Qubetics isn’t trying to copy what others are doing—it’s rewriting the rules. Its biggest draw right now is its Real World Asset (RWA) Tokenization Marketplace, which is making it easier for businesses, professionals, and everyday buyers to digitize and trade real assets on-chain. Picture this: a small firm in Monterrey wants to tokenize its machinery for leasing agreements. Or a real estate developer in Medellín wants to turn property shares into tradeable, fractional digital tokens. Even independent consultants in Mexico City can tokenize invoice receivables for instant liquidity. Qubetics makes all of that happen—legally, securely, and across chains. It’s not just about blockchain for the sake of blockchain. Qubetics is building tools for people who want to put assets to work, without red tape or banking delays. The marketplace is audit-ready, compliant, and deeply customizable—whether you’re issuing financial instruments or managing tokenized inventory. For Latin American economies, where trust in institutions can fluctuate and access to capital is uneven, this kind of decentralized asset management hits home. That’s why Qubetics is considered one of the top cryptos to join now. It offers real-world functionality that helps everyday businesses, freelancers, and side hustlers get more control over their finances while opening up new revenue models across borders. Qubetics Presale Stats and ROI Projections That Matter The current Qubetics crypto presale is in its 30th stage, and it’s flying. Over 508 million $TICS tokens have already been sold to 24,900+ holders, raising a total of $16.2 million. Right now, community members can still buy in at $0.1729 per token. Those who came in at stage one, when $TICS was just a penny, are now looking at a wild 1629% return. But here’s the thing—it’s not too late to enter. Based on current projections, getting in at $0.1729 could still net a 477% ROI if the token reaches $1 post-presale. At $5, that’s 2789%. At $10? Try 5678%. And if it surges to $15 after the mainnet launch, that’s a mind-blowing 8567% return. These aren’t pipe dreams. Analysts are crunching the numbers based on real infrastructure, strong demand, and rising use cases across global markets. The presale’s still live—but spots are getting tighter every day. Qubetics delivers real value, offers extraordinary growth potential, and solves concrete problems for a region that’s hungry for financial freedom. For anyone asking what are the top cryptos to join now, this one’s got to be on the radar. Litecoin – Speed, Simplicity, and Staying Power Litecoin is a name that’s been around the block—and that’s exactly why it’s still here. Created in 2011 as a lighter, faster version of Bitcoin, Litecoin has earned a rep as one of the most dependable cryptos in the game. It’s not flashy. It’s not hyped. But when people need a network that processes payments quickly and cheaply, they go with Litecoin. It’s especially popular across Latin America, where folks use it for remittances, peer-to-peer transfers, and even direct merchant payments. Thanks to its fast block time and low fees, Litecoin functions more like a traditional payment rail—but without the limitations of banks, borders, or approvals. Behind the scenes, Litecoin has consistently updated its core tech, integrating privacy features like MimbleWimble to give users more control over their transaction data. Plus, it’s widely accepted across thousands of merchants, online platforms, and payment processors. Litecoin isn’t trying to do everything. It’s laser-focused on being sound money—a digital alternative to cash that people can use with ease. That singular focus has helped it build one of the most trusted brands in the crypto world. Litecoin is one of the top cryptos to join now for those looking to balance high-growth plays like Qubetics with steady, practical blockchain tech that gets real-world usage every day. Tezos – Smart Contracts With Self-Upgrading Power Tezos is one of those projects that quietly builds while others make noise. Known for its self-amending blockchain, Tezos can upgrade without forks—meaning no community splits or downtime when key features roll out. That’s rare and powerful in a space often shaken by protocol wars and governance disputes. What makes Tezos attractive to developers and institutions alike is its clean design. It supports smart contracts, NFTs, and scalable apps, all while using a liquid proof-of-stake system that’s energy-efficient and secure. And the on-chain governance model?

What’s Next for Dogecoin, Shiba Inu & PEPE After the Correction",https://bitzo.com/2025/04/memecoin-comeback-whats-next-for-dogecoin-shiba-inu-pepe-after-the-correction,"Memecoins have recently faced a downturn, making many wonder about their future. This article delves into the potential next moves for Dogecoin , Shiba Inu , and PEPE after their recent correction. Could they be poised for another surge? This exploration offers insights into whether these popular digital coins are on the verge of a comeback. Dogecoin Price Analysis: Short-Term Dips versus 6-Month Gains DOGE dropped by about 7.27% over the last month while showing an overall gain of roughly 8.88% in the past six months. The coin has experienced short-term declines against a backdrop of more positive midterm recovery. This behavior reflects a period of volatility with recent setbacks outweighing long-term recovery trends. The current price ranges between $0.12 and $0.22 with major resistance near $0.28 and a secondary barrier around $0.38. Support is seen at around $0.08 with a lower level at zero. Short-term indicators and recent weekly losses nearing 6.60% suggest cautious trading. Bears currently dominate the price action, so traders may seek a clear breakout within these key levels before initiating new positions. Shiba Inu Price Action Amid Mixed Trends SHIB has shown a modest drop over the past week at -0.56% and a slight pullback of -3.78% for the month. Over the past six months, the performance reveals a steeper decline of -32.08%. The price has fluctuated within a range from $0.00001024 to $0.00001509. Indicators present a mixed picture, with a modest positive momentum of 0.00000086 contrasted by a negative Awesome Oscillator reading of -0.000000399. Current prices are trading between key support levels at $0.00000811 and $0.00000325, with resistances at $0.00001781 and $0.00002265. The market lacks a clear trend, as oscillators indicate neutrality. However, slight bullish signals from the momentum indicator suggest potential buying opportunities within these defined ranges. Upbeat Pepe Momentum Amid Mixed Trends PEPE price action shows a slight drop over the past month of 1.06% and a sharper decline over the last six months of 25.91%. Price moves have been volatile, reflecting short-term recovery attempts contrasted with a longer-term bearish sentiment. Data hints at alternating pressures with modest weekly gains of 1.48% that have not been sustained to overcome the extended downturn. Current price ranges from $0.0000052 to $0.0000092 with key support identified at $0.0000032 and resistance near $0.0000112. Price action is balanced with near-neutral RSI levels at 54.08, indicating mild buying pressure but no clear trend. Trading within these levels could involve testing the support zone before looking to make moves toward established resistance. Conclusion DOGE , SHIB , and PEPE have shown resilience despite the recent correction. DOGE's established presence keeps interest high. SHIB draws attention through its strong community and frequent updates. PEPE remains popular due to its meme appeal. Future movements depend on broader market trends and continued interest in meme-based tokens. Staying informed about these coins will be key to understanding their next steps.

Standard Chartered predicts it will reach $55 by year end due to its subnet architecture. This is a game changer for scalability and cost reduction. Avalanche is a serious competitor to Ethereum and Bitcoin. After the December upgrade, developer interest in the ecosystem has gone through the roof. Avalanche is on a roll. But while Avalanche is tackling the scalability problem, another project is taking a different approach. Ruvi AI is carving out its own space in the blockchain ecosystem by combining artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to deliver real world impact and tangible benefits to users across industries. Introducing Ruvi AI Unlike Avalanche which is addressing structural inefficiencies, Ruvi AI is combining blockchain with AI to deliver practical and effective solutions. Its superapp is intuitive and supports workflow automation, creative process enhancement and operational streamlining. This makes Ruvi AI a must have platform for creators, businesses and developers to stay ahead of the curve. At the heart of this ecosystem is the $RUVI token , a fundamental part of the platform that enables secure interactions and is a promising investment opportunity. Backed by a transparent roadmap and huge growth potential, $RUVI token is more than just a utility token; it’s a gateway to a tech driven revolution. Ruvi AI’s Presale Success The presale of Ruvi AI has been phenomenal, the level of trust and excitement in the market is huge. Within days of launch 10 million tokens were sold, raising $100,000. The token was priced at $0.01 during presale and will be listed at $0.07, making it a very attractive opportunity for investors. Forecasts suggest the token could hit $1 post listing, which makes Ruvi AI one of the best investment in the blockchain space today. VIP Tier 3 Benefits One of the best things about Ruvi AI is its VIP tier system, a well thought out system that rewards presale participants with awesome benefits. VIP Tier 3 has gotten a lot of attention especially from mid to high level investors. The minimum investment to qualify for it is 100,000 tokens, which is $1,000 during the presale, participants in this tier get a 60% bonus. This bonus adds 60,000 tokens to the original purchase, making it 160,000 tokens. At the listing price of $0.07 this would be worth $11,200 and if the $1 valuation is hit, the value would be $160,000. The combination of accessibility and high returns makes Tier 3 impossible to resist for those who want to maximize their investment in a game changing innovation. Leaderboard Rewards for Dedicated Investors To further drive participation, Ruvi AI has a leaderboard rewards program that rewards top presale contributors with big bonuses. The top 10 most loyal supporters get 500,000 tokens, worth $500,000 at the $1 valuationThe top 50 get 250,000 tokens, worth $250,000 and 1,000 participants get 20,000 tokens each, worth $20,000 at peak projections. This rewards system is designed to not only create excitement around the project but also a sense of community and shared vision among Ruvi AI’s early adopters. Why Ruvi AI Isn’t Just Another Blockchain Project Avalanche is laying the groundwork for blockchain scalability with its subnet strategy but it’s focused on structural inefficiencies. Ruvi AI is taking a more practical approach by targeting usability and tangible results for its users. By combining blockchain and AI, Ruvi AI delivers solutions that are not just theoretical but already having real world impact on people and businesses. And with Ruvi AI’s VIP rewards and leaderboard incentives it’s even more attractive for investors. The roadmap is transparent and focused on short and long term value creation so you get practical innovation not hype. Why RUVI AI is The Future? Avalanche’s scalability strategy will reshape blockchain infrastructure over the next few years but Ruvi AI is redefining how blockchain can solve real world problems today. With its presale success and VIP tiers and leaderboard rewards, it’s a leader in blockchain and AI innovation. Now is the time to act. Ruvi AI gives you the opportunity to invest in future thinking technology and be part of a community that’s driving real change. Don’t just watch the future happen. Be part of it with Ruvi AI. Invest now and secure your spot at the forefront of blockchain and AI.

This Altcoin Is A Strong Pick,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/looking-to-buy-the-next-solana-sol-before-everyone-else-this-altcoin-is-a-strong-pick/,"Investors search for the upcoming Solana (SOL) to experience rapid price increase. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been grabbing investor interest through its ongoing presale which entered phase 4 while raising $6.9 million by selling more than 412 million tokens. With 8,400 holders already on board, the current price of $0.025 offers a narrow window before a 20% jump to $0.03 in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) phase 5. This DeFi project connects lending and borrowing methods and a buyback system to replicate early Solana functionality but introduces original features. The crypto market currently searches for utility-driven tokens, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers itself as a leading solution. Does this new token Mutuum Finance (MUTM) hold potential to surpass the skyrocketing success of Solana? Let’s explore. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) surges in phase 4 out of 11 phases of its presale process. Phase 5 of the presale is set to launch at $0.03 instead 20% from current $0.025 which provides a quick profit for people who buy tokens now. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokenomics feature a mechanism that will generate a 140% profit opportunity based on the $0.06 listing price. Initial investors have the chance to accumulate potential returns of 9,900% after Mutuum Finance (MUTM) soars to a $2.50 token value. An ongoing Certik audit for smart contracts will provide audit results on social media platforms to enhance trust in the project. The recent Mutuum Finance (MUTM) dashboard introduction of a top 50 holder reward system has added new drive to the project. Solana (SOL) Faces Stiff Competition During 2021 Solana (SOL) hit unprecedented heights because of its fast blockchain but lost momentum in 2025. The current market price of $126 positions SOL at a disadvantage for reaching previous peak levels since market participants choose alternative investments. The scalability advantage of Solana faces diminishing momentum because Mutuum Finance (MUTM) among other new projects bring innovative DeFi services to the marketplace. Mutuum’s lending model, with mtTokens accruing interest and a buyback system fueling demand, contrasts with Solana’s broader focus. As Mutuum Finance (MUTM) builds a loyal user base, it’s poised to challenge Solana’s dominance in the altcoin space. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Shines The primary focus of MUTM stands alone from market hype because it provides practical product features. The overcollateralized structure ensures stable operations by permitting users to borrow ETH and lenders earn adjustable interest payments. The platform revenue channels through a buy-and-distribute mechanism that performs both token repurchases and rewards for stakeholders while minimizing token sell-offs. The Phase 4 token sale experienced a speedy complete sell-off which reflects the intense investor interest because people wanted to secure assets before future price appreciation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates from a clear strategy following upcoming exchange listing which positions the platform for future success in 2025 despite Solana continuing to experience stagnation. Seize the Moment Mutuum Finance (MUTM) leads the crypto market through its merger of useful DeFi technology with features that support investors. People should understand that Phase 4’s entry price of 0.025 USDT will not stay available because Phase 5 will introduce elevated costs for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) altcoin stands out because it brings investors 140% growth upon its exchange listing alongside post-launch potential values of $2.50. Step forward because the crowd is likely to discover this opportunity. You can access Mutuum Finance’s official website to join the presale and acquire your stake position before the token prices rise.

In the video, van Miltenburg referred to Ripple’s payment product as “kind of a SWIFT update or replacement.” Van Miltenburg’s statement points to Ripple’s intent to go beyond incremental improvements. He clarified that Ripple provides core infrastructure in the form of a messaging system, positioning it as a direct evolution of traditional systems like SWIFT. Ripplenet ""…kind of SWIFT update or replacement"" – Eric van Miltenburg, SVP of Strategic Initiatives, @Ripple I saw your convo earlier today @krippenreiter with @XrpArthur and others and remembered this clip. I hope it adds to the discussion. Goes contrary to a ""compliment"". pic.twitter.com/IQKkNnzqjM — 🌸Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) April 19, 2025 This positioning highlights Ripple’s long-held ambition to streamline cross-border payments and improve efficiency across global finance. A prominent crypto expert recently debunked rumors that Ripple and SWIFT were collaborating, but Ripple’s vast XRP-backed payment network remains a viable competitor to SWIFT’s slow and inefficient network. Van Miltenburg noted that Ripple works closely with clients and maintains regulatory compliance throughout its development cycle. He also acknowledged that the company works at the pace of its partners and revealed that the institutions are beginning to accelerate how they operate and innovate. Implications for XRP and SWIFT The comment about Ripple’s product being an “update or replacement” for SWIFT confirms the absence of a partnership between the two parties. Van Miltenburg’s words suggest Ripple is actively working to provide a full-scale alternative that addresses key shortcomings of current systems—namely, speed, cost, and transparency. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The discourse of XRP taking over SWIFT’s role in the cross-border payment space is new, as it fixes all of SWIFT’s bottlenecks with its unparalleled speed and efficiency. SWIFT has been the backbone of cross-border messaging for decades, but its inefficiencies have led to growing demand for more modern solutions. Ripple’s approach integrates messaging and settlement in a single framework, especially when using XRP for liquidity, offering a more comprehensive solution. Reasserting Ripple’s Strategic Direction By sharing the clip, Crypto Eri reinforced Ripple’s original messaging and strategic direction. Rather than allowing softened or diluted interpretations to shape the conversation, she used van Miltenburg’s words to recenter the narrative. Experts have projected that XRP could reach $35.86 by capturing just $1 of SWIFT’s daily volume. Replacing the network entirely could send the asset to triple and even quadruple-digit targets. The video serves as a reminder that Ripple is building infrastructure designed to transform global payments. According to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, SWIFT’s network is outdated , and he expects XRP to usher in a new era for cross-border payments.

The program ran a three-week pilot phase but failed to meet its goals. The initial pilot phase did not bring in strong projects or much activity. This poor performance led the BNB Chain Foundation to make a major overhaul. This fresh start aims to improve results and attract strong blockchain projects. BNB Chain Changes Plan to Bring Better Projects The incentive program was designed to help the BNB Chain grow by attracting new projects. However, early results showed weak on-chain activity and a lack of solid participants. Core metrics fell short of targets, and the program did not deliver the impact the team expected. BNB Chain’s $100M Incentive Program Gets an Upgrade! ⬆️ After a 3-week pilot, feedback showed the current program wasn’t effective. Now, BNB Chain is testing a new direct token acquisition method to improve the program metrics. Here’s what you need to know: 🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/kqNqB22mVn — BNB Chain (@BNBCHAIN) April 18, 2025 So, instead of continuing down the same path, the BNB Chain Foundation has decided to improve the program by setting stricter rules and clearer standards. The focus is now on quality projects that can help the protocol grow more meaningfully. The platform hopes to boost on-chain activity and attract more useful and secure assets by making the selection process tighter. The goal now is to attract better projects, make smarter investments, and improve the ecosystem’s growth. This reward program change comes shortly after BNB Chain finished upgrading its test networks. The upgrade was made to make transactions faster and easier. New Rules for Projects to Get Support Under the new structure, BNB Chain has launched a new token acquisition strategy. Tokens must have a market cap of at least $1 million, over 300 daily active traders, and daily trading volume above $200,000. Tokens must have more than $20 million in value locked in the platform. These changes are meant to attract real users and useful services rather than projects that rely on hype or quick profits. Security is also a top concern. Projects must prove that just a few wallets do not control their tokens. The top 10 wallets must own less than 10% of the total tokens, unless they belong to Binance or trusted companies. This rule is to stop cheating and help people trust the projects more. Every token must follow a clear release plan, and the smart contracts must be checked and safe to use. BNB Chain Will Invest in Selected Projects The foundation will carefully review and select projects that meet all the new rules. Each chosen project will receive an investment of at least $100,000. The foundation will announce every investment publicly on its official BNB Chain X account to ensure transparency and community participation.

Some predict a spectacular rally, while others forecast a sharp decline before there can be any rally. Related Reading: Today’s $1K XRP Bag May Become Tomorrow’s Jackpot, Crypto Founder Says Analyst Predicts 500% Price Jump Based On Chart Pattern From crypto commentator “Steph is Crypto,” Dogecoin looks primed for an epic price surge in excess of 500%. That’s the estimate based on a chart pattern seen before a preceding market cycle during which Dogecoin surged 501% after trending down in the last few weeks. “Bottom signal flashing,” Steph tweeted on social media site X, implying that the same pattern is developing again following another 129-day downtrend. If this trend holds, Dogecoin will rise as much as $0.73583 within the next few weeks. 💥 SIGNAL:$DOGE BOTTOM SIGNAL FLASHING. PREPARE FOR +500% IN THE NEXT WEEKS! #DOGECOIN pic.twitter.com/qGI9Sea4ZJ — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) April 19, 2025 The Drop Before Reversal Not everyone agrees with this optimistic view, though. An alternative prediction from SwallowAcademy on TradingView is that Dogecoin may first see a dramatic fall before it can go up. Their study of the price action of Dogecoin relative to Tether (USDT) indicates a possible 40% drop to the $0.09 support level. SwallowAcademy’s analysis observes that following a brush with close to $0.23 earlier this year, Dogecoin dropped to $0.09 before rising above $0.45. The analyst foresees the same trend happening, with a sharp drop followed by a four times jump that might ultimately retest the $0.45 level. When this report was made, Dogecoin was trading above $0.15. Short-Term Trader Numbers Spike Market intelligence company IntoTheBlock’s data shows dramatic shifts in the behavior of Dogecoin holders. Long-term holders who owned the cryptocurrency for more than a year fell by 2.67% last month. Medium-term holders (one to 12 months) fell by nearly 12%. Meanwhile, short-term traders with holding time of less than one month rose by over 100%. This radical movement toward short-term speculation might signify greater price volatility since these traders will respond rapidly to changes in the market.

Large holder inflows increased by over 5% in the last week, as reported by IntoTheBlock. On a longer term basis, these inflows were up 324% in the last 30 days. This increase in whale activity indicates significant investors may be setting themselves up for future price action even though daily trading continues to be dominated by smaller, short-term traders.

VOXEL’s trading volume rose to $12.71 billion in a 24-hour period, significantly higher than Bitcoin’s $4.76 billion volume, raising suspicions of a possible bot malfunction or market manipulation. The exchange acknowledged the anomaly in an official statement, confirming that it detected “abnormal trading behavior” regarding the VOXEL/USDT contract and initiated an investigation. Bitget stated that some user accounts were temporarily restricted as part of risk control measures.

The decision to suspend user accounts and reverse transactions has sparked controversy within the crypto community, with users expressing concerns about centralized risk control mechanisms and the potential impact on trust in the platform.

This happened after trade tariffs were announced for China, underscoring the deepening clash between Washington and Beijing. The single‑aisle jet landed at Boeing Field at 6:11 p.m. after a 5,000‑mile journey that included refueling stops in Guam and Hawaii. CNN reported that it had been waiting at Boeing’s Zhoushan completion center for final checks before handover, but rising duties turned the handover into a financial dead end. Earlier this month, the United States increased baseline tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%. China retaliated with 125% duties on American goods. At a market value near $55 million, a new 737 MAX would cost a Chinese buyer well over twice that figure once the extra charges were added. The abrupt return is the clearest sign yet that commercial aircraft’s long‑standing duty‑free status has been disrupted. Boeing had only just resumed preparing 737 MAX deliveries to China after an almost five‑year freeze linked to safety reviews and a previous round of trade friction. The tariffs have impacted the market on Tuesday after Bloomberg reported that Chinese authorities told domestic carriers to halt all Boeing deliveries. The news sent Boeing shares , a Dow component, down about 1% by midday. The White House and Boeing stayed silent, but President Donald Trump wrote on social media that China “just reneged on the big Boeing deal, saying that they will ‘not take possession’ of fully committed to aircraft.” Airline chiefs and industry analysts warn that aircraft deliveries will stay uncertain due to shifting tariffs. Some carriers say they would rather defer deliveries than pay tariffs. Boeing’s China business is at risk amidst the company’s losses The 737 MAX is Boeing’s best‑selling model and a vital revenue source. Yet the company has been fighting strong headwinds. The company has lost $51 billion in operating losses since 2018, the last year it shared annual profit. China is the world’s largest buyer of passenger jets. In its latest long‑term forecast, Boeing estimated that Chinese airlines will need 8,830 new planes over the next 20 years. With a 125% import duty in place, any U.S.‑built aircraft is out of reach financially. Boeing still builds every commercial plane in the United States and ships almost two‑thirds of them abroad. The company employs about 150,000 people and supports an estimated 1.6 million U.S. jobs, contributing roughly $79 billion to the American economy each year. Several other 737 MAX jets with Chinese branding remain at Zhoushan. Trade specialists say the dispute could still be settled by negotiation, but every day of doubt adds to airlines’ and manufacturers’ expenses. Flying an empty jet halfway around the world, only to park it again, cuts deep into already thin margins for an industry still recovering from pandemic losses.

The Portuguese-language media outlet Livecoins reported that officers served multiple warrants in several cities in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Police think that the gang’s ringleaders are all prisoners, and that the entire racket was orchestrated from Brazilian jails. Protection Racket: Suspects ‘Used Crypto to Launder Funds’ The raids come as part of a wider crackdown named Operation Timeo. The state’s Polícia Civil (PCRS) officers have said they seized tokens from crypto wallets and blocked suspects’ bank accounts. The state of Rio Grande do Sul on a map of Brazil. (Source: TUBS [CC BY-SA 3.0]) The PCRS said that the suspects launched a fraud network to blackmail the owners of small automobile trading garages. Officers added that the suspects also operated a “money laundering scheme.” This scheme reportedly used crypto to process the money they made from their fraud operations. The PCRS added that one suspect has also been charged with carrying a firearm without a permit. Porto Alegre, Brazil. (Source: Bruna Cabrera [CC BY-SA 2.0]) Suspects ‘Targeted Auto Traders in Several Cities’ A police spokesperson confirmed that officers had seized coins from multiple wallets in “several cities.” The PCRS probe saw a total of 60 agents execute 11 search and seizure warrants against suspects in the cities of Porto Alegre, Novo Hamburgo, São Leopoldo, Portão, Cachoeirinha, and Imbé. The São Leopoldo organized crime-fighting department orchestrated the operation. The PCRS said it also froze a total of 13.3 million reais ($2.3 million) in bank accounts belonging to 11 suspects. The police did not disclose the methods they used to seize the crypto. Nor did they reveal the type of coins the suspects used. Officers think that the gang targeted auto garage owners in Estância Velha, Novo Hamburgo, Ivoti, Sapiranga, and Portão. The garages in question were owned by individuals who trade and repair second-hand vehicles. The ringleaders allegedly sent individuals to order the business owners to hand over money “to avoid attacks on their businesses.” Brazil’s government said it will seek a budget surplus next year, likely setting up a clash with investors who are skeptical about the president’s commitment to fiscal responsibility https://t.co/mCU0zdAMbH — Bloomberg (@business) April 15, 2025 Operation Timeo: Ongoing Investigation Officers said they were investigating 10 suspects and one company.

A spokesperson said further investigations “may reveal a broader criminal network” involving extortion and money laundering.

Analysts point to XRP’s liquidity dominance which is double that of Cardano as a key factor. With a recent XRP ETF launch that showed impressive debut volumes, the narrative is clear—XRP is positioning itself as a leader in the crypto space. But amidst all this hype, we need to ask if XRP or any other single crypto project provides the best opportunity for growth and utility for investors. Enter Ruvi AI . While XRP is strengthening its position in financial applications, Ruvi AI is reimagining the blockchain landscape altogether through the seamless integration of AI. Why Ruvi AI Stands Out Ruvi AI’s platform merges blockchain technology and AI-driven tools to deliver tangible benefits to businesses, creators and individuals. Unlike speculative assets, Ruvi AI is functional, allowing users to automate workflows, optimize creativity and enhance efficiency across multiple industries. Its superapp ecosystem isn’t just a concept, it’s a solution to problems in real-time. The $RUVI Token At the heart of Ruvi AI is its native $RUVI token which powers interactions and transactions within its ecosystem. Designed with scalability and security in mind, it enables smart-contract execution and ecosystem rewards. For investors, this isn’t just a token, it’s a way to participate in one of the most revolutionary advancements in blockchain technology. Presale Success Ruvi AI’s presale has already made a big splash in the crypto space. In just a few days the project has moved forward by selling over 10 million tokens and the presale is at $0.01 per token. The $RUVI token is listed at $0.07 and the technology is top notch with even the experts in the field saying one token will be worth more than $1 by this summer. These numbers show how much investors believe in Ruvi AI’s roadmap especially since the project delivers real world utility and financial upside.Ruvi AI’s VIP system is designed to reward its early backers. Of the tiers available VIP Tier 2 is the best for moderate level investors who want to maximize their returns. To qualify for this tier investors need to buy 50,000 $RUVI tokens, with a minimum investment of $500 during the presale. The benefits? You get a 40% token bonus, which is an extra 20,000 tokens, making it 70,000 tokens in total. At the confirmed listing price of $0.07 this would be worth $4,900. If Ruvi AI reaches $1 this would be $70,000. Leaderboard Incentives for Investment Beyond the VIP tiers, Ruvi AI has unique leaderboard rewards to create a competitive and collaborative investment community. The program ensures high-contribution participants are rewarded for their trust and early support. For example, the top 10 investors will each get an extra 500,000 tokens, which would be worth $500,000 if $RUVI reaches $1. The top 50 will get 250,000 tokens and even investors in the top 1,000 will get 20,000 bonus tokens each. This incentivizes bigger participation while creating a sense of belonging among Ruvi AI’s community of backers. Ruvi AI vs XRP While XRP’s liquidity dominance and ETF buzz are great achievements in the financial space, Ruvi AI has a broader vision for blockchain utility. XRP’s value is tied heavily to its role in cross-border payments and potential ETF approval which, while important, is very niche compared to the bigger picture. Ruvi AI is already changing how industries collaborate, innovate and grow by tackling inefficiencies with its blockchain-AI hybrid. From its practical superapp tools to its investment ecosystem, Ruvi AI isn’t about following a trend; it’s about creating one. Join the Revolution XRP is strengthening its position in financial applications, but Ruvi AI is going to change the game altogether. With functionality that goes way beyond financial transactions and rewards systems designed for investors, Ruvi AI is the smarter play in the crypto space. Presale is live, join the Ruvi AI ecosystem now. Don’t follow the crypto hype. Be part of tomorrow’s blockchain and AI today. Invest in Ruvi AI and be one of the pioneers.

Pseudonymous analyst TechDev tells his 520,200 followers on the social media platform X that two macroeconomic factors are flashing bullish for altcoins based on historical precedent. The trader shares a chart suggesting that altcoins tend to explode whenever global liquidity surges and the business cycle bottoms out. Global liquidity refers to the amount of money sloshing in the world’s financial system, while the business cycle tracks the rise and fall of economic activity over time. Says TechDev, “Altcoins don’t run until liquidity breaks out. It’s time.” Source: TechDev/X Based on the trader’s chart, he appears to suggest that altcoins have sparked steep rallies in 2016 and 2020 following a business cycle bottom and a global liquidity breakout. Turning to Bitcoin ( BTC ), the trader predicts that the crypto king will also rally due to the bullish alignment of the two macro factors. “Are you ready?” Source: TechDev/X Zooming in on BTC, the trader predicts that Bitcoin will hit a massive price target this cycle after breaking out from a cup-and-handle pattern, which is typically viewed as a bullish continuation structure, indicating that buyers are stepping in without waiting for the asset to drop to its price lows. “After all the rigorous analysis, will be amusing if it ends up this simple…” Source: TechDev/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that BTC can surge to as high as $500,000 by 2026. At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $85,165.

Buterin proposed replacing ETHE’s current Virtual Machine (EVM) contract language in April 2025 with upgradeable RISC-V instruction set architecture versions. For context, RISC-V is an open-standard, free processor architecture known for its efficiency and flexibility. Buterin makes the case that RISC-V adoption could significantly expedite Ethereum’s execution layer. Buterin identified several bottlenecks responsible for entrenching the growth of Ethereum. He mentioned better availability sampling, a more competitive atmosphere between block producers, and ZK-proving improvements. Thanks to zero-knowledge proofs, key technologies for fast, cheap, and more private transactions. Buterin said Ethereum would have to take “radical steps” to remain competitive. “The beam chain initiative is a very promising way to simplify the consensus layer of Ethereum by a large margin,” he wrote. “But radical changes of this kind could be the only way to drive similar improvements for the execution layer.” The Ethereum community has struggled to find solutions for scaling issues for some time. This latest proposal indicates that a full reworking of the execution layer may be required for Ethereum to survive the next wave of blockchain innovation. Ethereum struggles to boost revenue amid fee collapse Ethereum is facing economic pressure , with transaction fees—the network’s largest source of revenue— falling to their lowest levels in years . Transaction fees on the Ethereum base layer averaged approximately $0.16 per transaction in April 2025. This is the lowest figure the network has seen since 2020. Blob fees — the special fees created by Ethereum’s layer-2 solutions — have collapsed. For the week ending March 30 , blob fees amounted to just 3.18 ETH, roughly $5,000 at current prices. That’s a staggering 95% decline since mid-March. Experts say the fees have declined not because of economic conditions but because users are migrating to the Ethereum base layer. Instead, they select cheaper and quicker layer-2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism. Layer-2s have made transactions cheap, but they’ve also eviscerated the core revenue of Ethereum. Many fear Ethereum’s base layer is being “cannibalized” by its scaling solutions. This means fewer users are completing normal transactions, said Brian Quinlivan, a director at Santiment. Instead, they’re using smart contracts or layer-2s that charge less. Should this continue, Ethereum may have dire financial issues. Investor sentiment is already brittle. Some analysts expect Ether (ETH) prices to collapse to near $1,100 if things go south. Ethereum community responds to RISC-V proposal Vitalik Buterin’s RISC-V concept is rocking the Ethereum Community. Some developers applaud it as a bold step that could help future-proof Ethereum. They think the move to RISC-V will make Ethereum more competitive with newer and speedier blockchains such as Solana and Sui. However, others are worried that the redesign of the execution layer would be a huge project that is fraught with risks. It would involve building portions of Ethereum from the ground up. That can take years at a minimum, require tons of resources, and present new vulnerabilities. It also raises questions about how developers and projects would port over old smart contracts to the new system. This can cause a lot of trouble when it comes to backward compatibility. The proposal has led many to conclude that Ethereum needs to evolve to stay relevant. As next-gen blockchains tempt users and developers onward with minuscule wait times and snap-popper speeds, Ethereum must move forward while innovating to retain its essential ethos. The community has drafted a proposal for public comment in response to the proposal. If accepted, it could signal the start of a new chapter for Ethereum — when the network redeems itself for a future where competition will abound.

The decentralized finance project Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates in phase 4 of its presale at $0.025 per token while it establishes itself as a major competitor against Cardano (ADA). Potential buyers rush to acquire MUTM tokens as the price is set to jump 20% to reach $0.03 in phase 5. The multisegment tokenomics design of the project delivers a 140% return when the tokens list at $0.06 and analysts expect its value to reach $3 following release. The innovative lending model offered by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has become notable after Cardano has faced challenges because of whale sell-offs. This rapid surge in demand establishes MUTM as the DeFi sector’s signature investment opportunity for alert investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) speeds up its 11-stage presale during phase 4 by already selling 412 million tokens. The existing price of $0.025 gives experienced investors a strategic starting point although buyers need to act fast because phase 5 will push the value toward $0.03. Current buyers who participate will obtain a 20% financial advantage from this impending price surge. Analysts predict Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens will reach $3 during 2025 which will produce a substantial ROI of 11,900%. Additionally the project’s tokenomics enable investors to achieve a 140% return when trading at $0.06 after presale. Recent updates show the team has launched a dashboard system which features the top 50 holders who gain bonus tokens from keeping their standings. The new initiative has generated substantial momentum which causes more investors to take part since the phase approaches completion. Cardano (ADA) market struggles ADA token is encountering market pressure because its price dropped to $0.6362 on April 17, 2025 while facing an 1.87% decrease. The token movement analysis of whales showed they sold more than 100 million units during the previous week which could reflect they either took profits or their confidence decreased. The analysts identify the $0.63 price mark as significant support that might trigger an ADA decline to $0.54 if broken. Cardano recorded a 6% weekly price increase but a monthly decline of 10% demonstrates the market sensitivity of its value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) demonstrates superior short-term investment potential through its pre-sale format as founder Charles Hoskinson fails to match the growth seen in this emerging project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) security focus The team of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) actively seeks online smart contracts verification through CertiK while placing trust as their primary focus. The project will publish audit findings throughout its official social presence to underline its dedication to transparent outcomes. The presale becomes increasingly relevant because phase 4 approaches its total capacity. The audit confirms Mutuum Finance (MUTM) places lead priority on investor fund security which differentiates the platform from market participants who operate in an environment of uncertainty. The project’s commitment to security strengthens its position for exchange trading which increases participation of investors seeking the affordable entry point. Seize the opportunity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) works to take down Cardano (ADA) through its forecast that its price will exceed $10 by 2025. Investors in phase 4 can seize the opportunity to obtain 140% returns upon launch while the price could scale to 11,900% after reaching $3 post-launch through the $0.025 entry point. As Cardano stumbles under whale pressure, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is sprinting ahead, blending real-world utility with robust tokenomics.

Investors Misled By ‘Cheaper’ Altcoins Inexperienced investors tend to confuse cheaper-priced altcoins as good bargains against Bitcoin , says Mow. “Most alts exploit unit bias by having a very high supply, so people can’t tell what they’re buying,” Mow tweeted on X. He underscored this confusion with an illustration: “XRP is *only* $2 but Bitcoin is too pricey at $85,000!” This price illusion occurs because most other cryptocurrencies have such much bigger overall supplies than Bitcoin’s hard capped 21 million coins. Most alts take advantage of unit bias by utilizing a very high supply, so people can’t figure out what they’re buying. “XRP is *only* $2 but Bitcoin is too expensive at $85,000!” Unit bias is absolutely destroying the uninitiated. #Bitcoin only. — Samson Mow (@Excellion) April 19, 2025 The psychological implication causes most fresh purchasers to wish to hold full coins of lesser cryptocurrencies rather than fractional amounts of higher-priced coins. Unit bias, Mow asserted, is devastating the inexperienced big time, implying that ignorance is damaging newbie investors who aren’t aware of the difference in market capitalization and individual coin price. Comparing Prices By Equal Supply Shows Different Results Mow constructed a thought experiment to illustrate how much more extreme cryptocurrency prices would be if they all shared Bitcoin’s limited supply. According to his estimates, if Ethereum only had 21 million coins (compared to its much greater supply), each coin would have to cost approximately $9,200 – a whopping 278,740% hike from its current price. Likewise, XRP would soar 470% to $5,800 per coin, and Solana would climb 2,325% to $3,400. Those numbers are calculated by taking the market cap of the alts and dividing by 21 million, thus framing their supply in terms of Bitcoin supply. ETH: $193B market cap / 21M = $9,200 Instead of buying that one twenty-one millionth of Etherium, you could buy just 0.11 BTC. — Samson Mow (@Excellion) April 19, 2025 “You can purchase one 21-millionth of the supply of BTC for ~$85,000,” said Mow. “What happens if you remove unit bias from alts in order to find the equivalent of 1/21 million?” His conclusion was obvious: “There is no way that these altcoins are worth that much.” Bitcoin Dominance Higher Than Projected Bitcoin’s portion of the overall cryptocurrency market has defied expectations by hitting around 60%, as indicated by TradingView data. This indicator, referred to as “Bitcoin dominance,” quantifies Bitcoin’s market capitalization in relation to all other cryptocurrencies combined. Following recent trends in the markets and his analysis of unit bias, Mow now forecasts that “Bitcoin dominance is going to go much higher” than where it is at the moment or even where the previous expectations stood. This contrasts with previous predictions which indicated capital would move out of Bitcoin to other cryptocurrencies late in 2024 and early 2025.

The decentralized exchange token HyperLiquid (HYPE) is making significant waves with a powerful price rally. Additionally, innovative AI-powered meme coin FloppyPepe (FPPE) demonstrates strong presale campaign performance, having reportedly surpassed $1.4 million in funding, while veteran giant Ripple (XRP) exhibits compelling signs of gearing up for a massive bull run. These trends highlight key opportunities worth looking into now. HyperLiquid’s HYPE Factor: Riding the Momentum Wave HyperLiquid’s HYPE token , trading strongly near $18.35, has shown impressive momentum with double-digit weekly gains and a significant rally off recent lows. This performance is backed by the DEX’s fundamental success (surpassing $1T volume) and robust tokenomics featuring revenue buybacks. Analysts note bullish technicals suggesting potential continuation towards $20 resistance, with possibilities of revisiting previous highs near $35 if conditions remain favorable. XRP Bull Run Incoming? $5 Target Gains Traction Ripple’s XRP, consolidating near $2.05, shows increasing signs of readiness for a bull run, primarily fueled by expectations of a favorable SEC settlement removing regulatory uncertainty. This optimism, coupled with Ripple’s RWA tokenization focus, supports bullish analyst predictions targeting $5.00 or higher for XRP within 2025, contingent on positive resolution and market sentiment . AI Power Unleashed: Inside FloppyPepe’s Ecosystem FloppyPepe attempts to pack substance with hot air by developing a new AI-powered ecosystem. First is FloppyX, which is an AI video generation framework aimed towards the development of captivating visual content. Secondly, Meme-o-Matic, which is an AI meme generator, allows anyone who wishes to partake in the buzz to create viral mockery content and has supposedly been made available through Telegram. This unfiltered ability given to the people sets FloppyPepe apart from most meme coins. Another solid inclusion is its “Floppynomics,” which contains scarcity through token burning, loyalty by rewarding, and social good through charitable donations. To top it all off, FloppyPepe’s one-of-a-kind commitment to security is depicted through the successful smart contract audit by SolidProof , one of the known reputable firms. With this verification, flap investors whose trust and confidence depend on the early presale become secure. FloppyPepe’s Edge: Raised $1.4M+ and Strengthened Ecosystem FloppyPepe is attracting a great deal of attention, as noted by its presale activity. The project has reportedly raised over $1.3 million in the public stage of the presale after securing a substantial private round ($907k). Based on the trajectory, the project is likely to exceed $1.4M. This indicates strong market validation and confidence in the community’s vision. This fundraising on its own proves its value and funds new development and marketing efforts. As for securing an investment, FloppyPepe must be relying on the combination of AI features providing real engagement with users, impeccable track record of growth, calculated sustainable tokenomics, and audited security. This is everything one needs in order to distinguish themselves in the AI and meme coin industries and establish a reputation, making them one of the top cryptos to buy now without relying on overpriced speculation.

When OpenAI unveiled o3 in December, executives said the model could answer “just over a fourth” of the problems in FrontierMath, a notoriously hard set of graduate‑level math puzzles. The best competitor, they added, was stuck near 2%. “Today, all offerings out there have less than 2%,” Chief Research Officer Mark Chen said during o3 and o3 mini livestream . “We’re seeing, with o3 in aggressive test‑time compute settings, we’re able to get over 25%.” TechCrunch reported that the result was obtained by OpenAI on a version of o3 that used more computing power than the model the company released last week . On Friday, the research institute Epoch AI, which created FrontierMath, published its own score for the public o3. OpenAI has released o3, their highly anticipated reasoning model, along with o4-mini, a smaller and cheaper model that succeeds o3-mini. We evaluated the new models on our suite of math and science benchmarks. Results in thread! pic.twitter.com/5gbtzkEy1B — Epoch AI (@EpochAIResearch) April 18, 2025 Using an updated 290‑question edition of the benchmark, Epoch put the model at about 10%. The result does match with a lower‑bound figure in OpenAI’s December technical paper, and Epoch cautioned that the discrepancy could be due to various reasons. “The difference between our results and OpenAI’s might be due to OpenAI evaluating with a more powerful internal scaffold, using more test‑time computing, or because those results were run on a different subset of FrontierMath,” Epoch wrote . FrontierMath is designed to measure progress toward advanced mathematical reasoning. The December 2024 public set contained 180 problems, while the February 2025 private update expanded the pool to 290. Shifts in the question list and the amount of computing power allowed at test time can cause large swings in reported percentages. OpenAI confirmed the public o3 model uses less compute than the demo version Evidence that the commercial o3 is lacking also came from tests by the ARC Prize Foundation, which tried an earlier, larger build. The public release “is a different model… tuned for chat/product use,” ARC Price Foundation posted on X, adding that “all released o3 compute tiers are smaller than the version we benchmarked.” OpenAI employee Wenda Zhou offered a similar explanation during a livestream last week. The production system, he said, was “more optimized for real‑world use cases” and speed. “We’ve done [optimizations] to make the model more cost efficient [and] more useful in general,” Zhou said, while acknowledging possible benchmark “disparities.” Two smaller models from the company, o3‑mini‑high and the newly announced o4‑mini, already beat o3 on FrontierMath, and OpenAI says a better o3‑pro variant will arrive in the coming weeks. Still, it shows how benchmark headlines can be misleading. In January, Epoch was criticized for delaying disclosure of OpenAI funding until after o3’s debut. More recently, Elon Musk’s startup xAI was accused of presenting charts that overstated the capabilities of its Grok 3 model. Industry watchers say such benchmark controversies are becoming an occurrence in the AI industry as companies race to capture headlines with new models.

In FX markets, hedge funds sold the U.S. dollar against major currencies, including euro, yen and the Aussie dollar, driving the dollar index to 98.5, the lowest since April 2022, according to data from charting platform TradingView. The DXY has declined by 10% in three months. Weakness in the dollar typically eases financial conditions, greasing risk-taking in financial markets. Meanwhile, gold's rally continued, with the per ounce price reaching a record high of $3,382, taking the year-to-date gain to 28%. Futures tied to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq traded 0.5% lower. Observers suggest that National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett's comment on Friday regarding Trump's intention to remove Powell likely triggered the selling of the dollar, along with upticks in BTC and gold. ""The move in bitcoin to $87,000 appears to be driven by a sharp drop in the U.S. dollar and a +2% rally in gold, both triggered by Trump's push to replace Fed chair Powell. While a trade deal with Japan may be announced soon, the key catalyst today is the perceived thread to Fed independence,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, told CoinDesk. Trump posted on Truth Social on Thursday that ""Powell's termination cannot come fast enough,"" while reiterating calls for lower interest rates on the following day. Early last week, Powell said that the Fed would wait for more data on the economy before changing the borrowing cost while warning of stagflation.

Announcing the deal on April 18, Blocksquare and Vera Capital said a marketplace would launch in the coming weeks to enable global investors to buy tokenized shares in “dozens of properties” located across seven US states. The first tokenized properties that will be up for grabs are part of Vera Group’s existing holdings, which include a three-storey office building in Fort Lauderdale and a retail plaza in Dania Beach, according to two properties listed on Vera Capital’s website. Source: Vera Capital “All our assets are already part of the group, so with the Vera Fund they’ve already been purchased, and they are owned by us, managed by us and we are only improving them,” Vera Group CEO Nick Polyushkin said . Vera Capital is a subsidiary of Vera Group, which also runs a South Florida real estate agency, real estate management company, and a real estate investment fund with over $100 million invested through commercial property acquisitions, land development and residential developments. Polyushkin said the $1 billion figure comes from the company’s roadmap, which includes tokenizing existing assets and raising funds for development projects. He said future properties the company plans to tokenize include two unit complexes valued at between $70 and $100 million. “This is ambitious numbers if you’re looking at this from the perspective of residential use in investments, but from a commercial standpoint, this is a very realistic number and not just achievable, it’s over-achievable,” he said.

The platform launched an EU-compliant framework in February 2025 to enable property owners to tokenize economic rights tied to real estate through notarized agreements. Blocksquare CEO Denis Petrovic said once the Vera Group partnership was in progress, Blocksquare started to research to “see if the framework we have from Luxembourg will also be applicable for the US.” “There’s always the option obviously of launching tokens directly without the Luxembourg entity getting involved, but just having it there it’s an additional convenience for a marketplace based out of the US like Vera Group,” he said.

Lack of roadmap clarity and token transparency stirs community concerns. Anticipation builds for Pi’s major appearance at Consensus 2025. Pi Network’s token saw a brief 4% price bump over the past day after releasing its long-awaited Mainnet Migration Roadmap. Meanwhile, the token has lost most of these gains at press time. While the movement has caught attention, analysts are still cautious. Roadmap Raises Hopes—and Questions The newly released roadmap outlines a three-phase plan for transitioning to the mainnet. However, the absence of concrete dates or timelines has frustrated much of the Pi community. Although the release update helped spark a short-term price reaction, many users have voiced concerns over the lack of clarity, especially as some report inconsistencies in their token balances with no clear resolution in sight. Adding to the confusion, the Pi Core Team reiterated that all tokens were minted at genesis.

Dead Bruv, the creators of the narrative-driven NFT project Meatbags, plan to mint 100,000 NFTs, with Meatbags holders being airdropped 10,000. The the rest will be sold off starting April 21, starting at $14 a pop, according to a post on the Meatbags X account. Holders will gain entry into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), called the Billionaire Bunker Club, a “fully decentralized, community-governed real-world asset onchain,” which will vote on what happens with the bunker if the effort to buy it is successful. Source: Meatbags A few ideas floated by the NFT project include a “members-only survival resort with Doomsday DJ,” a location to hold end-of-the-world festivals, or “an Airbnb with caviar tastings and canned bean room service.” UK online auctioneer SDL Property Auctions has the bunker Dead Bruv is hoping to buy listed for a guide price of 650,000 British pounds ($862,257), and an auction date scheduled for April 24. The real estate listing says the bunker is located on 1.4 acres near a former reservoir and already has the relevant permissions for the winning bidder to convert it into a house. The bunker was built in 1960 to act as a monitoring post during the Cold War and was decommissioned in 1968. It was one of 1,500 tasked with reporting any nuclear bursts and monitoring any radioactive fallout, according to SDL Property Auctions. Cointelegraph contacted SDL Property Auctions for comment. Nuclear bunker buy began as a joke Robert, the pseudonymous co-founder of Dead Bruv, said in an April 18 statement to X that the initiative was about trying to “make NFTs fun again” and was sparked by a joke that turned into a “lightbulb moment.” “There’s not much to compare this to, but these are the kinds of things that made me fall in love with NFTs in the first place. Taking risks. Getting creative. Pushing the boundaries of what this tech can do to create something completely new, absurd, and incredible,” he said. “When something comes from a place of, this is completely insane, we gotta do it, that’s when I know we’re onto something,” Robert added.

More than $53.9 billion worth of SOL is now staked on the Solana network from 505,938 unique wallet holders, who are making an 8.31% annualized return, blockchain data shows. The figure briefly overtook the staked ETH market cap on April 20, which now has $53.93 billion worth of value secured from 34.7 million staked tokens, Beaconcha.in data shows. Source: Alex Svanevik A contributing factor behind the flippening has been SOL’s strong price performance relative to ETH over the last two years, which has seen the SOL/ETH price ratio rise nearly tenfold from 0.0088 to 0.0866 since June 12, 2023, CoinGecko data shows. High SOL staking return is stifling Solana DeFi, pundits say However, the “risk-free” 8.31% return for SOL stakers at the network level — significantly higher than ETH’s 2.98% — may be attracting Solana users away from DeFi activities, such as providing liquidity to automated market makers and lending protocols in exchange for token rewards. “Solana having 65% of its marketcap staked means there's no other use of it's token, it’s actually bearish,” Builda Protocol developer and X user “JC” said. DefiLlama data shows that there are $21.5 billion worth of liquid staked ETH tokens on Ethereum compared to just $7.22 billion of liquid staked SOL on Solana. Multicoin Capital managing partner Tushar Jain previously said that Solana DeFi has been stifled because it’s not rational to make an investment in something that produces a lower return than the “risk-free” investment. “It doesn’t make sense for you to provide liquidity on a SOL/USDC AMM when that might earn you 5% but staking earns you 7%.” Ethereum also dominates in terms of DeFi total value locked at $50.4 million compared to Solana’s $8.85 billion. Industry pundits also pointed out that there are still far more validators securing the Ethereum network at 1.06 million compared to Solana’s 1,243. Solana staking isn’t really staking, Ethereum researcher argues One Ethereum researcher said Solana staking isn’t really securing the Solana network because there isn’t a mechanism to penalize bad actors for malicious behavior. “It's very ironic to call it ‘staking’ when there is no slashing. What's at stake?” Dankrad Feist said in an April 20 X post. “Solana has close to zero economic security at the moment.” Solana Labs said slashing is already possible, but it’s not automatic, and the attacker’s assets can only be slashed by restarting the entire network. Related: Ethereum price in ‘cursed’ downtrend which could continue well into 2025 — Analyst Solana is looking to roll out a more comprehensive slashing solution later this year, according to Multicoin Capital Managing Partner Kyle Samani. Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko said he’s pushing for a “correlated slashing” mechanism, where the penalty would be equal to the square of the difference between a validator’s faulty stake in an epoch and the median network staked validator. Source: Anatoly Yakovenko Meanwhile, Ethereum developers and researchers have been exploring ways to decentralize Ethereum staking. Many Ethereum stakers have resorted to liquid staking protocols over the last few years due to the high 32 ETH ($50,750) minimum needed to run an independent validator. However, this shift has led to the Lido protocol capturing an 88% share in Ethereum’s liquid staking market, adding another layer to Ethereum’s staking centralization concerns.

According to an Apr. 21 post shared on X, the token distribution will be based on two snapshots of user activity. The first snapshot covers contributions from Jan. 1, 2020, to Mar. 3, 2025, while the second includes activity up to Apr. 20, 2025. These snapshots will help determine eligibility for a retroactive airdrop, part of a wider strategy to reward long-time creators, collectors, developers, and participants in the Zora ecosystem. $ZORA will be live on April 23, 2025. pic.twitter.com/yZdjlnDohH — zora (@zora) April 20, 2025 Zora previously revealed details for its native token in March, describing ZORA as “a memecoin for the Zora community.” The token will launch on Base, Coinbase’s layer-2 network, instead of Zora’s own L2. This decision appears to be a move toward better accessibility and onboarding for new users, as Base has become a growing hub for onchain social apps and memecoins alike. You might also like: Base faces backlash after meme token launched via Zora crashes 95% before recovering The total supply of ZORA will be 10 billion tokens. Of that, 10% has been reserved for the retroactive airdrop. An additional 20% is set aside for future community incentives like grants and hackathons. 5% will go toward providing liquidity. The Zora treasury will receive 20%, which will unlock gradually over four years after a six-month delay. Team members will receive 18.9%, which will vest monthly over three years with a similar delay. Finally, 26.1% will be distributed to strategic contributors, including early investors and advisors. The ZORA token is intended for community use and will not carry any governance rights or equity claims. Still, its launch represents a major milestone in Zora’s journey from an experimental NFT platform into a fully-fledged onchain social network. Over the past few years, Zora has introduced tools like Open Editions and auction houses, hosted record-breaking NFT sales, and enabled millions of dollars in creator earnings. Most recently, it has focused on its “Coins” feature, turning every post into a tradeable token on Base. Since its inception, Zora has attracted over 2.4 million collectors and more than 618,000 creators, driving upwards of $376 million in secondary volume, as per its March token launch announcement . The ZORA token now becomes another way for the platform to deepen its engagement with users and experiment with new forms of value distribution.

The platform determined that certain accounts may have attempted to manipulate the market, leading to sudden and extreme price movements in VOXEL futures contracts. In response, Bitget suspended trading, deposits and withdrawals for the flagged accounts. It added that all other users remain unaffected and user funds are secure. “Upon investigation, certain accounts were found to have potentially engaged in market manipulation, triggering our risk control system,” Bitget said in a statement issued on April 20. Low-Profile Gaming Token’s Surge Raises Questions Over Market Stability Bitget’s team is currently working to unwind trades linked to the anomaly. It will also compensate users affected by the incident. The company has not disclosed the total value of impacted trades or provided a timeline for full resolution. VOXEL is not widely traded but has recently drawn attention due to its connection with Voxie Tactics. The game is a blockchain-based tactical RPG that lets players earn crypto rewards. Despite this, the sudden surge in futures activity appears disproportionate to the token’s usual market presence. The incident shows the risks of trading lightly regulated or low-liquidity digital assets on leveraged products such as perpetual futures. It also points to the pressure on centralized exchanges to maintain fair trading environments while safeguarding user interests.

In a post shared on the Ethereum Magicians forum on Apr. 20, Buterin argued that the switch could drastically improve the performance and simplicity of Ethereum’s ( ETH ) execution layer. The EVM is responsible for executing smart contract code across the Ethereum network. According to Buterin, its limitations have become a long-term bottleneck for scaling. He believes replacing it with RISC-V, a hardware-standard architecture already used in zero-knowledge EVMs, could provide massive improvements in proving efficiency, particularly for zero-knowledge-based scaling. ZK-EVMs currently translate Ethereum operations into RISC-V before producing proofs. Buterin recommends developers write contracts that compile directly to RISC-V, bypassing this intermediary step. Popular Ethereum programming languages like Solidity and Vyper, he said, would still be functional but would focus on RISC-V rather than the EVM. You might also like: Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposes a simplified layer-1 privacy roadmap Ethereum wouldn’t change its inter-contract communication, smart contract abstractions, or current account structure. The change would primarily affect the computation process at the back-end. Backward compatibility would be maintained, allowing legacy EVM contracts to continue operating and interacting with new RISC-V contracts. According to Buterin, this modification might increase prover efficiency by over 50 times, or more in some cases, helping Ethereum maintain its competitive advantage over faster monolithic blockchains like Solana ( SOL ) and Sui ( SUI ). This proposal coincides with multi-year lows in Ethereum’s network usage. According to Santiment data , the average transaction fee dropped to $0.16 in April, the lowest since 2020. The drop is tied to declining L1 activity as users move to layer-2 networks for lower-cost execution. Previous improvements have largely focused on reducing L2 storage costs, but they have also significantly decreased L1 revenue. Although Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade is set for May 7, Buterin’s call for a fundamental change suggests that minor changes might not be enough. To improve long-term scalability and stay up with high-performance chains, Ethereum may need to rethink the core features of its smart contract system.

ETH is now rising and might attempt to recover above the $1,650 resistance. Ethereum started a fresh increase above the $1,580 and $1,600 levels. The price is trading above $1,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $1,590 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $1,650 resistance zone. Ethereum Price Eyes Upside Break Ethereum price remained stable above the $1,500 level and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin . ETH traded above the $1,550 and $1,600 levels to enter a short-term positive zone. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $1,590 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair even cleared the $1,620 resistance. A high was formed at $1,644 and the price is stable above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,566 swing low to the $1,644 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $1,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $1,640 level. The next key resistance is near the $1,650 level. The first major resistance is near the $1,680 level. A clear move above the $1,680 resistance might send the price toward the $1,720 resistance. An upside break above the $1,720 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $1,800 resistance zone or even $1,840 in the near term. Downside Correction In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,650 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,620 level. The first major support sits near the $1,605 zone and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,566 swing low to the $1,644 high. A clear move below the $1,605 support might push the price toward the $1,580 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,550 support level in the near term.

Still, institutional interest remains strong, which suggests a gap between adoption and valuation. In contrast, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) appears as a new disruptive token that scored exceptionally well during presale and is benefiting from the 27.13% CAGR expansion of the GameFi market . XRP Price Prediction Coming as a remarkable shift, HashKey Capital has launched the first XRP Tracker Fund in Asia , providing a regulated avenue for XRP’s exposure for professional investors without requiring direct custody of the crypto. Ripple, the company behind XRP, has become an early backer of the fund, which suggests secretly supporting the defined structure and goals of the fund. The fund allows institutional investors to redeem or subscribe on a monthly basis, offering conventional terms. Analysts see this as enabling healthier bridges between traditional finance and crypto, potentially leading to wider institutional access to XRP. On the regulatory side, new changes have been viewed as positive for the XRP ecosystem. The two parties have settled into a 60-day pause in litigation. Market watchers consider the hope for potential settlement talks. Several applications for an XRP ETF are still awaiting regulatory feedback, as prediction markets suggest there is an 82% chance of at least one approval by year-end , a development that could significantly boost market liquidity. From a technical angle, XRP price is now moving within a narrow range of $2.05 and $2.12 . Also, the 50-day EMA currently sitting at $2.07 acts as support. While the momentum indicators remain neutral, decisive technical levels are leaning toward directional shifts, with resistance at $2.12 and $2.23 and support also at $2.05 and $1.93. Despite the action being relatively dormant, XRP price is likely positioning itself for future acceleration in response to evolving market conditions due to a combination of strong institutional adoption, anticipated clarity on regulations, and a period of technical consolidation. All About YETIO: The GameFi Emblem Of The Year Yeti Ouro (YETIO) is a cryptocurrency project on the Ethereum chain that combines elements of a meme coin with a Play-to-Earn gaming utility. It is gearing up for Stage 4, having raised over $3.36 million in presale thus far. In Stage 3, tokens are priced at $0.024, 100% higher than the token price in Stage 1. This has given early bird investors a 100% ROI. With over 218 million tokens sold, they are waiting for Stage 4, when the token price will increase to $0.041. The current stage ends in less than 2 days. The smart contracts of the project are SOLIDProof-checked , which instils the trust of the chain. The project is offering a limited time Easter bonus of 30% on all token purchases until the end of the day today one day ahead of Stage 3 end. Yeti Go is the name of the project’s core component—an action-packed racing game built using Unreal Engine 5 where players compete in elimination-type competitions for fun and YETIO tokens. Players can earn tokens by beating races, completing challenges, and ranking on leaderboards. YETIO tokens can also be used in an in-game marketplace to purchase certain skins, power-ups, and/or customized vehicles. Yeti Go isn’t just a game—it’s a full-throttle experience that blends cinematic visuals with pulse-pounding audio to pull you into the action. Developed in collaboration with the award-winning team behind titles like Call of Duty, Spider-Man, The Witcher, and Dead Space, it’s crafted for players who crave intensity and immersion. The sound design, created by professionals who’ve worked with Grammy-nominated artists such as Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid, adds emotion and energy to every moment. Scroll down to meet the game’s lead character and step into a world where precision meets power at every turn. With the capped supply of 1 billion, YETIO’s tokenomics dive 50% for presale, 15% for P2E, and community rewards, respectively, leaving the rest for team, marketing, and dilution. There is a built-in deflationary mechanism of burning 5% YETIO for every transaction, which improves sustainability. The goal of the project is to create an ecosystem that is beneficial for gamers and investors while maximizing the potential value appreciation of the token. Timed Gains vs. Macro Disputes: Which Is The Better Bet? YETIO allows traders to gain the most with its early-stage growth dynamics compared to XRP’s mature consolidation phase. While XRP is trading at 44% below its ATH, with institutional interest slowly trickling in via structured funds, YETIO offers immediate upside with 100% ROI from Stage 1 to 3. The upcoming Stage 4 price surge to $0.041 provides a visible catalyst that is missing in XRP’s price-bound movements.

Expert Discusses Possible Outcomes",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/whats-next-for-bitcoin-after-crossing-87000-expert-discusses-possible-outcomes/,"This Sunday, the market’s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), has once again crossed the $87,000 mark, following what analysts describe as a healthy correction that brought prices down to $74,000 earlier this month. In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), crypto analyst Doctor Profit provided a comprehensive analysis of the current price action, outlining what investors can expect moving forward. Expert Outlines Critical Price Levels For BTC Doctor Profit opened his analysis by revisiting the two potential outcomes he had outlined a month prior. The first scenario involved a healthy correction to the $70,000 to $74,000 range, which played out exactly as anticipated. The second scenario was a more severe downturn, a “Black Swan” event, that could see Bitcoin dropping to the $50,000 to $60,000 range. Importantly, he identified a critical threshold—the “Golden Line”—currently situated at $77,000. Related Reading: Solana Price Surges Toward $140 — Here’s The Resistance Level To Watch This level has proven resilient since the bull run began in early 2023, and as long as Bitcoin remains above it, Doctor Profit believes the potential for a crash scenario is off the table. The analyst noted that Bitcoin is currently facing challenges in breaking through the “Hammer Line,” a critical resistance level. Historically, whenever Bitcoin has approached this line, it has faced immediate rejection. However, with strong support at the Golden Line, Doctor Profit is prepared for two potential scenarios. Bitcoin Potential Breakout Scenarios If Bitcoin can break above the Hammer Line, he plans to close his short position from $90,000 and maintain his spot position acquired at $77,000. Conversely, if Bitcoin dips back to the $77,000 level, he intends to purchase more, having already set limit orders to capitalize on this price point. Looking ahead, Doctor Profit predicted that Bitcoin would likely continue to trade sideways within the range of the Hammer Line and Golden Line, specifically between $77,000 and $85,200. However, with Sunday’s spike, the Golden Line has been broken for the moment, pending a consolidation above it. However, several bullish triggers remain on the horizon, including potential agreements between the US and China, possible Federal Reserve rate cuts, and an increase in M2 liquidity. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Sees $120 Million Weekly Surge—Whales Tighten Their Grip In the mid to long term, Doctor Profit believes Bitcoin is more likely to break out above the Hammer Line than to fall below the Golden Line. He cautioned against trading within the dangerous zone between these two critical levels, labeling it a “forbidden zone.” A breakout above the Hammer Line would signal the end of the correction and a renewed ascent toward new all-time highs, while a breakdown below the Golden Line could indicate a significant shift in market sentiment and the onset of a deeper correction. While trading just above $87,200, BTC registers a nearly 4% surge in the weekly time frame.

Pi Coin, however, slipped just over 2% to around $0.63, continuing to trade sideways as it waits for a potentially market-moving event. On April 21, 5.6 million Pi tokens are set to unlock — a development that could impact the coin’s price depending on how the market reacts. For now, the $0.60 level is acting as strong support, and some analysts see this as a key zone that could fuel a future breakout. Despite the recent dip, excitement around Pi remains. Some analysts argue that the path to $5 is still in play, especially if the project continues to deliver on its roadmap and expands its use cases. “Utilities will drive value,” one community member posted, echoing a common belief among Pi holders. $Pi to $5 journey just began. $PI has a very strong support at $0.6. $5 is a very possible valuation.

The Tokyo-listed firm confirmed the purchase in a disclosure on Monday, citing an average price of around $85,561 per coin. This move pushes Metaplanet’s total holdings to 4,855 Bitcoin, up from 4,525 just a week earlier. Since the start of the year, the company has more than doubled its Bitcoin position, making it one of the most aggressive corporate accumulators of the asset in Asia. The company said the purchase aligns with its broader Bitcoin Treasury Operations, a business unit it officially launched in Dec. 2024. The strategy mirrors that of MicroStrategy in the US, aiming to convert fiat reserves into digital assets the company views as a long-term store of value. *Metaplanet Purchases Additional 330 $BTC * pic.twitter.com/Gkjp7wUi4S — Metaplanet Inc.

A longtime crypto advocate, Trump has recently warned Wall Street to adapt to digital assets or risk becoming irrelevant. Metaplanet did not say whether the latest Bitcoin purchase was funded directly from the recent bond issuance. Earlier filings, however, show the company has raised significant capital this year. It has done so through multiple financing rounds. A large portion of those funds has been used to accelerate Bitcoin acquisitions. Metaplanet Reports 95.6% BTC Yield in Q1, Eyes Long-Term Growth Metaplanet uses a custom metric called BTC Yield to assess the performance of its strategy. This measures the growth of Bitcoin per fully diluted share. The firm reported a 95.6% BTC Yield for the first quarter of 2025. So far in April, the yield stands at 12.1%. The company’s average purchase price across its Bitcoin holdings is about $89,941 per coin. Its total investment amounts to around $436.6m. Despite Bitcoin’s volatility, Metaplanet says it is focused on long-term accretive growth for shareholders rather than short-term gains.

While digital identity is a familiar topic in crypto circles, Holonym is going several steps further—embedding personhood into wallets, credentials, and what it calls “human keys.” What Is Holonym? Explained simply, Holonym builds digital infrastructure that lets people prove who they are online—safely, privately, and without relying on centralized institutions. The company has issued over 35.4 million credentials for more than 2.2 million users, helping both Web3 projects and broader humanitarian efforts distinguish humans from bots. One of the major use cases has been airdrops—Holonym has supported over $380 million in token distributions across more than 150 projects. But that’s just the start. From Airdrops to Aid Drops Beyond speculative token distributions, Holonym sees its identity tools as a way to get direct aid into the hands of real people. In many regions where aid is needed most, traditional identity systems or financial literacy aren’t reliable. That’s where Holonym’s “human keys” come in. They function like private cryptographic keys but are derived from human attributes rather than random sequences. For example, instead of needing to memorize a complex seed phrase, a person could generate a wallet from a biometric scan. This makes it possible for someone with no email access or formal ID to interact with digital finance systems. As a result, wallets become more accessible, identities become provable, and crypto becomes human-friendly—all critical for bringing billions into the digital economy who have been historically excluded. The Gitcoin Passport Acquisition Holonym also recently acquired Gitpoint Passport, a widely used identity solution for grants and matching funds that utilize quadratic funding. Gitpoint had already facilitated $60–80 million in grants. The core idea of quadratic funding is to support the most popular community-chosen projects, rather than those with the richest backers. However, the system had a flaw: bots could exploit it. Holonym’s identity layer now ensures each vote is tied to a real person—without compromising privacy. As part of the acquisition, Gitpoint Passport is being rebranded as The Human Passport, and will now include zero-knowledge proofs (ZK) by default. This means personhood verification can happen privately and securely. More importantly, Holonym plans to extend The Human Passport beyond Web3, using it for capital allocation in the real world—whether it’s aid, grants, or social impact projects. Thoughts on the Market Despite uncertain market conditions, Holonym remains focused on building. “The crypto cat is out of the box,” Shady El Damaty noted, describing today’s cycle as a normal swing of a volatile but maturing space. With regulatory clarity improving and infrastructure maturing, Holonym believes the next step for crypto is to prove itself through real-world utility—especially in capital allocation and digital rights. Their endgame? Elevating financial freedom by making it accessible to all—not just those who understand DeFi, but anyone with a smartphone and a fingerprint.

Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump published a “non-tariff cheating” list, stating that those who criticize tariffs are “bad at business.” The notable drop in consumer sentiment and a surge in household inflation expectations are indicative of the turbulent economic weather that lies ahead if the situation continues. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also contributed to the dampening investor sentiment, criticizing Trump’s tariffs, while the POTUS hit back, threatening to fire the central banker. This week’s economic data and consumer sentiment reports could further influence central bank monetary policy if there are big swings. “All signs point to more volatility this week,” said the Kobeissi Letter. Economic Events April 21 to 25 The first major reports of the week are on Wednesday, when the Global Services and Manufacturing PMI data is released. This data provides leading economic indicators used by economists and analysts to gain insights into changing economic conditions. March’s Durable Goods Orders report is due on Thursday, measuring the cost of orders received by manufacturers for durable goods, such as vehicles and electrical appliances. Big ticket items such as these are more susceptible to economic changes and are tied to consumer sentiment.

The Fed has been “too loose” with monetary policy, which is contributing to inflation risk, he opined before adding, “If we get inflation, the Fed will be behind the curve,” implying further rate hikes. Additionally, around 20% of S&P 500 companies, including Tesla and Alphabet (Google), will report earnings this week in what could be a tough quarter for big tech. Crypto Market Outlook Crypto markets have started the week in the green with Bitcoin leading the pack as usual. Total capitalization is around $2.84 trillion as BTC reclaimed $87,000 for the first time since late March. Analysts have said that Bitcoin has broken out of a falling wedge pattern, which could see the reversal of a three-month downtrend. Ethereum , XRP, and Binance Coin registered minor gains, but Bitcoin was leading the markets this Monday in Asia.

On one side, co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed a fundamental redesign of Ethereum’s execution layer, suggesting a shift to the RISC-V instruction set architecture to address performance and scalability issues. On the other hand, seasoned trader Peter Brandt has cast doubt on Ethereum’s near-term prospects, pointing to bearish technical signals and forecasting a possible price drop to $800. As the community weighs ambitious technical reforms against declining market sentiment, Ethereum's future appears more contested than ever. Vitalik Buterin Proposes Radical Shift to RISC-V for Ethereum, Aiming to Revive Network Efficiency and Investor Confidence Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has ignited fresh debate in the blockchain development community with a bold proposal to overhaul the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the foundational execution engine for Ethereum smart contracts. In an April 20 post, Buterin suggested replacing the EVM’s current bytecode system with RISC-V, a streamlined open-source instruction set architecture (ISA), in a move he claims could boost Ethereum’s execution-layer efficiency by up to 100-fold. The proposal, which follows months of scrutiny over Ethereum’s declining fee revenue and user base, targets a number of long-standing bottlenecks in the network’s scalability and competitiveness. Among these are stable data availability sampling, block production competitiveness, and efficient zero-knowledge proof generation — all crucial to Ethereum’s long-term survival in a rapidly evolving blockchain landscape. “The beam chain effort holds great promise for greatly simplifying the consensus layer of Ethereum,” Buterin wrote. “But for the execution layer to see similar gains, this kind of radical change may be the only viable path.” RISC-V: A Path to Execution-Layer Reinvention The RISC-V instruction set has gained popularity in recent years due to its flexibility, performance benefits, and open-source licensing. Originally developed for educational and industrial use in hardware architecture, its application in blockchain smart contract environments is unprecedented — and potentially revolutionary. Buterin’s argument centers on the idea that Ethereum’s aging EVM is a significant constraint on performance, particularly in the context of emerging blockchain systems like Solana and Sui that use more efficient virtual machine designs. Ethereum’s modular approach — splitting responsibilities between the base layer and layer-2 rollups — has allowed scalability through sidechains and rollups, but has left the core execution engine comparatively stagnant. Switching to RISC-V, Buterin claims, would enable Ethereum to natively support more complex and faster zero-knowledge (ZK) operations, crucial for secure, scalable, and private computation. Buterin’s proposal comes as Ethereum continues to face mounting pressure from faster, monolithic chains. Solana and Sui have both made headlines in recent months for their high transaction throughput and low-cost user experience, backed by aggressive developer incentives and increasing dApp activity. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s base layer has experienced a troubling drop in revenue. Blob fees — transaction fees associated with data from Ethereum’s rollup-centric design — fell to a weekly low of just 3.18 ETH in late March 2025, worth approximately $5,000 at the time. According to data from Etherscan and Token Terminal, the average network fee per transaction also plunged to just $0.16 in April, a level not seen since 2020. Brian Quinlivan, Director of Marketing at Santiment, attributed the falloff to declining user activity on the base layer, as more users and developers gravitate toward layer-2 solutions. Ethereum network weekly transaction fees declined significantly in Q1 2025 (Source: Token Terminal ) A Double-Edged Sword: Layer-2 Cannibalization While layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base have greatly improved scalability and cost for end users, they’ve also been accused of cannibalizing the Ethereum mainnet’s usage and revenue. These solutions collect fees off-chain or on separate execution environments, leading to a dramatic shift in where value is captured within the Ethereum ecosystem. The resulting financial pressure has contributed to Ether’s recent price woes. As of mid-April 2025, ETH is trading at around $1,637 — a far cry from its 2021 and 2022 highs. Some analysts warn the price could dip further to as low as $1,100 if investor sentiment continues to deteriorate in the face of weak fundamentals and aggressive competition. Buterin’s vision of a RISC-V-powered execution layer appears to be a direct response to this existential threat. By rejuvenating Ethereum’s technical core, the network may be able to reclaim its leadership status not only as a smart contract pioneer but as a sustainable and high-performance blockchain infrastructure. Buterin's latest move is not without controversy. Critics argue that such a sweeping change could fracture developer tooling and create additional friction in onboarding new developers. Others question whether RISC-V, traditionally associated with hardware, is the right fit for smart contract execution. Still, supporters say Ethereum needs bold action to survive what some are calling the ”great blockchain divergence” — a period where high-performance chains peel away market share from older, slower networks. If implemented, this proposal could mark one of the most transformative moments in Ethereum’s history since its launch. Whether Ethereum’s developer community and ecosystem stakeholders embrace this radical redesign remains to be seen — but one thing is clear: the future of Ethereum may very well depend on its willingness to evolve from within. Peter Brandt Predicts Ethereum Crash to $800 as ETH Battles Bearish Technicals and Sentiment Divide Veteran trader Peter L. Brandt, a commodities expert with nearly five decades of market experience, has rattled the Ethereum community with a grim technical forecast. In a recent tweet that included a stark descending triangle chart pattern, Brandt predicted that Ethereum (ETH) could collapse to as low as $800 — revisiting its 2022 bear market bottom. Brandt’s latest post comes amid a period of heightened uncertainty for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. ETH has already endured a 46% decline over the past year and fell 4% on Wednesday following the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates steady. Though it has recovered slightly, Brandt’s chart positions ETH dangerously close to a prolonged breakdown. The descending triangle pattern, which Brandt emphasized in his chart, is a classic bearish technical formation that usually suggests a continuation of a downtrend. The market veteran is known for his unforgiving takes on digital assets, and earlier this week, he went so far as to call Ethereum “worthless junk” — a statement that sparked fierce debate among crypto traders and Ethereum supporters. A Divided Market: Ethereum Bears vs Bulls While Brandt's prediction reflects a broader sentiment of disillusionment around Ethereum’s recent performance, not everyone is on the same page. In a twist of sentiment polarization, celebrity endorsements and crypto moguls have voiced optimism for ETH. NBA legend and crypto enthusiast Scottie Pippen publicly predicted the dawn of a major altcoin season, rooted in historical Bitcoin cycle patterns. According to Pippen, altcoin rallies tend to ignite roughly 340 days after each Bitcoin halving event. The most recent halving occurred on April 20 of last year — a timing coincidence that has fueled speculation in crypto circles. Scottie Pippen stated that he was bullish on ETH long-term since he is building a project on this network. It is focused on AI, gaming and tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). Echoing Pippen’s sentiment, Tron founder Justin Sun has reaffirmed his support for Ethereum. Despite the lackluster price action and a growing chorus of critics, Sun announced that Tron has no intention of selling its ETH holdings. Instead, he emphasized future collaboration with Ethereum developers, signaling a desire for a more cooperative and integrated crypto ecosystem. Ethereum's struggle is not just technical — it's systemic. The broader macroeconomic environment, tepid institutional demand for ETH-based ETFs, and Ethereum’s own scaling challenges have conspired to drive down sentiment. When Brandt posted his chart, Ethereum was trading at $1,587 — near the lower boundary of its recent trading range. The 4% dip after the Fed announcement reflects investors’ increasing sensitivity to macroeconomic signals, particularly interest rates that affect the appeal of risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, ETH-based spot ETFs, approved alongside Bitcoin ETFs last year, have not garnered the same capital inflows. Data shows that Bitcoin ETFs have consistently outperformed their Ethereum counterparts in terms of net inflows and investor demand. This divergence has placed added pressure on ETH, especially as questions linger about its monetization model, base-layer revenue decline due to Layer-2 migration, and relatively slower development pace compared to rising Layer-1 competitors like Solana and Sui. The $800 Scenario: A Realistic Risk or an Outlier? Brandt's $800 forecast would mark a staggering drop of nearly 50% from current levels — a move that would likely shake investor confidence and create ripple effects across decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and Web3 projects built on the Ethereum network. Yet even some Ethereum skeptics question the likelihood of such a deep retracement. The network remains the most widely used smart contract platform, with significant developer activity, institutional interest, and long-term infrastructure playbooks backing its future. Still, history has shown that when Brandt speaks, markets tend to listen — if not react.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-21 05:00:00

But What About OKX? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Just two months after the highly anticipated mainnet launch of Pi Network on February 20, the project is facing renewed scrutiny as users report withdrawal suspensions on major exchanges, mostly MEXC. This development has cast a shadow over what was expected to be a breakthrough moment for the Pi ecosystem. https://twitter.com/Dr_Picoin/status/1913575336530391377 Users across various forums and social media platforms claim they are unable to withdraw their Pi tokens from MEXC, raising concerns about liquidity and accessibility. Meanwhile, Pi holders are now turning their attention to other exchanges like OKX and Bitget, eager to know if withdrawals remain functional there. So far, no formal issues have been reported from those platforms, but the community remains on alert. Technical Outlook: Will Pi Reclaim $1? According to recent analysis, Pi recently failed a breakout attempt from a symmetrical triangle, causing a short-term drop. Analysts believe that if Pi can recover and reclaim $0.85, a rally toward $0.89–$0.91 is still possible. However, a break below $0.83 could trigger a further fall toward the critical support at $0.80. At the time of writing, Pi is trading at $0.63. Market uncertainty and cautious trading behavior continue to dominate Pi’s chart movements, with many waiting to see if the coin can regain momentum or slip further into decline. Looking Ahead: Utility vs. Market Pressure Pi Network’s core strength lies in its growing ecosystem. The Telegram wallet, upcoming decentralized applications (dApps), and ongoing community engagement all point to a project with long-term vision. But questions remain about exchange compliance, liquidity, and the coin’s ability to gain real-world traction. Moreover, the inability to withdraw Pi tokens from certain exchanges raises concerns about whether the broader market—and regulators—view Pi as a fully operational asset or still a work in progress. Despite the roadblocks, the Pi community remains optimistic.

SOL price is now consolidating and might climb further above the $142 resistance zone. SOL price started a fresh increase above the $125 and $132 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $130 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $137 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $142 resistance zone. Solana Price Gains Over 5% Solana price formed a base above the $120 support and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL gained pace for a move above the $125 and $132 resistance levels. The pair even spiked toward the $145 resistance zone. A high was formed at $143.06 and the price is now retreating lower. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $135 swing low to the $143 high. Solana is now trading above $130 and the 100-hourly simple moving average.

The next major resistance is near the $145 level. The main resistance could be $150. A successful close above the $150 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $155. Any more gains might send the price toward the $165 level. Pullback in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $142 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $138.50 zone. The first major support is near the $137 level and the trend line. A break below the $137 level might send the price toward the $132 zone.

His comments on Solana come amid ongoing debate within the ETH ecosystem over whether to continue prioritizing a rollup-centric Layer 2 (L2) strategy or reconsider more direct Layer 1 scaling improvements. Related News: There's A Lot To Watch In Altcoins In The New Week - Here Are 6 Important Developments Expected ETH has long focused on horizontal scaling via rollup-L2 solutions that process off-chain transactions and settle them on the mainnet. Adams defended this approach, stressing that Ethereum’s five-year commitment to rollup-centric scaling should not be undermined by changing views. “Ethereum has been working towards a layer 2-centric or horizontal scaling roadmap for over 5 years,” Adams said. “I am all for scaling improvements to layer 1; the rollup-centric roadmap actually requires it.” However, he criticized the inconsistency in the way some in the Ethereum community have handled Layer 2s, saying it was a contradiction to claim to support rollups while still largely relying on L1 for core functionality. *This is not investment advice.

While the broader crypto space grapples with volatility and shifting narratives, certain tokens have emerged as major opportunities to cash in on. For investors looking for the next big opportunity, coins like PI, Solana, and PepeX have surfaced as names to watch. Here is why you should be on the lookout for these three coins in 2025. Can Solana surge to $2000? Pseudonymous crypto analyst CryptoCurb is forecasting a staggering upside for Solana, suggesting the token could hit $2,000 if current adoption and network growth trends persist. In an X post, the analyst argued that Solana’s network metrics and scalability position it well to rival Ethereum’s performance in the previous cycle. curb @CryptoCurb · Follow “How does Solana get to $2k”$2k $SOL = $1T market capETH ran to $0.6T market cap last cycle. ETH was also UNUSABLE (>$500 transaction fees) at >$100B mc. $2k is absolutely realistic IF solana keeps its global adoption pace with minimal disruptions/continues to scale. 9:17 pm · 20 Apr 2025 179 Reply Copy link Read 27 replies At its peak, Ethereum reached a $600 billion market capitalization despite persistent congestion and high transaction fees. CryptoCurb contends that if Solana maintains its trajectory without major disruptions, a $2,000 price target — translating to a $1 trillion market cap — is attainable, effectively displacing Ethereum as the top altcoin. “2K is absolutely realistic if Solana keeps its global adoption pace with minimal disruptions and continues to scale,” the analyst wrote. In the near term, CryptoCurb expects rising network inflows to lift Solana to $150 before a possible surge toward the $2,000 mark. Solana is currently priced at $140, with a market capitalization of $72.6 billion, meaning the path to CryptoCurb’s projection remains long and ambitious. PI rally on the horizon? Multiple crypto analysts are lining up bullish forecasts for Pi Network, projecting a potential run toward $5. According to PiMigrate, the altcoin’s recent price action and utility potential put it on track for a fresh highs. Pi Network News @PiMigrate · Follow 🎉 $Pi to $5 journey just began. $PI has a very strong support at $0.6.$5 is a very possible valuation. Good utilities will push it up. #PiNetwork 6:10 pm · 20 Apr 2025 530 Reply Copy link Read 46 replies In an X post, the analyst argued that Pi’s strong support at $0.60, coupled with growing use cases, makes a $5 surge “very possible.” Further fueling optimism, crypto strategist Xia noted a rapid increase in trading momentum after Pi broke above $0.63 with rising volume. She highlighted improving RSI and MACD readings as confirmation of a strengthening uptrend. Backing this technical and sentiment shift is a substantial exodus of tokens from exchanges. Over 41 million Pi Coins — valued at roughly $27 million — were moved off trading platforms within 48 hours, with more than 13 million transferred from OKX to private wallets. This decline in exchange supply typically signals reduced selling pressure and heightened investor conviction, supporting the bullish case for Pi Network in the near term. Why PepeX is the coin to watch? PepeX is emerging as a contender in the meme coin launchpad sector, offering a more controlled and security-focused alternative to current platforms. With platforms like Pump.fun under scrutiny for enabling low-effort, vulnerable tokens, PepeX introduces infrastructure aimed at raising project standards and oversight. Central to its offering is the Moonshot Engine, an AI-driven tool that streamlines token creation while addressing inefficiencies in typical meme coin launches. The platform enforces a 5% token holding cap for project creators and a mandatory $500 launch fee to discourage opportunistic launches and bolster credibility. Through these measures, PepeX aims to improve fairness, accountability, and investor protection in a segment historically lacking those safeguards. Its presale has already raised over $1.4 million, reflecting steady demand. Its focus on stronger project standards, clearer transparency, and investor safeguards positions PepeX as a potential long-term player in a market growing weary of low-quality, high-risk launches.

Meanwhile, the persistent uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariff policies, marked by both threats of increased tariffs and promises of trade agreements, will continue to fuel volatility across all asset classes. With no major domestic economic data or earnings releases scheduled for Monday, attention remained focused on trade developments. Gold surged more than 1% to above $3,370 per ounce on Monday, setting a new record high, buoyed by a weaker U.S. dollar and safe-haven buying. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) jumped more than 2% to above $87,000 on Monday, breaking out of a week-long consolidation to reach its highest levels since late March. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 1.19% to around 34,500, while the broader Topix Index declined 0.5% to 2,545 on Monday, ending a two-day winning streak as investors turned cautious ahead of updates on US-Japan trade talks. The Japanese yen strengthened past 141 per dollar on Monday, marking a seven-month high as the dollar weakened amid rising concerns over the Federal Reserve’s independence. On the trade front, Japan is reportedly considering boosting imports of soybeans and rice as a concession in ongoing tariff negotiations with the US. Looking ahead, market attention is turning to next week’s Bank of Japan policy meeting, where the central bank is expected to keep the policy rate steady at 0.5%. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.34% to above 3,290 while the Shenzhen Component gained 0.5% to 9,830 on Monday, recouping losses from the previous session, and the offshore yuan rose to around 7.28 per dollar on Monday, rebounding from losses seen the previous week after the People's Bank of China expectedly kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged for the sixth consecutive month in April 2025. China said on Monday that it ""firmly opposes"" any country making trade negotiations with the U.S. that come at Beijing’s expense, warning it would take “countermeasures” in a “resolute and reciprocal manner.” China has unveiled a plan to open its services sector further, aiming to attract more foreign investment amid rising trade tensions with the U.S. Meanwhile, the Chinese government ramped up fiscal support, with budget spending surging to CNY 9.26 trillion in the first quarter of 2025. Foreign direct investment into China sank by 10.8% from the previous year to about $36.9 billion in the first quarter of 2025. Hong Kong ( HSI ) market closed. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.80% Australia ( AS51 ) market closed. The Australian dollar climbed to around $0.64 on Monday, approaching a four-month high as broad weakness in the US dollar continued to support commodity-linked currencies. The U.S. markets were closed on Friday, April 18, 2025, in observance of Good Friday. U.S. stock futures declined on Monday as markets reopened following an extended holiday weekend: Dow -0.78%; S&P 500 -0.75%; Nasdaq -1.03%. Investors are also bracing for a packed earnings week, with over 100 S&P 500 companies set to report, including tech heavyweights Tesla and Alphabet. Other major firms on the earnings docket include Verizon, AT&T, Boeing, American Airlines, and Intuitive Surgical.

The ministry said it “respects all parties to resolve their economic and trade differences with the United States through consultations on an equal footing,”. Moreover, China “firmly opposes any party striking a deal at the expense of China.” It made clear that “China will never accept it and will take countermeasures in a resolute and reciprocal manner” if such arrangements proceed. This warning comes after reports that the Trump administration is offering incentives to countries that curb imports from China. China urged its trading partners to stand “on the side of fairness and justice on the issue of reciprocal tariffs,” signaling that they should uphold fair treatment instead of giving in to one-sided demands. It said it was “willing to strengthen solidarity and coordination with all parties, join hands to deal with the situation, [and] jointly resist unilateral bullying.” This appeal highlights Beijing’s aim to build a coalition of like‑minded economies opposed to aggressive tariff moves. The Commerce Ministry concluded by reaffirming China’s resolve. “China is determined and capable of safeguarding its own rights and interests,” Ministry said. China warns that agreeing to the US demand could backfire A Commerce Ministry spokesperson said “Appeasement will not bring peace, and compromise will not be respected,”. In recent weeks, Beijing imposed 125% levies on American imports in response to U.S. tariffs. It also restricted exports of critical minerals and placed several smaller U.S. companies on blacklists that limit their work with Chinese firms. Analysts do not expect a trade deal soon. On Thursday, April 17, former President Donald Trump said he believed a deal could be struck in three to four weeks. Last week, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia on his first overseas trip of 2025. In official statements , Xi called for joint efforts to oppose tariffs and “unilateral bullying.” Since U.S. tariffs began, China has boosted trade with Southeast Asia, which is now its largest regional partner. The United States remains China’s top single‑country partner. Last week, China’s Ministry of Commerce named Li Chenggang, former ambassador to the World Trade Organization, as its top trade negotiator and vice minister. Separately, China has filed a lawsuit against the United States with the WTO over the latest round of tariffs. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

""Total hacked funds of USD 1.4bn around 500k ETH. 68.57% remain traceable, 27.59% have gone dark, 3.84% have been frozen. The untraceable funds primarily flowed into mixers then through bridges to P2P and OTC platforms,"" Zhou said in an executive summary published on X on Monday. The untraceable funds were moved into mixers before being transferred through bridges to P2P (peer-to-peer) and OTC (over-the-counter) platforms, the post explained, mentioning the use of Wasabi, a crypto mixer, to wash off a certain amount of BTC, following which a portion of these funds entered into other mixers, including Railgun, Tornado Cash and CryptoMixer. The malicious entity then executed multiple cross-chain swaps through Thorchain, eXch, Lombard, LiFi, Stargate and SunSwap, with the final stage involving the conversion of these illicit funds into more liquid assets. The North Korea-linked Lazarus Group hacked Bybit in February, draining 500,000 ether (ETH) by taking ""control of the specific ETH cold wallet and transferring all the ETH in the cold wallet to this unidentified address."" Forensics reveal that of the hacked funds, a total of 432,748 ETH, representing 84.45%, has been transferred from ether to bitcoin via Thorchain. Notably, 67.25% of these funds, amounting to 342,975 ETH (around $960.33 million), has been converted into 10,003 BTC and distributed across 35,772 wallets with an average of 0.28 BTC per wallet. Further, 1.17% of the funds, or 5,991 ETH (approximately $16.77 million), remains on the Ethereum blockchain, stashed across 12,490 wallets. Lastly, the Lazarus Bounty initiative has received 5,443 bounty reports in two months, of which, 70 have been deemed valid.

Attorney General Dan Rayfield filed a new lawsuit accusing the cryptocurrency exchange of violating state securities laws by allowing the sale of digital assets that were not properly registered. The case claims Coinbase failed to assess the risks these assets posed to consumers and argues that the company’s conduct left Oregon investors exposed without adequate protections contributing to what the Attorney General views as a significant gap in regulatory oversight. A New Legal Battle for Coinbase The Oregon Attorney General’s move came weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dismissed its lawsuit against Coinbase. That dismissal followed a prior ruling from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, which had determined that the SEC’s claims were sufficient to move forward. However, the SEC’s abrupt decision to drop the case, paired with internal personnel changes, including the reassignment of the agency’s top crypto litigator , Jorge Tenreiro, signaled a broader shift in federal enforcement priorities. In light of this perceived retreat by federal regulators, Oregon has now stepped forward with its claims. The complaint argues that the crypto assets identified in the SEC’s original case, along with others, are being sold illegally to state residents. Coinbase CLO Criticizes Complaint’s Omissions Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal reacted publicly to the complaint, highlighting what he described as glaring omissions and questionable motivations. In a post on X, Grewal pointed to Section 9 of the lawsuit as telling. He noted that the complaint fails to reference Judge Torres’s 2023 decision in the Ripple case, which concluded that XRP is not inherently a security, a ruling widely seen as a landmark moment for the crypto sector. We finally got a copy of the Oregon AG complaint. If there were any doubt about the motivation behind it, look no further than section 9, where it 1) omits Judge Failla’s order granting interlocutory appeal of the @SECGov case; 2) omits any mention of Judge Torres’ decision in… pic.twitter.com/mIXxtQ7ojH — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) April 18, 2025 The complaint also excludes any mention of Judge Failla’s decision to allow an interlocutory appeal in the SEC’s case against Coinbase. Furthermore, Grewal criticized the involvement of two private law firms in drafting the lawsuit, as well as language within the complaint that refers to the new SEC chairman as a “crypto lobbyist” and condemns the reassignment of former SEC enforcement staff to other departments. Grewal suggests the suit is politically motivated rather than rooted in a genuine concern for investor protection.

With this, Robert Kiyosaki’s Bitcoin price prediction is making waves again, reigniting optimism among crypto investors. What’s Next For Bitcoin Price? Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the famous book Rich Dad Poor Dad, believes Bitcoin will reach at least $180,000 by the end of this year. He even thinks it could go beyond $200,000. He warned people to pay attention to what gold, silver, and Bitcoin are showing us. Gold is at its highest price ever, silver demand is growing fast, and Bitcoin is rising. He says the big crash he talked about in his books is now happening. According to him , the value of the U.S. dollar is falling, and people who saved in stocks, bonds, or mutual funds are losing their money. He blames powerful banks for this crisis and urges people to protect themselves by buying gold, silver, and Bitcoin. He says 2025 is seeing record-high credit card debt , rising unemployment, and losses in retirement savings like 401(k)s and pensions. He believes the U.S. could be heading into a “Greater Depression”—a crisis he warned about years ago in books like Rich Dad’s Prophecy , Fake , and Who Stole My Pension . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : What Happened In Crypto This Week? , Bitcoin Price Analysis According to Coinpedia Markets, the BTC price recovery brought some hope to traders. The Support between $82,000 and $83,000 is holding well for now, but resistance around $87,500 remains tough. If Bitcoin fails to break above that level with strong buying volume, it could dip again toward $81,000. Even though Bitcoin dipped below $80,000 recently, some analysts pointed out that it is still performing better than expected. Bitcoin had reached a high of $108,786 in January , and the current pullback is seen as part of its natural price movement. As long as key support levels hold, traders and investors remain hopeful that Bitcoin can climb higher in the coming months. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Source: Sam Altman Altman’s response sparked discussion about what drives users to interact with AI models in a polite manner. Some AI users say they interact politely with the bots in case AI becomes sentient and starts treating people based on how they interacted with it in the past. Source: Zvbear Others, such as engineer Carl Youngblood, claim they’re motivated to treat the AI well for personal development: “Treating AIs with courtesy is a moral imperative for me. I do it out of self-interest. Callousness in our daily interactions causes our interpersonal skills to atrophy.” A December 2024 survey by Future found that 67% of American users are polite to AI assistants, with 55% doing so because it's the right thing to do, and the other 12% doing so out of fear that mistreating the bots could come back to haunt them. Debate over ChatGPT’s electricity consumption A September 2023 research paper from Digiconomist founder and Bitcoin mining critic Alex de Vries states that a single ChatGPT query requires around three watt-hours of electricity. However, data analyst Josh You from AI research institute Epoch AI argues the figure is an overestimate, and is closer to 0.3 watt-hours due to more efficient models and hardware compared to 2023. One responder to Altman’s post wondered why ChatGPT doesn’t have a solution to save electricity costs on courtesy words like please and thank you. Altman recently stated that the cost of AI output has been falling tenfold every year as AI models become more efficient.

In an executive summary on hacked Bybit funds posted on X on April 21, Ben Zhou said that of the total $1.4 billion hacked, 68.6% “remains traceable,” 27.6% has “gone dark,” and 3.8% has been frozen. The untraceable funds primarily flowed into mixers , then through bridges to peer-to-peer and over-the-counter platforms, he added. In February, hackers associated with the Lazarus Group exploited vulnerabilities in Bybit’s cold wallet infrastructure, stealing $1.4 billion in the largest crypto exchange hack to date. “Recently, we have observed that the mixer mainly used by the DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] is Wasabi,” Zhou said before stating that following the Wasabi washing of BTC, “a small portion of it entered CryptoMixer, Tornado Cash, and Railgun.” Zhou confirmed that 944 Bitcoin ( BTC ) worth around $90 million went through the Wasabi mixer. Multiple crosschain and swap services were carried out through platforms such as THORChain, eXch, Lombard, LI.FI, Stargate, and SunSwap before the loot eventually entered P2P and OTC services, he added. Another 432,748 Ether ( ETH ), around 84% of the total worth roughly $1.21 billion, has been transferred from Ethereum to Bitcoin via THORChain. Around two-thirds of that — around $960 million worth of Ether — has been converted into 10,003 BTC across 35,772 wallets, he added. Around $17 million worth of Ether remains on the Ethereum blockchain across 12,490 wallets, Zhou reported. Around $1.2 billion worth of stolen crypto is still being tracked. Source: Lazarus Bounty Bybit pays around $2.3 million in bounties Zhou also revealed that only 70 of 5,443 bounty reports received over the past 60 days were valid. Bybit launched the Lazarus Bounty program in February, offering a total of $140 million in rewards for information leading to funds being frozen. To date, it has paid out $2.3 million to 12 bounty hunters. Most of this went to one entity, the Mantle layer-2 platform, whose efforts resulted in $42 million worth of frozen funds.

43607874,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=712839,1745214870,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43607874.jpeg,Tesla faces “code red” as Musk’s DOGE role sparks brand crisis,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/tesla-faces-code-red/,"Tesla analyst Dan Ives warned investors on Sunday that the company faces a “code red” moment unless Chief Executive Elon Musk walks away from his controversial government activities and turns his attention back to the company. In a note to Wedbush Securities clients ahead of Tesla’s first‑quarter earnings report on Tuesday, Ives wrote “Musk needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla.” As reported by Bloomberg , Ives added, “Tesla is Musk and Musk is Tesla … and anyone that thinks the brand damage Musk has inflicted is not a real thing, spend some time speaking to car buyers in the US, Europe, and Asia.” Ives, long known as a Tesla bull, cut his 12‑month price target for the shares by 43% two weeks ago, citing what he called a brand crisis tied to Musk and to President Donald Trump’s trade policies. He warned that China, which supplied more than a fifth of Tesla’s revenue last year, could retaliate against U.S. tariffs. Tesla’s 43% slide is tied to Musk’s White House role, Ives warns “Tesla has unfortunately become a political symbol of the Trump Administration/DOGE,” Ives said. Since Inauguration Day, Tesla’s stock has tumbled 43%, first‑quarter deliveries have disappointed, and street protests against the company have spread, he wrote. The analyst estimated “potentially 15% to 20% permanent demand destruction” among future buyers because of the fallout. Tuesday’s earnings call is expected to focus on 2025 sales volume, progress on autonomous driving, plans for a robotaxi network, and the profit hit from tariffs. But, Ives said, “looming over everything is Musk’s role in the White House.” Musk, the world’s richest person, holds the title of special government employee, a temporary post capped at 130 workdays a year. People familiar with the matter told Wedbush that Musk is expected to step back when that limit is reached this year. Despite the trouble, Ives kept an “outperform” rating on Tesla, calling it “one of the most disruptive technology companies on the globe over the years.” Still, he framed the next weeks as decisive. “We view this as a fork‑in‑the‑road time,” he wrote. “If Musk leaves the White House, there will be permanent brand damage, but Tesla will have its most important asset and strategic thinker back as CEO. If Musk chooses to stay with the Trump White House, it could change the future of Tesla; brand damage will grow.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Meanwhile, Robert Kiyosaki and other financial figures like Cathie Wood and Jack Dorsey predicted a $1 million Bitcoin by 2030–2035, due to inflation and fiscal instability. Charles Schwab is also preparing to offer spot Bitcoin trading by April 2026, signaling deeper TradFi integration thanks to shifting regulatory winds and rising investor demand. Bitcoin Finds Strength in Strategy Michael Saylor, the co-founder of Strategy, hinted at yet another upcoming Bitcoin purchase by the company. After its most recent acquisition of 3,459 BTC, which was valued at over $285 million on April 14, Strategy now holds a staggering 531,644 BTC. In a post on X dated April 20, Saylor revealed that more than 13,000 institutions and 814,000 retail accounts directly hold shares of Strategy (MSTR), with an estimated 55 million beneficiaries gaining indirect exposure through ETFs, mutual funds, pensions, and insurance products. The scale of institutional and retail involvement proves the growing alignment between traditional capital markets and Bitcoin, with Strategy acting as a conduit for this flow. The company consistently issued corporate debt and equity to finance its BTC purchases, creating a unique pipeline that converts stock market capital into digital assets. This financial strategy enabled broader investor exposure to Bitcoin without requiring direct asset custody, thereby boosting market confidence and supporting BTC’s price resilience. In December of 2024, Strategy was added to the Nasdaq 100 index , which greatly increased its visibility among institutional and passive investors who track the tech-heavy benchmark. The inclusion also solidified Strategy’s role as an important player in the digital asset landscape, as capital linked to the index indirectly flows into Bitcoin. The firm’s influence extends across the US, with Bitcoin analyst Julian Fahrer reporting in February of 2025 that twelve states have some level of exposure to Strategy’s BTC holdings. Some of these states include California, Texas, Florida, and Illinois. Additionally, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out that the combination of ETF inflows and institutional purchases from firms like Strategy provided critical support to the Bitcoin market, which might otherwise face volatility from short-term trader activity. So far in 2025, Bitcoin ETFs saw roughly $2.4 billion in inflows , helping to stabilize the price of the crypto king. Through a combination of financial engineering, strategic acquisitions, and wide-reaching investor exposure, Strategy drives mainstream capital into the Bitcoin ecosystem Bitcoin to Hit $1M by 2035? Robert Kiyosaki, the well-known financial educator and author, predicted that Bitcoin could surpass $1 million by 2035. In a recent post on X from April 18, Kiyosaki stated his belief that not only Bitcoin, but also gold and silver will experience massive price increases. He forecasted that gold will reach $30,000 and silver could hit $3,000 per coin. Kiyosaki placed a lot of emphasis on the fact that inflationary US monetary policies are accelerating the depreciation of the dollar, making hard assets like Bitcoin a lot more valuable as hedges against economic instability. Kiyosaki is a longtime supporter of gold and silver, and more recently added Bitcoin to his list of preferred assets. He sees them as crucial tools for preserving generational wealth during volatile economic cycles. He also painted a grim picture of the current US financial landscape, and pointed to record-high credit card debt, soaring national debt, rising unemployment, and struggling retirement accounts as signs of an impending economic depression. According to him, the combination of these factors is setting the stage for a major collapse, which he and other ”sound money” advocates believe will drive Bitcoin’s value dramatically higher. Kiyosaki’s prediction aligns with those of several other well known voices in the financial and crypto sectors who suggested that Bitcoin could reach seven-figure territory in the next decade. Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter, projected in May of 2024 that Bitcoin will reach $1 million by 2030. Trader Michaël van de Poppe echoed this in late 2024 but also warned that price gains like this will likely coincide with hyperinflation and severe economic downturn. Other influential people also voiced similar outlooks. Blockstream CEO Adam Back suggested that Bitcoin could rise to $1 million if the US government, under a Trump administration, started buying Bitcoin for its reserve. Eric Trump added weight to the narrative during a keynote speech at the Bitcoin MENA event in December of 2024 when he said that Bitcoin’s scarcity alone will inevitably drive its price to $1 million. Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, pushed the envelope further in February 2025 by stating that Bitcoin could climb to $1.5 million by 2030 if adoption trends persist. These forecasts reflect the growing consensus among Bitcoin advocates and financial visionaries that the digital asset may serve as a lifeline in a future shaped by inflation, fiscal mismanagement, and a declining dollar. Schwab Plans Spot Bitcoin Trading Bitcoin’s momentum could pick up even more after Charles Schwab CEO Rick Wurster revealed that the financial giant is aiming to launch spot Bitcoin trading services by April 2026. This will be a big stem forward in the integration of digital assets in traditional finance. In comments reported by RIABiz , Wurster pointed to a 400% spike in traffic to Schwab’s crypto-focused website as evidence of growing investor interest in the space. He stated that Schwab is optimistic about launching direct spot crypto offerings in the next 12 months, and credited the improving regulatory conditions for making such a move more viable. Wurster took over as CEO in 2025, and has been very vocal about his intention to provide Schwab clients with access to digital asset markets. In a previous interview with Yahoo Finance, he said that the firm was eager to offer crypto trading services but was holding out for a favorable regulatory environment. The re-election of Donald Trump provided what Wurster sees as the needed political shift. Despite his role, Wurster admitted that he does not currently own any cryptocurrency and regrets missing out on early gains in the asset class, calling it “silly” in hindsight. Nonetheless, his leadership started a clear pivot in Schwab’s stance toward digital assets. In January of 2025, Schwab made headlines by partnering with the Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) to co-develop exchange-traded funds and cryptocurrency services for the upcoming Truth.Fi platform. It is designed as a hybrid between digital assets and traditional finance, and Truth.Fi aims to serve as an alternative to the existing banking infrastructure. TMTG CEO and White House official Devin Nunes stated the platform is intended for users who are concerned about issues like censorship, debanking, and data privacy.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-21 06:00:41

The collaboration aims to offer global investors fractional ownership in a diverse portfolio of properties spread across seven states. Announced on April 18 , the initiative will launch a dedicated marketplace in the coming weeks, enabling users to purchase tokenized shares in dozens of properties. First Tokenized Properties Include Office and Retail Sites in South Florida The first listings include a three-story office building in Fort Lauderdale and a retail plaza in Dania Beach—both part of Vera Group’s current holdings. “All our assets are already within the group. They are purchased, managed, and improved by us,” said Vera Group CEO Nick Polyushkin. Vera Capital is the investment arm of Vera Group, which oversees a broader South Florida real estate agency, property management operations, and a development fund with over $100 million in active investments. According to Polyushkin, the $1 billion figure is based on Vera Group’s roadmap to tokenize existing assets and support new development projects. Among the upcoming offerings are two residential unit complexes, each valued between $70 and $100 million. While acknowledging the ambitious scale of the project, Polyushkin emphasized its feasibility. “These are ambitious numbers if you’re thinking in terms of residential investing, but from a commercial real estate perspective, this is very realistic—and not just achievable, but over-achievable,” he said. When it comes to tokenized real-world assets, the future favors those who build with regulation, purpose and vision in mind.

Shoutout to @IvanOnTech for a great… pic.twitter.com/XPXbCizx73 — Blocksquare (@blocksquare_io) April 20, 2025 Blocksquare, which operates on Ethereum, has already facilitated the tokenization of roughly 150 properties across 28 countries, with a total value exceeding $145 million. In February 2025, the company launched an EU-compliant framework designed to help property owners tokenize economic rights tied to real estate through notarized agreements. Blocksquare Explores Adapting Luxembourg Legal Framework for U.S. Real Estate Market Blocksquare CEO Denis Petrovic noted that the firm is assessing whether its legal framework, established in Luxembourg, can also be applied in the U.S. market. “There’s always the option of issuing tokens directly without involving the Luxembourg entity, but having it in place adds a layer of flexibility and legal assurance for a U.S.-based marketplace like Vera,” Petrovic explained. McKinsey & Company recently reported that tokenized financial assets have had a “cold start” but are still expected to grow to a $2 trillion market by 2030. Meanwhile, a report by the Global Financial Markets Association (GFMA) and Boston Consulting Group estimates the global value of tokenized illiquid assets will reach $16 trillion by 2030 . Even more conservative estimates from Citigroup suggest that $4 trillion to $5 trillion worth of tokenized digital securities could be minted by 2030. Recognizing this potential, major companies are making significant moves in the tokenization space. Goldman Sachs, for instance, plans to launch three new tokenization products later this year, driven by growing client interest.

Buterin shared the concept in a blog post on the Ethereum Magicians forum, calling it a “radical” but potentially necessary step to simplify and strengthen the network. The proposal coincides with Ethereum’s ongoing evolution following years of scalability upgrades and modular architecture experiments. “The Beam Chain work shows great promise for greatly simplifying Ethereum’s consensus layer,” Buterin wrote, “but such a radical change may be the only viable path for the execution layer to achieve similar gains.” Related News: Michael Saylor Signals Another Bitcoin (BTC) Buy - Here's the Price Level Where He Will Suffer Losses If BTC Price Declines According to Buterin, moving to RISC-V, a free, open-source instruction set architecture, could reduce on-chain execution costs by up to 100x in some scenarios. RISC-V is often compared to proprietary architectures like ARM and x86, but stands out for its openness and flexibility, making it a potential game-changer for blockchain infrastructure. Buterin emphasized backward compatibility, assuring the community that existing EVM contracts will remain fully functional and interoperable with the newly introduced RISC-V contracts. The proposal includes binary support options as well as an interpreter that can translate EVM contracts to RISC-V format. This isn’t the first time RISC-V has been explored on the blockchain. In August 2023, Polkadot introduced PolkaVM, a virtual machine that supports multiple architectures, including RISC-V. Buterin cited this model as an example of a less disruptive path that avoids the need for a major hardfork. *This is not investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As crypto markets regain steam, a fresh contender, Lightchain AI, is turning heads alongside stalwarts Solana and XRP. Table of Contents Could May be the breakout month for SOL, XRP, Lightchain AI? Which of these cryptos stands out most for immediate upside? Are investors backing the right coin as market momentum builds? As May unfolds, a new wave of momentum is building around some of the market’s most talked-about cryptocurrencies: Solana ( SOL ), XRP , and the fast-rising Lightchain AI. Each of these projects is pushing toward new highs, driven by unique catalysts and investor confidence. Solana is gaining renewed attention due to its consistent scalability improvements, while XRP continues to draw eyes with its long-anticipated regulatory clarity. But Lightchain AI, priced at just $0.007 and already raising $19.3 million in its presale, is emerging as a serious contender with disruptive potential. With innovations like the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) and Proof of Intelligence (PoI), Lightchain AI is offering more than hype; it’s delivering substance. For investors asking which crypto could deliver the strongest returns this May, the answer may not be what they expect. This article will explore the potential of Lightchain AI and what sets it apart in the competitive world of cryptocurrency. Could May be the breakout month for SOL, XRP, Lightchain AI ? Historically speaking, May is a month when momentum is regained in the crypto space, and this year, Solana, XRP, and Lightchain AI are leading the charge. Solana is bouncing back from prior obstacles with fortification and developer attention, while XRP’s legal clarity is continuously rebuilding confidence in its long-term prospects, particularly with cross-border exchanges. But Lightchain AI is here to tell a different story, a story that deals with real utility in the space between the AI and blockchain. With $19.3 million already raised, and a presale price of just $0.007, it’s quickly establishing itself as a breakout pick for anybody looking beyond legacy coins. All three of their narratives are strong, but May’s rally could end up being defined not only by past reputations, but by innovation, strategic positioning, and community engagement. You might also like: SHIB, DOGE get the cold shoulder as Lightchain AI with 21300% growth potential shines Which of these cryptos stands out most for immediate upside ? While Solana and XRP remain solid long-term plays, Lightchain AI currently offers the highest upside potential for investors seeking immediate growth. Solana’s recovery is underway, but slower, often tied to broader tech cycles and institutional sentiment. XRP, despite its momentum, faces the weight of its large market cap and competition in the payments sector. Lightchain AI, on the other hand, enters the field with a compelling use case powered by decentralized AI execution, token utility, and novel features, such as the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine. The entry point is attractive, and its early-stage status means gains could be exponential if market attention continues to swell. For those prioritizing rapid return potential in a short window like May, Lightchain AI may be the standout choice. Are investors backing the right coin as market momentum builds ? With capital flowing back into crypto, investor choices in May could define portfolio performance for the rest of the year. Solana is regaining trust due to improved network stability and growing adoption among developers. XRP is seeing optimism from the institutional side, but much of the current bullishness may already be priced in. Lightchain AI, however, is in a different category, one that combines utility, innovation, and a low market cap entry. Its Proof of Intelligence consensus and developer-driven AIVM architecture are beginning to resonate with forward-looking investors who missed early runs of similar projects. Backing Lightchain AI now isn’t just about hype; it’s about strategic timing. As momentum builds, those aligned early with emerging utility-based platforms could stand to benefit most.

While past cycle comparisons suggest more upside, the overheated RSI hints that a short-term cooldown might come first. BTC on the Move Bitcoin’s price remained relatively stable over the past several days, hovering around $84,000-$85,000. However, the new business week kicked off on the right foot, with its valuation jumping above $87,500. BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko The surge caught the eye of numerous industry participants, some of whom believe a further rally could be brewing. Scott Melker (the host of The Wolf of All Streets Podcast) told his one million followers on X that BTC has been “breaking through descending resistance from the all-time high.” He claimed the price needs to spike beyond $88,804 “to break the series of lower highs and lower lows.” The X user JAVON MARKS chipped in, too. They suggested that BTC has invalidated a falling wedge pattern with its latest price pump, pointing out that this has resulted in a massive rally in the past. For their part, 0xNobler believes “the Golden Bull Run” could start this week. They think BTC has yet to mirror its positive performance from the 2020-2021 and 2016-2017 cycles, envisioning an ascent to as high as $200,000. In addition, the analyst forecasted that many altcoins “are set to pump 150-200x.” What Are Indicators Signaling? Some important metrics also suggest that BTC’s price could be on the verge of a further increase. The asset’s exchange netflow , for instance, has been negative in the past week, suggesting a shift from centralized platforms toward self-custody methods. This could be viewed as a bullish factor in the short term since it reduces the immediate selling pressure. BTC Exchange Netflow, Source: CryptoQuant Meanwhile, the renowned analyst Ali Martinez recently reminded that BTC market peaks have historically coincided with surges in retail activity. He said the rise from $70,000 to the ATH of $110,000 ( observed in January this year) lacked that, hinting that the market top has yet to be reached . Despite the bullish sentiment across the community, one indicator points to a potential pullback in the near future. This is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum oscillator that tracks the speed and magnitude of recent price changes. It varies from 0 to 100, and readings above 70 are considered bearish since they signal that the asset could have entered overbought territory. Currently, the ratio stands at approximately 73.

The ever-fluctuating world of cryptocurrencies keeps us all on our toes, trying to decipher whether we should be cautiously optimistic or bracing for a downturn. One crucial tool that helps gauge the overall market sentiment is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . Let’s dive into the latest readings and understand what they signify for your crypto journey. Crypto Fear & Greed Index: A Glimmer of Hope or Just a Mirage? As of April 21st, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a well-known metric provided by Alternative.me, nudged upwards to 39. This is a two-point increase from the previous day, offering a tiny sliver of optimism. However, before you start popping champagne bottles, it’s essential to note that despite this uptick, the index remains firmly entrenched in the ‘Fear’ zone. This consistent ‘Fear’ sentiment prompts a crucial question: Is this a temporary blip or a sign of underlying market anxiety? The index operates on a scale from 0 to 100. Let’s break down what these numbers truly represent: 0-24: Extreme Fear – This zone typically indicates a market ripe for potential buying opportunities. When fear is rampant, prices are often suppressed, presenting chances to acquire assets at lower valuations. 25-49: Fear – Still a cautious zone, ‘Fear’ suggests investors are apprehensive, possibly due to recent market corrections or negative news. While not as extreme as the lowest range, it still reflects a bearish sentiment. 50-74: Greed – As the index climbs into ‘Greed’, it signals growing market confidence. Investors are becoming more optimistic, potentially driving prices upwards. 75-100: Extreme Greed – This is the ‘danger zone’. ‘Extreme Greed’ often precedes market corrections. It indicates a bubble-like scenario where excessive optimism can lead to irrational buying and inflated prices. Decoding the Components: What Drives the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just a random number generator. It’s a composite index, meticulously calculated by analyzing six key market indicators. Understanding these components gives us a deeper insight into the factors influencing market sentiment. Let’s break down each element: Volatility (25%): Volatility measures the rapid price fluctuations in the crypto market, particularly Bitcoin. High volatility often breeds fear as investors become uncertain about price stability. The index analyzes the current volatility and compares it with 30-day and 90-day averages. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This factor examines market momentum and trading volume relative to the 30-day and 90-day averages. Strong buying momentum and high volume typically indicate greed, while weak momentum and low volume can suggest fear. Social Media (15%): Social media sentiment plays a significant role in today’s markets. The index analyzes social media platforms for crypto-related hashtags and keywords, gauging the overall tone – positive or negative – of online conversations. Surveys (15%): While less prominent than other factors, periodic crypto surveys gauge investor sentiment directly. These surveys ask participants about their market outlook, contributing to the overall index score. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market reflects investor preference for Bitcoin versus altcoins. Increased Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate a ‘flight to safety’ during fearful times, while decreasing dominance might suggest a higher risk appetite and greed. Google Trends (10%): Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries provides insights into general public interest in crypto. Spikes in searches can indicate either increased fear of missing out (FOMO) during greedy periods or panic selling during fearful times. Why Does the ‘Fear’ Zone Persist Despite the Slight Increase in Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The slight two-point rise in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a minor positive shift, but the persistent presence in the ‘Fear’ zone highlights ongoing market anxieties. Several factors could be contributing to this: Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Global economic factors, such as inflation, interest rate hikes, and geopolitical tensions, heavily influence investor sentiment across all markets, including crypto. Uncertainty in these areas can fuel fear. Regulatory Scrutiny: Ongoing regulatory discussions and actions surrounding cryptocurrencies create uncertainty and apprehension among investors. Negative regulatory news can quickly trigger fear in the market. Recent Market Corrections: Recent price corrections and market volatility can leave a lingering sense of caution, making investors hesitant to become overly bullish, even after minor positive price movements. Altcoin Performance: While Bitcoin might show some stability, the performance of altcoins also contributes to the overall sentiment. If altcoins are experiencing significant downturns, it can drag the index down, even if Bitcoin shows signs of improvement. Navigating Market Fear: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should crypto investors do when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index hovers in the ‘Fear’ zone? Here are some actionable insights: Exercise Caution, Not Panic: Fear can be contagious. While the ‘Fear’ zone suggests caution, it’s crucial to avoid panic selling based solely on the index. Make informed decisions based on your own research and risk tolerance. Identify Potential Buying Opportunities: Historically, periods of ‘Fear’ and ‘Extreme Fear’ have presented attractive buying opportunities. When the market is fearful, assets can be undervalued. Consider dollar-cost averaging into your favorite cryptocurrencies during these times. Review Your Portfolio: Market fear is a good time to review your portfolio allocation. Ensure your portfolio aligns with your long-term investment goals and risk appetite. Rebalance if necessary. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic trends. Understanding the factors driving market sentiment empowers you to make more informed decisions. Focus on Long-Term Fundamentals: In times of fear, it’s easy to get caught up in short-term price fluctuations. Re-center your focus on the long-term fundamentals of the projects you’re invested in. Strong projects with solid use cases are more likely to weather market storms. Conclusion: Interpreting the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for Informed Decisions The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a valuable tool for understanding the prevailing sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. While the recent slight increase to 39 offers a glimmer of hope, the continued presence in the ‘Fear’ zone underscores the need for cautious optimism. By understanding the components of the index, recognizing the factors driving market sentiment, and adopting a strategic approach, crypto investors can navigate market fluctuations more effectively and make informed decisions, regardless of whether the needle points towards fear or greed. Remember, market sentiment is just one piece of the puzzle – thorough research and a long-term perspective are your best allies in the dynamic world of crypto investing.

DXY, which is a measure of the greenback against a basket of six leading currencies, has fallen to 98.23, its lowest level since March 2022, according to TradingView. “The dollar Index is below 98.5, a new three-year low. This is getting serious,” said gold investor Peter Schiff on April 21.

However, it saw a similar decline between October and December 2022 when it fell from 114 to 101 as the greenback depreciated. This dip has been deeper, however, with more pain predicted if trade deals are not made fast.

The euro is above $1.15. The dollar has also fallen below 141 Japanese yen and .81 Swiss francs (a new 14-year low, just 3% above a record low.) The dollar Index is below 98.5, a new three-year low. This is getting serious. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) April 21, 2025 Meanwhile, gold prices have hit another all-time high of $3,380 per ounce, he added. The usually slow-moving precious yellow metal has gained a whopping 29% in dollar terms since the beginning of this year as investors flock to safe havens amid the currency crisis. BTC Hits 4-Week High Meanwhile, Bitcoin appears to have decoupled from tech stocks and realigned with gold, surged 2.5% on the day to reclaim a four-week high of $87,550 during the Monday morning trading session in Asia. Bitcoin appears to be holding gains, trading at $87,400 at the time of writing rather than bouncing back down off resistance. However, it needs to clear the $88,500 level it reached in late March to see a larger move into the $90K range. “I’m open to the possibility that it may be finally happening. Bitcoin taking on its final form. Either that or somebody is levering up on longs for some other reason,” said economist Alex Krüger. He also suggested that investors in Asia were viewing Bitcoin as a safe haven, whereas those in the US were speculating with it as a risk asset.

Analysts Warn! Here Are the Details",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-surpasses-87000-after-a-long-break-analysts-warn-here-are-the-details/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has broken above the $87,000 level for the first time in more than two weeks, driven by increased global liquidity and renewed institutional appetite. Bitcoin Surpasses $87,000 on Global Liquidity Surge, But Analysts Say Bull Run Is Early But analysts caution that it is too early to say a new bull market has begun as macroeconomic uncertainties continue to weigh on sentiment. Bitcoin was trading at $87,525, up more than 2.4% in the past 24 hours. The move marked a sharp recovery from earlier this month, when BTC fell to $74,500 following market jitters sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump’s aggressive tariff proposals. Liquidity and Institutions Drive Demand Kronos Research analyst Dominick John attributed the recent surge to the increase in global M2 money supply and institutional accumulation, particularly by Michael Saylor, who recently announced that he purchased 3,459 BTC. “Bitcoin’s rise above $87,000, the increase in global liquidity… and renewed institutional interest are tightening the available supply,” John said, citing data showing that global M2 supply in the US, Europe, Japan and China reached $90.2 trillion between December and February. Strategy, which has continued to defend Bitcoin despite reporting $5.91 billion in unrealized losses on its BTC holdings in Q1, has remained publicly bullish. “Bitcoin has no counterparty risk… Not even chaos,” Saylor wrote in a piece on X. Meanwhile, US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded net inflows of $15.8 million last week, indicating growing confidence among institutional players compared to the cautious sentiment seen in February and early March. Other cryptocurrencies followed Bitcoin’s lead, albeit with mixed results. Ethereum (ETH) rose 0.97% to $1,656, while XRP climbed 1.38% to $2.13. However, Solana (SOL) fell 0.87% to $140.20. Despite the rally, analysts remain cautious. Ongoing U.S. trade talks remain a major source of uncertainty, said Peter Chung, research director at Presto Research. *This is not investment advice.

BTC zoomed above $87,000 in Asian morning hours, with Cardano’s ADA, BNB Chain’s BNB, XRP and ether (ETH) adding as much as 1.5%. The spike reversed all declines since Thursday, with tokens such as Solana’s SOL up 5.2% in the past week. The tariff-driven trade wars have sparked fears of inflation and currency devaluation, prompting comparisons of the asset to gold’s historical role as a hedge. “Although bitcoin has had a close correlation with U.S. equities, it seems to be changing with a stronger tie to the rise of the price of gold, which has been a safe haven while equities have plummeted,” Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message on Monday. “Bitcoin crossed $87,000 as a sign of renewed investor confidence as the market continues to stabilize after panicking over tariffs. It’s also worth noting that Bitcoin's digital gold narrative is taking off as both assets have grown in tandem,” Ruck said. Gold set fresh highs Monday with a push above $3,380 per ounce, bringing year-to-date gains to 25%. Bitcoin has dropped more than 20% from a January peak of $108,000, though Monday’s push over $87,000 sent the asset to its highest level since Donald Trump’s “liberation day” in early April. Pressure on the greenback has continued to grow as the dollar index (DXY) crashed to a three-year low, with some pointing out that most bad news has been “priced in” and that bitcoin could see upside in the coming days. “Trump's inclination to remove Jerome Powell as Fed Chair and force interest rate cuts is causing people to sell the U.S. dollar and U.S. government debt, moving to other safe haven assets such as gold, European bonds, and now, Bitcoin,” Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message Monday. “After all, when rates are cut, more money flows into the money supply, devaluing the U.S. dollar. In general, downward pressure on the US dollar is growing and this could be a driving catalyst for Bitcoin to become a safe haven asset,” Mei added. Meanwhile, here’s a machine’s view of the markets today, powered by the CoinDesk Markets AI bot. ADA Price Analysis Cardano’s ADA is above 63 cents with strong technical indicators pointing to continued upward momentum despite macroeconomic headwinds. Price action formed a clear ascending channel with strong support at $0.612, which successfully held during multiple retests. Notable volume spike occurred on 2025-04-21 00:00 when volume reached 68M (3x average), propelling price through key resistance at $0.630. Fibonacci extension levels suggest 64 cents as the next target, with an overall range of 0.031 (5.1%), indicating substantial volatility. RSI remains below overbought territory despite the rally, suggesting potential for continued upward momentum. Consolidation near previous resistance suggests accumulation rather than distribution. XRP Price Analysis XRP's decisive breakout signals a potential end to months-long sideways trading, with technical indicators pointing to further gains ahead. Fibonacci retracement levels suggest potential continuation toward $2.15, with the 61.8% extension pointing to $2.18 as the next target if bullish momentum persists. SOL Price Analysis SOL breaks decisively above $135 resistance, surging 10.2% to establish new support levels with strong volume confirmation Key technical battle emerges between $129 support and $144 resistance zones, with on-chain data showing 5.75% of realized volume concentrated at these critical levels Price action formed a clear ascending channel with higher lows and higher highs, particularly evident in the April 19-21 rally. Volume significantly increased during upward movements, confirming the strength of the bullish trend. The 48-hour momentum indicators show bullish divergence with price maintaining strength above the 20-hour moving average. BNB Price Action BNB breaks $600 barrier with 3.2% surge as large holders accumulate during market volatility. Recent quarterly token burn removed 1.57 million BNB worth over $1 billion, supporting price momentum. Open interest in BNB rose 3.3% to $760 million despite negative funding rates, with 68% of traders betting on continued price increases. BNB broke out of its consolidation range with a 3.2% surge from $592.63 to $601.74. Price action shows clear bullish momentum with increasing volume, particularly during the breakout candle where volume spiked to 55,661 units. Fibonacci extension targets suggest potential continuation toward the $605-610 zone if current momentum persists.",Markets|BNB|SOL|XRP|Bitcoin|News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-21 07:16:50

Whether you’re flipping short-term market trends or managing long-term positions, the platform is designed for speed, efficiency, and usability. Origins of Flipster Flipster started as AQX in June 2020, short for “Access, Quality, and Xtraordinary.” The platform was created to address two common crypto trading issues of limited risk protection and poor liquidity. AQX launched its public beta on May 18, 2022. In July 2023, the platform rebranded as Flipster to emphasize a more engaging and user-friendly trading experience. Since the rebranding, Flipster has experienced rapid growth, offering more than 350 perpetual futures contracts and serving users in more than 200 countries. How Does Flipster Handle Security Risks? In the era of digital trading, security breaches, unfortunately, occur from time to time, and even major platforms like Binance are not immune. For instance, in 2019, Binance experienced a security breach that resulted in the theft of 7,000 BTC. The key question becomes – how does a platform respond? Flipster has gone above and beyond to protect users. To date, Flipster has not reported any external hacks or Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) attacks. While no external attacks have occurred, Flipster continuously enhances security through encryption, two-factor authentication (2FA), and regular audits. The platform partners with Fireblocks for cold storage solutions and conducts thorough reviews of its internal controls to stay ahead of emerging threats. Security Enhancements Flipster follows strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols, which require every user to submit identification documents, such as a passport, ID card, or driver’s license—and typically a selfie or live verification before they can deposit or withdraw funds. This verification process can be completed directly within the app, thanks to an integration with Sumsub that streamlines the experience. Once users upload their documents and receive approval (which usually occurs quickly, with an email notification sent upon approval), they can start trading. While some may find mandatory KYC procedures inconvenient, Flipster has made the process relatively quick and effective, enhancing security by preventing bad actors from using the platform. Flipster protects user funds using industry-standard measures through Proof of Reserves (PoR) . They regularly publish audits that show all customer assets are fully backed 1:1 by reserves. This allows users to check that their account balances are included and confirms that Flipster does not use fractional reserves. PoR ensures that if all users decide to withdraw their funds, Flipster can process every request. This is important, especially after recent industry collapses. By frequently updating the Proof of Reserves, Flipster shows accountability and reassures users that their money is safe and securely held. Additionally, users can verify their account balance via the Merkle Tree self-verification tool on Flipster. Flipster is committed to securing user information and digital assets beyond the measures already mentioned. In December of 2024, Flipster achieved ISO/IEC 27001 certification, which is widely recognized for establishing high standards in information security management for organizations. The security measures implemented by Flipster demonstrate their relentless dedication to protecting users’ data and assets in an increasingly complex digital world. In addition to being an ISO/IEC 27001 certified organization, Flipster has partnered with Fireblocks to secure digital assets in cold storage, ensuring they are safely held offline. The platform implements two-factor authentication (2FA) for an extra level of protection and includes end-to-end encryption, keeping user data secure. Flipster enlists third-party security experts to conduct regular reviews and audits of its security measures, ensuring compliance with international industry standards. Role-based access control (RBAC) is employed to limit access to sensitive data based on employees’ roles. Additionally, Flipster has a response plan for security incidents that outlines procedures for emergency responses in case of a breach, while adhering to global privacy and protection laws, including GDPR. Through these comprehensive security measures and its robust response plan, Flipster is committed to creating and protecting a safe and reliable environment for users to trade and manage their assets.

It’s not just about understanding blockchain technology or the latest meme coin; it’s also about keeping a close eye on broader economic indicators that can send ripples through the crypto market. This week is shaping up to be particularly eventful on the economic front, with several key announcements and speeches scheduled that could significantly influence crypto market events . Are you prepared for the potential shifts? Navigating Crypto Market Events This Week The traditional financial markets and the burgeoning crypto sphere are more interconnected than ever. Economic events that move the needle in traditional finance often have a cascading effect on digital assets. This week, we’re focusing on a series of announcements and speeches that deserve your attention. Let’s break down the key dates and times to mark on your calendar, all in UTC for your convenience: Tuesday, April 22 13:30 UTC: U.S. FOMC Member Harker Speaks – Patrick Harker’s insights into the Federal Reserve’s perspective on the economy are always closely watched. His commentary can provide clues about future monetary policy, which directly impacts investment sentiment across all markets, including crypto. 14:00 UTC: EUR ECB President Lagarde Speaks – Christine Lagarde’s remarks on the Eurozone economy are equally significant. Given the global nature of financial markets, developments in the Eurozone can indirectly influence crypto markets, particularly for those assets paired against EUR. Wednesday, April 23 13:30 UTC: U.S. Fed Waller Speaks – Christopher Waller’s perspectives as a Fed Governor are highly valued. His speech offers another opportunity to gauge the Fed’s thinking and potential future actions. Pay close attention to any hints about inflation, interest rates, or economic growth, as these are crucial drivers for market volatility events in crypto. Thursday, April 24 12:30 UTC: U.S. Initial Jobless Claims – This is a critical piece of data reflecting the health of the U.S. labor market. Higher than expected jobless claims can signal economic weakness, potentially leading to a risk-off sentiment that might affect crypto. Conversely, lower claims can suggest a robust economy, which could be interpreted positively by the markets. The jobless claims impact is often immediate and noticeable. 21:00 UTC: U.S. FOMC Member Kashkari Speaks – Neel Kashkari, another influential voice from the FOMC, will be speaking late in the day. His views, especially following the jobless claims data, could provide further clarity on the Fed’s stance and potential market direction. Decoding Federal Reserve Speakers and Their Crypto Market Impact Why are speeches from federal reserve speakers so important for the crypto market? The answer lies in the Fed’s influence on monetary policy. Here’s a breakdown: Interest Rate Expectations: Statements from Fed officials can heavily influence expectations about future interest rate hikes or cuts. Higher interest rates generally make riskier assets like cryptocurrencies less attractive compared to safer, yield-bearing investments. Inflation Outlook: The Fed’s view on inflation is critical. If speakers suggest inflation is persistent and requires aggressive measures, this can lead to market uncertainty and potential downturns, impacting crypto negatively. Conversely, if they signal inflation is cooling down, it could boost market confidence. Economic Growth Signals: Fed speakers often provide insights into the overall health of the U.S. economy. Concerns about economic slowdown or recession can trigger risk aversion, leading investors to pull back from volatile assets like crypto. Market Sentiment: Beyond specific policy signals, the overall tone and sentiment conveyed by Fed speakers can shape market mood. Hawkish (inflation-fighting) tones can induce caution, while dovish (growth-supporting) tones might encourage risk-taking. Keep an eye on the nuances of their speeches. Are they hinting at future rate cuts? Are they expressing concerns about persistent inflation? Are they optimistic or pessimistic about economic growth? These are the questions crypto investors should be asking and seeking answers for. Jobless Claims and Crypto Volatility: What to Expect? The weekly U.S. Initial Jobless Claims report is more than just a labor market statistic; it’s a potential catalyst for market volatility events , including in the crypto space. Here’s why: Jobless Claims Data Potential Crypto Market Reaction Explanation Higher than Expected Claims Potentially Negative Signals economic weakness, increased unemployment, and potential recessionary pressures. Investors might move away from risk assets like crypto towards safer havens. Lower than Expected Claims Potentially Positive Suggests a strong labor market and a healthy economy. This can boost overall market confidence and potentially support risk assets like crypto. In Line with Expectations Neutral to Mild Market reaction might be muted as the data confirms existing economic expectations. However, it still contributes to the overall economic narrative. It’s crucial to remember that the market reaction isn’t always straightforward. Other factors, including global events, earnings reports, and overall market sentiment, also play a role. However, jobless claims remain a key indicator to watch, especially in the current economic climate. Actionable Insights: Preparing for Economic Events in Crypto So, how can you, as a crypto enthusiast or investor, navigate these economic calendar crypto events effectively? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on economic calendars and news sources. Know when these announcements are scheduled and be prepared for potential market movements. Manage Risk: Economic events can trigger volatility. Consider adjusting your portfolio risk accordingly. This might involve reducing exposure to highly volatile assets or using hedging strategies. Analyze Speaker Statements: Don’t just look at the headlines. Read or listen to the full speeches or detailed summaries to understand the nuances of what Fed and ECB officials are saying. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification can help mitigate the impact of market volatility. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider Technical Analysis: Use technical analysis tools to identify potential support and resistance levels for your favorite cryptocurrencies. This can help you anticipate price movements around economic announcements. This week’s crypto market events are poised to be significant. By staying informed, understanding the potential impact of federal reserve speakers and jobless claims impact , and preparing your strategy, you can navigate the volatility and potentially capitalize on opportunities. The key is to be proactive and informed.

Stańczak says Buterin’s proposals are meant to spark discussions and invite scrutiny regarding the network’s future goals and breakthroughs. In a recent post following Buterin’s previous proposal on replacing Ethereum ( ETH ) Virtual Machine with RISC-V to improve long-term scalability, Stańczak said that under the change in leadership, the Foundation will shift its focus from research and development to working on Layer 1 scaling, Layer 2 support, optimizing user experience, and interoperability. This includes improving the network under the new protocol upgrades, such as the upcoming Pectra upgrade, Fusaka and Glamsterdam. Our discussions about the Layer 1 scaling roadmap have been extensive, and the feedback so far suggests that the community appreciates our ambition. Turning that ambition into reality now depends on the focus of the core development teams and researchers. Following the recent… — Tomasz K. Stańczak (@tkstanczak) April 20, 2025 As a result, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin will have a relatively smaller role in the network’s daily operational work. Instead, Buterin will be focusing his efforts on network-related research initiatives. “We aimed, among other things, to free more of Vitalik’s time for research and exploration, rather than day‑to‑day coordination or crisis response. Each time Vitalik shares insights or communicates a direction, he accelerates major long‑term breakthroughs,” said Stańczak.

However, he took the opportunity to remind community members that although Buterin’s proposals hold significant impact, they are designed to spark conversations and should not be treated as final decisions. In fact, he emphasized that the community could very well refine proposals or even reject them outright. “I want to make clear that Vitalik’s proposals will always carry weight, but they are intended to start conversations and encourage progress in difficult research areas,” continued Stańczak. On April 20, Vitalik Buterin shared a proposal on the Ethereum Magicians forum where he advocated for switching the Ethereum Virtual Machine in favor of RISC-V, an open-source instruction set architecture. He believed the change could greatly improve the network’s efficiency, especially in terms of for zero-knowledge-based scaling. The proposal was published only a few days prior to the network’s latest upgrade, which is set to go live on May 7.

Out of the $1.4 billion in stolen ETH, 68.57% of the funds remain traceable, while 3.84% have been frozen. However, 27.59% have gone dark—likely laundered through mixers and bridges. Bybit Hack: What Happened To Stolen Crypto? On February 21, 2025, North Korea’s Lazarus Group exploited a free storage software tool used by Bybit, leading to the theft of 500,000 ETH. It marked the largest-ever crypto heist. Movement of the Funds After the hack, most of the stolen ETH was converted into Bitcoin via Thorchain: 432,748 ETH (~$1.21B) swapped into BTC. 342,975 ETH (converted into 10,003 BTC ) distributed across 35,772 wallets. 944 BTC (~$90M) passed through Wasabi Mixer. Some funds also flowed through CryptoMixer, Tornado Cash, Railgun, and bridging services like LiFi, Stargate, and SunSwap. Currently, 5,991 ETH (~$16.7M) is still sitting on Ethereum, spread across 12,490 wallets. Bybit’s Response: Lazarus Bounty Program To track stolen assets, Bybit launched lazarusbounty.com , calling on blockchain analysts and bounty hunters. So far, 5,443 reports have been submitted, but only 70 were deemed valid. The exchange urges more experts to join the investigation. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : UK Minister’s X Account Hacked to Promote Fake ‘House of Commons’ Crypto , Crypto Hacks on the Rise According to DeFiLlama , over $11.25 billion has been hacked from the crypto sector to date.

The launch event is aimed at banks, fintechs, payment service providers, remittance providers and USDC strategic partners. It will feature Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire sharing his vision for the stablecoin giant’s next move within the payments space, according to an invite seen by CoinDesk. New and incipient regulations around the globe are opening up the stablecoin space, where Circle has shared the limelight with larger rival Tether. It makes sense then that Circle — a firm that has successfully pivoted during its years in the crypto space — should look to consolidate its position and return to its roots as a payments company. “Circle is launching a payments network that is initially targeting remittances but is ultimately aiming to rival Mastercard and Visa,"" said a person familiar with the plans. Stablecoins have reached an adoption level where the technology could disrupt global money transfers in a way similar to WhatsApp and international calls, VC firm Andreessen Horowitz said in recent report. In a recent interview, crypto custody tech specialists Fireblocks pointed to billions being moved around by payments services providers doing things like cross border payments using stablecoins like USDC and USDT. Circle was in the news most recently, after the firm announced plans to go public in the U.S., only to postpone the date of its IPO thanks to choppy and uncertain market conditions.

43610747,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=150993,1745220609,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Struggling Bitcoin Miners Face Dire Hashprice Plunge: Is Profitability Vanishing?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/struggling-bitcoin-miners-hashprice-plunge/,"The world of Bitcoin miners is facing a significant shake-up. While Bitcoin prices have shown resilience, a critical metric that directly impacts miner revenue – hashprice – has plummeted to levels not seen in five years. This alarming drop is squeezing profit margins and pushing many miners dangerously close to their breakeven points. Are we witnessing a critical juncture for the Bitcoin mining industry? Let’s dive deep into the factors contributing to this pressure and what it means for the future of Bitcoin. What is Hashprice and Why Does it Matter for Bitcoin Miners? Imagine you’re running a business, and suddenly, the price you get for your product drops significantly, even though your operating costs remain high or are even increasing. This is precisely the situation Bitcoin miners are currently facing. Hashprice, in simple terms, is the dollar-denominated revenue a miner earns for every petahash per second (PH/s) of computing power they contribute to the Bitcoin network. It’s a crucial indicator of mining profitability. Think of it this way: Hashrate: This is the total computational power being used to mine Bitcoin. It’s like the collective effort of all miners securing the network. Hashprice: This is the reward for that effort, expressed as dollars earned per unit of hashrate (PH/s). According to data from HashRate Index, cited by CoinDesk, hashprice is currently hovering around a worrying $44.00 per PH/s. This figure is precariously close to the lows observed in August 2024 and represents a five-year nadir. To understand the severity, consider the factors at play that are driving this downward pressure. The Perfect Storm: Factors Squeezing Miner Profitability Several converging factors are creating a challenging environment for Bitcoin miners , eroding their miner profitability despite relatively stable or even increasing Bitcoin prices. Let’s break down these key pressures: Increased Competition: The Bitcoin mining landscape is becoming increasingly competitive. More miners are joining the network, especially as Bitcoin gains wider adoption. This increased competition means a smaller slice of the Bitcoin reward pie for each miner. Rising Bitcoin Mining Difficulty: The Bitcoin network’s difficulty adjustment mechanism automatically increases the difficulty of mining new blocks to maintain a consistent block creation time of approximately 10 minutes. As more miners join, difficulty rises, requiring more computational power to earn the same amount of Bitcoin. This translates to higher operational costs. Lower Transaction Fees: Transaction fees, which miners also earn alongside block rewards, have become less predictable and are often lower than during peak bull market periods. This reduces the overall revenue stream for miners. Surging Energy Costs: Energy is a primary operating expense for Bitcoin miners . Global energy prices have been volatile and, in many regions, have surged. Higher energy costs directly eat into miner profit margins, especially for those using older, less efficient mining hardware. Breakeven Point: Are Bitcoin Miners Operating on Thin Ice? The combination of declining hashprice and rising operational costs is pushing many Bitcoin miners closer to their breakeven point. The breakeven point is the price at which a miner’s revenue exactly equals their total costs. Operating below this point means incurring losses. The breakeven point varies significantly depending on several factors, including: Mining Hardware Efficiency: Miners using older, less energy-efficient ASIC miners face higher electricity costs per Bitcoin mined, leading to a higher breakeven point. Newer, more efficient hardware offers a significant advantage. Electricity Costs: Miners with access to cheap electricity sources (e.g., renewable energy, regions with lower energy tariffs) have a lower breakeven point compared to those in areas with expensive electricity. Operational Efficiency: Factors like cooling systems, maintenance, and overall farm management also impact operational costs and the breakeven point. While some miners, particularly those with access to cheap energy and efficient hardware, may still be operating slightly above breakeven, the current hashprice environment leaves little room for error. They are certainly far from the lucrative profitability levels experienced during the 2021 bull run. The Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI): A Reflection of Miner Struggles The challenges faced by Bitcoin miners are mirrored in the performance of publicly traded mining companies and related investment vehicles. The Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI), which tracks the performance of companies involved in the Bitcoin mining industry, is a stark indicator. It has plummeted by a significant 50% year-to-date. This dramatic drop reflects investor concerns about the declining miner profitability and the overall health of the mining sector. This ETF’s performance serves as a tangible example of the pressure the entire mining ecosystem is under. When mining companies struggle, their stock prices suffer, and ETFs like WGMI, which are designed to provide exposure to this sector, naturally reflect these downturns. Navigating the Storm: What’s Next for Bitcoin Mining? The current situation presents both challenges and potential opportunities for the Bitcoin mining industry. Here are some key aspects to consider: Consolidation: Periods of low profitability often lead to industry consolidation. Less efficient miners may be forced to shut down or be acquired by larger, more efficient operations. This can lead to a more streamlined and resilient mining sector in the long run. Technological Innovation: The pressure on miner profitability incentivizes innovation in mining hardware and energy efficiency. We may see faster adoption of next-generation ASIC miners and greater exploration of renewable energy sources to reduce operational costs. Strategic Energy Sourcing: Miners are increasingly looking for locations with abundant and cheap energy, including stranded energy sources or regions with favorable renewable energy policies. This geographical diversification can help mitigate energy price risks. Hedging Strategies: Sophisticated mining operations may employ hedging strategies to manage Bitcoin price volatility and energy cost fluctuations, providing more predictable revenue streams. Is This a Moment of Fear or Opportunity? For some Bitcoin miners , the current low hashprice environment is undoubtedly a moment of fear . The squeeze on profit margins is real, and survival depends on efficiency, access to cheap energy, and sound financial management. However, for others, particularly those with strong balance sheets and efficient operations, this period could represent an opportunity . Here’s why: Reduced Competition: As less efficient miners are forced to exit, the remaining miners may experience less competition and a potential rebound in hashprice if Bitcoin prices remain stable or increase. Acquisition Opportunities: Financially strong miners may find attractive acquisition opportunities, acquiring assets and hashrate from struggling competitors at discounted prices. Long-Term Positioning: Miners who can weather this storm and continue to operate efficiently will be well-positioned to benefit from the next Bitcoin bull market and potential future increases in hashprice . Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts and Investors Understanding the dynamics of Bitcoin miner profitability is crucial not just for miners themselves, but also for crypto enthusiasts and investors: Monitor Hashprice: Keep an eye on hashprice as a key indicator of mining health and potential pressure points in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Track Mining ETFs: Follow the performance of Bitcoin mining ETFs like WGMI to gauge investor sentiment and the overall health of the mining sector. Assess Mining Company Performance: If you are interested in investing in crypto mining, research individual mining companies, focusing on their efficiency, energy costs, and financial stability. Understand Bitcoin Fundamentals: A strong understanding of Bitcoin’s mining mechanism, difficulty adjustments, and economic incentives is essential for navigating the crypto space effectively. Conclusion: Navigating the Volatile Waters of Bitcoin Mining The current dip in hashprice to a five-year low presents significant challenges for Bitcoin miners . Rising competition, increased difficulty, lower fees, and surging energy costs are creating a perfect storm, squeezing profit margins and pushing many towards breakeven. While this situation is undoubtedly concerning, it also fosters innovation, consolidation, and strategic adaptation within the mining industry. For those who can navigate these volatile waters, the long-term prospects of Bitcoin mining, driven by the fundamental strength of Bitcoin itself, remain compelling. The coming months will be crucial in determining how the mining landscape evolves and how miners adapt to this new reality.

Rector suggests these developments may collectively signal the end of a prolonged period of market uncertainty, with specific implications for XRP. 🚨XRP Timeline Update 🚨 4/24- Ukraine Mineral Rights Deal 4/30- Q1 2025 GDP Release 4/30- 3 ProShares XRP ETF's Go LIVE 5/7- Fed Interest Rate Decision 5/13- April CPI 6/18 Fed Interest Rate Decision (Cut Likely) In addition to these events on the calendar we know the… — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) April 18, 2025 April and May Mark Critical Dates for Market Movement Rector’s timeline begins with an event scheduled for April 24, which involves a mineral rights deal in Ukraine. Although he does not elaborate on the nature of this agreement or its direct connection to digital assets, including this event in his timeline indicates that he views it as geopolitically relevant. He then highlights April 30 as a particularly active day. On that date, the U.S. government is expected to release GDP data for the first quarter of 2025. Also scheduled for April 30 is the launch of three ProShares exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to XRP. This marks the first time multiple XRP-based ETFs will begin trading simultaneously, potentially broadening access to the asset for institutional and retail investors through traditional financial platforms. Another major economic update is set for May 7, when the Federal Reserve is expected to announce its decision on interest rates. This will be followed on May 13 by the release of April’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, providing further insight into inflation trends. Interest Rate Policy and Economic Data Remain in Focus Rector also points to June 18 as a critical date, as the Federal Reserve is expected to deliver another interest rate decision, with a potential rate cut considered likely at that time. These monetary policy decisions and economic indicators, such as GDP and CPI, are key drivers in shaping investor appetite for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

He suggests a more favorable investment climate may return as the market moves past these uncertain periods. Legal Resolution and Regulatory Milestones Expected Alongside these macroeconomic events, Rector adds that several ongoing developments could influence XRP’s position in the market. He asserts that Donald Trump will continue to sign new trade agreements, though he does not cite specific deals. He also states that the legal case between the Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple is now concluding, though no exact end date was provided. Rector predicts the continued rollout of XRP-related ETFs and anticipates that stablecoin regulations will be finalized by August. The conclusion of the Ripple case could have implications for the legal classification of XRP, while new ETFs and regulatory clarity could contribute to improved investor confidence and institutional participation. Rector characterizes the current market phase as “maximum uncertainty and fear,” but he believes this period is about to end. According to him, the combination of macroeconomic events and XRP-specific milestones will usher in a renewed “risk on” environment, suggesting a return of investor confidence and speculative capital. In his concluding remarks, Rector encourages followers to “lock in” their positions, implying that the present moment may represent a favorable entry point for investors in XRP.

Across the daily, 4-hour, and 15-minute charts, XRP is forming bullish patterns supported by rising momentum. Technical indicators like Bollinger Bands and MACD are aligning, pointing toward an imminent breakout. With the price consolidating near key resistance zones, traders are watching closely for entry opportunities in both short- and mid-term positions. Daily Chart Insights On the daily chart, XRP is pressing against the Bollinger Bands’ midline, which serves as dynamic support for around $2.05. The upper band sits at $2.23, acting as the next resistance zone, while $1.87 remains the key support. The MACD is beginning to curl upward, suggesting early bullish momentum is returning. Though not yet confirmed, this MACD formation often precedes strong continuation when paired with narrowing Bollinger Bands. These signals suggest that the price is coiling and may soon expand in favor of the bulls. 4-Hour Chart Structure The 4-hour chart shows signs of steady accumulation. The price has rebounded from $1.90 and is now testing the Bollinger midline. The MACD histogram has flipped green, showing growing buyer interest. The structure resembles a forming flag or pennant, often seen before continuation moves. If XRP breaks above its short-term resistance near $2.15, a quick rally toward $2.23 could follow. This timeframe supports the idea that momentum is building underneath the daily chart’s more macro-level resistance. 15-Minute Chart Confirmation The 15-minute chart adds clarity to the bullish narrative. XRP is forming an ascending triangle—typically a bullish continuation pattern. The price is consistently setting higher lows while pressing against the $2.15 resistance. The MACD line is above the signal line, and histogram bars are extending positively. Volume is gradually rising, which adds conviction to the setup. If this triangle breaks to the upside, it would provide a strong intraday signal and confirm a higher timeframe analysis. Technical Indicators in Agreement Across all timeframes, Bollinger Bands are tightening, a precursor to volatility expansion. On shorter timeframes, MACD has already flipped bullish. The alignment of structure and indicators suggests increasing buying pressure. The convergence of price at mid-band levels and the formation of higher lows reinforce the setup for a bullish move. These signals don’t guarantee a breakout, but they offer a favorable context for a calculated position. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Environment Beyond the charts, XRP remains in a recovery phase. Market confidence is improving due to better clarity in its regulatory and institutional positioning. Ripple’s growing role in global payment infrastructure enhances the coin’s longer-term value proposition. While these factors aren’t immediate price drivers, they help sustain demand and sentiment—both crucial for trend continuation in assets like XRP. Trade Setup and Price Forecast Today’s setup provides a high-probability trading opportunity. A confirmed break above $2.15 would be a strong buy signal, ideally entered once the 15-minute candle closes above that level with volume support. From there, the first profit target (TP1) lies at $2.23, where daily resistance meets the Bollinger Band ceiling. If momentum carries, the second profit target (TP2) is $2.45, a prior supply zone. For protection, a stop-loss at $2.01 balances risk against the trade’s structure and volatility. This configuration offers a favorable risk-reward setup for both intraday and short-swing traders. Prediction For Today XRP is likely to break above the $2.15 level today, driven by consistent higher lows, strengthening MACD signals, and tightening volatility bands. If the breakout is confirmed, the price is expected to rally first toward $2.23 and possibly extend to $2.45 in the short term. This forecast is supported by synchronized signals across multiple timeframes, suggesting that the market is preparing for expansion after a period of consolidation. Traders should watch for volume-backed breakout confirmation before entering, as today’s momentum could define the week’s direction.

While the digital realm of cryptocurrency keeps us on our toes, something monumental is happening in the world of traditional assets. Gold, the age-old safe haven, is making headlines and not just trickling, but exploding to unprecedented heights. We’re talking about a new record high , folks! The spot price of gold has rocketed to a staggering $3,364.29 per ounce, with futures trading even higher at $3,375.90 per ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange. What’s fueling this golden blaze? Buckle up as we dive into the details, and it might just surprise you – it involves none other than former U.S. President Donald Trump and his ‘golden rule’. Unpacking the Record High Gold Price Surge Let’s get straight to the heart of the matter: why is gold suddenly shining brighter than ever? The surge seems to be directly linked to a rather provocative social media post by Donald Trump. In a tweet that sent ripples across financial markets, Trump declared, “Remember the golden rule of negotiating: He who has the gold makes the rules.” Now, you might be thinking, “What does a tweet have to do with gold prices?” Well, in today’s interconnected and highly sensitive markets, a statement from a figure as influential as Donald Trump can act as a significant catalyst. Here’s a breakdown of why this tweet might have triggered such a dramatic gold price increase: Psychological Impact: Trump’s statement, whether intended or not, reinforces gold’s traditional role as a store of value and power. It plays into the long-held belief that in times of uncertainty or negotiation, those holding gold have the upper hand. Market Sentiment: Such a bold declaration from a prominent political figure can sway market sentiment, especially among investors who are already considering gold as a safe haven amidst economic or geopolitical uncertainties. Fear of Inflation/Economic Instability: The phrase “He who has the gold makes the rules” can be interpreted as a nod towards potential economic instability or a shift in global power dynamics, prompting investors to flock to gold as a hedge against these risks. Essentially, Trump’s tweet acted like a match to dry tinder, igniting existing anxieties and reinforcing gold’s allure as a safe and powerful asset. This isn’t just about a simple price fluctuation; it’s a psychological play amplified by social media in the modern financial landscape. The ‘Golden Rule’ and Its Market Implications Trump’s ‘ golden rule ‘ tweet isn’t just a catchy phrase; it taps into centuries of economic and political thought where gold has held a central position. Historically, gold has been synonymous with wealth, power, and stability. Think about the gold standard, national gold reserves, and the phrase “as good as gold.” Trump’s statement re-emphasizes this historical significance, especially in the context of negotiations and power dynamics. But what are the real-world implications for investors and the broader market? Increased Investor Interest: The tweet and subsequent media coverage are likely to draw even more attention to gold as an investment . Investors seeking safe havens, especially those less familiar with the complexities of cryptocurrency, might find gold’s tangible nature and historical track record appealing. Potential for Further Price Appreciation: If the initial surge is driven by sentiment and renewed interest, it could create a self-fulfilling prophecy. As more investors buy gold, driven by the narrative of its enduring value, the price could continue to climb. Geopolitical Uncertainty Amplifier: Trump’s statement comes at a time of significant global geopolitical tensions. In such times, gold traditionally performs well as investors seek refuge from market volatility and economic uncertainties linked to international conflicts or political instability. However, it’s crucial to remember that market reactions to social media, especially political statements, can be volatile and sometimes short-lived. While the immediate impact is undeniable, the long-term sustainability of this gold rally will depend on broader economic factors and investor behavior beyond just a single tweet. Is Now the Time for Gold Investment? With gold hitting a record high and market sentiment seemingly bullish, the million-dollar question is: should you invest in gold now? There’s no straightforward answer, as every investment decision should align with individual financial goals and risk tolerance. However, let’s consider some points to help you make an informed decision: Pros of Investing in Gold Now Cons of Investing in Gold Now Safe Haven Asset: Gold is historically a reliable safe haven during economic downturns and market volatility. Inflation Hedge: Gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation, maintaining its value when fiat currencies lose purchasing power. Diversification: Adding gold to an investment portfolio can enhance diversification and reduce overall risk. Momentum: The current price surge indicates strong momentum, which could attract further investment and drive prices higher. High Entry Point: Buying at a record high means you’re entering the market when prices are already elevated, increasing the risk of a potential correction. No Yield: Unlike stocks or bonds, gold doesn’t generate income (dividends or interest). Returns are solely based on price appreciation. Volatility: While seen as stable, gold prices can still be volatile, especially in response to market sentiment and speculative trading. Storage and Security: Physical gold requires secure storage and insurance, adding to the cost of investment . Before jumping into gold investment , consider your own financial situation, risk appetite, and investment goals. Diversification is key, and while gold can be a valuable part of a balanced portfolio, it shouldn’t be the only component. Consult with a financial advisor to tailor a strategy that’s right for you. Donald Trump, Market Movers, and the Future of Gold The incident highlights the powerful influence of public figures, especially in the age of social media, on market movements. Donald Trump , even out of office, continues to be a significant market mover. His ‘ golden rule ‘ tweet, whether a calculated move or a casual remark, has demonstrably impacted the gold price . Looking ahead, the future of gold prices will depend on a complex interplay of factors: Global Economic Conditions: Economic growth, inflation rates, and interest rate policies will continue to be major drivers of gold prices. Geopolitical Events: Escalating tensions, trade wars, and political instability typically boost gold’s safe-haven appeal. Central Bank Policies: Central banks’ gold reserves and monetary policies can significantly influence gold markets. Investor Sentiment: Overall market sentiment, driven by factors like social media trends and influential figures, can create short-term volatility and long-term trends. While Trump’s tweet provided an immediate catalyst, the underlying fundamentals of supply, demand, economic stability, and investor confidence will ultimately determine the long-term trajectory of gold prices. Keep a close watch on these broader economic indicators and geopolitical developments to understand where gold might be headed next. Conclusion: Gold’s Golden Moment – Hype or Sustainable Surge? The record high gold prices are undoubtedly grabbing attention. Fueled by Donald Trump ’s ‘ golden rule ‘ tweet, the surge underscores gold’s enduring appeal as a safe-haven asset in uncertain times. Whether this is a fleeting moment of hype or the start of a sustained bull run remains to be seen. For investors, it’s a reminder of gold’s role in portfolio diversification and its potential as a hedge against economic turbulence. However, as with any investment , due diligence, understanding your risk tolerance, and considering long-term financial goals are paramount before diving into the golden glow.

With RSI weak and price trending far from its $4,891 ATH, ETH may remain range-bound. If support at $1,600 fails, a further downside is likely. That being said, recovery depends on renewed buying interest and reclaiming $1,700–$1,750 in the coming month. Ethereum Price Prediction 2025 The Ethereum blockchain network will be launching the PECTRA upgrade soon. This upgrade merges two previously planned updates—Prague and Electra—into a comprehensive enhancement.

Considering the market sentiments, the average price could settle at around $3,392.

The cryptocurrency rose more than 3%, erasing most of the losses triggered earlier this month following Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff declaration that had sent shockwaves through global markets. The jump came as the dollar weakened and US stock futures dipped, with traders reacting to comments made by National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett on Friday. Trump’s Inquiry Into Firing Powell Fuels Dollar Slide and Market Anxiety Hassett said Trump is exploring whether he can legally dismiss Powell , raising fresh doubts over the Fed’s political independence. A key gauge of the dollar dropped to its lowest level since Jan. 2024, reflecting the broader unease. Bitcoin’s rebound was accompanied by a similar move in gold, which climbed to a new record high. Both assets are widely seen as hedges against inflation and systemic risk, and their gains suggest investors are increasingly positioning for potential instability in traditional markets. Trump has repeatedly clashed with Powell over interest rates and the direction of monetary policy. While the law does not allow a sitting president to fire the Fed chair without cause, a pending Supreme Court case concerning presidential authority over independent agencies has brought the issue back into focus. A ruling in Trump’s favor could raise the likelihood of political interference in central banking. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett on Friday said President Donald Trump and his team were continuing to study if they could fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, a sign that such a move, a matter of great consequence for the central bank's… https://t.co/JN9lImo3Xl pic.twitter.com/uXCcjGRhu5 — Reuters (@Reuters) April 19, 2025 Sen. Elizabeth Warren, speaking to CNBC, recently warned that any move to remove Powell could have far-reaching consequences. “If Chairman Powell can be fired by the President of the United States, it will crash the markets in the United States,” she said. Warren, a longtime critic of Powell, said she nonetheless supports his continued tenure in order to protect the institutional independence of the central bank. Bitcoin Breaks Out as Price Rebounds Sharply From April Low Bitcoin’s momentum continued to build as it reclaimed key technical levels. Himanshu Maradiya, founder of CIFDAQ Group, said the asset had bounced back strongly from its April 20 low. It rose more than $3,000 in a single day. The move marked a 16% recovery from its 2025 low of under $75,000. “Bitcoin is breaking out, reclaiming the $87,000 mark after recovering from its early April slump,” Maradiya said, pointing to renewed bullish momentum and a potential run toward the $90,000 to $94,000 range. He added that the current rally had defied expectations of a pullback over Easter and suggested broader strength across the crypto market.

While concerns about the coin’s long-term viability continue to grow, several analysts remain positive about its future. Despite recent price dips and community frustration, Pi Network is showing surprising strength , according to long-time analyst and early supporter Dr Altcoin. Known for his steady support and honest feedback on the Pi project, Dr Altcoin says he’s never been more confident in Pi’s future than he is today. Why Pi Coin Didn’t Crash To $0.30? Over the past few months, Pi faced a tough challenge : a massive wave of token unlocks that many feared would send prices crashing. Dr Altcoin himself warned that Pi could fall to $0.30 if the team didn’t act. And yes, after unlocks began, the price slipped from $0.70 to around $0.60—but then something unexpected happened. Instead of collapsing, the price held. The reason? The Pi Core Team quietly stepped in with a supply-absorbing strategy to manage the influx of tokens hitting centralized exchanges . It worked. The price stabilized. For many, this was the clearest signal yet that Pi isn’t just another overhyped crypto—it’s built to last. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Network News: 5.6M Pi Tokens Set to Unlock Today, Analyst Eyes $5 Surge , Can Pi Coin Hit $314? Still, not everything is perfect. The Pi community remains disappointed with the current price and, perhaps more importantly, with the lack of updates from the Core Team. But Pi’s continued presence among the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market cap speaks volumes about its staying power and the strength of its user base. Dr Altcoin, whose Pi-related posts have reached nearly 40 million people worldwide, believes the project is just getting started. In fact, he’s doubling down on his prediction: Pi reaching $314 within the next five years. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Starting with dual VM support, the goal is improved scalability, prover efficiency, and overall execution simplicity for Ethereum.

43612106,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=25068,1745221591,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/99/default.png,“Bitcoin là tài sản độc nhất vô nhị mà mọi quy tắc của nó đều dựa vào toán học.” – Paolo Ardoino,https://blog.bitfinex.com/uncategorized/bitcoin-la-tai-san-doc-nhat-vo-nhi-ma-moi-quy-tac-cua-no-deu-dua-vao-toan-hoc-paolo-ardoino/,"CTO Bitfinex – Paolo Ardoino hé lộ tầm nhìn về cuộc cách mạng tài chính phi tập trung cùng Bitcoin News trong bài phỏng vấn vừa qua. và lý do tại sao Tự do tài chính lại là trọng tâm trong sứ mệnh của Bitfinex. “Tia lửa” Bitcoin: Năm 2012, Ardoino “say nắng” Bitcoin vì ý tưởng trao quyền tự quản lý tài sản cho mọi người, đặc biệt là hàng tỷ người chưa có tài khoản ngân hàng. “Một cuộc cách mạng tài chính toàn cầu!” Triết lý “tự do”: Bitcoin là cam kết về tự do tài chính, phi tập trung và trao quyền kiểm soát tài sản cá nhân. Ardoino hiện thực hóa điều này bằng cách phát triển công nghệ P2P an toàn, minh bạch. Thành công = Ứng dụng thực tế: Thành công của Bitcoin không nằm ở giá mà ở việc người dân tin dùng nó hơn tiền tệ truyền thống. “Bitcoin được quản lý bởi toán học, không phải chính sách! Tính ngang hàng (P2P) mới là cuộc cách mạng!” Giáo dục là chìa khóa để mọi người hiểu được giá trị cốt lõi của Bitcoin. Sáng tạo lớn nhất của Bitfinex: Tiềm năng sáng tạo của Bitfinex nằm ở việc xây dựng các công cụ giúp chủ quyền tài chính trở nên thiết thực và có thể mở rộng. Điều này có nghĩa là tiếp tục đẩy mạnh giới hạn về hiệu suất, bảo mật và tính mở – không chỉ dành cho trader, mà còn cho các nhà phát triển, nhà sáng tạo và cộng đồng. Chúng tôi không chỉ là một nền tảng giao dịch. Bitfinex đang phát triển thành một stack công nghệ tài chính hiệu suất cao – từ API cực nhanh cho trader lập trình đến các giao thức P2P giúp giao tiếp và kết nối tự do. Một lĩnh vực tôi đặc biệt hứng thú là tích hợp cơ sở hạ tầng P2P để xây dựng khả năng phục hồi ở những khu vực mà quyền truy cập vào công cụ tài chính truyền thống bị hạn chế hoặc đe dọa. Đó là nơi sáng tạo thực sự xảy ra – ở ranh giới, nơi công nghệ gặp nhu cầu hàng ngày của con người. Cho dù là kích hoạt thanh toán vi mô qua Lightning hay xây dựng giao thức chống kiểm duyệt thông qua các dự án như Holepunch, trọng tâm của chúng tôi là mở rộng quyền truy cập, không chỉ thanh khoản. “Maximalist” có chọn lọc: Ardoino tin Bitcoin là độc nhất, “ngôi sao phương Bắc” nhưng không loại trừ các công nghệ khác nếu chúng phục vụ con người và phù hợp với tinh thần phi tập trung, tự chủ. Thu Hẹp Khoảng Cách: Bitcoin không chỉ về giá mà về nguyên tắc chống lại sự mờ ám và kiểm duyệt. “Khả năng phục hồi, quyền riêng tư, phi tập trung là nền tảng!” Cân bằng “tinh thần Bitcoin” và Web3/DeFi: Tinh thần cốt lõi của Bitcoin là “kim chỉ nam”. Bitfinex tiếp cận công nghệ mới dựa trên lăng kính các nguyên tắc của Bitcoin: tăng cường tự do và khả năng phục hồi cá nhân. Cộng đồng xây dựng giá trị: Những mối quan hệ giá trị nhất là với những người xây dựng, giáo dục và bảo vệ các giá trị cốt lõi của Bitcoin bằng hành động thực tế. Lộ trình Bitfinex – Hướng đến tổ chức: Tập trung củng cố cơ sở hạ tầng cho các quỹ đầu tư và tổ chức lớn, đáp ứng nhu cầu về độ tin cậy, tốc độ và tuân thủ. Lời khuyên cho người mới: Tập trung xây dựng giá trị thật: Đóng góp bằng mã nguồn, giáo dục, cải thiện dự án, giải quyết vấn đề thực tế. “Đừng chạy theo ‘hype’, hãy hòa mình vào nhịp điệu bền bỉ của Bitcoin.” Di sản: Góp phần làm Bitcoin dễ tiếp cận hơn: Ardoino không cần tên tuổi, chỉ mong đóng góp vào việc xây dựng hệ thống giúp Bitcoin hữu ích hơn cho mọi người. Câu hỏi cho Satoshi: Nếu Ardoino có thể quay ngược thời gian và hỏi Satoshi một câu hỏi, có lẽ đó sẽ là: “Ông có ngờ rằng mình sắp châm ngòi một cuộc cách mạng tài chính không?” Bởi vì đó chính xác là những gì Bitcoin đang là – bằng chứng cho thấy rằng con người có thể lật đổ trạng thái của nền tài chính hiện tại và mang lại sự cân bằng và khả năng phục hồi mà nền kinh tế toàn cầu của chúng ta đang rất cần. Đây mới chỉ là khởi đầu. Đó là toàn bộ cuộc phỏng vấn của Paolo Ardoino, CTO Bitfinex & CEO Tether. —- Đừng quên theo dõi cộng đồng Bitfinex Vietnam tại Telegram , Twitter & Facebook để cập nhập các bài viết, thông tin & sự kiện sớm nhất nhé!

On the daily timeframe, the price has broken above the mid-Bollinger Band (20 SMA) at $83,061 and is now testing the upper band at $88,326. This breakout signals a shift from range-bound behavior to upward continuation. After weeks of consolidation between $77,000 and $84,000, this push suggests a potential trend reversal. The daily MACD has confirmed a bullish crossover with rising histogram bars, indicating increasing upside momentum. 4-Hour Chart Analysis The 4-hour chart reinforces the bullish structure. BTC has broken above $85,000 resistance, forming higher lows and a clean uptrend. The Bollinger Bands are widening, showing volatility is returning. The 20-period SMA now acts as a dynamic support. The MACD shows strong bullish momentum, with both the MACD line and signal line trending upward and separated, confirming sustained buying interest. Price is comfortably holding above the breakout zone, strengthening the case for more upside toward $88,000 and beyond. Short-Term Insight from the 15-Minute Chart The 15-minute timeframe shows a precise breakout of an ascending triangle pattern formed below $86,000. The breakout was accompanied by increased volume, and the price is now consolidating above the previous resistance, turning it into support. The MACD remains bullish with no signs of weakening. Bollinger Bands are expanding, reflecting continued volatility. The clean structure and consolidation above resistance indicate bullish continuation is likely in the short term, offering intraday traders strong confirmation of trend strength. Indicators Confirming Bullish Strength Across all timeframes, indicators align with the bullish narrative. Bollinger Bands are expanding on the daily and intraday charts, signaling rising volatility in favor of the bulls. The MACD on all three timeframes—daily, 4-hour, and 15-minute—displays clear bullish crossovers. Price has reclaimed the 20-period SMA as support at every level, turning previous resistance zones into new support levels. These signals collectively strengthen confidence in the current uptrend’s reliability. Macro Factors Behind the Move Beyond technical, Bitcoin’s rally is supported by positive sentiment in the broader market. Institutional flows are picking up again, and increasing expectations around the next halving cycle are influencing long-term investor behavior. This fundamental backdrop supports the technical breakout, helping build the momentum behind today’s price action. Confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a store of value amid fiat uncertainty is also providing a floor for demand. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Entry, Profit Targets, and Risk Management Today’s price structure offers a favorable setup for bullish entries . A strategic entry is between $86,800 and $87,200, especially on a retest of the breakout zone. Take-Profit 1 (TP1) is $88,300, which coincides with the upper Bollinger Band on the daily chart. Take-Profit 2 (TP2) is set at $91,500, a key resistance from March. A conservative stop-loss below $83,000 offers strong protection in case of a false breakout, sitting just below the daily mid-band support. This setup delivers an attractive risk-reward profile for both intraday and swing traders. Price Projection For Today Bitcoin is likely to continue its bullish momentum today. With the breakout confirmed across multiple timeframes and indicators all aligned, the price could reach the $88,300 level soon. If volume persists and bulls defend key support at $86,800, a run toward $91,500 is possible within the next 24 to 48 hours. The structure is strong, and no immediate bearish divergence or exhaustion signs are visible. For today, the bias remains bullish with a clear path toward higher levels, supported by both price action and momentum indicators.

43611435,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=150999,1745221828,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Exciting ZORA Token Launch: Revolutionizing the NFT Marketplace on April 23rd,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/zora-token-launch-nft-marketplace/,"Get ready, NFT enthusiasts! The buzz is real as Zora, the popular NFT marketplace, has officially announced the launch of its native token, ZORA Token , slated for April 23rd. This move is poised to inject fresh energy into the platform and the wider Web3 ecosystem. Are you curious to know what this revolutionary development means for you and the future of NFTs? Let’s dive deep into the details of this highly anticipated launch. What is Zora and Why a Token Now? For those new to the space, Zora is not just another NFT marketplace. It’s a protocol designed for creators and communities. Zora emphasizes open and permissionless systems, empowering creators with more control over their work and its distribution. Think of it as a decentralized infrastructure for NFTs, allowing anyone to build on top of it, create their own marketplaces, or integrate NFTs into their applications. So, why introduce a ZORA Token Launch now? Here’s a breakdown of the likely reasons and benefits: Decentralization and Governance: A native token often signifies a move towards greater decentralization.

Here is the Latest Purchase Amount,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/japanese-investment-firm-continues-to-buy-bitcoin-as-bitcoin-price-rises-here-is-the-latest-purchase-amount/,"Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has added another 330 Bitcoin (BTC) to its treasury, bringing its total holdings to 4,855 BTC, worth more than $420 million at current market prices. The move comes as Bitcoin has recovered losses from the previous week to rise above $87,300. Metaplanet Adds 330 BTC, Bringing Its Assets Above $420 Million as Bitcoin Surpasses $87K The latest purchase marks Metaplanet’s third BTC purchase this month, solidifying its position as the 10th largest publicly traded Bitcoin holder worldwide. The company's aggressive buildup comes amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, including investor concerns over U.S. trade policy and global market instability. Bitcoin’s rally stands in sharp contrast to the market’s volatility, which began earlier this month when President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff proposals triggered a dramatic sell-off that wiped $5.4 trillion from U.S. stocks in two days. While the Nasdaq fell 11%, Bitcoin's decline was relatively modest at 6%, reinforcing its growing perception as a digital safe haven. Metaplanet is not alone in deepening its exposure to bitcoin. Last week, Japanese fashion retailer ANAP Holdings announced that it had purchased approximately 16.66 BTC worth around 200 million yen (about $1.4 million). The crypto assets will be managed by its subsidiary ANAP Lightning Capital, which adopts a transparent approach by conducting quarterly market value assessments and reporting gains or losses in its financial statements. ANAP also shared a new performance metric called BTC Yield, which measures bitcoin growth per fully diluted share. The company reported a quarter-to-date BTC return of 12.1%, following a staggering 95% return in the previous quarter. *This is not investment advice.

13334158,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/cryptocurrency-vs-stocks-key-differences-explained,1745222100,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,Crypto vs. traditional stocks and bonds: What’s the difference?,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/cryptocurrency-vs-stocks-key-differences-explained?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Crypto, stocks and bonds: Are they the same? When you dive into investing, you’ll find three frequently utilized investment options: Crypto is the risky thrill-seeker’s choice, stocks offer a middle ground with growth potential, and bonds are for those who prefer a steadier, more predictable path. While both stocks and crypto offer growth potential, regulation makes stock market investments more structured and predictable, and crypto aims for decentralization and remains less regulated. Crypto Cryptocurrency is a digital currency built on blockchain technology , a decentralized, transparent and secure system that records all transactions. No entity, such as a bank, directly controls it. Crypto is known for massive swings — big gains (and losses) can happen fast, making it exciting for those who want to play the high-risk game. Although cryptocurrency has been available for a while, its adoption has surged in recent years, gaining traction among retail investors, institutions and even some governments. Cryptocurrency is not universally regulated and can be accessed through various channels, including crypto exchanges, brokers, ATMs and fintech apps. Stocks Stocks represent ownership in a company — when you buy a stock, you’re purchasing a share of that business. If the company performs well and earns profits, shareholders may benefit through dividends and capital gains. On the flip side, poor performance or negative market sentiment can lead to losses. Stocks are typically regulated by government agencies, such as the US Securities and Exchange Commission, making them generally less risky than cryptocurrencies. However, they are still influenced by factors such as company performance, market conditions, economic trends and global events — making them potentially volatile. You can purchase stocks through traditional stock exchanges (like the NYSE or Nasdaq) or online brokerage platforms. Bonds Bonds are essentially loans that investors give to governments or companies. In exchange, the issuer pays regular interest over a set period and returns the full loan amount — known as the principal — when the bond reaches its maturity date, which can range from a few months to 30 years. Bonds are often considered less volatile than stocks, making them a popular choice for conservative investors. However, they are not without risks. Rising interest rates can lower a bond’s market value, inflation can erode purchasing power, and corporate bonds carry the risk of default if the issuer experiences financial trouble. The trade-off for this relative stability is usually lower returns, which may not appeal to those seeking high-growth investments. Bonds are regulated financial instruments and can typically be purchased through brokers or directly from government agencies. Is crypto more profitable compared to stocks and bonds? While crypto can offer diversification benefits, its relationship with traditional assets is complex and evolving. For instance, ​in 2024, Bitcoin ( BTC ), the most popular cryptocurrency, demonstrated remarkable profitability, achieving a 121% return and outperforming traditional assets like the Nasdaq 100, which gained 25.6%, and the S&P 500, which rose by 25%. Gold also saw a significant increase of 26.7%, while US large-cap stocks experienced a 24.9% gain. Bonds, on the other hand, offered a more modest return: The 10-year US Treasury bond, known for its fixed interest payments, ended the year with a yield of approximately 4.57%. Historically, Bitcoin has exhibited a low correlation with the S&P 500, averaging 0.17 over the past decade. However, this correlation has fluctuated, reaching as high as 0.75 before declining toward zero in early 2025, indicating periods of both alignment and independence from traditional markets. Tariff fallout: Which is more profitable now — Crypto, stocks or bonds? The tariffs introduced by US President Donald Trump on April 2, 2025, have had an unprecedented impact on both traditional and crypto markets. But the effects have followed the above pattern consistently — stocks experienced a sharp price reduction. According to the Guardian, the Nasdaq Composite entered a bear market by the close of trading on April 3, falling more than 20% below its most recent peak on Dec. 16, 2024. In the meantime, European indexes such as the FTSE 100 fell over 11%, and the S&P 500 dropped at least 12% since the introduction of tariffs. Crypto had an even stronger downturn, which was once seen as a hedge against market volatility but has not been immune. Bitcoin’s price dropped by over 6% and Ether’s ( ETH ) by more than 12% within 24 hours of the tariff announcement, as global markets reacted with fear. The unpredictability of tariff policies contributes to market jitters, affecting all asset classes, from stocks to bonds and crypto, in unique ways. Bonds have experienced only a small return rate increase, given that a higher return means a lower price for a bond. According to CNBC, in response to President Trump’s tariff announcements, global bond yields sharply dropped as investors sought safe havens amid stock market turmoil. For example, Germany’s 10-year bond yield fell from 2.72% to below 2.6%, and US Treasury yields also hit their lowest levels in months, signaling heightened demand for government debt, though economists warn this rally may not be sustainable if inflation concerns persist. Trading and investing in crypto, stocks and bonds: What sets them apart? All asset classes — crypto vs. traditional investments — involve identifying patterns, but the timeframes, dynamics and tactics differ significantly. Crypto and stock trading share similar patterns, like sensitivity to macroeconomic trends and technical patterns, but their market structures contrast sharply. Stock markets operate within set hours, such as the NYSE’s hours of 9:30 am–4:30 pm ET, while crypto markets run 24/7. Bonds are typically traded during regular market hours, similar to stocks, but the exact trading hours can depend on the type of bond, such as Treasurys or corporate issues. Crypto trading involves pairs using common tokens like Bitcoin or Ether as base currencies, while stocks are typically bought with fiat, and bonds are traded in fixed denominations, often with a minimum investment threshold. Liquidity issues can affect all three: Crypto can face challenges with small-cap tokens , stocks with micro-cap companies and bonds with less-traded long-term or corporate issues. Timeframes for market patterns highlight further distinctions. Crypto market patterns thrive on short-term volatility, demanding rapid decisions and frequent trades, while stock patterns often track longer-term trends tied to company performance and broader economic cycles. Bonds move the slowest, with price shifts driven primarily by interest rates, and offer stable, predictable patterns. Price drivers also set them apart. Crypto values hinge on market trends, adoption and utility; stocks rely on company fundamentals, research and earnings; and bonds depend on interest rate movements and issuer creditworthiness, prioritizing stability over growth. Entry barrier to crypto, stocks and bonds Stock issuance is governed by company laws, blockchain protocols with hard caps control crypto supply, and bonds are issued based on creditworthiness. To invest in stocks and bonds, you generally need to be at least 18 years old and have a brokerage account to invest in the stock and bond markets. Some stocks may require a higher income or level of experience, while most stocks only allow accredited or wealthy investors to participate. Buying stocks and bonds means going through regulated brokers and exchanges. Crypto, on the other hand, lets you jump in with just a wallet — no intermediary, no paperwork. Centralized crypto exchanges require Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, but decentralized platforms let you trade freely with only your private keys. Did you know? Stocks represent company equity with dividends; crypto represents digital assets with varying uses; and bonds are loans offering fixed-interest payments. Regulatory differences between crypto, stocks and bonds While stocks and bonds follow strict rules, crypto is still figuring things out, making buying, selling, holding and taxes a whole different experience. In most countries, investing in stocks and bonds is legal and regulated. Still, some governments, like North Korea and Cuba, impose strict restrictions or outright bans on private investment in these assets. Crypto faces a patchwork of regulations worldwide, ranging from full bans in countries like China and Egypt to partial restrictions in places like India, where regulations limit banking support but don’t outlaw trading. Meanwhile, crypto-friendly nations like El Salvador embrace digital assets with clear legal frameworks and government support. Holding stocks and bonds is straightforward. The shares sit safely with a brokerage, and bonds pay you interest at fixed intervals. Holding crypto, however, comes with risks. You can self-custody in a wallet , but if you lose your private keys , your funds are gone forever. If you keep crypto on an exchange, there’s always a risk of hacks or platform failures. Taxes add another layer of complexity. Stocks and bonds typically fall under capital gains and dividend tax rules, with clear guidelines based on how long you’ve held them. Crypto tax laws vary widely by country. Some countries treat it like property, others like a commodity, and a few don’t tax it at all. Keeping track of every transaction is crucial, as even swapping one crypto for another can be taxable. Crypto vs. stocks vs. bonds: Which one should you buy in 2025? Choosing between crypto, stocks and bonds in 2025 depends on your personality, risk appetite and financial goals. If you love the adrenaline and believe in the future of decentralized finance (DeFi) , then a crypto-focused portfolio might be for you. For example, a high-risk, high-reward portfolio could be 70% crypto, 20% stocks and 10% bonds. If you prefer a more structured approach but still want growth, stocks balance risk and return. A portfolio, for instance, with 60% stocks, 30% crypto and 10% bonds could give exposure to innovation while keeping things grounded. For those who sleep better knowing their money is safe, bonds provide stability.

Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) is showing strong bullish momentum as it’s currently on the verge of breaking out of the falling wedge formation and trading above the key moving averages — including 20-day Exponential Moving Average, 9-day Simple Moving Average, and 50-day Simple Moving Average. After reaching its all-time high of $35.02 on 21 December, HYPE price price entered a downtrend, carving out a falling wedge formation. The price bottomed near $9 on April 7, touching the wedge’s lower trendline before then bouncing and testing the previous resistance at around $17.30. Since then, it has climbed above all major moving averages, including SMA 9, EMA 20 and, SMA 50. The 20 EMA and 50 SMA just had a bullish cross, signaling trend reversal. The RSI is currently sitting at 63.51, indicating that bullish momentum is picking up. MACD also shows bullish crossover, with both lines above zero. Source: TradingView You might also like: Hyperliquid token: inverse head & shoulders signals a potential rally towards $25 If HYPE holds above $18, the next major resistance lies at the psychological $20 level, which also aligns with the zone where the price was supported multiple times throughout January and February until it broke lower in early March. Once $20 is cleared, the next key resistance to watch is around $26 — where the upper trendline meets with the lower high that formed in mid February. If the wedge breakout is confirmed and the price holds above $18 with increasing volume, a longer-term target of $35 becomes possible — aligning with the origin of the upper trendline of the falling wedge. The bullish thesis would be invalidated if HYPE fails to hold above the $18 support zone, especially on increasing sell volume. A breakdown back below the 50-day SMA and 20-day EMA would suggest a loss of momentum and could open the door for a retest of the $17.30 level or even a move back toward the wedge’s lower trendline near $12–$13.

The price could hit a high of $3.99 in 2025. XRP Price Today: XRP value has surged 3.04% in 24 hours to $2.12. In the latest update on the Ripple vs SEC case, Attorney Fred Rispoli has provided an updated timeline for the SEC v. Ripple case. He stated that the necessary documentation had already been produced following Alderoty’s declaration, and they are now awaiting a vote by the SEC Commission, which is expected in 30 days. Following this, the SEC will file a motion to lift the injunction, which Ripple will not contest. Once the judge signs off, the case will be finalized, most likely within 60 days. Coming to the expenses, which Ripple will be bearing, the case will be settled with a $50 Million payout to the SEC. That being said, we can expect the process to expedite, as Paul Atkins has given a positive statement in a recent speech about cryptocurrencies. Talking about the XRP price, it is up by 3.04% to $2.12. If the bullish momentum kicks in, XRP could aim at its resistance level of $2.15. On the flip side, if it loses out on steam, the XRP price could take a plunge to $2.04. Our XRP price prediction will explore the potential answers to questions such as “Will XRP reach $10 in 2025?” by providing short-term and long-term Ripple (XRP) price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 2.12775011 2.81% Market cap $ 124,248,196,353.62 Circulating Supply 58,394,167,593.00 Trading Volume $ 2,332,058,256.0061 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Crypto Price Prediction May 2025 XRP price has been currently trading at $2.12, around its resistance at $2.14, with RSI at 51, and price above the 9-day SMA. A sustained momentum above $2.20 could trigger an uptrend toward the $2.50 mark. That being said, weakening volumes could bring the price down to $2. XRP Price Prediction May 2025 XRP Price Prediction 2025 The SEC believes that XRP can help release funds stuck in the U.S. Nostro accounts, which can then be used to buy more Bitcoins. There is more positive news for Ripple, as they have integrated their stablecoin RLUSD into their cross-border payments network: Ripple Payments . Moreover, JP Morgan Chase has approved XRP for use within its banking payment framework. If things go in favor of Ripple, the XRP price could surge to a maximum of $5.81 by the end of 2025. In contrast, if the lawsuit continues, XRP could remain in a narrow range with a potential low of $2.3. That being said, we can expect an average price of $4.89. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.6 6.25 8.64 2027 7.15 8.89 12.25 2028 11.3 14.11 16.53 2029 13.98 16.48 21.12 2030 16.92 19.87 26.97 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP price will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.64 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum XRP price will be around $5.6, with an average trading price of $6.25. This could be a result of Ripple’s role in CBDC development and XRP’s rising institutional demand. XRP Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP’s price will range between $7.15 to $12.25. XRP price might record an average level of $8.89. The reason behind this surge could be due to Ripple’s increasing domination in the payment sector, accelerating XRP’s buying demand and utility. XRP Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases, including new dApps and announcements regarding XRP. This might boost the dominance of XRP as the second-largest altcoin by market cap. We expect the XRP price to range between $11.3 to $16.53. The average trading price could be around $14.11. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The altcoin might record a trading range between $13.98 to $21.12, with an average price of $16.48. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The long-term XRP price prediction depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the XRP price could scale between $16.92 to $26.97. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.87.

The intraday rally added more than $3,000 to the asset in less than 24 hours, erasing a substantial portion of April’s drawdown. While the single‑day appreciation of about 4% is not unprecedented for the notoriously volatile asset, the backdrop that accompanied Monday’s advance has market participants treating the move with extra significance. Why Is Bitcoin Up Today? The most immediate macro‑economic thread was the sell‑off in the US dollar after National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told reporters on Friday that US President Donald Trump intends to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The dollar index (DXY) slipped to 98.182 on Monday, while capital rotated simultaneously into traditional safe‑haven gold. Spot gold climbed to a new high at $3,385 per ounce, extending its 2025 gain to 28%. In contrast, S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures traded about 0.5% lower. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Largest Holders Are Stacking Again — What It Means For The Market Observers seized on the divergence between Bitcoin and risk‑asset benchmarks. Financial author Mel Mattison wrote on X that he is “seeing more evidence tonight of BTC breaking its strong risk‑on/QQQ correlation,” recalling his January thesis that “this is the year BTC breaks that correlation and starts trading more in sympathy with gold.” Apollo founder Thomas Fahrer reached a similar conclusion: “Bitcoin is pumping while stock futures are trading down. It’s almost like the market is treating it like it’s an alternative financial system or something.” The Kobeissi Letter described the alignment between the two hard‑asset narratives as notable because “Gold has hit its 55th all‑time high in 12 months and Bitcoin is officially joining the run, now above $87,000.” In a follow‑up post, the macro newsletter argued that both assets are “telling us that a weaker US Dollar and more uncertainty are on the way,” crediting part of gold’s strength to President Trump’s publication of a “non‑tariff cheating” list from Sunday that targets currency manipulation, export subsidies and other forms of perceived economic aggression. Related Reading: Crypto Gurus Predict Bitcoin Boom ‘In Days’—But Expert Urges Caution The renewal of trade‑policy anxiety capped a three‑day Easter weekend that had failed, in the words of Kobeissi, to deliver “the trade deals the market priced‑in last week.” Trump’s ninety‑day “reciprocal tariff” pause still has seventy‑nine days remaining, and market sentiment appears increasingly sceptical that a sweeping accord will materialise in that window. Nonetheless, FOX Business correspondent Charles Gasparino reported on Sunday that a Wall Street executive “with ties to the Trump White House” believes Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is “close to announcing a significant trade deal, likely to be with Japan,” while cautioning that negotiations remain fluid. Bitcoin Price Breaks Out Against the macro backdrop, chart technicians pointed to an important structural break on the daily Bitcoin chart. Trader Scott Melker observed that the spot rate is now “breaking through descending resistance from the all‑time high” and must clear $88,804 to invalidate the series of lower highs and lower lows. The account @ChartingGuy highlighted $94,000—the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement of the entire drawdown—as the “minimum target on this rally,” adding that market behaviour at that level will determine whether the current impulse proves a mere relief bounce or the beginning of a more sustained advance. Meanwhile, crypto analyst IncomeSharks warned: “Nice to see the downtrend breakout but the timing is important. Sunday is not a day to celebrate a low volume pump while stock markets are closed. If you want to see a bullish moves lets see stocks open red tomorrow and keep this candle green. Then we can have fun.” At press time, BTC traded at $87,509.

President Donald Trump continues to stir controversy, and his actions have prompted rare and pointed criticism from three of his predecessors from the Democratic Party. Obama commends universities holding out against Trump On April 3, 2025, Former President Barack Obama spoke at Hamilton College in New York. The 44th President urged universities and other institutions to push back against the Trump administration’s demands. At another function on April 15, Obama also condemned Trump for cutting off the $2.3B federal funding for Harvard University. Obama referred to the decision as “unlawful and ham handed.” The Ivy League school was asked to shut down its diversity, equity and inclusion programs, which were referred to as civil rights violations. They were also charged with cracking down on antisemitism. The funds were frozen after the school refused. Obama praised Harvard for setting an example for other institutions to resist federal pressure on its operations and practices. During his speech in upstate New York, Obama urged those with the resources to take a stand. “It is up to all of us to fix this,” he said. “It’s not going to be because somebody comes and saves you. The most important office in this democracy is the citizen, the ordinary person who says, ‘No, that’s not right.’” Biden and Clinton have been vocal While neither former president explicitly named Donald Trump, they both made their thoughts about the president’s actions and their effects on the American people known. In Chicago on Tuesday, speaking at the national conference of Advocates, Counselors and Representatives for the Disabled, Biden criticized Elon Musk’s DOGE cuts to Social Security. This event was the former president’s first significant public appearance since he left office. He accused the administration of endangering the benefits of 73 million seniors by cutting jobs at the Social Security Administration. “In fewer than 100 days, this administration has caused so much damage and destruction. It’s breathtaking,” the former president said to a crowd of about 200 attendees. “They’re shooting first and aiming later. The result is a lot of needless pain and sleepless nights.” Clinton on the other hand did not criticize the president’s administration directly. Instead, he commended the service of federal workers, who Trump is trying to put out of work at the moment. He spoke at a ceremony in Oklahoma City dedicated to the 168 victims of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building bombing. During his speech, the ex-president made a case for humility, stating: “It does you good every now and then to admit you’re wrong.” According to historians, ex-presidents do not typically comment publicly on their successor’s government due to the American tradition of seamless handovers and the principle that the country is run by one president at a time. Three presidents commenting on Trump in such a short period of time is unprecedented and also sets off warning bells, as no one is more qualified to spot issues in governance than those who have occupied the seat in the past.

BNB Price Hit $600,https://coinpedia.org/uncategorized/bnb-chain-becomes-the-top-choice-for-usdt-users-bnb-price-hit-600/,"The post BNB Chain Becomes the Top Choice for USDT Users! BNB Price Hit $600 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Binance BNB Chain is quietly stealing the spotlight. Over the past month, it has become the number one choice for people using USDT (Tether), the world’s most popular stablecoin. With nearly 12 million active wallets, BNB Chain has now taken the lead from other big players like TRON and Ethereum. So, why are so many people moving to BNB Chain? Let’s break it down. BNB Chain Hit 12M Active USDT Addresses According to recent data from CryptoRank, about 31.1 million wallets used USDT across different blockchains in the last 30 days. BNB Chain hits 12M active USDT addresses In the last 30 days, @BNBCHAIN recorded 12M active $USDT addresses, while the total number of unique active $USDT addresses across all chains reached 31.1M. Together, @BNBCHAIN and @trondao account for 74% (23.2M) of all active $USDT … pic.twitter.com/gtmnTjywKg — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) April 20, 2025 Out of all these, BNB Chain led the way with nearly 12 million active addresses, more than any other network. This shows that more people are choosing BNB Chain for their everyday transactions. It’s fast, has low fees, and is easy to use—exactly what users want when sending or receiving stablecoins like USDT. TRON came in second with 11.2 million active addresses, which is still a big number. TRON has always been a popular choice for stablecoin transfers. Polygon followed with 2.6 million active wallets, and Ethereum came next with 1.8 million. Even though Ethereum used to be the top network, its high fees and slower transactions are pushing users toward cheaper and faster options. Solana and Arbitrum saw under 1 million active addresses each, showing they’re growing but still behind the leaders. BNB Quarterly Token Burn Along with its rise in USDT activity, BNB Chain has also completed its 31st token burn. In this round, 1.57 million BNB tokens were removed from circulation, worth about $916 million. This burn is part of BNB’s plan to slowly cut down its total supply and make the token more valuable over time. Right now, the total supply of BNB is around 139.3 million, with over 40 million tokens still left to burn. BNB Price Outlook Looking at the BNB price, it is trading around $604 , showing a small 2% rise as big investors continue buying during market ups and downs. Even though the price is holding steady, the overall market trend for BNB looks neutral for now. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is at 48.57, which means the token isn’t showing strong signs of going up or down yet. However, if the RSI moves above 50, it could be a sign that buyers are slowly gaining control, and BNB might be ready for a stronger move.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|TRADING|USDT|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-21 08:06:53
43612055,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=151004,1745223033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Dire Setback: India’s Supreme Court Rejects WazirX Hack Victims Amid Crypto Regulation Void,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/supreme-court-rejects-wazirx-hack/,"In a shocking turn of events for cryptocurrency investors in India, the Supreme Court has dismissed a petition filed by victims of the massive WazirX hack that occurred in July 2024. This decision, citing the absence of clear India crypto regulation , has sent ripples through the Indian crypto community, leaving many questioning the future of digital asset protection in the country. Supreme Court’s Stance on WazirX Hack: A Regulatory Gap Justices BR Gavai and Augustine Masih, presiding over the case, stated their inability to intervene in the WazirX hack matter. Their reasoning? The lack of a robust legal framework governing cryptocurrencies in India. According to a report by CCN, the justices clarified that the issue falls under the domain of policy-making, which is the legislature’s responsibility, rather than judicial intervention. This essentially means the court believes it cannot create regulations from the bench and needs a legislative push to act decisively in such cases. This stance highlights a critical issue: the regulatory vacuum surrounding cryptocurrencies in India. Let’s break down what this means: Lack of Legal Clarity: Without specific laws, defining crypto exchanges’ responsibilities and user rights becomes incredibly difficult. Policy Paralysis: The court’s decision underscores the urgent need for the Indian government to formulate and implement comprehensive India crypto regulation . Investor Vulnerability: In the absence of regulation, crypto investors are left in a precarious position, with limited legal recourse in cases of fraud, theft, or exchange failures like the WazirX hack . The Devastating WazirX Hack: A Recap To understand the gravity of the Supreme Court’s decision, it’s crucial to revisit the WazirX hack itself. In July 2024, the Indian crypto exchange WazirX, once a prominent player in the Indian market, suffered a security breach resulting in a staggering $235 million loss. Here are some key points about the incident: Massive Scale of Theft: $235 million in cryptocurrency victims assets were reportedly stolen, making it one of the largest crypto heists in Indian history. User Impact: Thousands of WazirX users were affected, losing a significant portion, if not all, of their crypto holdings on the platform. Aftermath and Petition: Aggrieved cryptocurrency victims collectively filed a petition in the Supreme Court, seeking intervention and demanding accountability from WazirX and regulatory bodies. The petition aimed to address the lack of consumer protection and seek compensation for the losses incurred due to the WazirX hack . However, the Supreme Court’s dismissal has effectively closed this legal avenue for the victims, at least for now. Why Does India Lack Crypto Regulation? Unpacking the Delay The question arises: why, despite the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies and incidents like the WazirX hack , does India still lack clear India crypto regulation ? Several factors contribute to this delay: Regulatory Ambiguity: Government agencies have shown varying stances on cryptocurrencies, oscillating between outright bans and regulated frameworks, creating confusion and hindering progress. Concerns Over Financial Stability: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has voiced concerns about the potential risks cryptocurrencies pose to financial stability, citing volatility and money laundering risks. Lack of Consensus: Different government departments and stakeholders have yet to reach a consensus on the optimal regulatory approach for cryptocurrencies. Global Uncertainty: The evolving global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies also influences India’s approach, as policymakers observe and learn from international examples. This regulatory uncertainty not only leaves cryptocurrency victims unprotected but also stifles innovation and growth in the Indian crypto space. Businesses and investors operate in a grey area, hindering long-term development and potentially driving talent and investment away from India. Impact on Crypto Investors: What Does This Mean For You? The Supreme Court’s decision and the ongoing regulatory void have significant implications for Indian crypto investors. Here’s what you need to consider: Increased Risk: Without regulatory oversight, investing in crypto exchange platforms in India carries a higher risk. User funds are less secure, and legal recourse in case of disputes or failures is limited. Need for Vigilance: Investors must exercise extreme caution when choosing crypto exchange platforms. Due diligence, security audits, and platform reputation become even more critical. Uncertainty About Future Regulations: The Supreme Court’s decision might act as a catalyst for the government to finally prioritize India crypto regulation . However, the timeline and nature of these regulations remain uncertain. Potential for Market Volatility: Negative news and regulatory uncertainty can trigger market volatility. Investors should be prepared for potential price swings in the crypto market. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors: Action Description Diversify Holdings Don’t put all your crypto assets on a single exchange. Spread them across multiple reputable platforms and cold storage wallets. Prioritize Security Use strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), and be wary of phishing attempts. Stay Informed Keep abreast of regulatory developments in India and globally. Follow reputable crypto news sources and legal experts. Advocate for Regulation Engage with industry bodies and participate in discussions about crypto regulation in India. Your voice matters! The Road Ahead: Will India Finally Embrace Crypto Regulation? The Supreme Court’s dismissal of the cryptocurrency victims ‘ petition is undoubtedly a setback. However, it also serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for India crypto regulation . While the present situation seems dire, there’s still hope for a regulated and thriving crypto ecosystem in India. The decision might actually push the government to expedite the process of formulating and implementing crypto laws. The potential benefits of a regulated crypto market in India are immense: Investor Protection: Clear regulations will provide a safety net for investors, protecting them from fraud and exchange failures like the WazirX hack . Economic Growth: A regulated crypto industry can attract significant investment, create jobs, and contribute to India’s economic growth. Innovation and Technology: A supportive regulatory environment can foster innovation in blockchain technology and related sectors. Tax Revenue: Regulation will enable the government to effectively tax crypto transactions, generating substantial revenue. The path forward requires proactive measures from both the government and the crypto industry. Constructive dialogue, informed policy-making, and a focus on investor protection are crucial to unlock the potential of cryptocurrencies in India while mitigating risks. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for Indian Crypto The Supreme Court’s decision regarding the WazirX hack victims’ petition marks a critical juncture for the Indian cryptocurrency landscape. It underscores the urgent need for comprehensive India crypto regulation and highlights the vulnerabilities faced by cryptocurrency victims in the current unregulated environment. While the dismissal is a blow to those affected by the WazirX hack and the broader crypto community, it also presents an opportunity. An opportunity to push for meaningful regulatory change, to protect investors, and to build a sustainable and thriving crypto ecosystem in India. The future of crypto in India hinges on decisive action and a commitment to creating a regulatory framework that balances innovation with investor protection.

The depeg has stretched on for weeks, triggered by recent changes to how sUSD is issued and backed. While the team has already rolled out a new liquidity initiative to address the issue, the response so far hasn’t been enough to turn the tide. In an April 21 thread on X, the Synthetix founder urged SNX stakers to take action through its new staking mechanism, warning that the current goodwill-driven approach may soon give way to tougher enforcement. The new initiative, called the 420 Pool , offers SNX holders a chance to earn a share of 5 million SNX tokens by locking their sUSD for 12 months. Warwick is banking on this long-term commitment to help absorb excess supply and ease the sell pressure that’s been dragging sUSD away from its peg. Warwick said the current process, which involves sending sUSD directly to a contract, is “extremely not ideal,” but suggested that once the user interface goes live in the coming days, staker participation will be closely watched. If engagement remains low, he warned, the protocol may shift from incentives to enforcement. “We tried nothing which didn’t work, now we have tried the carrot and it kind of worked but I’m reserving judgement. I think we all know how much I like the stick so if you think you will get away with not eating the carrot I’ve got some bad news for you,” Warwick said.

Unlike fiat-collateralised stablecoins, sUSD maintains its peg using crypto-based collateral and price feeds from Chainlink oracles, making it more sensitive to changes in protocol mechanics. The sUSD depeg can be traced back to a major protocol update, known as SIP-420. Introduced to boost capital efficiency, it slashed the collateral ratio for minting sUSD from 500% to 200% and moved to a shared, protocol-owned staking pool. While SIP-420 made it easier to mint sUSD, it also flooded the market faster than demand could catch up, throwing off liquidity balances and pushing the stablecoin well below $1. At press time, it was trading at $0.7714 and was down 4.2% in the past 24 hours. Warwick believes the solution lies in mobilizing existing capital within the ecosystem. “The collective net worth of SNX stakers is like multiple billions the money to solve this is there we just need to dial in the incentives. We will start slow and iterate but I’m confident we will resolve this and get back to building perps on L1,” he added. sUSD isn’t the first stablecoin to lose its peg . In March 2023, Circle’s USDC briefly fell to $0.87 after revealing that $3.3 billion of its reserves were tied up in the collapsed Silicon Valley Bank. More recently, TUSD lost its peg to the U.S. dollar in January amid reports that its issuer failed to promptly release a collateral audit.
