Assets traditionally viewed as slow movers have risen as the clear winners, while the cryptocurrency market has quietly slipped to the bottom of the performance rankings. As the year draws to a close, data from across commodities, equities, and digital assets shows an imbalance in returns, revealing that cryptocurrencies now sit behind every major asset class in year-to-date performance. Clear Split Between Traditional Assets And Crypto The performance data for 2025 reveals a strong divergence between traditional markets and digital assets, with the gap widening as the year progressed. According to the figures revealed on the social media platform X by ‘Bull Theory,’ silver is the top-performing asset for 2025, posting gains of about 130% year-to-date. Gold is the second-best-performing asset of 2025, with an increase of about 65%, while copper has climbed close to 35%. These numbers reflect sustained strength across the commodities sector. Equity markets are also currently trading in positive territory. The Nasdaq is up around 20% on the year, the S&P 500 has gained approximately 16%, and the Russell 2000 is higher by about 13%. The only negative numbers are from the crypto industry. In contrast, the crypto market sits at the bottom of the performance rankings. Bitcoin is currently down by about 6% from its 2025 opening price, Ethereum has declined around 12%, and the entire altcoin market (removing Ethereum) has suffered a much deeper drawdown of about 42%. Therefore, the crypto market is now officially the worst-performing asset class in 2025. Chart Image From X. Source: @BullTheoryio From Mid-Year Rally To Q4 Breakdown The current weakness of the crypto market is very different from the optimism that dominated the beginning and middle of 2025. During that period, the crypto market experienced a powerful recovery that reignited bullish sentiment across the board. Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and several large-cap tokens pushed to new all-time highs. Bitcoin’s rally peaked in October, when it set its standing record of $126,000 after months of steady accumulation and strong momentum. Ethereum, on the other hand, registered a new all-time high of $4,946 in August, while XRP’s all-time high came earlier in July. XRP’s record price of $3.65 was the most notable, as it was its first time breaking into a new all-time high since 2018. That bullish trend began to unravel as the fourth quarter got underway, starting with the crypto market flash crash on October 10. The decline has extended since then, and Bitcoin and the broader crypto market have now fallen into negative territory from their 2025 opening levels. Quarterly returns data shows that Bitcoin just recorded its worst fourth-quarter performance in seven years. The result is a year in which digital assets, despite a powerful mid-year rally, are closing out as the worst-performing major asset class. Bitcoin Quarterly Returns.

Phase 1 sold out in record time, distributing 10 million tokens and raising $500,000 almost instantly. This success continued through Phase 2, bringing the total funds raised to over $1.4 million with a community of more than 3,000 holders . We have now entered Phase 3 , and the demand shows no signs of slowing down. Investors have already snapped up 600,000 tokens in this round. Market analysts are predicting that this phase will be exceptionally short. Speculation regarding imminent listings on major exchanges is driving this rapid accumulation. Avalanche Expands Globally While GeeFi Builds Core Utility Avalanche is making significant strides in the enterprise sector. The network is expanding into the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region through its new DLT Foundation . It is also focusing on launching custom blockchains for large enterprises and revolutionizing the music industry by modernizing royalty payments. GeeFi mirrors this commitment to real-world application by building a comprehensive decentralized ecosystem. The platform centers on the GeeFi Wallet , a secure non-custodial solution that gives users total control over their private keys. The integrated Decentralized Exchange (DEX) ensures seamless trading, and the upcoming GeeFi Crypto Card will bridge the gap between digital assets and daily spending. Secure Massive ROI Before Phase 3 Ends The current presale phase represents a critical opportunity for investors. Phase 3 tokens are currently priced at $0.13 . Buying at this level secures a guaranteed 325% ROI once the token lists at the confirmed price of $0.40 . Early supporters who participated in Phase 1 have already witnessed their investment grow by an astounding 1,200% . Time is of the essence for new investors. Analysts predict that Phase 3 will conclude in just 2 weeks due to the surging momentum and swirling rumors of tier-one exchange listings. This is the final window to acquire tokens at a discounted rate before public trading begins. Generate Passive Income with Flexible Staking GeeFi empowers its community with some of the most competitive staking rewards in the industry. You can earn substantial passive income by locking your assets. The platform offers a lucrative 55% APR for users who commit to a 12-month lock-up period. Shorter durations are also available to suit different strategies, including 22% APR for 3 months and 15% APR for 1 month . There is even a flexible option offering 10% APR with no lock-up required. Furthermore, the referral program allows you to earn a 5% bonus in GEE tokens for every purchase made by someone using your unique link. The Next 100x Gem Is Here Investors are constantly searching for the next project capable of delivering exponential returns. GeeFi is widely considered a potential 100x gem due to its solid utility and explosive presale performance. This project offers a rare combination of security, usability, and financial growth potential. Fear of missing out is driving thousands to secure their allocations before the presale closes. The window of opportunity is narrowing rapidly. Once Phase 3 sells out, the chance to invest at these ground-floor prices will disappear. Take action now to position yourself at the forefront of the next major evolution in decentralized finance.

One fine art loss adjuster allegedly said they received dozens of valuation certificates for decorative paintings submitted in one claim. Each sheet looked correct at first, but the descriptions for different pieces were identical. That single detail pushed the adjuster to suspect the entire batch came from an automated system. That check opened the door to wider concerns about how often forged files are slipping into the process without anyone noticing. Exposing how fraudsters build convincing paperwork Olivia Eccleston, a fine art insurance broker at Marsh, said chatbots and large language models are now helping fraudsters forge sales invoices, valuations, provenance documents, and certificates of authenticity. Olivia said this adds a new layer to an old fraud problem in the art market. Some attempts are deliberate. Others start when someone asks an AI model to search historic databases, and it produces results that never existed. Those errors then show up in paperwork that gets sent to insurers as if it were fact. The chain of ownership, known as provenance, is central in the art world. When people corrupt that chain with invented details, the artwork’s value collapses. Angelina Giovani, co-founder of provenance research group Flynn & Giovani, said AI makes this easy because “it’s quite conniving… it has to come up with an answer, so if you give it enough information, it will guess something.” Angelina said she saw a case where an AI system appeared to create a signature on a painting to strengthen its story. Experts note that none of this is new in principle. People once copied letterheads from respected institutions or designed fake stamps. Now they lean on AI to generate the same paperwork with smoother language and fewer obvious errors. Filippo Guerrini-Maraldi, head of fine art at insurer Howden, said he has seen many forged documents over his career and that automated systems now make them look more realistic. Angelina said she has seen fake ledger numbers and forged Nazi-era stamps on provenance files. She also pointed to the case of Wolfgang Beltracchi, who created hundreds of paintings and used staged photographs to build fake ownership histories behind them. These tactics show how far people go to support artwork that cannot stand on its own. Tracking digital clues as fraud becomes harder to see Harry Smith, executive chair of art valuers Gurr Johns, said AI now makes fraud quicker because people no longer need to invent a fake expert to back their claim. The tool produces whatever support text they want. Grace Best-Devereux, a fine art loss adjuster at Sedgwick, said she checks metadata in digital documents to spot signs of AI interference. Grace said adjusters also use their own systems to decide whether a provenance document is real. But she warned that the job is getting harder because new tools are making forged text look normal. Grace said, “We’re at this precipice where it might not be possible for me to look at it and say, ‘the text looks wrong, and I need to investigate this further.’” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

Pacific Gas and Electric said the blackout started Saturday afternoon and peaked two hours later, hitting about 130,000 customers. As of press time, reportedly 21,000 homes and businesses still had no electricity, mostly in the Presidio, the Richmond District, Golden Gate Park, and parts of downtown. Pacific Gas and Electric said the cause was a fire at a substation that caused “significant and extensive” damage, and it could not give a timeline for full repairs. San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said in a 9 p.m. update on X that police, fire crews, parking control officers, and city ambassadors were sent into affected neighborhoods as transit slowly came back.“Waymo has also paused service,” he said. Elon Musk says Tesla is unaffected by the blackout Meanwhile, Elon Musk said via a post on X that:- “Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by the SF power outage.” Though, it did not take long for people to point out that Tesla does not run a driverless program in the city at all, with his comment section littered with angry users. Tesla’s local service uses “FSD (Supervised),” which is a driver-assist system that needs a human behind the wheel at all times. Regulators at the California DMV and the California Public Utilities Commission confirmed that Tesla has no permits to run driverless cars in the state without human safety workers ready to brake or steer. Tesla is trying to become a big player in robotaxis, but its rides today still rely on human supervisors, even in states where the company holds permits for driverless programs. Tesla’s Robotaxi app lets people request a car, but every trip has a human on board. Waymo, on the other hand, leads the market in the West and competes with companies like Baidu-owned Apollo Go. The outage hit as robotaxi programs become more common in other major U.S. cities. Waymo is one of the few companies offering full driverless rides to the public, even though surveys show people remain uneasy. The American Automobile Association said earlier this year that two-thirds of U.S. drivers reported fear of autonomous cars. Bryan Reimer, a research scientist at MIT and co-author of “How to Make AI Useful,” said the pause in San Francisco showed the limits of these vehicles. He said something was missed in the design or development of the systems, and he argued that power failures are expected events. “Not for eternity, but in the foreseeable future, we will need to mix human and machine intelligence, and have human backup systems in place around highly automated systems, including robotaxis,” he said. Reimer also said regulators must decide how many highly automated cars should be allowed on streets and should hold AV companies responsible for any “chaos gridlock” the cars cause during major outages. Waymo did not say when service will return or whether any collisions happened during the blackout.

Our Pi network price prediction anticipates the Pi price to reach a maximum level of $0.35 by 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $3.14. Pi Network, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan, is a social crypto and developer ecosystem built for real-world utility and mass accessibility. 2025 has been a defining stress test: Pi surged to about $2.98 in February, crashed to a new all-time low of $0.1585 on October 11, and now trades near $0.22 in early December, highlighting extreme volatility as the year closes. But basic building blocks continue to keep investor interest alive, including the Passkey security improvement to Pi Wallet, Pi DEX, and AMM on Testnet, Pi Network Ventures pushing towards decentralization and AI with OpenMind, and millions of new KYC verifications and continuing projects such as the 2025 Pi Hackathon and Sign Protocol partnership. In this Pi Network price prediction, we discuss these developments with major technical levels and the model of exponential supply of Pi that is in decline to determine whether 2025–2031 favors a sustained recovery or further downside.

The daily RSI is near 43, staying below neutral, while the MACD remains negative, confirming weak momentum and continued bearish pressure. Key support sits between $0.19 and $0.20, while resistance now stands between $0.21 and $0.22. As of December 21, 2025, Pi Network is showing continued weakness after declining back toward the $0.20 psychological level. Pi is trading near $0.205, with a market cap of approximately $1.71 billion and 24-hour volume around $11.64M, indicating cautious participation rather than aggressive dip-buying. Bulls are struggling to reclaim lost ground, and price action suggests hesitation ahead of key support. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis The 1-day chart shows a small red candle following a failed attempt to hold above $0.21. Price has ranged between roughly $0.202 and $0.212, and settled at $0.205.This keeps Pi stuck in its recent low consolidation zone. The overall structure still reflects lower highs, and no clear reversal pattern has formed yet. The RSI (14) is currently around 41, which is below the neutral 50 level. This indicates that bearish momentum is still present in the market. However, since the RSI is not yet in the oversold zone, which is below 30, there is still room for further downside before a strong rebound can be expected. The RSI line is relatively flat, suggesting weak selling pressure and a lack of strong buying interest at the moment. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView On the MACD (12, 26), both the MACD and signal lines remain below the zero line, with a slightly negative histogram. This confirms that bearish momentum is still present, even if selling pressure has slowed compared to earlier declines. Immediate support is found around $0.20, with a breakdown opening the door toward $0.19. On the upside, resistance sits at $0.21, followed by a stronger barrier near $0.22. A daily close above $0.22 would be needed to shift the short-term bias away from bearish. Pi/USD 4-Hour Price Analysis On the 4-hour timeframe, the price of Pi Network is trading around $0.205, moving sideways after a prolonged bearish move. Price action shows a series of lower highs, confirming that the broader short-term trend remains bearish. However, the recent candles are small and tightly ranged, indicating consolidation near a key support zone around $0.20, where buyers are attempting to defend the price. The RSI (14) is currently around 47, which is slightly below the neutral 50 level. This suggests that the market is still leaning bearish, but selling pressure is weak. The RSI recently moved up toward the mid-range and then pulled back, indicating a short-term recovery attempt that lacked strong momentum. Since the RSI is neither overbought nor oversold, price action is likely to remain range-bound unless a stronger push from buyers or sellers appears. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView The MACD (12, 26) on the 4-hour timeframe is very close to the zero line, showing low momentum and market indecision. Although the MACD line is slightly above the signal line, the histogram remains small, indicating that bullish momentum is weak and not yet confirmed. Overall, the MACD suggests a consolidation phase, where the price is stabilizing but has not formed a clear directional move yet.

Price is likely to move sideways or slightly downward, unless buyers push it above nearby resistance, which would signal a short-term relief bounce. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.3610 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly, neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is PI’s price down today? Pi’s price is down due to a technical breakdown below key support, combined with weak momentum and low trading volume. Ongoing open mainnet delays limit real utility, while supply overhang concerns continue to weigh on demand. In the short term, price action depends on whether the $0.20 support holds or breaks toward $0.15. Will Pi Price Reach $5? At the current pace of development and given its total PI supply circulating supply of over 8 billion PI, Pi Network’s value is unlikely to reach $5 in the near term. Multiple technical quantitative indicators and fundamental factors, such as delayed mainnet launch and maximum supply constraints, suggest that Pi’s price may fluctuate within lower ranges before any major uptrend. A $5 target would require sustained adoption, significant on-chain activity, and strong market demand that is not yet present. Will Pi Reach $10? Reaching $10 would represent a massive increase in Pi’s market cap, something that is not expected soon under current crypto market conditions. Analysts suggest that even optimistic forecasts place this milestone more than a decade away, if at all. Investors should treat such projections as speculative investment advice and conduct their own research before making investment decisions, as Pi remains a high-risk asset with uncertain long-term value.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi showed a sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72. At the start of July 2025, Pi Network faced high volatility as massive token unlocks triggered strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range. On July 19, 2025, PIUSDT declined slightly to $0.4412, reflecting short-term bearish pressure. On July 26, 2025, PIUSDT continued to hover under pressure around $0.4409, staying within a tight trading range as momentum remained subdued. for August 2, 2025. Pi traded at $0.3496, still under pressure and at its all-time low. On August 6, 2025, Pi Network is traded at around $0.3410, showing moderate consolidation with weak momentum and limited price movement. On August 9th, Pi/USDT went up from its early August low of $0.3766 and traded around $0.4103. August 17th, 2025, the Pi Network (PI) traded at $0.387 , showing slight movement between support at $0.383 and resistance at $0.390 . On August 21, Pi Network (PI) traded near $0.366, showing a modest 1.39% gain as buyers attempted a short-term recovery. On September 2, 2025, Pi network traded around $0.34, just above its past month’s August all-time low of $0.3304. On September 22, 2025, Pi crashed to a new all-time low (ATL) of $0.2234, marking a –92% drop from its February ATH and reflecting heavy sell-side pressure from token unlocks and weak demand. Pi rebounded slightly, to trade between $0.25 and $0.28 through late September, though resistance at $0.30 continued to hold firmly. At the start of October 2025, Pi trades at $0.2718, but is still struggling under bearish sentiment as buyers attempt to defend support above $0.26 while momentum indicators suggest only a weak recovery. On October 11, 2025, Pi Network hit a new all-time low of $0.1585, reflecting the peak of a prolonged market crash and severe selling pressure. On October 15, 2025, Pi Network (PI) stabilized slightly, trading around $0.1884, as short-term buyers stepped in following the sharp October 11 crash. On October 28, 2025, PI attempted a short rebound toward $0.238, but failed to hold gains, slipping back below the 20-day moving average. As of the start of November 2025, Pi Network traded at approximately $0.247, still below key resistance at $0.26, as traders remain cautious ahead of the upcoming 120 million token unlock expected in November. As of November 15, Pi network traded at $0.223. This rise for 1 day was driven by technical breakout signals, whale accumulation, and ongoing ecosystem updates. As of November 30, 2025, Pi Network traded around $0.243, consolidating above the $0.24 support zone while still below the $0.26 resistance heading into month-end. As of December 1, 2025, Pi Network had dropped to about $0.226, as sellers reacted to December’s 190M PI token unlock overhang and a broader risk-off mood in the crypto market. As of December 16, 2025, Pi Network traded around $0.196, having broken below the psychological $0.20 support as ongoing token unlocks, legal uncertainty, and sustained bearish technical momentum kept strong downside pressure on the price.",Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|TRADING|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-21 21:30:00

The CBDC project ultimately aims to enhance fiscal efficiency by curbing misuse and slashing administrative costs. However, the broader pushback against the CBDC from citizens remains, with many of them seemingly believing that it is a tool for government surveillance. Is South Korea’s CDBC ready? According to reports , the Bank of Korea (BOK) is accelerating the resumption of the CBDC experiment amid delays in discussions on the Korean won stablecoin bill . According to sources cited in local reports on December 21, the BOK already sent out an official document to major banks regarding the second round of CBDC testing. A BOK official stated, “Details, including the specific method and schedule, are currently under discussion.” Under the second phase of testing, the BoK is allegedly considering distributing a portion of government subsidies in the form of digital currency. They hope the CBDC can help limit its use and reduce the management and administrative costs linked with subsidy execution. The first phase of the CBDC experiment was conducted with seven banks and lasted three months before it was suspended. At the time, the experiment received backlash for its limited practical utility and the financial burden it placed on the participating banks, which amounted to billions of won. Revival of the testing phase was floated in late August of this year during a meeting between BoK Governor Rhee Chang-yong and Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol, in which they discussed using CBDC for subsidy payouts as a way to address the problems. The banking industry is adamant that a second round of testing is required for the time being. One banking industry official said, “With the official document, we have no choice but to restart preparations.” At the same time, it has become clear that South Korea may be looking to pursue both the stablecoin and CBDC avenues, rather than sticking with one. A BOK official stated, “Stablecoins and CBDCs have different roles and purposes, so they can coexist. We are proceeding with previously scheduled procedures and are not directly related to the delay in discussions on the won-denominated stablecoin bill.” Despite such statements pushing the efficiency narrative, the pushback from South Korean citizens against broader CBDC adoption has been massive, with online petitions making concerning claims like how it could facilitate excessive government surveillance and control over personal finances, gaining traction. South Korean agencies debate stablecoin oversight The launch of the second phase of CBDC testing is being debated as the institutionalization of the Korean won-denominated stablecoin continues to be delayed due to the inability of the Financial Services Commission and the Bank of Korea to see eye to eye over the matter of issuer and regulatory framework. The Democratic Party of Korea’s Digital Asset Task Force (TF) initially requested that the Financial Services Commission submit a government proposal by December 11, but the Financial Services Commission reportedly submitted only a rough outline of the draft bill. The draft, “Key Contents of the Framework Act on Digital Assets,” claims the Financial Services Commission (FSC) proposed a plan to designate important stablecoins based on the number of stablecoin users and issuance volume. This designation should have been made in consultation with the Bank of Korea (BOK). As such, it is interpreted as only partially reflecting the BOK’s concerns about the issuance of won-denominated stablecoins. The final draft is expected but has been delayed due to the failure to coordinate opinions on key issues, such as the requirements for issuing by bank-centered consortiums and the unanimous agreement of the policy consensus body.

They shift with a change of behavior. First, users watch. Then they participate. Finally, they hold. Price is a natural successor when this shift occurs on scale. New DeFi crypto seems to be reaching that phase. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is subject to increased allocation restraint; the token priced at $0.035 is experiencing the change in behavioral patterns. Early Signals of Behaviour at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a protocol which is being developed that is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol based on Ethereum. The project is very practical in its momentum as opposed to being focused on hype. Users supply assets. Borrowers access liquidity. Participation can be rewarded by the protocol mechanics of the system. There are a number of initial behavioral cues forming. One is holding behavior. With the approach of Phase 6 allocation, the number of tokens left is decreasing. This could promote long holding as compared to short term flipping. Another indicator is the usage of mtToken. Users receive the assets deposited on Mutuum Finance in the form of mtTokens. Such tokens make users remain on the platform as opposed to leaving within a short time. Behavior change is also manifested in terms of Leaderboard activity. The 24-hour leaderboard will give the best daily winner $500 of MUTM. This makes participating recurrent, not a single participation. Such trends tend to be better than the announcements. Participation and Habit Formation The process of lending and borrowing is more likely to accustom more people than most other crypto products. Users reposition, trade collateral or yield management. Every interaction strengthens interaction. The price increase due to short term bursts of attention is prone to decline since habits of protocols are more resilient to the recession induced post-event changes. Selling pressure may decline with time when users use the platform to stay active. Mutuum Finance is a product that revolves around this loop. Lending creates deposits. Borrowing creates demand. Both parties communicate with each other several times. This may eventually transform the token into a utility connected holding. V1 being the Behavioral Trigger Point The V1 launch that is coming is significant since it transforms the behavior of users. Up to V1, the participation is largely preparative. Following V1, the actions become operative. Due to the official updates, Mutuum Finance is set to launch its V1 on the Sepolia testnet in the Q4 of 2025. Its main characteristics are liquidity pools, mt Tokens, debt tokens and a liquidator bot. The assets initially launched will be ETH and USDT. Behavior will in many cases accelerate when platforms are changed between setup and usage. There are analysts who feel that this step can initiate the initial significant repricing. In a bullish case, it is projected that after the launch, MUTM could climb higher than $0.06 as more people join. Second Price Scenario Other than participation, long term behavior is determined by incentives. Mutuum Finance has a buy and distribute mechanism. Some of the protocol revenue is used to purchase MUTM in the market and redistribute to interested mtToken stakers. This creates a feedback loop. The more it is used, the more it gives revenue. Increased revenue causes increased purchasing pressure. This model is in contrast to the demand which is supported by attention; this model associates price support with activity. Yield rewards are also incentives to hold. Selling is less appealing when the users make money by participating in it. According to some commentators of the market, a long term demand of a sustained revenue would justify a higher price bracket in the long term, possibly between $0.10 and $0.15 should consistent progress be found in the usage. Scaling Behavior with Stablecoin and Layer-2 plans Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will serve stablecoins and consider integration with layer-2 according to the official roadmap. The assets such as Stables minimise the volatility to daily users. There are the layer-2 networks which minimize fees and enhance speed. Daily use is easy because of lower cost and stabilizing value assets. This increases the number of people who can use it other than sophisticated traders. Liquidity increases with the magnitude of behavior, and, as price movements tend to become organized. Mutuum Finance is still in development with MUTM priced at $0.035, and with V1, its beta features will become available. Nonetheless, on reaching an allocation of near 100% and a shift of user behavior toward being habitual, MUTM seems poised to potentially experience another 300% token appreciation.

Bitcoin predictions for 2026 Galaxy Digital Research has released its annual crypto market predictions for 2026, predicting that Bitcoin will reach $250,000 by the end of 2027, although they acknowledge that 2026 remains too unpredictable to call it with confidence. Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital, explained that options markets currently price equal odds of Bitcoin hitting either $70,000 or $130,000 by June 2026, and equal odds of $50,000 or $250,000 by year-end 2026. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $126,080 on October 6, 2025, driven by regulatory reforms and ETF inflows during the first ten months of the year. However, the market experienced a sharp reversal and witnessed leverage liquidations, whale distribution, and shifting investment narratives. By December, Bitcoin had fallen back to the low $90,000 range and currently trades around $88,000. The report identifies several factors responsible for the potential uncertainty for 2026, including the rate of AI capital expenditure deployment, monetary policy conditions, and the U.S. midterm elections in November. Thorn emphasized that until Bitcoin firmly re-establishes itself above the $100,000 to $105,000 level, downside risk remains in the near term. Galaxy released 26 predictions covering various aspects of the crypto ecosystem, including expectations that more than 50 spot altcoin ETFs will launch in the United States, U.S. spot crypto ETF net inflows will exceed $50 billion, and at least 15 crypto companies will IPO or uplist in the U.S. during 2026. How accurate were Galaxy’s 2025 predictions? Galaxy Digital predicted at the beginning of the year that Bitcoin would cross $150,000 in the first half and possibly reach $185,000 in the fourth quarter. By November, Thorn had lowered the year-end target to $125,000, and even that revised forecast appears unlikely to be met due to the significantly lower Bitcoin trades in December. A major leverage unwinding event on October 10, 2025, caused significant market disruption, erasing approximately $78 billion in open interest across crypto futures. More than 470,000 Bitcoins held for over five years, worth approximately $50 billion, changed hands during 2025. Galaxy facilitated one of the year’s largest single transfers, involving $9 billion worth of assets from a legacy whale. Throughout 2025, institutional investment was more toward artificial intelligence infrastructure, data centers, nuclear energy, quantum technology, and gold. Galaxy predicted that at least one major wealth management platform would announce a 2% or higher recommended Bitcoin allocation. It hit on that one as Morgan Stanley published a report announcing up to 4% allocation. They also accurately forecast that more than half of the top 20 publicly traded Bitcoin miners would become or partner with AI and high-performance computing firms. However, Bitcoin did not cross $150,000 as Galaxy initially predicted, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs did not collectively reach $250 billion in assets under management, and Bitcoin did not finish among the top performers on a risk-adjusted basis among global assets. Galaxy Digital see s bi g 2026 for stablecoin s Ga laxy Digital predicts that stablecoins will overtake the U.S. Automated Clearing House system in transaction volume due to current data showin g st ablecoin transactions already exceeding major credit card networks like Visa and processing roughly half the volume of the ACH system. Thad Pinakiewicz, vice president of research at Galaxy, said that stablecoin supply has been growing at a 30% to 40% compound annual growth rate along with transaction volumes. According to data from DefiLlama, the stablecoin market cap currently stands at approximately $309 billion, with Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC continuing to dominate the market. Galaxy expects the passage and implementation of the GENIUS Act in early 2026 to accelerate stablecoin adoption. The act was signed into law by President Trump in July 2025 and provides regulatory clarity for stablecoins. It is expected to enable both incumbent tokens to grow and new entrants to compete for market share. Jianing Wu, a research associate at Galaxy, explained that consumers and merchants are unlikely to juggle multiple digital dollars and will instead gravitate toward one or two options with the broadest acceptance. Nine major banks, including Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Bank of America, and Citigroup, are already exploring plans to launch stablecoins based on G7 currencies. In October, Western Union revealed plans for its U.S. Dollar Payment Token on the Solana blockchain. Sony Bank is developing a stablecoin for integration across its U.S. ecosystem, including PlayStation and subscription services, with a planned 2026 launch. Cryptopolitan reported earlier this month that SoFi Technologies has introduced SoFiUSD, a fully reserved dollar stablecoin issued by SoFi Bank on Ethereum. Galaxy’s expectations include that at least one of the top three global card networks will conduct more than 10% of its cross-border settlement volume through public-chain stablecoins, though most end users will never see a crypto interface. Galaxy predicts that decentralized exchanges will capture more than 25% of combined spot trading volume by the end of 2026, up from roughly 15-17% currently.

According to a press release sent to CryptoPotato , the country will channel 10,000 BTC, worth roughly $1 billion, to support the long-term development of GMC. GMC is a new economic hub designed for mindfulness, sustainability, and innovation. Bhutan Unveils Bitcoin Development Pledge Bhutan’s ruler, His Majesty King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, unveiled the Bitcoin Development Pledge via his National Day Address earlier this week. The commitment aligns with the king’s vision of applying modern digital technologies to serve the people of Bhutan and future generations. The country will assess several approaches that would enable the long-term use of the pledged assets. The options under consideration include collateralising the Kingdom’s bitcoin holdings, implementing yield management strategies, and preserving asset value while holding them long-term. Bhutan will guide any use of BTC in the GMC by prudence and strong governance, ensuring transparency and capital preservation. The country will prioritize preserving long-term potential while developing the economic hub in a stable and sustainable manner. Jigdrel Singay, Board Director at GMC, commented on the approach, saying: “Bhutan’s position is that its Bitcoin holdings are intended for the long term, and that commitment is reiterated clearly in the Development Pledge. The specific strategy is still being worked on, and the examples mentioned in the announcement outline the range of responsible options under consideration. There is no change to Bhutan’s long-term stewardship approach toward its Bitcoin reserves.” GMC to be Powered by Digital Infrastructure Besides being a mindfulness hub, GMC will also provide regulatory clarity, financial connectivity, and a long-term environment for collaboration. The hub is open to partnerships from both local and international digital asset entities. Bhutan has already integrated digital assets into the hub’s strategic reserves and enabled crypto-based payments across services. The Kingdom has also launched TER, a sovereign-backed token linked to physical gold. These efforts build on the country’s track record of being one of the earliest adopters of BTC and digital asset infrastructure. Since 2017, Bhutan has quietly been mining BTC using clean energy. “As your King, I must ensure that every Bhutanese is a custodian, stakeholder, and beneficiary of GMC…This commitment is for our people, our youth, and our nation,” Bhutan’s ruler stated.

This isn’t science fiction; it’s a potential reality that has top experts sounding the alarm. A critical quantum defense upgrade for Bitcoin is now a race against time, with dire warnings that failure could see BTC’s price plummet below $50,000 within the next few years. The clock is ticking on the most significant technological challenge Bitcoin has ever faced. Why Is Quantum Defense Suddenly a Crisis for Bitcoin? For years, quantum computing has been a distant theoretical threat. However, recent expert analysis suggests the timeline for danger is accelerating faster than the timeline for a solution. The core issue is simple: the cryptographic algorithms that protect Bitcoin wallets today could be broken by a sufficiently powerful quantum computer. While such a machine may not exist imminently, preparing the entire Bitcoin network for this change is a monumental task that could take a decade. Without this quantum defense , the market’s confidence—and thus, Bitcoin’s price—could collapse preemptively. What Are the Experts Saying About the BTC Price Threat? The warnings from industry leaders are stark and carry significant weight. Jameson Lopp, a respected BTC Core developer, acknowledges that while a direct attack isn’t immediate, the process of upgrading the protocol and migrating vulnerable funds will be painfully slow. The more urgent outlook comes from Charles Edwards of Capriole Investments. He presents a chilling forecast: BTC could fall below $50,000 by 2028 if it lacks quantum resistance. Edwards emphasizes that the market impact of delayed action could dwarf past catastrophes, potentially exceeding the fallout from the FTX collapse. His reasoning is grounded in a terrifying statistic: over four million BTC are currently stored in wallets that are vulnerable to a future quantum attack. This isn’t a minor flaw; it’s a systemic risk. How Does a Lack of Quantum Defense Create Market Panic? The threat isn’t just technical; it’s profoundly psychological. The cryptocurrency market is driven by trust in security and scarcity. Therefore, the mere perception of vulnerability can trigger a sell-off long before any actual attack occurs. Consider these key risk factors: Loss of Scarcity: If millions of supposedly lost or secure coins become accessible to an attacker, the total supply shock could devastate the market. Erosion of Trust: Bitcoin’s value proposition hinges on being a secure, decentralized store of value. A fundamental security flaw undermines this entire premise. Institutional Flight: Large investors and ETFs would be forced to re-evaluate their holdings if the foundational technology is seen as compromised. This perfect storm of technical risk and market sentiment is why establishing robust quantum defense is no longer optional—it’s essential for survival. Can Bitcoin Actually Implement a Quantum Defense in Time? The path to a quantum-resistant Bitcoin is fraught with challenges. Upgrading a decentralized, multi-trillion-dollar network is not like updating a phone app. It requires near-universal consensus among developers, miners, exchanges, and holders. The transition would likely involve: Developing and rigorously testing new, quantum-safe cryptographic standards. Creating a clear migration path for users to move funds from old, vulnerable addresses to new, secure ones. Ensuring backward compatibility and network stability throughout the multi-year process. The five-to-ten-year window experts cite is not for building the quantum computer itself, but for completing this incredibly complex global upgrade. The race is on. What’s the Final Verdict on Bitcoin’s Quantum Future? The message from the forefront of crypto development is clear: complacency is the real enemy. The challenge of quantum computing is unprecedented, but Bitcoin has overcome major obstacles before. The key takeaway is that proactive development and community coordination are paramount. The market will reward foresight and punish delay. The narrative for the next decade will be defined by how effectively the ecosystem builds and deploys its quantum defense . The alternative is a price prediction no investor wants to see become reality. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is a quantum attack on Bitcoin? A: A quantum attack would use a powerful quantum computer to solve the mathematical problems that currently protect Bitcoin wallets, allowing an attacker to steal funds. Q: Is my Bitcoin safe right now? A: Yes, for the immediate future. The threat is from future, more advanced quantum computers. However, coins in certain types of addresses (like legacy Pay-to-Public-Key Hash) are considered more vulnerable long-term. Q: What is being done to make Bitcoin quantum-resistant? A> Cryptographers and Bitcoin developers are actively researching “post-quantum cryptography”—new algorithms that even quantum computers couldn’t easily break. Implementing them network-wide is the next major hurdle. Q: Could a quantum computer break Bitcoin tomorrow? A> Most experts agree this is highly unlikely. The current generation of quantum computers is not powerful enough. The concern is about being prepared before the technology advances. Q: Will we need to buy new “quantum-proof” Bitcoin? A> Not exactly. The likely solution is a network upgrade where users move their BTC to new, quantum-resistant address types, similar to past upgrades like SegWit. Q: Are other cryptocurrencies at risk too? A> Yes, virtually all cryptocurrencies using similar cryptography (like Ethereum) face the same quantum threat and will need their own defense strategies.

One minute, timelines look quiet; the next minute, rockets ignite, and portfolios start sweating. While blue-chip names keep shipping updates and scaling quietly, meme-powered presales are stealing the spotlight with louder momentum and sharper upside chatter. Avalanche is pushing scalability milestones, Chainlink continues to expand real-world data integrations, and traders are scanning headlines for the next breakout narrative. For readers tracking opportunity windows with clarity, trusted resources still matter. To explore emerging trends and informed perspectives, many investors compare insights under Best Crypto to Buy Now before committing capital. That brings the spotlight to a presale shaking timelines right now. Apeing ‘s whitelist is pulling attention like gravity, and Apeing dominates as the 100x crypto across early adopter discussions. Scarcity is apparent, timing feels sharp, and anticipation is building as wallets line up for front-row access. Apeing Dominates as the 100x Crypto and Sets the Tone Early Apeing opens this story with intention. Apeing dominates as the 100x crypto not by accident, but through a launch strategy built around decisive early participation and controlled access. History favors conviction. Those who hesitate, refreshing charts and waiting for perfect signals, often watch the biggest multipliers move without them. This project flips that script by rewarding speed, clarity, and belief before public noise takes over. The upcoming Apeing presale is structured to favor early momentum. Upcoming presale stage 1 pricing is set at 0.0001, with a planned listing at 0.001. That gap defines the upside narrative without leaning on hype alone. Limited token allocation reinforces discipline, while the whitelist filters out casual watchers and lets serious participants in. This framework builds trust and creates growth pathways without diluting value. Apeing and $APEING are positioned to benefit from a clean launch, transparent mechanics, and a community primed to move together rather than chase later. Why Apeing Dominates as the 100x Crypto for Early Whitelist Access Apeing dominates as the 100x crypto for one apparent reason: timing meets structure. Joining the whitelist early means exposure at the lowest available entry before public pricing reshapes demand. Tokens allocated to presale stage 1 are capped, creating urgency without chaos. Early participants gain clarity on supply, pricing, and roadmap expectations, reducing emotional trading later. This approach encourages steady conviction and long-term thinking while still offering explosive upside potential. With projected upside discussions reaching beyond 10,000 percent based on entry versus listing pricing, Apeing and $APEING present a calculated risk profile rather than blind speculation. When momentum builds early, diamond hands tend to form naturally. Avalanche (AVAX) Price Today Signals Scalable Power Ahead Avalanche continues to earn its place among serious infrastructure-focused networks. AVAX price today reflects a blockchain designed for speed, low latency, and developer flexibility. Its consensus mechanism supports high throughput without sacrificing decentralization, making it attractive for DeFi, gaming, and enterprise-grade applications. Recent developments highlight Avalanche’s growing subnet ecosystem, allowing customized blockchains to operate efficiently within its network. This modular approach improves scalability and cost control while expanding use cases. AVAX price forecasts often hinge on adoption metrics rather than speculation alone, positioning the token as a steady performer for investors prioritizing fundamentals and network utility. Chainlink (LINK) Crypto Price Today Anchors Real Utility Chainlink remains a backbone for decentralized data infrastructure. LINK crypto price today reflects its role as the most widely adopted oracle network, connecting smart contracts with real-world data securely and reliably. This utility-driven model continues attracting partnerships across DeFi, gaming, and traditional finance bridges. Recent expansions into cross-chain interoperability reinforce Chainlink’s relevance as multi-network ecosystems grow. Secure data feeds, proof-of-reserves, and automation tools strengthen its long-term value proposition. LINK price forecasts often align with broader adoption rather than hype cycles, making it a staple for portfolios focused on reliability and depth of integration. Conclusion Avalanche, Chainlink, and Apeing each serve different investor mindsets. AVAX delivers scalable infrastructure, LINK anchors real-world data trust, and Apeing dominates as the 100x crypto by capturing early momentum through a disciplined whitelist model. Apeing’s fast start, limited allocation, and clear presale pricing create a compelling early-stage narrative. The whitelist is currently open, momentum is accelerating, and early access is shrinking by the day. For those serious about identifying high-upside opportunities before public entry points shift the game, Apeing and $APEING deserve immediate attention.

Market swings can be nerve-wracking. However, a simple strategy endorsed by CNBC and top financial experts can bring peace of mind: limiting your crypto allocation to a modest portion of your overall wealth. Let’s explore why this rule is a cornerstone of prudent investing. Why is a Small Crypto Allocation So Crucial? Cryptocurrency markets are famous for their dramatic price movements. This volatility presents opportunity, but also significant risk. Financial advisors consistently stress that your crypto allocation should act as a satellite to your core portfolio, not its foundation. By capping exposure, you harness potential growth while insulating your financial future from severe downturns. CNBC’s report, citing multiple experts, provides a clear framework. They recommend maintaining this crypto allocation between 1% and 3% of your total assets, with an absolute maximum of 5%. This disciplined approach is your first defense against market unpredictability. How Do You Build a Diversified Portfolio Around Crypto? If crypto is just a small slice, what fills the rest of the pie? The answer is classic, time-tested diversification. The experts suggest the majority of your portfolio should consist of stable assets. Value Stocks: Shares in established companies often considered undervalued. Bonds: Government or corporate debt that provides regular income. Broad Market ETFs: Funds that track entire indices like the S&P 500. This mix creates a buffer. When crypto markets dip, your other holdings can help stabilize your overall net worth. Think of your crypto allocation as the high-octane fuel in a reliable car—powerful in small amounts, but dangerous as the only component. What Are the Modern Tools for Crypto Diversification? Gone are the days when diversification meant just buying Bitcoin and Ethereum. The landscape has evolved, offering investors more sophisticated tools. The report highlights the growth of spot ETFs. Now, you can find ETFs for a wider range of cryptocurrencies. More importantly, mixed spot ETFs have emerged. These are single funds that hold a basket of different digital assets, instantly providing diversification within your crypto allocation itself. It’s a one-click solution for spreading risk across the crypto sector. Which Fund Management Strategies Protect Your Investment? Setting your allocation is just the first step. Actively managing that portion is key to long-term success. CNBC’s experts emphasized two powerful strategies: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): This involves investing a fixed, small amount at regular intervals (e.g., $100 every week). DCA removes the stress of timing the market. You buy more when prices are low and less when they are high, averaging out your purchase cost over time. Periodic Rebalancing: Market movements can skew your allocations. If your crypto surges in value, its portion of your portfolio might grow beyond your intended 5%. Rebalancing means selling some of that profit and reinvesting it into your other assets to restore your original, safe balance. Together, DCA and rebalancing turn emotional investing into a systematic, disciplined process. They ensure your carefully planned crypto allocation stays on track. Conclusion: Prudence is the Ultimate Strategy In the thrilling world of digital assets, discipline is your greatest ally. Adhering to a modest crypto allocation under 5%, diversifying with traditional assets, and using systematic strategies like DCA are not limitations—they are the frameworks for sustainable, low-stress participation in the crypto revolution. This approach lets you explore the potential of cryptocurrency without jeopardizing your core financial security. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Why 5%? Why not 10% or 20% for higher returns? A: The 5% cap is a risk management guideline. Cryptocurrency is a high-risk asset class. Limiting exposure ensures that even in a worst-case scenario where the value drops significantly, your overall financial health and long-term goals remain intact. Q: Does this 5% rule apply to experienced traders as well? A: The advice is generally for the average investor building a long-term portfolio. Professional traders with dedicated risk capital may operate differently, but the principle of not overexposing one’s total net worth to volatile assets still holds true. Q: How often should I rebalance my portfolio? A: A common practice is to review and rebalance quarterly or semi-annually. Avoid doing it too frequently, as transaction fees and short-term volatility can make excessive trading counterproductive. Q: What if I only have a small total amount to invest? Should I still follow the 5% rule? A> Yes, the principle scales. If you have $1,000 to invest, your crypto allocation should be no more than $50. This instills good habits from the start and prevents a disproportionate risk on a small portfolio. Q: Are crypto ETFs safer than buying coins directly? A> They offer different kinds of safety. ETFs traded on traditional exchanges may provide easier management and custodial security. However, they still carry the market risk of the underlying cryptocurrencies. A mixed ETF offers instant diversification, which is a form of risk mitigation. Q: Can dollar-cost averaging really work in a volatile market? A> Absolutely. Volatility is precisely why DCA is effective. It systematically navigates the ups and downs, preventing you from investing a large lump sum at a market peak and helping you build a position at an averaged cost.

This monumental figure signals robust investor confidence, yet a critical question remains: why hasn’t this tidal wave of money propelled the price of XRP to new heights? Let’s dive into the data, the leaders, and the underlying market dynamics shaping this fascinating chapter for XRP spot ETFs . What’s Driving the Massive Inflows into XRP Spot ETFs? Since their debut on November 13, U.S. spot XRP spot ETFs have become a magnet for capital. Investors are clearly seizing the opportunity to gain regulated exposure to XRP without the complexities of direct custody. This influx represents a major vote of confidence in the asset’s legitimacy and its potential within a structured financial framework. The sheer scale of investment, reported by CryptoBriefing, underscores a significant shift toward institutional adoption of digital assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Which XRP ETF Providers Are Leading the Pack? The competition among issuers is fierce, with clear frontrunners emerging in assets under management (AUM). Here’s a breakdown of the top performers: Canary : The current leader, its spot XRP ETF holds approximately $335 million in AUM. 21Shares : A strong contender with around $250 million gathered. Grayscale : A well-known name in crypto funds, holding about $220 million in its XRP offering. This distribution shows a healthy, competitive landscape where multiple trusted firms are successfully attracting investor capital. Why Is XRP Price Stuck Below $2 Despite Huge ETF Inflows? Here lies the central paradox. While billions pour into XRP spot ETFs , the token’s market price has struggled to break and hold above the $2 mark. Two primary factors are at play: First, selling pressure from large-scale investors, often called “whales,” has counteracted the buying pressure from ETFs. Second, broader cryptocurrency market volatility has created headwinds for all digital assets, including XRP. Therefore, ETF inflows alone are not a guaranteed short-term price catalyst; they exist within a complex ecosystem of competing market forces. The Critical Challenge: Does XRP Need Its Own Story? Analysts point to a deeper, more strategic hurdle. For XRP to achieve sustained, long-term growth, it must cultivate a unique investment narrative separate from Bitcoin. While Bitcoin is often viewed as “digital gold,” XRP’s value proposition is tightly linked to its utility in cross-border payments and banking solutions. The success of XRP spot ETFs provides the fuel, but a compelling, distinct story about real-world adoption and efficiency is the engine needed for a lasting rally. What’s the Future for XRP and Its Spot ETFs? The initial success of these funds is undeniable and marks a pivotal moment. However, the path forward involves navigating the disconnect between institutional investment and retail market sentiment. Continued growth for XRP spot ETFs will likely depend on: Clarity in regulatory landscapes. Tangible advancements in XRP’s core use cases for global finance. A stabilization in the broader crypto market to reduce overarching volatility. The $1.2 billion inflow is a powerful foundation, but the next chapter will be written by adoption, utility, and market maturity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What are spot XRP ETFs? A: Spot XRP ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold the actual XRP cryptocurrency. They allow investors to buy shares that track the live price of XRP without needing to buy and store the tokens themselves. Q: How much money have XRP ETFs gathered since launch? A: U.S. spot XRP ETFs have seen approximately $1.2 billion in net inflows since their launch on November 13. Q: Which XRP ETF has the most assets? A: As of the latest reports, the Canary spot XRP ETF is the largest, with around $335 million in assets under management (AUM). Q: If so much money is flowing in, why isn’t the XRP price higher? A: The price is being suppressed by selling pressure from large holders and general volatility in the wider cryptocurrency market. ETF buying is one of several factors influencing price. Q: What does XRP need for long-term price growth? A: Analysts suggest XRP needs to establish a strong, unique narrative focused on its utility in payments and banking, moving beyond simply following Bitcoin’s market trends. Q: Are XRP ETFs a good investment? A: Like any investment, XRP ETFs carry risk. They offer a regulated way to gain exposure to XRP, but their performance is tied to the volatile crypto market.

A significant 25% of these affluent investors plan to expand their cryptocurrency investments in the coming years. This indicates a strategic, rather than speculative, approach to digital assets. Why Are Chinese HNWIs Cautiously Optimistic About Crypto? The current low allocation reflects a traditionally conservative portfolio structure. Chinese asset owners typically center their wealth on pillars like: Gold as a physical store of value. Insurance products for security and legacy planning. Real estate , though its prominence has shifted. Therefore, the planned increase signals a pivotal shift. Investors are beginning to view crypto not as a fringe gamble, but as a legitimate component of a diversified, modern portfolio. This acceptance is a crucial step for broader cryptocurrency adoption within regulated financial frameworks. Is Overseas Investment the Key Driver for Crypto Interest? The report highlights an aggressive interest in overseas opportunities. Notably, 6% of wealthy Chinese individuals identified cryptocurrency as an overseas investment product they might pursue within the next year. This trend suggests two things: Cryptocurrency is perceived as a global, borderless asset class. It may serve as a channel for diversification beyond domestic markets and capital controls. Consequently, for Chinese HNWIs , crypto represents both a technological investment and a potential tool for international wealth strategy. Could AI Revive the NFT and Digital Collectibles Market? Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, the report casts an eye on the future of digital collectibles. It projects that the growing prominence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) could revive interest in NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). How? AI can drive new forms of creative content, gaming assets, and verifiable digital ownership, making NFTs more functional and integrated into the digital economy. This synergy between AI and blockchain could create the next wave of popular digital assets. What Are the Actionable Insights for the Crypto Market? This data is not just a snapshot; it’s a roadmap. The cautious but growing allocation from Chinese HNWIs points to a maturation phase. The market should note: Education is paramount: Investors seek strategic understanding, not just hype. Regulatory clarity attracts capital: Clear frameworks foster confidence. Integration with traditional finance will be key for wealth managers. The planned increase in crypto investment signifies a vote of confidence in the asset class’s long-term viability. Conclusion: A Strategic Shift in Global Wealth Portfolios The Hurun report unveils a nuanced narrative.

US Lawmakers Propose Tax Relief,https://bitcoinist.com/stablecoins-get-a-break-us-lawmakers-propose-tax-relief/,"Lawmakers in the US have put forward a discussion draft that would ease tax reporting for small stablecoin payments and let some crypto earners delay taxes on staking and mining rewards. According to reports, the plan was circulated by Representatives Max Miller (R-Ohio) and Steven Horsford (D-Nev.). The proposal aims to clear up rules that many say are confusing for everyday users and small businesses. Stablecoin Safe Harbor For Small Payments Based on reports , the draft would create a safe harbor for regulated dollar-pegged stablecoins when they are used like cash. Under the plan, capital gains on stablecoin transactions under $200 would be exempt from tax. That $200 threshold is meant to stop everyday buys — coffee, tips, small fees — from triggering tax paperwork and capital gains calculations. The exemption would only apply to stablecoins issued by a permitted issuer and that keep a stable peg to the USD. A Deferral Option For Staking And Mining Rewards Reports have disclosed another major change: taxpayers could elect to defer taxes on staking and mining rewards. Instead of being taxed the moment rewards are received, a taxpayer could choose to defer recognition for up to five years. After that period ends the rewards would be taxed as ordinary income at fair market value. The choice would be voluntary, and some taxpayers might still face tax when they sell or convert assets later. Mark-To-Market And Wash Sale Provisions Also Included The draft does more than just touch stablecoins and staking. It would apply wash sale rules to digital assets, which limits the ability to claim artificial losses by quickly repurchasing the same token. It also creates a path to elect mark-to-market accounting for certain traders, which would treat their holdings as sold at year-end for tax calculations. These moves are meant to align crypto tax practice closer to other parts of the tax code and to reduce gaps the IRS says exist. A Draft, Not Yet A Bill Lawmakers described the text as a discussion draft and have been talking with stakeholders and committees. The measure has not been formally introduced as a bill, and changes could come as it moves through the House Ways and Means Committee. If enacted, the framework is written to take effect for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Targeted for the first half of 2026, this ambitious update promises to tackle some of Ethereum’s most persistent challenges head-on. For anyone invested in the future of decentralized finance and applications, understanding the Glamsterdam upgrade is crucial, as it aims to refine the very core of how the Ethereum protocol operates. What Exactly Is the Glamsterdam Upgrade? Core developers have started the preparatory work for Glamsterdam, as reported by CoinDesk. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a planned systemic overhaul with clear objectives. The primary goals are to enhance transparency, reinforce decentralization, and improve the network’s overall efficiency. The developers plan to resume detailed discussions in January 2026 to finalize the scope, but the key pillars are already taking shape. At its heart, the Glamsterdam upgrade seeks to implement a profound change by separating the roles of block proposers and block builders. This separation is a direct move to combat centralization pressures within the network’s validator ecosystem. Furthermore, the upgrade will focus on boosting data processing speeds and introducing mechanisms to stabilize the often-volatile gas fees, which are a constant pain point for users. Why Is the Glamsterdam Upgrade a Game-Changer? The planned changes within the Glamsterdam upgrade address fundamental aspects of Ethereum’s operation. Let’s break down the key benefits this upgrade is designed to deliver: Enhanced Decentralization: By separating proposers and builders, the Glamsterdam upgrade reduces the risk of validator centralization, keeping the network true to its foundational principles. Improved User Experience: Faster data processing and more stable gas fees mean smoother and more predictable transactions for everyone using dApps or DeFi protocols. Greater Transparency: The structural changes aim to make the block production process more visible and fair, increasing trust in the network. However, executing an upgrade of this magnitude is not without its challenges. The complexity of modifying core protocol mechanics requires meticulous planning and extensive testing to ensure network security and stability remain intact. The long timeline, targeting H1 2026, reflects the careful, deliberate approach developers are taking with the Glamsterdam upgrade. What Comes After Glamsterdam? Meet Hegota Ethereum’s development roadmap is a continuous journey. Immediately following the Glamsterdam upgrade, developers have already penciled in the next phase: Hegota, slated for the second half of 2026. While Glamsterdam focuses on proposer-builder separation and fee mechanics, Hegota will tackle a different critical issue: node storage capacity. As the blockchain grows, the data storage requirements for running a full node increase, which can discourage participation and hurt decentralization. The Hegota upgrade aims to address this by implementing solutions that manage historical data more efficiently, ensuring that running a node remains accessible for the average participant. This one-two punch of Glamsterdam and Hegota shows a clear, strategic vision for Ethereum’s scalable and sustainable future. The Road Ahead for Ethereum and Its Community The announcement of the Glamsterdam upgrade marks a significant commitment to Ethereum’s long-term health. For developers building on Ethereum, these upgrades signal a more robust and efficient platform. For investors and users, they promise a better, more reliable experience. The multi-year timeline underscores that these are not reactive patches but thoughtfully planned evolutions. In conclusion, the Glamsterdam upgrade represents a pivotal step in Ethereum’s maturation. It directly confronts the trade-offs between scalability, decentralization, and user experience. While the full technical specifications will crystallize in 2026, the direction is clear: a stronger, more resilient, and truly decentralized Ethereum. The work beginning now on the Glamsterdam upgrade lays the foundation for the next era of the world’s leading smart contract platform. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: When is the Glamsterdam upgrade expected to go live? A: The Glamsterdam upgrade is currently targeted for release in the first half of 2026. Developers will reconvene in January 2026 to finalize the detailed scope. Q: What is the main goal of the Glamsterdam upgrade? A: Its primary goals are to improve decentralization by separating block proposers and builders, enhance data processing speeds, and stabilize gas fees on the Ethereum network. Q: What is ‘proposer-builder separation’ mentioned for Glamsterdam? A: It’s a design change that splits the role of choosing transaction order (building) from the role of proposing the block to the network. This aims to reduce centralization and increase fairness. Q: What upgrade is planned after Glamsterdam? A: The next planned upgrade is called Hegota, targeted for H2 2026. It will focus on solving node storage capacity issues to keep Ethereum running efficiently. Q: Will the Glamsterdam upgrade require a hard fork? A> While not all details are set, upgrades of this scale typically require a coordinated hard fork, where all node operators must update their software to the new protocol rules. Q: How will the Glamsterdam upgrade affect gas fees? A: A key objective is to introduce mechanisms that lead to more stable and predictable gas fees, though the exact technical solution is part of the ongoing development work.

56156604,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=248530,1766359511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revealing Insight: How Differing Views Shape Bitcoin Price Predictions at Fundstrat,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tom-lee-bitcoin-price-predictions/,"BitcoinWorld Revealing Insight: How Differing Views Shape Bitcoin Price Predictions at Fundstrat Have you ever wondered why expert Bitcoin price predictions can vary so wildly? A recent leaked memo from financial research firm Fundstrat, suggesting a potential drop to $60,000, caused a stir. However, Chairman Tom Lee quickly provided crucial context, revealing a fascinating truth about how major firms analyze crypto markets. This internal diversity of opinion, far from being a weakness, offers a more complete picture for investors. What Did the Leaked Fundstrat Memo Actually Say? The document, believed to be from Sean Farrell, Head of Digital Asset Strategy, presented a cautious short-term outlook. It suggested Bitcoin could test $60,000 in the first half of the coming year. Furthermore, it projected Ethereum (ETH) might fall to between $1,800 and $2,000, and Solana (SOL) could see a range of $50 to $75. These figures immediately sparked discussion across crypto media and forums. Tom Lee, a well-known Bitcoin bull, moved to clarify the situation. He emphasized that Fundstrat does not enforce a single, monolithic view. Instead, the firm encourages different analytical perspectives. This means short-term tactical views can differ from long-term strategic outlooks, even within the same organization. Why Do Bitcoin Price Predictions Diverge? The core of Lee’s explanation lies in methodology. He detailed that his own Bitcoin price predictions are primarily driven by macroeconomic analysis. He focuses on broader market cycles and global liquidity conditions—factors like interest rates and central bank policies that affect all risk assets. In contrast, Sean Farrell’s approach centers on on-chain data and fund flows. This method scrutinizes the movement of capital into and out of crypto assets, exchange reserves, and derivatives market risk. Therefore, two experts looking at different datasets can logically arrive at different conclusions for the same asset. Tom Lee’s Lens: Macro cycles, institutional adoption, long-term liquidity trends. Sean Farrell’s Lens: Short-term capital flows, exchange net positions, derivatives market risk. What Can Investors Learn from This Episode? This incident is a powerful reminder for anyone following Bitcoin price predictions . First, treat any single price target or report as one piece of a much larger puzzle. A robust investment thesis should consider multiple angles and time horizons. Second, understand the analyst’s framework. Is their prediction based on technical patterns, on-chain fundamentals, macroeconomics, or a combination? Knowing the “why” behind a price target is often more valuable than the target itself. Finally, internal debate within a research firm is a sign of intellectual rigor, not confusion. It prevents groupthink and leads to more thorough analysis. Navigating the Future of Bitcoin Price Predictions So, where does this leave us? The key takeaway is that the cryptocurrency market is complex and multi-faceted. Relying on a single voice or methodology is risky. The most informed perspectives come from synthesizing views from different analytical schools—both the macro “big picture” and the micro “fund flows” data. Tom Lee’s clarification ultimately reinforces that smart market analysis embraces nuance. By understanding that experts like Lee and Farrell are examining different parts of the same elephant, investors can make more measured decisions rather than reacting to every headline. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What was the main point of Tom Lee’s clarification? A: Lee clarified that the leaked memo represented one internal, short-term viewpoint. He stressed that Fundstrat values diverse analytical approaches, and his own long-term, macro-driven outlook on Bitcoin may differ from other strategists’ short-term, flow-based models. Q: Who is Sean Farrell? A: Sean Farrell is the Head of Digital Asset Strategy at Fundstrat. He is known for his data-intensive approach, focusing on capital flows, on-chain metrics, and risk indicators to form his market outlook. Q: Should I be worried about Bitcoin dropping to $60,000? A> A single prediction is not a guarantee. It’s a scenario based on specific data and assumptions. Investors should consider it alongside other analyses and, most importantly, their own investment horizon and risk tolerance. Q: What’s the difference between macro and fund flow analysis? A: Macro analysis looks at large-scale economic factors like interest rates and inflation that influence all markets. Fund flow analysis tracks the actual movement of money into and out of specific assets, like Bitcoin ETFs or exchange wallets. Q: Does this mean Fundstrat is bearish on Bitcoin? A> Not necessarily. It shows the firm has multiple frameworks. Tom Lee remains publicly long-term bullish based on macro trends, while other team members may have cautious short-term views based on different data.

The coin’s critical support is at $0.000038. The upside is limited unless the price reclaims $0.000042–$ 0.000045. FLOKI on the daily timeframe FLOKI is trading around $0.0000406 on December 21, holding just above the lower Bollinger Band near $0.0000382, which signals sustained downside pressure rather than a completed bottom. The coin’s price continues to trade below the mid-band at $0.0000452, maintaining the bearish trend of the daily structure. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView FLOKI’s RSI sits near 38, showing weak momentum with no clear bullish divergence yet. The MACD remains negative and flat, indicating sellers are still in control, but momentum is no longer accelerating aggressively. A daily close below $0.000038 would result in a price drop to $0.000032–0.000034 zone, while any recovery remains capped below $0.000045. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the 4-hour timeframe, FLOKI is consolidating under the Alligator averages, with resistance stacked around $0.000041–0.000042. The sharp bearish candle followed by small-bodied candles suggests selling pressure is slowing, but OBV is drifting lower, confirming the absence of strong accumulation. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Likewise, the MACD is flattening near the zero line, indicating short-term stabilization rather than a reversal. A clean reclaim of $0.000042 is needed to shift the short-term bias bullish, while a loss of $0.000039 would likely resume the downtrend.

Directional clarity will come from either a breakdown below $0.000038 or a recovery above $0.000042–0.000045. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~11x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a market cap of up to $95 to $100 billion to hit $0.01, over 95x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

This comes as Solana’s on-chain SOL-USD volumes have grown to the point of being comparable to and even surpassing major centralized exchanges, like Binance and Bybit, highlighting its growing importance for real-time trading and liquidity recycling. Where is crypto liquidity parked? Questions about Ethereum’s dominance of the stablecoin volume and activity sector vanished when it posted a historic month in October 2025, processing approximately $2.82 trillion in stablecoin transfers, the highest monthly volume ever recorded. In November, its stablecoin transaction volume reached $1.94 trillion, and so far in December, it has done $1.61 trillion, according to data from The Block. The major stablecoin is USDT, which dominates by over 52%. “Ethereum is not just another smart contract platform. It has become the settlement layer for global dollar liquidity,” Waidmann wrote on X . “When serious money moves, it still settles on Ethereum mainnet. Not because it is the fastest. Because it is the most trusted.” By sheer scale, Ethereum has a stranglehold on being the primary settlement layer for institutional dollar flows, but Solana has made its case to a growing audience too. The network’s on-chain SOL-USD volume has exceeded the combined spot trading volume on Binance and Bybit for three consecutive months, according to Kaviish Sethi , who works in data and research at Artemis. Source: Kaviish Sethi on X Solana’s appeal lies in its high throughput and low transaction costs, which make it well-suited for frequent trading, payments, and smaller-value transfers. Solana or Ethereum? While Ethereum dominates in settlement and high-value flows, Solana is establishing itself as a venue where liquidity is actively used, recycled, and traded, reinforcing its role as a market-facing layer of the ecosystem. The stablecoin dominating the Solana markets is Circle’s USDC, which leads by over 68%. The stablecoin supply on Solana has risen to record levels, sitting at over $15 billion in market capitalization, having hit over $16 billion a few months ago, although this pales in comparison to Ethereum’s total stablecoin market cap of over $167 billion. “Solana isn’t just a memecoin chain . It’s becoming the liquidity layer of crypto,” Sethi stated . “This is what real adoption looks like.” The growth of both ecosystems shows that the crypto industry is growing beyond single-chain maximalism, because there’s also Tron, which is known to be one of the leading platforms for stablecoin, mostly USDT transactions. Stablecoin adoption has also increased globally as more jurisdictions, like the United States, have put out laws that regulate its issuance, among other guidelines. “Stablecoins made blockchains useful,” Waidmann concluded. “Ethereum made stablecoins reliable,” though Solana’s trajectory of innovative performance shows that reliability now comes in multiple forms, with both blockchains positioning themselves to capture the distinct segments of on-chain dollar liquidity.

This signals that the firm is committed to its high-stakes treasury strategy even as its MSTR stock falters. This comes as MSCI plans to remove Strategy Inc. from its global indices during its February review. The index provider has flagged concerns that the firm now functions more like an investment vehicle than an operating company. Still, market analysts have pointed out that the financial implications of such a move are severe. Traders and institutions jockey as Bitcoin Tests $90K resistance zone Saylor’s signal arrives as BTC trades around the $90,000 level and the formation of liquidity clusters, providing insight into the short-term market outlook. In a brief post , the executive stated that Green Dots led Orange Dots, which was followed by a graph showing the Bitcoin acquisitions of his firm. Analysts often interpret the message as a hint that more Bitcoin buying could be forthcoming soon. The post continues a year-long pattern Saylor has used to hint at a new BTC purchase. Notably, such a weekend teaser is usually followed by a Monday morning SEC filing confirming a significant acquisition. Still, the last time Saylor hinted at more BTC buys with green dots, Strategy established a Bitcoin reserve for dividend payments in addition to buying more BTC. This means there’s a possibility of another move besides BTC purchases again this time. The Strategy executive chairman ’s past behavior adds weight to the signal. He has often used brief, symbolic posts before announcing major Bitcoin purchases. Institutional signals sometimes drive temporary sentiment about the BTC price. Traders are motivated to position themselves based on their expectations for purchases, even if they haven’t made a purchase yet. These investors can reduce their exposure in the short term or exit their positions when the price approaches resistance, or hedge by selling near the anticipated resistance zone. Tom Lee’s Fundstrat has also cautioned that Bitcoin could reach $60,000, even with longer-term optimism persisting. Bitcoin is trading near a heavy resistance zone around $90,000, where liquidity and sell orders are concentrated. Another crypto analyst, Ted Pillows, says market makers may sweep all three liquidity clusters in the next few days as Bitcoin tests the $90,000 level. Markets often move toward these zones as traders seek to fill large orders. According to on-chain data cited by Pillars, large clusters of resting liquidity are present at that level, creating a temporary barrier for price movement. A strong buyer stepping in near this zone could influence how Bitcoin reacts to that resistance. The leading crypto’s current structure makes the message especially notable. Institutional demand keeps Bitcoin supported amid volatility Liquidity data shows price magnets both above and below current levels. The largest group of upside liquidity is around $90,000, while the downside liquidity ranges from $86,000 to $84,000. This suggests that institutional interest in BTC remains, despite recent volatility. Even after incurring some substantial outflows last week, ETFs still maintain substantial Bitcoin balances. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is among the top six ETFs of this year. Additionally, corporate treasuries remain active in the market. These are part of the reasons why BTC demand is not falling even at increased prices.

Have you checked the market’s pulse today? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a crucial barometer for investor emotion, has inched up to 25. This five-point climb from yesterday offers a fragile sign of relief, but the overarching message remains clear: the cryptocurrency market is still gripped by extreme fear . Understanding this index is key to navigating the volatile crypto landscape. What Exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? Think of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as the market’s emotional heartbeat. Created by data provider Alternative.me, it quantifies the collective sentiment of cryptocurrency investors on a simple scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 screams “Extreme Fear,” while 100 shouts “Extreme Greed.” The current reading of 25, though improved, firmly sits in the “Extreme Fear” zone. But how is this number calculated? It’s not a guess; it’s a data-driven formula. How is the Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The index synthesizes data from six key market dimensions to avoid reliance on any single metric. This multi-source approach provides a more holistic view. Here’s the breakdown: Volatility (25%): Measures current price swings against historical averages. High volatility often correlates with fear. Market Volume (25%): Analyzes trading volume and momentum. Unusual volume can signal strong sentiment shifts. Social Media (15%): Tracks the volume and sentiment of crypto mentions on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Incorporates data from polls and community sentiment platforms. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Monitors Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Rising dominance can indicate a “flight to safety.” Google Trends (10%): Measures search volume for cryptocurrency-related terms. What Does a Score of 25 Mean for Your Portfolio? A Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 25 presents a classic contrarian signal. Historically, prolonged periods of extreme fear have often preceded significant market rebounds. For investors, this environment demands a balanced strategy. For the cautious investor, it’s a reminder to stick to fundamentals, avoid emotional selling, and consider dollar-cost averaging into strong projects. For the opportunistic trader, extreme fear can uncover undervalued assets. However, the key challenge is timing. Sentiment can remain depressed for extended periods, and a slight improvement does not guarantee an immediate rally. Actionable Insights in a Fearful Market Navigating a fearful market requires discipline. First, use the index as a context tool, not a timing tool. Second, review your portfolio’s risk exposure. Third, consider this a research phase to identify quality projects that may be oversold. Finally, remember that market cycles are inevitable. While the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index signals distress, it also maps a potential road to recovery for those who prepare. Conclusion: Reading Between the Emotional Lines The rise to 25 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a minor positive in a sea of negative sentiment. It highlights that while fear dominates, there are subtle shifts beneath the surface. For savvy participants, understanding this metric provides a strategic edge, separating market noise from actionable signal. The path from fear to greed is rarely a straight line, but tracking this journey is essential for long-term success in cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a good Crypto Fear & Greed Index score? There’s no universally “good” score. Extremely low scores (0-25) can signal buying opportunities for contrarians, while extremely high scores (75-100) often warn of potential market tops. Many investors watch for sustained moves out of extreme zones. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index is updated daily, typically once per day. This allows investors to track sentiment shifts on a regular basis without the noise of minute-by-minute fluctuations. Can the Fear & Greed Index predict Bitcoin price? No, it cannot predict exact price movements. It is a sentiment indicator that shows the market’s emotional temperature. It is best used alongside technical and fundamental analysis, not as a standalone prediction tool. Why does the index focus so much on Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s market dominance is a component because it often acts as a “safe haven” within crypto during turmoil. When fear rises, money may flow from altcoins into Bitcoin, increasing its dominance. Is extreme fear always a buy signal? Not always. While extreme fear has preceded major rallies, markets can remain fearful for long periods. It should be considered a potential alert for value, not an automatic trigger to invest. Where can I check the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index is publicly available on websites like Alternative.me. Many major cryptocurrency news and data platforms also display it or provide similar sentiment analysis tools.

This Monday, CME Bitcoin futures opened with a dramatic $695 gap, sending a clear signal to attentive traders. This isn’t just a random blip; it’s a direct window into the relentless 24/7 energy of the crypto spot market clashing with traditional finance hours. Let’s unpack what this CME Bitcoin futures gap really means for your strategy. What Exactly Is a CME Bitcoin Futures Gap? Simply put, a CME Bitcoin futures gap is the price difference between where the futures contract closes on Friday and where it reopens on Monday. The CME, or Chicago Mercantile Exchange, follows a traditional schedule. It closes for the weekend. Bitcoin, however, never sleeps. Its global spot market trades continuously. Therefore, when the CME reopens, its futures price must instantly adjust to catch up with all the buying and selling that happened over Saturday and Sunday. This catch-up creates the gap. The wider the gap, the more significant the weekend price movement in the underlying Bitcoin market was. Why Should You Care About This $695 Signal? This specific $695 CME Bitcoin futures gap from $87,895 to $88,570 is more than a number. It’s a market footprint. It tells us that over the weekend, bullish sentiment dominated the spot markets, pushing prices higher. Now, traders watch for a potential “gap fill.” Market theory suggests these gaps often act as magnets, with prices tending to retrace to fill the void. This creates a self-fulfilling prophecy as traders position for the move. However, it’s not a guaranteed rule. Bullish Gap: A gap up (like this $695 one) indicates strong weekend buying. A fill would mean a price drop back toward the Friday close. Bearish Gap: A gap down signals selling pressure. A fill would mean a price rally. No Fill: Sometimes, the gap remains open, acting as a new support or resistance level, confirming a strong trend. How Can Traders Use Futures Gaps for Actionable Insights? Understanding CME Bitcoin futures gaps provides a tactical edge. They offer a structured way to view market sentiment shifts that occur outside traditional hours. Here’s how savvy investors use them: Identify Sentiment Shifts: The gap direction is a clear, unfiltered read on weekend market emotion. Plan Entry/Exit Points: The gap area can serve as a potential profit target or a zone to place stop-loss orders. Gauge Institutional Activity: The CME is a hub for institutional players. Gaps can reflect their adjusted positions after a weekend of analysis. Remember, while powerful, a gap is just one piece of the puzzle. Always combine this analysis with other indicators like trading volume, overall market trends, and major news events. What Are the Risks of Trading the Gap? Relying solely on the CME Bitcoin futures gap strategy carries inherent risks. The expectation of a fill is a common tendency, not an iron law. A strong, sustained trend can easily ignore an open gap. Furthermore, other macroeconomic factors or breaking crypto news can immediately override any gap-based technical setup. The key is to use the gap as a context-setting tool, not a crystal ball. It helps you understand *where* price might feel a pull, not a definitive prediction of *where* it will go. Conclusion: The Gap as Your Weekend Translator This week’s $695 CME Bitcoin futures gap is a perfect case study. It translates two days of decentralized, global Bitcoin trading into a single, digestible signal on a regulated exchange. By mastering this concept, you gain insight into hidden momentum and potential future price magnets. In the volatile world of crypto, tools that help decode silence are invaluable. Keep watching these gaps—they tell the story of what happens when traditional finance takes a break, but the digital economy charges ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is a CME futures gap unique to Bitcoin? A: No, gaps occur in futures for any asset traded on exchanges with closed periods. However, they are especially pronounced for Bitcoin due to its 24/7 spot market. Q2: How often do CME Bitcoin futures gaps get filled? A: While many gaps are filled, it’s not a 100% certainty. The probability varies with market conditions. Some gaps fill quickly, others take time, and a few may never close. Q3: Can retail traders profit from these gaps? A: Yes, but with caution. Traders might place limit orders near the gap area, anticipating a fill. However, this requires careful risk management, as prices may not reach the gap level. Q4: Does a larger gap mean a stronger price signal? A: Generally, yes. A larger CME Bitcoin futures gap indicates more significant price movement and potentially stronger sentiment over the weekend, making the gap area a more notable technical level. Q5: What’s the difference between a CME gap and a price gap on a crypto exchange? A: A CME gap is caused by exchange hours. A price gap on a continuous crypto exchange is rarer and usually caused by extreme volatility or liquidity issues between trades. Found this breakdown of the crucial CME Bitcoin futures gap helpful?

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, Bitcoin is now trading at $89,009.66 on the Binance USDT market. This surge marks a significant milestone and has traders and investors asking: what’s fueling this impressive rally? What’s Driving the Current BTC Price Rally? The jump in the BTC price above $89,000 is not happening in a vacuum. Several key factors are contributing to this bullish momentum. First, increasing institutional adoption continues to provide a solid foundation of demand. Furthermore, macroeconomic conditions, such as concerns about inflation, often lead investors to seek assets like Bitcoin as a potential store of value. This combination creates a powerful tailwind for the leading cryptocurrency. Why Does This $89,000 Level Matter for Bitcoin? Breaking past major psychological price levels, like $89,000, is crucial for market sentiment. It often acts as a trigger for several market behaviors: FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): Retail investors may enter the market, fearing they will miss further gains. Technical Breakout: This price action can signal a breakout from previous trading ranges, attracting algorithmic and technical traders. Media Attention: Major milestones generate headlines, bringing Bitcoin back into the mainstream conversation. Therefore, sustaining this BTC price level is the next critical challenge for the bull run. What Are the Immediate Implications for Traders? For active participants in the market, a rising BTC price presents both opportunity and risk. On one hand, long-term holders see their convictions validated. On the other hand, short-term traders must navigate increased volatility. Key considerations now include: Monitoring key support and resistance levels around the new price point. Being aware of potential profit-taking that could lead to a pullback. Assessing the strength of the volume supporting the price increase. A healthy rally is typically accompanied by strong, sustained trading volume. Could the BTC Price Climb Even Higher? While past performance never guarantees future results, analyzing market structure can provide clues. The breach of $89,000 opens the door to test even higher resistance levels. Market analysts will now watch to see if Bitcoin can gather the momentum to challenge the next major thresholds. However, it’s essential to remember that the cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile, and corrections are a normal part of any major uptrend. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Bitcoin The surge of the BTC price above $89,000 is a testament to Bitcoin’s growing resilience and its evolving role in the global financial landscape. This move reinforces its position as the market leader and sets a new benchmark for the current cycle. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a curious observer, this rally underscores the dynamic and transformative potential of digital assets.

Why Are This Week’s Key Financial Events So Crucial? Economic data acts as a pulse check for global markets. When central banks and governments release figures, they provide clues about future policy. For crypto, which often reacts to shifts in liquidity and risk sentiment, these key financial events can trigger significant volatility. Understanding them helps you anticipate moves rather than just react. December 22nd: A Dual Focus on China and the U.S. The week kicks off with two major announcements. First, China announces its Loan Prime Rate (LPR). As a benchmark for lending rates, it signals the direction of monetary policy in the world’s second-largest economy. A change here can impact global commodity demand and risk appetite. Later, the U.S. releases Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data for October. The Federal Reserve watches this inflation gauge closely. A higher-than-expected reading could reinforce a “higher for longer” interest rate stance, potentially pressuring risk assets like stocks and crypto. 1:00 a.m. UTC: China Loan Prime Rate (LPR) 3:00 p.m. UTC: U.S. Core PCE Price Index (October) December 23rd: Taking the Economy’s Temperature On Tuesday, the spotlight returns to the U.S. with the preliminary release of third-quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This figure measures the total value of goods and services produced. It’s a broad indicator of economic health. Strong GDP growth might delay hopes for Fed rate cuts, while weak data could fuel them. Crypto markets frequently interpret delayed cuts as negative for liquidity, making this one of the week’s most pivotal key financial events . 1:30 p.m. UTC: U.S. GDP (Third Quarter, Preliminary) Navigating Holiday Hours and Key Data The Christmas holiday introduces a unique dynamic. While U.S. markets are closed on December 24th and 25th, important data is still released. Initial jobless claims, a weekly measure of layoffs, come out on the 24th. This can cause outsized moves in thinly traded markets, as fewer participants can lead to amplified volatility. Always check your exchange’s holiday schedule for any changes in liquidity or leverage. December 24th & 25th: U.S. Markets Closed (Christmas) 1:30 p.m. UTC (Dec 24th): U.S. Initial Jobless Claims Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders How should you approach these key financial events ? First, mark them on your calendar. Second, understand the likely narrative. Hot inflation (PCE) and strong growth (GDP) are typically seen as hawkish for the Fed, which can be a headwind for crypto. Conversely, weak data may be interpreted as bullish for potential rate cuts. However, remember that markets often “buy the rumor, sell the news.” The price reaction can be counterintuitive, so manage your risk accordingly. Conclusion: Your Week-Ahead Strategy This week’s calendar of key financial events provides a clear roadmap of potential market catalysts. From Chinese policy signals to crucial U.S. inflation and growth data, each release holds the power to influence trader sentiment across all asset classes. By preparing for these moments, you position yourself to make more informed decisions, whether you’re trading Bitcoin, Ethereum, or traditional equities. Stay vigilant, especially around the holiday-thinned trading, and let the data guide your strategy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Why do crypto markets care about traditional economic data like PCE and GDP? A: Crypto is no longer an isolated asset class. It is influenced by global macro factors like interest rates and liquidity. Data that shapes Federal Reserve policy directly impacts the cost of capital and investor risk appetite, which flows into digital asset prices. Q: How can I prepare for volatility around these events? A> Consider reducing high leverage positions ahead of major announcements, set stop-loss orders to manage risk, and ensure you have access to real-time news feeds. Also, be aware that spreads may widen on exchanges during data releases. Q: The U.S. markets are closed for Christmas. Will crypto trading be affected? A> Crypto markets operate 24/7, so trading will continue. However, liquidity can be significantly lower during major traditional market holidays, which may lead to sharper, more volatile price swings with less volume. Q: What is the single most important event for crypto this week? A> The U.S. Core PCE data is likely the most critical. As the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, it has the highest potential to alter interest rate expectations, a primary driver of market sentiment.

Future quantum attacks pose a significant challenge to the current blockchain system. This has prompted blockchain developers to engage in discussions on how to tackle this issue. Some of these discussions included considering some updates to protocols. However, Hoskinson advised developers that the biggest challenge is timing; hence, they needed to focus on this aspect instead of certain amendments required. He further warned that acting rashly could result in high costs for blockchain networks. According to him, the cryptographic tools essential to protect blockchain technology from future quantum attacks are already accessible. Hoskinson guides blockchain developers in preparation for future quantum attacks Hoskinson pointed out that the US National Institute of Standards and Technology made post-quantum standards public in 2024. Following this release, the Cardano founder highlighted that the key issue is based on the costs associated with executing new protocols before validators and miners are ready. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that while several researchers believe that cutting-edge quantum computers could ultimately break current cryptography, reports from sources reveal that there is still less consensus on when this threat might materialize. However, based on the recently announced predictions, practical quantum computing could occur anytime from a few years to more than ten years from now. Still, Hoskinson advised blockchain developers to focus on concrete developments rather than hype and corporate timelines when evaluating how soon this danger might materialize. One of the suitable ways the Cardano founder suggested was for them to shift their focus to DARPA’s Quantum Benchmarking Initiative. According to his argument, this program conducts tests on several quantum computing methods to determine whether they can produce useful outcomes. “It’s the best independent and objective standard we can use to see if quantum computers will be real, when they will arrive, and who will build them,” Hoskinson said. Notably, DARPA has decided that 2033 will be the year in which it will determine if large-scale quantum computing is feasible. Hoskinson reveals a suitable solution for a major emerging problem in the crypto industry Similar to other leading networks, such as Bitcoin , Ethereum, and Solana, reports from reliable sources have highlighted that Cardano utilizes elliptic-curve cryptography. It is worth noting that such a method is at great risk because of Shor’s algorithm, that is, in the event of the development of very powerful quantum computers. This news raised tension in the crypto ecosystem as developers ignited heated debates. To address this controversy, Hoskinson noted that the industry knows suitable ways to curb this problem. Nonetheless, he mentioned that this approach is centered on deciding between two different cryptographic methods. To further elaborate on this point, he stated that the two options to choose from include Hashes, which is utilized by Ethereum, and lattices, which is actually their preferred choice. Concerning Hoskinson’s statement, analysts weighed in on the matter. They highlighted that Hash-based cryptography relies on cryptographic hash functions to produce digital signatures effectively, which are widely recognized as the most secure approach against future quantum threats. The analysts also pointed out that these systems are straightforward, thoroughly researched, and established to be cautious. However, they are mainly used for signing data and are not preferable for general encryption purposes.

If you’ve been waiting for the explosive growth of alternative cryptocurrencies, recent data delivers a sobering message. The Altcoin Season Index currently sits at a mere 17, a clear signal that Bitcoin is firmly in the driver’s seat. This crucial metric tells us we are deep in a ‘Bitcoin season,’ leaving many investors wondering when the tide will turn for other digital assets. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? Before we panic or celebrate, let’s understand the tool. CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index is a simple but powerful gauge. It measures the percentage of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) that have outperformed Bitcoin over a 90-day window. The calculation is straightforward: Track the performance of the top 100 coins against Bitcoin. Count how many have posted better gains. If 75% or more outperform Bitcoin, an ‘altcoin season’ is officially declared. Therefore, a score of 17 means only a small fraction of major altcoins are beating the king of crypto. This index is your reality check against market hype. Why Does a Low Altcoin Season Index Matter? A reading this low isn’t just a number; it has real implications for your strategy. It indicates strong capital rotation into Bitcoin, often driven by institutional interest through ETFs or macroeconomic factors like inflation hedging. During these phases, money flows out of riskier altcoins and into the perceived safety and liquidity of Bitcoin. For investors, this means: Portfolio Underperformance: A diversified altcoin portfolio may lag significantly behind a simple Bitcoin holding. Reduced Speculative Fever: The ‘moonshot’ mentality cools, and projects need real utility to attract attention. Consolidation Opportunities: For long-term believers, this can be a time to research and accumulate quality altcoins at lower prices. Is This the End for Altcoins? Historical Context Says No Take a deep breath. History shows these cycles are normal. The crypto market moves in distinct waves. Intense ‘Bitcoin seasons’ are typically followed by periods where altcoins catch up and even surge past BTC’s returns. The index has swung from single digits to above the 75 threshold multiple times in past cycles. The current low Altcoin Season Index reading may simply be setting the stage for the next major rotation. Patience and a long-term perspective are key. Actionable Insights in a Bitcoin-Dominant Market So, what should you do when the Altcoin Season Index is stuck at 17? Instead of fearing the data, use it to inform smarter decisions. Reassess Your Allocation: Is your portfolio balance aligned with the current market regime? It may be wise to ensure a healthy Bitcoin allocation. Focus on Fundamentals: Use this quieter period to deeply research altcoin projects. Look for strong development activity, real-world use cases, and resilient communities. Dollar-Cost Average: If you believe in specific altcoins long-term, consider systematic buying during this phase to lower your average entry cost. Watch for the Flip: Monitor the Altcoin Season Index for a sustained move above 50, which could signal the beginning of a shift in momentum. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto Seasons The Altcoin Season Index at 17 is a powerful snapshot of today’s market reality, not a permanent verdict. It confirms Bitcoin’s current strength and the challenging environment for altcoins. However, understanding this cycle is the first step to navigating it successfully. By respecting the trend, focusing on fundamentals, and preparing for the eventual shift, you can position your portfolio not just to survive the Bitcoin winter, but to thrive when the altcoin spring returns. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Where can I check the current Altcoin Season Index? A: You can find the live Altcoin Season Index on CoinMarketCap’s website under their ‘Indices’ section. Q: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? A: The index is typically updated daily, reflecting the rolling 90-day performance data. Q: Does a low index mean all altcoins are losing money? A: Not necessarily. It means they are underperforming Bitcoin. Some altcoins may still have positive price action, just not as strong as BTC’s. Q: What usually triggers a shift from Bitcoin season to altcoin season? A: Shifts can be triggered by Bitcoin price stabilization, new technological narratives (like DeFi or NFTs in past cycles), or a surge of new capital seeking higher returns in smaller-cap projects. Q: Should I sell all my altcoins when the index is low? A> A blanket sell-off is rarely a good strategy. It’s better to review each holding based on its fundamentals and your investment thesis. The index is a macro tool, not specific investment advice. Found this breakdown of the Altcoin Season Index helpful?

It usually follows it. The long-lasting projects are willing to build silently as well as sort out difficult issues initially and acquire fame subsequently. This phase is missed by a lot of investors since it is not a glamorous one on the surface. But here is where the best moves are usually made. A single emerging DeFi crypto seems to have broken through that invisible barrier of infrastructure being complete and focus beginning to catch up. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project developing a decentralized ethereum-based lending and borrowing system. Its design is based on two lending paths which deal with various users. On the one hand, the users have an opportunity to provide assets to pooled markets and obtain mtTokens. These are their deposits and earned yield in the form of these mtTokens. Borrowers on the other hand have access to liquidity as they vary depending on market conditions (Rule of Collateral). The protocol is constructed based on dynamic interest rates, collateral thresholds, and liquidation systems. These are not outward aspects. They are the fundamental engine that enable a lending platform to perform at scale in a safe manner. This infrastructure is being ready before the V1 release on the Sepolia testnet scheduled to happen in Q4 2025. Infrastructure Progress In the case of real infrastructure, participation begins to increase preceding headlines. This can normally be traced in the consistent increase instead of sudden peaks. Mutuum Finance has accumulated $19.4M already and has more than 18,600 holders. Over 820M tokens were already sold. These figures did not happen just like that. These constructions were constructed gradually, which is a more usual indication of health. The early investor feeling is that it is not a short term frenzy and hence the constant growth rate. These trends are normally observed to emerge before the attention of the wider market can be collected. Token Growth and Presale When a protocol is ready, then token structure comes into play. The total supply of the Mutuum Finance is 4B MUTM. 45% or approximately 1.82B of this amount are issued to the presale. Phase 6 is currently at the advanced stage at over 99% allocation with the token at the value of $0.035. MUTM has already increased 250% since it started its presale in early 2025 since the price of Phase 1 was $0.01. Supplies do not increase before infrastructure is created but after it. Price pressure tends to increase as the availability is reduced and the usage expectations are high. Other analysts are of the view that after V1 is launched, MUTM may rise above $0.06, indicating that early investors would be at a good position. Security as Last Infrastructure Layer The final box that serious users wait to be checked before is security. Mutuum Finance was also CertiK audited with their 90 out of 100 token scan score. Besides this, Halborn security is going through the lending and borrowing contracts of the protocol. The code is completed, and is being analysed formally. It also has a $50k bug bounty that will motivate responsible disclosure of code vulnerabilities. Such measures are important since most investors will only invest funds when they see and believe in security structures. There are a number of indicators that visibility begins to increase. The next step of the protocol is the upcoming V1 testnet launch, which approaches the actual use of the protocol. The 24-hour leaderboard will give the highest daily contributor a reward of 500 in MUTM making him/her participate over and over again. There are equal card payments which make new users have less friction. Focus is likely to follow preparation rather than pledges. Mutuum Finance seems to be passing through the stage of infrastructure becoming visible. MUTM is getting harder to disregard by those following the potential best crypto to buy stories in Q4 2025.

An anonymous whale executed transactions worth $37.6 million, sending shockwaves through the DeFi community and raising questions about market stability. This event highlights the powerful influence large holders can have on asset valuations. What Caused the Sudden AAVE Price Drops? According to on-chain data from Onchain Lens, the catalyst was clear. Over a three-hour period, a wallet address starting with 0xa923 sold 230,350 AAVE tokens. The whale didn’t simply cash out for stablecoins; instead, they swapped their AAVE for two major assets: 5,869.46 stETH (worth $17.52 million) and 227.8 WBTC (worth $20.07 million). This strategic move away from AAVE and into other blue-chip crypto assets immediately pressured the market. Consequently, the AAVE price drops reflected this sudden increase in selling pressure. Breaking Down the Whale’s $37.6 Million Move Let’s examine the mechanics of this substantial transaction. The whale’s actions provide a case study in large-scale portfolio management. Asset Sold: 230,350 AAVE tokens. Total Value: $37.59 million at the time of the swaps. Assets Acquired: The whale diversified into staked Ethereum (stETH) and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). Market Impact: The sale contributed directly to the reported 9.57% decline in AAVE’s value over 24 hours. This wasn’t a panic sell into fiat but a calculated reallocation within the crypto ecosystem. However, the sheer size of the trade was enough to trigger the notable AAVE price drops observed across exchanges. How Do Whale Transactions Affect Crypto Markets? Whale movements are a critical factor for any crypto investor to monitor. These large holders, whether individuals or institutions, possess the power to move markets single-handedly. Their transactions often signal changing sentiments or strategic shifts. In this case, the whale’s decision to exit a large AAVE position likely prompted other traders to reassess their holdings, creating a cascade of selling. Therefore, understanding whale behavior is key to anticipating potential AAVE price drops or surges. What’s the Current State of AAVE? Following the sell-off, data from CoinMarketCap shows AAVE trading at approximately $161.70. The 24-hour chart clearly shows the dip correlating with the whale’s activity. While a 10% correction can be unsettling for holders, it’s essential to view it within the broader context of crypto market volatility. Such events test the resilience of the project’s underlying fundamentals and its community’s conviction. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Events like this offer valuable lessons. First, they underscore the importance of on-chain analysis. Monitoring whale wallets can provide early warning signs. Second, diversification remains a cornerstone of risk management. Finally, investors should distinguish between technical price movements driven by large trades and fundamental changes to a project’s long-term prospects. While today’s news focuses on the AAVE price drops , the future will depend on the protocol’s adoption and innovation. In summary, the recent whale transaction serves as a potent reminder of the crypto market’s sensitivity to large-scale moves. The direct link between the $37.6 million sell-off and the subsequent AAVE price drops is a textbook example of on-chain activity driving exchange prices. For savvy investors, these events are not just headlines but opportunities to learn, adapt, and refine their strategies in the dynamic world of decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly is a “whale” in cryptocurrency? A: A “whale” is a term for an individual or entity that holds a large enough amount of a specific cryptocurrency that their buying or selling activity can significantly influence its market price. Q: Why did the whale swap AAVE for stETH and WBTC instead of USDT? A> This suggests the whale is not exiting the crypto market entirely but is rebalancing their portfolio. They may view stETH (yield-bearing Ethereum) and WBTC (Bitcoin on Ethereum) as having different risk/reward profiles or better short-term prospects than AAVE. Q: Should I sell my AAVE because of this whale sell-off? A> Investment decisions should be based on your own research, risk tolerance, and long-term thesis for the AAVE protocol. A whale’s trade reflects their strategy, which may not align with yours. Consider the project’s fundamentals alongside market movements. Q: How can I track whale movements myself? A> You can use on-chain analytics platforms like Etherscan, Nansen, or Arkham Intelligence. These tools allow you to track large transactions and monitor the wallets of major holders. Q: Is a 10% drop considered a major crash for a cryptocurrency like AAVE? A> In the highly volatile crypto market, 10% daily moves are not uncommon. While significant, it is not typically classified as a “crash.” It is, however, a substantial correction worthy of attention. Q: Could this price drop present a buying opportunity? A> Some traders view significant dips caused by single events (like a whale sell-off) as potential buying opportunities if they believe the project’s long-term value remains strong. This is known as “buying the dip,” but it carries inherent risk. Found this analysis of the AAVE price drops insightful? The crypto market moves fast, and knowledge is power.

This week brings significant token unlocks that could create notable market movements. Between December 22 and 28, several major projects will release substantial amounts of tokens into circulation. Understanding these events is crucial for making informed investment decisions and navigating potential volatility. What Are Token Unlocks and Why Do They Matter? Token unlocks represent scheduled releases of previously locked cryptocurrency tokens into the circulating supply. Projects typically lock tokens for team members, advisors, investors, or ecosystem development. When these token unlocks occur, they increase selling pressure as recipients may choose to sell their newly accessible holdings. However, they also represent important milestones in a project’s development timeline. This week’s schedule includes six significant releases worth monitoring closely. The timing coincides with the holiday period, which could amplify market reactions due to typically lower trading volumes. Let’s examine the specific token unlocks scheduled for this crucial week. Detailed Breakdown of This Week’s Token Unlocks According to data from Tokenomist, here are the major token unlocks scheduled from December 22-28: MBG : 15.84 million tokens ($8.06M) unlocking December 22 at 12:00 PM UTC UDS : 2.15 million tokens ($5.16M) unlocking December 23 at 12:00 AM UTC SOON : 21.88 million tokens ($8.82M) unlocking December 23 at 8:30 AM UTC H : 105 million tokens ($15.28M) unlocking December 25 at 12:00 AM UTC XPL : 88.89 million tokens ($11.5M) unlocking December 25 at 12:00 PM UTC JUP : 53.47 million tokens ($10.34M) unlocking December 28 at 2:00 PM UTC Each of these token unlocks represents a different percentage of circulating supply, with MBG leading at 8.42% and JUP being the most conservative at 1.73%. The Christmas Day releases for H and XPL tokens are particularly noteworthy given the holiday timing. How Should Investors Approach These Token Unlocks? Navigating token unlocks requires strategic thinking. First, consider the percentage of circulating supply being released. Higher percentages typically mean greater potential impact. Second, examine historical patterns for how each project’s tokens have behaved during previous unlock events. Some projects experience minimal price movement while others see significant volatility. Third, research the recipients of the unlocked tokens. Are they long-term supporters or short-term investors? Team and advisor tokens might have different selling patterns than venture capital holdings. Finally, consider overall market conditions. During bullish markets, token unlocks might be absorbed more easily, while bearish conditions could amplify selling pressure. Key Projects to Watch: H, XPL, and JUP Analysis Among this week’s token unlocks , three projects deserve special attention. The H token unlock represents $15.28 million entering circulation on Christmas Day. With 4.79% of circulating supply being released, this could create interesting trading opportunities. Similarly, XPL’s $11.5 million unlock later on December 25 adds another layer to the holiday trading dynamics. The JUP unlock on December 28 concludes the week with a more modest 1.73% of supply entering circulation. Each of these token unlocks tells a different story about project development and investor confidence. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders Successful navigation of token unlocks involves several practical strategies. Monitor trading volumes before and after unlock events for unusual activity. Set appropriate stop-loss orders if you hold affected tokens. Consider dollar-cost averaging if you believe in a project’s long-term fundamentals despite short-term unlock pressure. Additionally, watch for official project communications around unlock events. Some teams provide guidance about lock-up extensions or selling restrictions that could mitigate market impact. Remember that not all token unlocks lead to price declines—some represent maturation milestones that attract new investors. Conclusion: Navigating Token Unlock Volatility This week’s token unlocks present both challenges and opportunities for cryptocurrency market participants. By understanding the mechanics, timing, and potential impacts of these events, investors can make more informed decisions. The December 22-28 period serves as an excellent case study in how scheduled token releases interact with market dynamics, especially during holiday periods with potentially reduced liquidity. Successful crypto investing requires anticipating and responding to fundamental events like token unlocks . While they create short-term uncertainty, they also represent normal project development milestones. The key is balancing awareness of immediate market impacts with conviction about long-term project fundamentals. Frequently Asked Questions About Token Unlocks What exactly happens during a token unlock? During a token unlock, previously restricted tokens become available for trading. These tokens were typically locked for team members, early investors, or ecosystem development and become accessible according to a predetermined schedule. Do token unlocks always cause price drops? Not necessarily. While token unlocks often create selling pressure, the actual price impact depends on multiple factors including market conditions, the percentage of supply being unlocked, and recipient selling behavior. Some unlocks have minimal price effect. How can I find information about upcoming token unlocks? You can use cryptocurrency data platforms like Tokenomist, CoinMarketCap, or specialized token unlock calendars. Most projects also disclose unlock schedules in their official documentation and announcements. Should I sell my tokens before an unlock event? This depends on your investment strategy and research. Some investors sell before unlocks to avoid potential volatility, while others see them as buying opportunities if they believe the selling pressure is temporary and the project fundamentals remain strong. What’s the difference between token unlocks and token burns? Token unlocks increase circulating supply by releasing restricted tokens, while token burns permanently remove tokens from circulation, decreasing total supply. These are opposite mechanisms affecting token economics differently. How long do price effects from token unlocks typically last? Price effects vary widely. Some tokens recover within days, while others experience longer-term pressure. The duration depends on the unlock size, market conditions, and subsequent project developments.

Grossman’s remarks, in part within the context of a larger industry conversation, underscore the increasing confidence among blockchain proponents that real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, the act of representing traditional financial instruments on public blockchains, is already reshaping the global financial landscape. “While many feared digitization would destroy media, what it actually did was force its evolution,” Grossman said , adding that real-world asset tokenization, the process of representing traditional assets onchain, will force traditional institutions to adapt. He added: “This is no longer hypothetical. BlackRock is offering tokenized funds. Franklin Templeton is running tokenized money market funds on public blockchains. Major global banks are piloting onchain settlement, tokenized deposits and real-time asset movement.” The RWA industry, minus stablecoins, has a market capitalization of almost $19 billion, according to RWA.XYZ. Financial giants such as Citi , Bank of America, and JPMorgan Chase continue to exist. Still, they will do so in a different medium, much as media companies shifted to digital media in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Grossman emphasized that those who will succeed in tokenized finance will adapt, not resist, as the world transitions into a blockchain-powered global financial system. Tokenization cuts costs and accelerates settlements Tokenization for real assets offers several advantages , including 24/7 access to markets beyond local borders, a wide-ranging scale of exchange, lower transaction costs resulting from disintermediation, and settlement times of minutes instead of days. Tokenized assets enable the markets not only to remain agnostic and continue ongoing operations, but they also reduce the number of intermediaries and the complexity of those intermediaries necessary, thereby lowering transaction costs and settlement times from days to mere minutes. For institutional investors, this effectively decreases counterparty risk and improves capital efficiency. In September, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) released a joint statement providing support for a regulatory regime of 24/7 capital markets. Tokenization transforms markets amid regulatory challenges While regulatory support is growing, tokenized finance must navigate complex legal frameworks to ensure its success. Firms will need robust cybersecurity measures to protect assets and ensure compliance with global securities laws. The majority of the tokenized RWA value is currently floating on Ethereum, according to RWA.XYZ. The move to 24/7 trading is a stark contrast to conventional markets, which close on nights, weekends, and holidays. The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which processed approximately $3.7 quadrillion in settlements in 2024, received SEC approval to begin offering tokenized financial instruments in December. It’s also expected that in the second half of 2026, DTCC will begin trading tokenized assets such as US Treasuries and stock indexes. Ultimately, tokenization could create a more efficient, inclusive, and transparent financial system. Institutions that embrace these changes early may gain a competitive advantage, while those resistant to blockchain innovation risk falling behind.

According to him, it is essential to encourage the responsible development and use of this technology, rather than allowing the country to fall behind other nations in the adoption of AI. During “The Sunday Briefing,” Hansen pointed out that it is best if they are encouraged to make significant investments and develop AI responsibly, as this technology offers numerous benefits when used effectively, such as in energy production, healthcare, and scientific research. Hansen describes AI as a game-changer Hansen’s strong support for AI technology prompted reporters to request an interview. In the interview, they asked him to comment on cybersecurity. Respondingly, the Google executive acknowledged that it is essential for them to exercise caution and consider people’s safety while effectively teaching them how to utilize this technology properly. Afterwards, Hansen hinted at energy as a major sector for AI advancement. He also discussed the “Genesis Mission,” an ongoing collaboration among tech firms, the Department of Energy, and the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). It is worth noting that this initiative is part of a recent executive order signed by US President Donald Trump. It aims to accelerate the adoption of AI, particularly in scientific research. Regarding this executive order, Hansen commented that such a move is a perfect example of how energy and AI can work effectively together. Regarding scientific research, he noted that federal agencies employ some of the most skilled scientists globally in their national laboratories. In the meantime, reports from reliable sources reveal that energy issues have been a major problem in the tech ecosystem. Hansen decided to weigh in on the matter. He declared that the most suitable way to tackle this issue is by integrating AI and emerging technologies such as quantum computing. Based on his argument, this move could establish a positive cycle where the tech industry can improve science, enhance energy solutions, and showcase American innovation. Another key problem in the tech industry, according to an analysis by Hansen, is cybercrime. The Google executive mentioned that tech companies have developed an effective method to utilize AI for defense against such attacks. To illustrate this point, he noted that while criminals are increasingly utilizing this technology to conduct their illicit activities, tech firms are purposefully establishing AI-driven tools to protect their systems on a large scale. Sundar Pichai warns of the presence of irrationality in the recent AI boom Last month, Sundar Pichai, the chief executive officer of Alphabet Inc. , the multinational conglomerate that owns Google, told reporters that if the AI bubble were to burst, almost every business would experience the consequences. Following this argument, Pichai noted that while the recent AI investments have significantly increased, the current AI hype demonstrates the presence of some “irrationality.” He made this statement as there are increased concerns in Silicon Valley and other areas regarding a potential bubble. This ongoing trend stems from the escalating value of AI tech firms and the increased spending by businesses seeking to expand in this field. Reports asked the CEO whether Google would be safe from the impact of an AI bubble pop. Responding to this question, Pichai still gave a warning, even though he asserted that the tech giant can handle such a situation. “I believe no company will be immune, including us,” he said. Meanwhile, sources highlighted that Pichai also addressed issues related to energy requirements, the delay in achieving climate goals, investments in the UK, the accuracy of his AI models, and the potential impact of the AI revolution on jobs during a broad, exclusive interview at Google’s headquarters in California.

56161662,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=248557,1766371212,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Stunning Surge: Gold Hits New All-Time High of $4.4K, What’s Next?",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/gold-all-time-high-surge/,"BitcoinWorld Stunning Surge: Gold Hits New All-Time High of $4.4K, What’s Next? In a stunning move that has captured the attention of investors worldwide, gold has shattered records by hitting a new all-time high of $4,384.90 per ounce. This milestone, reached on the spot market, marks the precious metal’s highest price point since October 20th and signals a powerful shift in market sentiment. For those watching both traditional and digital assets, this surge raises critical questions about safety, value, and the future of store-of-value investments. What Drove Gold to This New All-Time High? Several converging factors have propelled gold to this historic peak. Primarily, ongoing global economic uncertainty acts as a major catalyst. Investors traditionally flock to gold during times of instability, seeking a reliable hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Furthermore, shifting expectations around central bank policies, particularly interest rate cuts, have reduced the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold. This perfect storm of demand has created relentless upward pressure on its price. According to live data from TradingView, gold is currently trading at $4,380.74, showing a solid gain of 0.97% from the previous day’s close. This consistent upward trajectory is not a fleeting spike but part of a sustained bullish trend. The breach of the previous all-time high resistance level is a technically significant event that often invites further buying from momentum traders and institutional funds. Gold vs. Bitcoin: A New Chapter in the Store-of-Value Race? This record-breaking price inevitably invites comparison with digital gold: Bitcoin. For years, a narrative has existed pitting the ancient precious metal against the modern cryptographic asset. Gold’s recent all-time high achievement arrives during a period of consolidation for major cryptocurrencies, prompting a fresh look at this dynamic. Safe-Haven Status: Gold’s surge reinforces its centuries-old role as a premier safe-haven asset during geopolitical or economic stress. Institutional Adoption: Both assets are seeing increased investment from ETFs and large-scale funds, validating their roles in diversified portfolios. Market Maturity: Gold’s market is deep and established, while Bitcoin’s is younger, more volatile, but growing in acceptance. Therefore, rather than a simple competition, many analysts now view them as complementary assets within a broader macro strategy for preserving wealth against different types of risk. What Does This Mean for Your Investment Strategy? For the average investor, watching gold hit a new all-time high can trigger both excitement and anxiety. The key is to avoid emotional decisions. Historically, breaking a major resistance level can lead to further price discovery, but it can also precede periods of profit-taking and correction. Consider your portfolio’s goals and risk tolerance. Actionable insights include: reviewing your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your long-term strategy, considering dollar-cost averaging if adding exposure to avoid timing the peak, and understanding that gold often performs well in environments where growth assets may struggle. This milestone is a powerful reminder of the importance of having uncorrelated assets in your portfolio. The Road Ahead: Can the Rally Continue? The fundamental drivers behind gold’s strength show few immediate signs of abating. Persistent inflation concerns, a complex geopolitical landscape, and a global trend toward de-dollarization by some central banks continue to support demand. However, a sharp reversal in central bank policy or a sudden surge in risk appetite across equity markets could apply temporary downward pressure. The breakthrough to a new all-time high has fundamentally changed the technical picture, opening the door for gold to target even higher price zones. Market participants will now watch key support levels around the previous highs for signs of sustained strength. In conclusion, gold’s ascent to a $4.4K all-time high is more than just a number—it’s a statement on the current state of the global economy. It highlights a deep-seated search for stability and tangible value in an uncertain world. Whether you are a traditionalist favoring precious metals or a modernist exploring digital assets, this event underscores the timeless need for strategic, diversified wealth preservation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Why did gold’s price hit a new all-time high? A: The surge is driven by a combination of global economic uncertainty, expectations of interest rate cuts, strong central bank buying, and its role as a hedge against inflation. Q: Is it too late to invest in gold after this record high? A> While timing the market is difficult, many analysts view gold as a long-term holding for portfolio diversification. Strategies like dollar-cost averaging can mitigate the risk of buying at a peak. Q: How does gold’s performance affect Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies? A> It renews the debate on “store of value” assets. They often react to similar macro forces (like loose monetary policy), but can also diverge. Some investors hold both for a balanced approach. Q: What is the difference between spot gold price and futures price? A> The spot price is for immediate purchase and delivery. The futures price is for contracts to buy/sell gold at a set price on a future date. The article references the spot price, which is the standard benchmark. Q: Should I sell my gold holdings now that it’s at a high? A> This depends entirely on your personal financial goals, investment horizon, and why you bought gold initially. Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is recommended. Q: Where can I reliably track the live price of gold? A> Reputable financial data platforms like TradingView, Bloomberg, or Kitco provide real-time and historical price data for gold and other commodities.

A broad Asia Pacific share gauge rose about 0.5%, led by tech, after last week’s dip revived talk of a final push higher into 2026. Crypto did not lead the move, although Bitcoin edged up about 1% in early trading, echoing the steadier tone in risk assets.

This wave of crypto liquidations wasn’t random—it was decisively led by traders betting against the two largest digital assets. Let’s break down what happened and why it matters for your portfolio. What Triggered This Wave of Crypto Liquidations? A sudden and sharp price movement is often the match that lights the crypto liquidations fuse. When the market moves violently against leveraged positions, exchanges automatically sell a trader’s assets to cover their debt, leading to a forced closure or ‘liquidation’. The past day saw this mechanism fire on all cylinders, creating a cascade of selling and buying pressure that amplified the original price move. Bitcoin and Ethereum: The Short-Squeeze Story The data reveals a clear narrative. For Bitcoin (BTC), $49.14 million was liquidated. Crucially, short positions —bets that the price would fall—made up 62.66% of that total. Ethereum (ETH) told a similar, more intense story with $47.23 million liquidated and a staggering 67.34% being shorts. This pattern suggests a potential short squeeze . Here’s a simple breakdown: Short Sellers Borrow: Traders borrow an asset (like BTC) and sell it, hoping to buy it back later at a lower price. Price Rises Unexpectedly: If the price climbs instead, those short sellers face mounting losses. The Squeeze: To limit losses, they are forced to buy back the asset, which pushes the price up even further, triggering more crypto liquidations in a vicious cycle. Is This Just a BTC and ETH Phenomenon? Not entirely. While the giants dominated, other assets showed different behaviors. For instance, the token LIGHT saw $16.31 million in liquidations, but here, long positions (bets on a price increase) were the majority at 51.43%. This highlights a critical point: crypto liquidations are not a monolithic event. Market sentiment and price action can vary drastically between assets, punishing both bulls and bears depending on the coin. How Can Traders Navigate Liquidation Risks? Surviving these volatile storms requires discipline. First, manage your leverage . High leverage magnifies both gains and losses, making you a prime target for liquidation. Second, always use a stop-loss order . This tool automatically exits your position at a predetermined price, helping you avoid the forced closure of a liquidation. Finally, stay informed. Monitoring funding rates and overall market leverage can provide early warning signs of potential volatility. The Ripple Effect of Major Crypto Liquidations A $112 million liquidation event doesn’t happen in a vacuum. It creates ripple effects across the market. The forced buying from short squeezes can artificially inflate prices, while the forced selling from long liquidations can deepen a crash. This activity increases market volatility in the short term, creating both danger and opportunity for alert traders. Understanding these mechanics is key to interpreting sudden price swings. In summary, the recent crypto liquidations serve as a powerful reminder of the market’s inherent risks. The data paints a clear picture of a short squeeze impacting Bitcoin and Ethereum, while other assets faced their own unique pressures. For traders, the lesson is timeless: respect leverage, employ risk management tools, and never underestimate the market’s power to humble overconfident positions. Staying educated and cautious is your best defense against the next liquidation storm. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are crypto liquidations? Crypto liquidations occur when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s leveraged position because they have lost the collateral needed to keep it open. This happens to prevent the trader from owing more money than they have. Why were mostly short positions liquidated for BTC and ETH? The data suggests a short squeeze. If the price of BTC or ETH rose quickly, traders who had borrowed and sold (shorted) the asset were forced to buy it back at a higher price to limit losses, triggering a cascade of liquidations. What is the difference between long and short liquidations? Long liquidations happen when prices fall sharply, wiping out traders who bet on a price increase. Short liquidations happen when prices rise sharply, hurting traders who bet on a price decrease. How can I avoid getting liquidated? Use lower leverage, set prudent stop-loss orders, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Continuously monitor your positions and the overall market conditions. Do large liquidations affect the overall market price? Yes, they can. A large wave of liquidations creates forced buying or selling, which adds volatility and can amplify price movements in the short term. Where can I track crypto liquidation data? Several websites like Coinglass and Bybit provide real-time liquidation data across multiple exchanges, showing totals for different cryptocurrencies and position types.

This wasn’t a scene from a dystopian film—it was the startling reality that unfolded last weekend when a city-wide blackout brought Alphabet’s autonomous vehicle service to a grinding halt. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts who understand the importance of resilient, decentralized systems, this incident raises crucial questions about the infrastructure supporting our future transportation networks. Waymo Robotaxi Gridlock During San Francisco Blackout On Saturday evening, a fire at a Pacific Gas & Electric substation plunged much of San Francisco into darkness, affecting approximately 120,000 customers. While human drivers struggled with non-functioning traffic signals and transit disruptions, Waymo’s autonomous vehicles faced a more fundamental challenge: how to navigate a city without power. Social media quickly filled with images and videos showing Waymo robotaxis frozen at intersections, creating bottlenecks as human drivers either waited patiently or attempted to maneuver around the stationary vehicles. The scale of the disruption was significant. According to leaked documents from Tiger Global Management, Waymo now provides approximately 450,000 robotaxi rides per week—nearly double what the company reported in spring 2025. This massive fleet, when immobilized, created what one Twitter user described as “a MASSIVE jam” in neighborhoods like North Beach. Autonomous Vehicles Meet Real-World Chaos Waymo’s self-driving systems are designed with specific protocols for handling traffic signal failures. Under normal circumstances, their vehicles treat non-functioning traffic lights as four-way stops. However, Saturday’s event presented an unprecedented scenario where multiple intersections simultaneously lost power, creating complex decision-making challenges for the autonomous systems. The company explained in their statement: “While the failure of the utility infrastructure was significant, we are committed to ensuring our technology adjusts to traffic flow during such events.” This incident highlights a critical vulnerability in current autonomous vehicle technology—their dependence on predictable environmental conditions and infrastructure. Impact Area Details Duration Waymo Service Suspension Full suspension in San Francisco Approximately 24 hours PG&E Customers Affected 120,000 initially, 35,000 still without power Sunday morning Multiple days for some customers Traffic Signal Failure Widespread across affected areas Until power restoration Muni Transit Disruption Significant service interruptions Throughout outage period San Francisco Blackout Reveals Infrastructure Dependencies Mayor Daniel Lurie’s warning to residents to stay off the roads unless absolutely necessary underscored the severity of the situation. The blackout didn’t just affect Waymo’s operations—it disrupted the entire city’s transportation ecosystem. This incident serves as a stark reminder that even the most advanced AI systems remain vulnerable to basic infrastructure failures. For those following cryptocurrency and blockchain developments, this event draws interesting parallels. Just as decentralized networks aim to eliminate single points of failure in financial systems, autonomous vehicle networks must develop similar resilience against centralized infrastructure vulnerabilities. The question becomes: Can autonomous systems be designed to function independently when traditional infrastructure fails? Power Outage Response and Recovery Timeline Waymo’s response followed a clear timeline: Saturday Evening: Service suspended after blackout begins Saturday Night: Social media fills with images of stalled vehicles Sunday Afternoon: Company announces service resumption Ongoing: Analysis and system improvements based on lessons learned The company emphasized that “the majority of active trips were completed successfully” before the suspension, suggesting their systems handled the initial phase of the outage reasonably well. However, the decision to suspend service entirely indicates recognition of limitations in handling prolonged, widespread infrastructure failure. Traffic Disruption Lessons for Future Autonomous Systems This incident provides valuable insights for the entire autonomous vehicle industry: Redundancy Requirements: Systems need backup protocols for extended infrastructure failures Communication Protocols: Clear guidelines for how autonomous vehicles should communicate their status during emergencies Public Education: Better public understanding of autonomous vehicle behavior during unusual conditions Infrastructure Coordination: Closer collaboration between autonomous vehicle companies and municipal infrastructure providers Waymo’s spokesperson stated they are “focused on rapidly integrating the lessons learned from this event,” suggesting this incident will directly inform future system improvements. The company’s commitment to “earning and maintaining the trust of the communities we serve” will be tested by how effectively they address these challenges. FAQs: Understanding the Waymo Blackout Incident What caused the Waymo robotaxis to stop during the blackout? Waymo’s autonomous systems are designed to treat non-functioning traffic lights as four-way stops. However, the scale of Saturday’s blackout—affecting multiple intersections simultaneously—caused vehicles to remain stationary longer than normal as they tried to assess complex traffic situations. How long was Waymo service suspended? Service was suspended from Saturday evening until late Sunday afternoon—approximately 24 hours. The company resumed operations once they determined their systems could safely navigate the recovering infrastructure. What company operates Waymo? Waymo is operated by Waymo LLC , which is owned by Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google. You can learn more about Alphabet on their Wikipedia page . Who is San Francisco’s mayor? Daniel Lurie serves as Mayor of San Francisco. Information about the mayor’s office and initiatives can be found on the official San Francisco government website . What utility company experienced the substation fire? Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) experienced a fire at a San Francisco substation. More information about the company is available on their official website or Wikipedia page . Where can I see the social media posts about the incident? Posts from Vincent Woo ( @fulligin on Twitter/X ) and Iago Maciel ( @_iagomaciel on Twitter/X ) documented the gridlock caused by stalled Waymo vehicles. Conclusion: Resilience as the Next Frontier for Autonomous Vehicles The San Francisco blackout incident serves as a crucial stress test for autonomous vehicle technology. While Waymo successfully resumed service within 24 hours, the event exposed significant vulnerabilities in how these systems handle widespread infrastructure failure. For the cryptocurrency community, which champions decentralized, resilient systems, this incident offers important lessons about the limitations of centralized infrastructure dependencies. As autonomous vehicles become more integrated into our transportation networks, their ability to handle exceptional circumstances will determine public trust and regulatory acceptance. The true test of this technology isn’t how it performs under ideal conditions, but how it adapts when everything goes wrong. Waymo’s response to this crisis—and their implementation of lessons learned—will shape the future of urban mobility.

An Ethereum OG stakes a staggering 3,598 ETH, worth approximately $10.8 million, on the liquid staking platform Ether.fi. This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a monumental vote of confidence from an address that held its assets silently for nine long years. Why Is This Ethereum OG Staking ETH Such a Big Deal? When an early adopter, often called an ‘OG,’ makes a move, the market pays attention. This particular address, starting with ‘0xccc,’ had remained dormant since the early days of the Ethereum network. The decision to finally deploy this capital into liquid staking speaks volumes. It signals a strategic shift from passive holding to active participation in securing the network while seeking yield. This action validates the maturity and perceived safety of modern staking protocols for even the most cautious, long-term investors. What Does Liquid Staking on Ether.fi Offer? The choice of Ether.fi is crucial. Unlike traditional staking, which locks up assets, liquid staking provides flexibility. Here’s what likely attracted this Ethereum OG: Liquidity: Stakers receive eETH tokens representing their staked ETH, which can be used across DeFi for additional yield. Non-Custodial Security: Users retain control of their keys, a paramount concern for OGs. Earned Rewards: The staked ETH earns staking rewards, growing the holder’s position over time. Therefore, this move isn’t just about earning interest; it’s about maintaining liquidity in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. The Ethereum OG stakes ETH not for passive gain but for strategic, flexible growth. What Does This Mean for the Broader Ethereum Ecosystem? This massive stake is a bullish signal for Ethereum’s proof-of-stake consensus. When influential, long-term holders participate in staking, it increases network security and decentralization. Moreover, it demonstrates institutional-grade confidence in the staking infrastructure. This event may encourage other large holders to consider similar strategies, potentially increasing the total value locked in DeFi and strengthening Ethereum’s economic foundation. Key Takeaways from the $10.8M Ethereum Stake The story of this Ethereum OG provides clear insights for every crypto observer: Long-Term Belief: Holding for nine years shows profound conviction in Ethereum’s core value. Strategic Evolution: The move from simple holding to sophisticated yield generation marks a new phase for smart capital. Market Sentiment: Such actions often precede or reflect growing institutional and whale confidence in crypto financial products. Ultimately, watching an Ethereum OG stakes ETH on this scale is a masterclass in patient, strategic crypto investment. Conclusion: A Legacy Holder’s Powerful Endorsement The decision by this Ethereum OG to stake $10.8 million is more than a headline. It is a powerful endorsement of Ethereum’s current trajectory and the innovative tools built around it. It blends the wisdom of long-term holding with the dynamism of modern DeFi. This move underscores a critical trend: the maturation of cryptocurrency from speculative asset to a cornerstone of a new, participatory financial system. The silent giants are awakening, and their actions chart the course for the future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Who is considered an Ethereum OG? An Ethereum OG (Original Gangster) typically refers to an early investor or developer who acquired ETH or participated in the network during its initial years, often before 2017. What is liquid staking? Liquid staking allows users to stake their crypto assets (like ETH) to secure a network and earn rewards, while receiving a liquid token (like eETH) that represents their staked position. This token can be used elsewhere in DeFi. Why is staking important for Ethereum? Staking is the process that secures the Ethereum blockchain under its proof-of-stake consensus. Participants lock up ETH to validate transactions and create new blocks, earning rewards for their service. What is Ether.fi? Ether.fi is a non-custodial, decentralized liquid staking protocol. It allows users to stake ETH and receive a liquid token, eETH, while maintaining control of their private keys. Could this large stake influence ETH’s price? While a single stake doesn’t directly dictate price, it can influence market sentiment. A large, long-term holder staking (not selling) is generally viewed as a confident, long-term bullish signal. Is my ETH safe if I stake it? Staking involves smart contract and protocol risks. Using well-audited, non-custodial platforms like Ether.fi can mitigate some risk, but it’s crucial to conduct your own research before staking any assets.

That future is now on the legislative table in Hong Kong. In a groundbreaking proposal, the Hong Kong Insurance Authority (HKIA) has taken a decisive step to allow insurance companies to invest their capital in cryptocurrencies. This move could unlock billions in institutional capital for the crypto market, fundamentally reshaping its landscape and solidifying Hong Kong’s ambitious plan to become a global digital finance hub. What Does the Hong Kong Crypto Insurance Investment Proposal Entail? The HKIA’s draft legislation, first reported by Bloomberg, is a detailed framework for integrating digital assets into the conservative world of insurance finance. The core of the plan is to permit licensed insurers to allocate a portion of their investment portfolios to cryptocurrencies and the underlying infrastructure that supports them, like custody solutions and trading platforms. However, this isn’t a free-for-all. The authority has introduced a critical risk management measure: a 100% risk weighting for volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This means insurers must hold capital equal to the full value of their crypto investments as a buffer against potential losses. For stablecoins, the risk weighting would be more nuanced, tied directly to the safety and liquidity of the assets they are pegged to, such as the US dollar. Why is Hong Kong Pushing for Crypto in Insurance? This initiative is not an isolated event. It’s a strategic piece of a much larger puzzle. Hong Kong has been actively and methodically building a comprehensive regulatory environment for digital assets. The goal is clear: to attract global businesses, talent, and capital. By allowing Hong Kong crypto insurance investment , the city achieves several objectives: Diversification: It provides insurers with a new, non-correlated asset class to potentially enhance portfolio returns. Market Maturity: It signals deep institutional confidence, which can reduce volatility and increase mainstream adoption. Competitive Edge: It positions Hong Kong ahead of other financial centers that are still grappling with crypto regulation. What Are the Risks and Challenges for Insurers? While the opportunity is significant, the path forward is lined with challenges. The primary concern is the inherent volatility of the crypto market. A 100% risk weighting is a direct acknowledgment of this. Insurers will need sophisticated risk management frameworks to navigate price swings. Furthermore, operational risks like cybersecurity, custody of private keys, and regulatory compliance across jurisdictions remain daunting. The success of this Hong Kong crypto insurance investment framework will depend heavily on the industry’s ability to develop and adopt robust security protocols and clear internal governance policies. What’s the Timeline for This Crypto Investment Law? Patience is key. The HKIA has outlined a deliberate and consultative process. The proposal is scheduled for a formal public and industry consultation period running from February to April 2026. This extended timeline allows all stakeholders—insurers, tech firms, and the public—to provide feedback and shape the final rules. Only after this consultation will the refined legislation be submitted to Hong Kong’s Legislative Council for debate and approval. Therefore, while the direction is set, the actual implementation of Hong Kong crypto insurance investment is still a few years away, allowing ample time for preparation. The Bottom Line: A Watershed Moment for Crypto Hong Kong’s proposal is a watershed moment. It represents one of the first concerted efforts by a major financial regulator to formally bridge the world of traditional, risk-averse insurance with the innovative but volatile crypto ecosystem. If successful, it could create a powerful blueprint for other global financial centers, driving unprecedented levels of institutional capital into digital assets and accelerating the maturation of the entire sector. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can Hong Kong insurers invest in crypto right now? A: No. This is currently a legislative proposal. Insurers must wait for the law to pass after the consultation and legislative process, which is targeted for after 2026. Q2: What does a 100% risk weighting mean? A: It means an insurance company must hold capital in reserve equal to 100% of the value of its cryptocurrency investments. This is a conservative safeguard against the asset’s potential to lose value. Q3: Will this make insurance policies riskier? A: Not necessarily. The strict risk-weighting and capital requirements are designed to protect policyholders. Insurers are expected to invest only a small, managed portion of their vast portfolios in crypto. Q4: How does this help Hong Kong? A: It attracts crypto businesses and financial institutions to set up operations in Hong Kong, boosting its economy and fulfilling its goal of becoming a leading digital finance hub. Q5: Are stablecoins treated the same as Bitcoin? A: No. The proposal treats them differently. Stablecoins would receive a risk weighting based on the quality and liquidity of their reserve assets (like US Treasuries), which will likely be lower than 100%.

A new Bitcoin price prediction from a prominent on-chain analyst suggests the flagship cryptocurrency could see a staggering rally to $150,000, but not before navigating a crucial shakeout period. This forecast hinges on complex market data and holder behavior, offering a roadmap for the volatile years ahead. Let’s break down the key insights and what they mean for your portfolio. What is the Core Bitcoin Price Prediction? On-chain analyst Murphy presents a compelling timeline. He anticipates Bitcoin will find its ultimate cycle bottom in 2026. Following this low, the stage is set for a powerful bull market capable of propelling the price to a target of $150,000. This Bitcoin price prediction isn’t just a random guess; it’s built on analyzing where coins are held and the psychology of different investor groups. Why is the $80K-$90K Zone So Critical? The analysis identifies a massive support wall between $80,000 and $90,000. This zone represents a key battleground between fear and conviction. Here’s the data that makes this area so significant: Strong Support: Approximately 7.46 million BTC are held profitably below $80,000, creating a base of investors less likely to sell in panic. Overhead Supply: Conversely, about 6.17 million BTC are held at a loss above $90,000. If the price rises, these coins could become sell-side pressure as holders break even. The Absorption Test: The bullish case depends on new buying demand absorbing the 1.87 million BTC in this critical range without triggering massive sell-offs. Who is Selling and What Does it Mean? A major liquidation event in October cleared out many weak hands. The current selling pressure now comes primarily from Long-Term Holders (LTHs)—investors who have held Bitcoin for over 155 days. These profitable players are distributing their coins, likely influenced by the classic four-year cycle theory and broader economic uncertainty. However, there’s a silver lining. The analyst notes that panic selling above $110,000 has largely subsided. More importantly, despite this sustained selling from LTHs, Bitcoin has avoided the catastrophic 50% crashes seen in previous cycles. This resilience points to exceptionally strong underlying demand, a bullish signal often overlooked in short-term price action. How Does This Lead to a $150K Bitcoin Price Prediction? The path to $150,000 is a process of elimination and accumulation. The market is currently in what Murphy calls a “strong shakeout period.” This phase is designed to transfer coins from impatient or uncertain hands to steadfast believers. Once this distribution concludes and the selling pressure from LTHs is exhausted, the foundation for the next leg up will be solid. The projected inflection point in 2026 is when this cycle resets. With weaker sellers flushed out and a new wave of accumulation complete, the reduced available supply, met with increasing demand, could create the explosive conditions needed to fulfill the ambitious Bitcoin price prediction of $150,000. Conclusion: Patience is the Ultimate Strategy This analysis paints a picture of a market in transition. The road to new all-time highs requires navigating significant volatility and a final capitulation phase. For investors, the key takeaway is the importance of a long-term perspective. The data suggests that while 2025 may be turbulent, strategic accumulation during weakness could position portfolios exceptionally well for the potential bull run that follows the 2026 low. This Bitcoin price prediction underscores that in cryptocurrency, timing and patience are often more valuable than timing the market perfectly. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main reason for predicting a bottom in 2026? A1: The prediction is based on the four-year Bitcoin cycle theory and on-chain data showing Long-Term Holders are still distributing their coins. The analyst believes this selling pressure needs more time to be fully absorbed by the market. Q2: Why hasn’t Bitcoin crashed 50% like in past cycles despite the selling? A2: The analyst points to exceptionally strong underlying demand from new buyers. This consistent demand is absorbing the sell-side pressure from LTHs, preventing the deep, panic-driven crashes seen historically. Q3: What happens if Bitcoin breaks below the $80,000 support zone? A3: A sustained break below $80,000 could invalidate the current support thesis and potentially lead to a deeper and faster search for a bottom, as it would trigger stop-losses and fear selling from the profitable cohort holding below that level. Q4: Is the $150,000 target guaranteed if we bottom in 2026? A4: No price target is guaranteed. The $150,000 figure is a projection based on historical cycle patterns and supply/demand dynamics. It requires favorable macroeconomic conditions and continued adoption to materialize. Q5: What should an investor do based on this analysis? A5: The analysis suggests a strategy of patience and potential dollar-cost averaging during periods of weakness, with a focus on the long-term horizon beyond 2026, rather than attempting to trade short-term volatility.

It was also negative for almost all of November. The Coinbase premium is the price difference between Bitcoin or other crypto assets trading on the US-based exchange compared to other major alternatives, particularly those popular in Asia, like Binance. “That usually signals US spot demand is lagging the rest of the market,” observed analyst ‘Kyledoops’ on Sunday. “Less aggressive institutional buying, softer risk appetite, and capital staying cautious. Not panic, but a clear sign US flows haven’t stepped back in yet.” America Selling, Asia Buying The Coinbase premium acts as a sentiment indicator for institutional and retail demand in different regions. When it is positive, it signals strong buying pressure from US investors, often indicating institutional interest since Coinbase is heavily used by American institutions. The Coinbase $BTC premium has stayed negative for 7 straight days, now around -0.04% per Coinglass. That usually signals U.S. spot demand is lagging the rest of the market. Less aggressive institutional buying, softer risk appetite, and capital staying cautious. Not panic, but… pic.twitter.com/HtjNSorO1I — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) December 21, 2025 A negative Coinbase premium typically indicates weakening US demand as American investors are selling or showing less buying interest compared to other regions. It can also signal institutional hesitation since the exchange is a proxy for institutional activity, meaning institutions may be reducing exposure or staying on the sidelines, which is bearish overall. Year-end dynamics are also at play as institutions are rebalancing portfolios, taking profits, and engaging in tax-loss harvesting as the fiscal year closes. This is actually fairly typical for December, though the magnitude this year is more pronounced. The opposite appears to be happening in Asia, which is seeing more buying pressure. “The US and the EU are selling Bitcoin like there’s no tomorrow… but Asia is buying,” observed analyst ‘No Limit.’ They shared a chart showing that Asian traders are aggressively buying during their sessions, treating price dips as buying opportunities, while the opposite is happening in the US. Historical Patterns Repeating However, this isn’t new, as the same dynamic appeared in 2019, in March 2020, and in late 2022, the analyst noted. In previous cycles, Western selling was followed by Asian accumulation, and the price eventually followed Asia’s lead upward. Additionally, over the past couple of weeks, frequent liquidation events have caused crypto market dumps in late trading in the US on Sunday, and accumulation followed in Asia during the Monday morning trading session. “Same story every time.

Overall, the optimism behind prediction markets is rising, but Santos cautioned that incorporating them into mainstream platforms like Robinhood may carry potential long-term risks. He commented, “The problem with casino-like products isn’t that users lose money. It’s that casinos accelerate churn. The longer you exist inside a casino, the higher the probability of liquidation. And liquidation means you’re out of the game entirely. A churned user is worth zero.” Santos says mainstream platforms should focus on growing with users Robinhood and other platforms began incorporating prediction markets in 2025 by partnering with prediction companies. In August, Robinhood partnered with Kalshi to enter the sports betting market. The company’s Prediction Markets Hub now enables users to wager on popular pro and college football games. In addition, Coinbase is also preparing to launch its own prediction market, in collaboration with Kalshi, as it seeks to expand the range of asset class offerings on its website amid declining demand for digital assets. Gemini was also granted CFTC authorization to be a Designated Contract Market, offering regulated prediction markets for customers in the United States. However, Santos believes that trying to put such services on mainstream platforms would be more of a departure from their key mission of providing a stable and reliable service to retail users. He argued that, for Robinhood and similar platforms, what matters is the simplicity of their platform design and accessibility; the trick is to achieve long-term growth with users, rather than maximizing short-term payouts. He added, “If durability matters, you optimize for staying power.” In his X post , he also explained , “Casinos serve just enough alcohol to increase the house edge, but not enough to make players leave the table. Financial superapps are attempting the same optimization. The failure mode is over-extraction → churn.” Critics argue that weak regulation makes prediction markets vulnerable The Inversion Capital Founder said prediction markets can potentially create a spike in numbers, but at the cost of long-term risks that may threaten user stability on financial apps. Products like credit cards, insurance, and savings accounts are not as flashy, he said, but they tend to foster long-lasting relationships with users because they’re integrated with everyday financial management. Critics have attributed the growth of betting markets and the muddied distinction between trading and gambling to the Trump administration’s relaxed regulatory approach. They said this lack of scrutiny also leaves the markets vulnerable to insider influence and abuse. Prediction markets, notably Polymarket and Kalshi, surged during the 2024 US presidential race, generating billions in betting and consistently tilting the odds in Trump’s favor, contrary to polling data. By the time the elections were drawn to a close, the markets appeared to be more accurate, reinforcing the view that betting markets would outperform traditional forecasting. So far, Polymarket and Kalshi have partnered with top news organizations, including CNBC, Yahoo Finance, and CNN, to incorporate prediction market odds into their reporting. In early 2025, Intercontinental Exchange also revealed plans to invest up to $2 billion in Polymarket, part of demand prompted by a surge in customer interest in market predictive data for trading. However, regulators in multiple states, including Nevada, New York, and Massachusetts, have attempted to halt the operations of prediction markets, particularly those of Kalshi. They’ve contended that the platform’s contracts are classified as gambling wagers, so the company is now embroiled in lawsuits questioning regulators’ power to pursue the platform.

That’s exactly what’s happening with Metaplanet, a Japanese firm making waves with its latest strategic pivot. The company has just approved the issuance of dividend-paying preferred stock, specifically tailored for foreign institutions. This move isn’t just a financial reshuffle; it’s a clever bridge between the volatile world of cryptocurrency and the steady demands of global capital. What Are Metaplanet Dividend Shares and Why Do They Matter? Metaplanet’s board has given the green light to create and issue preferred stock that pays dividends. This represents a significant shift. The company is moving from a pure growth model, common in tech and crypto, toward a more traditional capital strategy that includes income-generating securities. Following this approval, Metaplanet can now reclassify its capital reserves. These funds can be used specifically to finance preferred stock dividends and share buybacks. Furthermore, the issuance limit for its Class A and B preferred shares has been doubled. The Class B shares have received special approval for issuance exclusively to overseas institutional investors. This structure is seen as a masterstroke. It offers a new type of Bitcoin exposure to global funds, pension managers, and asset allocators who might be hesitant for two key reasons: Reluctance to hold BTC directly due to custody, regulatory, or volatility concerns. Hesitation to invest in volatile common stock of a crypto-focused company. How Does This Strategy Attract Global Capital? Metaplanet isn’t just changing its capital structure; it’s actively building bridges to international markets. The company recently began trading on the U.S. Over-The-Counter (OTC) market, increasing its visibility to American investors. Moreover, it has established a strategic subsidiary in Miami, Florida. This location is no accident. Miami has positioned itself as a crypto-friendly hub in the United States. This two-pronged approach allows Metaplanet to localize what it calls a “U.S.-style Bitcoin strategy” within Japan’s unique regulatory environment. Essentially, the company is creating a hybrid model. It leverages Japan’s corporate framework while adopting aggressive Bitcoin treasury strategies pioneered by American firms like MicroStrategy. The goal is clear: attract global capital by offering a familiar, income-producing security that is indirectly backed by Bitcoin’s potential. What Are the Benefits and Potential Challenges? This innovative move by Metaplanet presents several compelling benefits for different stakeholders. For foreign institutions, it provides a regulated, dividend-yielding avenue to gain Bitcoin exposure without the operational headaches of direct ownership. For Metaplanet, it unlocks a new pool of sophisticated, long-term capital that values income and stability. For the broader crypto market, it demonstrates a mature financial engineering approach that could be replicated by other firms. However, challenges remain. The success of these Metaplanet dividend shares hinges on investor confidence in the company’s ability to manage its Bitcoin treasury profitably to fund dividends. Furthermore, regulatory scrutiny on both sides of the Pacific will be intense. The company must navigate the complex web of Japanese financial law and the expectations of international investors. Conclusion: A Blueprint for Crypto-Corporate Integration Metaplanet’s approval of dividend-paying shares for foreign institutions is more than a corporate announcement. It’s a potential blueprint for how publicly listed companies can integrate Bitcoin into traditional finance frameworks. By creating a security that offers both yield and crypto exposure, Metaplanet is solving a major pain point for institutional adoption. This strategy could pave the way for a new asset class: dividend-paying equities backed by digital asset strategies. As the line between traditional finance and cryptocurrency continues to blur, innovative structures like these will likely lead the charge. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are Metaplanet dividend shares? A1: They are a new class of preferred stock approved by Metaplanet that will pay regular dividends to shareholders. The Class B shares are specifically designated for issuance to overseas institutional investors. Q2: How are these shares related to Bitcoin? A2: Metaplanet holds Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset. The company’s value and its ability to generate capital for dividends are indirectly tied to the performance and management of its Bitcoin holdings. Q3: Why would an institution buy these instead of just buying Bitcoin? A3: Institutions face hurdles like custody, regulatory compliance, and volatility. These shares offer regulated, dividend-paying exposure to Bitcoin’s potential without the need to hold the asset directly, acting as a simplified gateway. Q4: What is Metaplanet’s connection to Miami? A4: Metaplanet established a subsidiary in Miami to help attract global capital and localize a U.S.-style, aggressive Bitcoin treasury strategy within the bounds of Japanese regulation. Q5: Are these shares available to retail investors? A5: The initial focus and specific approval for Class B shares are for overseas institutional investors. Retail access would depend on future issuance and public offering details. Q6: What does this mean for the future of corporate Bitcoin adoption? A6: It signals a maturation phase. Companies are moving beyond simply buying Bitcoin to creating sophisticated financial products around it, making crypto assets more palatable for the traditional financial world.

FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.172 Market Cap $280.42M Trading Volume $7.16M Circulating Supply 1.629B FLOW All-time High $46.16 (April 05, 2021) All-time Low $0.157 (Oct 10, 2025) 24-hour High $0.1763 24-hour Low $0.1699 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 10.11% (Very High) 50-Day SMA $0.2344 14-Day RSI 24.96 (Oversold) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 25 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 9/30 (30%) 200-Day SMA $0.3482 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown FLOW is currently bearish on the longer timeframe, trading near $0.172. The oversold RSI suggests a potential bounce, but the trend remains unchanged. Bulls need to reclaim $0.176–$0.18 to shift short-term bias. Flow coin 1-day price analysis As of December 22, FLOW is trading around $0.172, pressing close to the lower Bollinger Band near $0.159, which confirms sustained downside pressure rather than a completed bottom. The coin’s price remains well below the mid-band at $0.199, maintaining a decisively bearish daily structure. FLOWUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The RSI is deeply oversold at around 26, signaling exhaustion risk. However, a reversal has not yet occurred. Similarly, MACD remains negative and flat, showing bearish momentum is slowing but not reversing. If FLOW closes below $0.170, we could see a drop to $0.159. Currently, any recovery to the upside is capped unless FLOW reclaims $0.185–$0.20. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour timeframe, FLOW remains below all Alligator averages, with resistance stacked at $0.174–$0.176. The sharp sell-off, followed by small-bodied candles, shows short-term stabilization, but OBV remains weak, confirming limited accumulation. FLOWUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView A slightly positive CMF suggests mild dip-buying, although not strong enough to alter the trend bias. A reclaim of $0.176 would allow a relief push toward $0.182, while a loss of $0.170 likely resumes the downtrend. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.2573 SELL SMA 5 $0.2216 SELL SMA 10 $0.2050 SELL SMA 21 $0.2112 SELL SMA 50 $0.2344 SELL SMA 100 $0.2819 SELL SMA 200 $0.3482 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.2105 SELL EMA 5 $0.2304 SELL EMA 10 $0.2703 SELL EMA 21 $0.3158 SELL EMA 50 $0.3507 SELL EMA 100 $0.3695 SELL EMA 200 $0.4140 SELL What to expect from Flow? FLOW is oversold but still bearish, with risk skewed toward further downside unless buyers defend $0.17 decisively. Any bounce without reclaiming $0.18 and above remains corrective. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming months. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance.

In a significant move for institutional adoption, Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution Taiko has announced a strategic partnership with Bitcoin-native platform Avalon Labs. Their mission? To construct a robust, compliant, and high-performance foundation specifically for institutional RWA infrastructure . This collaboration aims to dismantle the final barriers preventing large-scale capital from flowing onto decentralized networks. Why is This Partnership a Game-Changer for RWA Infrastructure? Real-world asset tokenization is often hailed as blockchain’s next multi-trillion-dollar frontier. However, institutions have remained cautious, citing concerns over regulatory compliance, technological risk, and settlement speed. The Taiko and Avalon Labs partnership directly addresses these pain points. By merging Taiko’s Ethereum-equivalent Layer 2 architecture with Avalon’s Bitcoin-centric financial expertise, they are creating a specialized institutional RWA infrastructure designed for trust and efficiency. Taiko brings critical technological assurances to the table, which are non-negotiable for institutional players. Its design eliminates centralized sequencer risk—a single point of failure common in other rollups—and guarantees transaction finality in under two seconds. This combination of decentralization and speed is rare. Moreover, operating as a Type 1 zkEVM means it’s fully compatible with Ethereum, allowing institutions to leverage existing tools and smart contracts within a more scalable and secure environment. What Will This New Institutional RWA Infrastructure Actually Do? Avalon Labs plans to deploy a suite of core financial primitives directly on the Taiko network. This isn’t just about creating simple tokenized assets; it’s about building the entire financial ecosystem around them. The planned features include: Institutional-Grade Lending Contracts: Secure, programmable debt markets for tokenized RWAs. Verified Oracle Data Feeds: Reliable, tamper-proof external data for accurate asset pricing and contract execution. Regulatory-Compliant Stablecoin Issuance: Foundations for minting stable digital currencies tied to real-world collateral. This toolkit will allow asset managers, banks, and funds to not only tokenize assets like treasury bonds or real estate but also to engage in complex financial activities like borrowing against them or earning yield—all on-chain. The focus is on creating an institutional RWA infrastructure that meets strict regulatory standards without sacrificing the core benefits of blockchain, such as transparency and auditability. How Does This Address the Core Needs of Institutions? For traditional finance to embrace DeFi protocols, two pillars are essential: reliability and decentralization. Taiko’s architecture provides both. The removal of centralized sequencer risk mitigates a major operational and reputational danger for institutions. Furthermore, sub-two-second finality means settlements are near-instantaneous, resolving a key inefficiency in traditional systems. Avalon Labs’ role is to ensure this powerful technical base is equipped with the right financial plumbing. Their experience in Bitcoin on-chain services brings a deep understanding of secure, value-based systems. Together, they are not just building another platform; they are engineering a regulated gateway. This institutional RWA infrastructure acts as a bridge, allowing traditional capital to flow into the digital asset space with confidence, knowing the framework is built for both performance and compliance. The Future of Finance Built on Shared Strengths The collaboration between an Ethereum Layer 2 leader and a Bitcoin financial services pioneer is symbolic. It highlights that the future of institutional RWA infrastructure may not belong to a single blockchain but to strategic integrations that leverage the unique strengths of multiple ecosystems. Taiko offers a secure, scalable, and familiar Ethereum environment, while Avalon provides the financial service layer needed to manage real-world value. This partnership is a clear signal that the industry is maturing beyond speculation and moving toward utility. The construction of dedicated, institution-first infrastructure marks a pivotal shift. It paves the way for a new era where global liquidity can seamlessly interact with blockchain’s innovation, unlocking unprecedented efficiency and accessibility in finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is RWA infrastructure in crypto? A1: RWA infrastructure refers to the underlying technology, protocols, and services built on blockchain that enable real-world assets like bonds, real estate, or commodities to be represented, traded, and managed as digital tokens. Q2: Why is the Taiko and Avalon partnership important? A2: It combines Taiko’s high-speed, decentralized Ethereum scaling with Avalon’s Bitcoin-native financial expertise to create a secure, compliant platform specifically designed for institutional use, addressing key adoption barriers. Q3: What does ‘eliminating sequencer risk’ mean? A3: Many Layer 2 networks rely on a single central operator (sequencer) to order transactions, creating a failure point. Taiko’s decentralized design removes this risk, enhancing security and censorship resistance for institutions. Q4: What kind of assets could use this new infrastructure? A4: The infrastructure is designed for institutional-grade assets, including government treasuries, commercial debt, real estate funds, and private equity, enabling them to be tokenized and used in on-chain finance. Q5: How fast are transactions on Taiko? A5: Taiko offers transaction finality in under two seconds, which is crucial for institutional financial activities that require rapid and certain settlement. Q6: Is this infrastructure live now? A6: The partnership has been announced, and Avalon Labs is in the planning/development phase to build its suite of services (lending, oracles, stablecoins) on the Taiko network.

The view comes as large banks and asset managers begin product tokenization, a move that once seemed extreme but is now being treated as a practical step by major institutions. Regulatory Signals Push Institutions Forward Based on reports cited by Grossman, progress has accelerated because rules are becoming clearer. Legislative efforts, regulatory guidance, bank involvement and accounting standards are starting to line up. That combination reduces uncertainty, which is often what slows large pools of capital. BlackRock has already launched tokenized funds, while Franklin Templeton is running tokenized money market funds on public blockchains. Those actions suggest that tokenization is no longer confined to pilot labs or internal trials. It is being used with real assets and real clients. Bank of America recently said that banks are heading toward a multi-year, onchain future. A few years ago, that would have sounded radical. Today, it sounds inevitable. 20+ years ago, I began my career in media and saw firsthand what happens when an analog industry collides with… — Keith A. Grossman (@KeithGrossman) December 21, 2025 Tokenization: Big Players Making Their Presence Felt Banks are also taking part. Citi, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase have all been linked to onchain settlement tests, tokenized deposits and near real-time asset transfers. These projects focus on reducing friction in back-end processes that have existed for decades. Settlement that once took days could be shortened to minutes if shared ledgers are used. That change alone alters how risk, liquidity and cost are managed across markets. Grossman framed the moment as similar to earlier shifts in other industries. He pointed to how legacy media struggled when distribution moved online more than 20 years ago. At the time, many firms tried to protect old revenue streams instead of adapting. Some survived by changing early. Others lost influence as new platforms took control. Tokenization: Old Revenue Lines Face Pressure In finance, the pressure point sits in areas such as reconciliation, clearing, settlement and custody. These roles have long supported steady margins, partly because they depend on complex and slow systems. Reports have disclosed that software and shared protocols can now handle much of that work. As a result, some services may become cheaper and less profitable over time. That does not mean banks disappear. According to Grossman’s view, they remain central players, much like they did after ATMs reduced teller roles or when voice-over-internet systems cut long-distance call costs for telecom firms. The institutions stayed, but their shape changed. The same pattern is expected here. Banks may rely more on software, fewer manual steps and new forms of infrastructure control. Tokenization is moving faster than expected, according to MoonPay president Keith Grossman. Banks and asset managers are testing tokenized funds and onchain settlement, signaling that what was once experimental is now becoming practical. The lenders and other big players are among the firms pushing the shift, showing the trend is already under way.

Related Reading: Banks Could Favor A Higher XRP Price, Finance Expert Says According to Jurrien Timmer, a notable pullback is possible next year with key support seen in a range of $65,000 to $75,000. That view sits alongside data points and trader commentary that recall past big drops after sharp peaks. Cycle Warning From Fidelity Timmer said Bitcoin’s price history follows a roughly four-year rhythm tied to halvings. Past peaks have been followed by steep corrections of about 70 to 85%. For example, after a high of $1,137 in 2013 the price slipped to roughly $230, and the 2017 peak near $14,050 later traded down toward $3,415. Prices surged again after 2021, and that pattern of parabolic advance then sharp retreat has been repeated. Some traders say those falls are tests of patience rather than a sign the story is broken. Fidelity Warns: #Bitcoin Cycle Peak May Already Be In Fidelity’s Jurrien Timmer believes the $126K October high was the top for this cycle. Based on $BTC 4-year halving pattern, He expects 2026 to be a down year, with support around $65K–$75K.

Market action often looks like a rapid climb to a peak, a quick drop, and a long period where prices move sideways and gains feel slow. Those sideways stretches are where many long-term holders are rewarded, though it can take years. BTC will hit $250k by year-end 2027. 2026 is too chaotic to predict, though Bitcoin making new all-time highs in 2026 is still possible. Options markets are currently pricing about equal odds of $70k or $130k for month-end June 2026, and equal odds of $50k or $250k by year-end… — Alex Thorn (@intangiblecoins) December 21, 2025 Galaxy Research has flagged overlapping macro and market risks that make forecasting harder for 2026, and options and volatility trends suggest Bitcoin is behaving more like a macro asset than a pure growth gamble. Galaxy Research is still bullish on a multi-year view and projects a path toward $250,000 by the end of 2027. First Quarter Patterns May Matter Related Reading: Before You Sell Bitcoin For Gold, Hear This Warning Based on reports from traders, the first quarter has in past cycles been a period that often supports price stability, although recent years have shown less regularity. Large inflows and treasury buys that could arrive in 2025 might be offset by early-cycle selling from big holders. The balance between institutional demand and whale supply will likely show itself in the first half of 2026, making that stretch important for whether historical four-year rhythms hold firm.

These accounts (some linked to terrorist networks, others showing impossible login behavior or blatant KYC failures) remained active, with one Venezuelan in particular reportedly pushing $93 million through his Binance account, some of which were traced to Iran and Hezbollah. The Binance accounts came from Venezuela, Brazil, Syria, Niger, and China, with users allegedly logging in from Caracas and Osaka within hours, or changing banking details 647 times in just 14 months. “A common automated process at financial institutions is to screen for irregular “pass-through” behaviour, such as when funds deposited into an account are transferred out again within 24 hours in a manner that is potentially suspicious,” said FT. Binance accounts showed alleged suspicious activity The Financial Times claims it investigated 13 different Binance accounts and allegedly found suspicious flows of $1.7 billion in crypto, including $144 million after November 2023, the same day Binance agreed to clean house. One Venezuelan woman, who registered on Binance in 2022, received over $177 million in crypto in under two years, allegedly using 496 different bank accounts to off-ramp funds across the Americas. The 13 accounts received at least $29 million in Tether from wallets later frozen by Israel under anti-terrorism laws. Most of that came from four wallets tied to Tawfiq Al-Law, who was accused of funneling money for Hezbollah, the Houthis, and a Syrian firm connected to the Assad regime. These wallets were seized in May 2023 and sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury in March 2024. In one bizarre case, a man from Brazil registered with a damaged ID card from 20 years ago, where even his date of birth was unreadable. The email on file belonged to a completely different woman. He was later charged for helping a group that smuggled illegal gold. When stopped at the Venezuelan border with $50,000 in cash, he told guards it was to “buy sausages from a Chinese acquaintance.” His Binance account showed he received $16 million, with at least $5 million tied to the Al-Law wallets. Binance documents showed the man’s net worth at $400,000, but he withdrew $4 million in hard currency before going inactive in late 2022. The account, however, stayed open into 2025. Carter-Ruck, Binance’s legal team, said : “Any suggestion that our client has knowingly facilitated bad actors in criminal conduct is also baseless.” They also claimed none of the wallets were marked for terror financing at the time and insisted no alerts were triggered by major blockchain tracking tools. Former CEO Changpeng Zhao , better known as CZ, was pardoned by President Trump in October after being charged with “willfully violating anti-money-laundering laws.” The White House defended the pardon, saying Trump was correcting overreach by the Biden administration in its “war on cryptocurrency.” CZ remains barred from executive roles at Binance, but his longtime business partner He Yi, who shares three children with him, was just named co-CEO this month. The Treasury Department had earlier blasted Binance for failing to report over 100,000 suspicious transactions, tied to crimes including child exploitation, ransomware, drug trafficking, and terrorism. And now, in November, 306 families of October 7 2023 attack victims filed a lawsuit accusing Binance of enabling Hamas and Hezbollah to launder millions through its platform.

56173093,https://cryptonews.com/?p=466586,1766395361,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/56173093.jpeg,Russia’s Central Bank Says Bitcoin Mining Is Strengthening the Ruble,https://cryptonews.com/news/russias-central-bank-says-bitcoin-mining-is-strengthening-the-ruble/,"Russia’s Central Bank has acknowledged that crypto mining contributes to the ruble’s strength, though quantifying its exact impact remains difficult as much of the industry operates in gray areas. Governor Elvira Nabiullina made the statement while responding to questions about the sector’s influence on foreign exchange markets, according to a local report . The acknowledgment comes as senior Kremlin officials push to formally classify mining as an export activity in Russia’s trade accounts, which further shows the sector’s growing importance to the national economy despite regulatory uncertainties. Governor Elvira Nabiullina. | Source: GFMAG Mining Emerges as Informal Export Driver Deputy Chief of Staff Maxim Oreshkin argued at the VTB “Russia Calling!” forum that crypto mining should be treated as an export activity because mined digital assets effectively flow abroad even without crossing physical borders. He described the sector as “ a new export item ” that Russia “ doesn’t value very well ,” citing the underestimation of mining-related financial flows as the reason for incorrect ruble exchange rate forecasts. Industry figures estimate Russia produces tens of thousands of Bitcoins annually, with daily mining revenue reaching approximately 1 billion rubles. The Industrial Mining Association reports Russia ranks second globally for mining, accounting for over 16% of the world’s hashrate in the summer months, though network halving reduced output from roughly 55,000 BTC in 2023 to around 35,000 BTC in 2024. Nabiullina acknowledged mining’s currency market impact but emphasized context, stating that for mining, “ it’s probably difficult to quantify its impact right now, because a significant portion of it is still in the gray zone. But in any case, this mining didn’t emerge this year, meaning the exchange rate appreciation can’t be attributed to the fact that it has risen sharply. “ Gray Market Operations Cost Billions Despite Legalization Russia legalized crypto mining on November 1, 2024 , requiring legal entities and entrepreneurs to register with the Federal Tax Service, while exempting individual miners who consume less than 6,000 kWh per month. Corporate mining is taxed at 25%, while individuals pay progressive rates of 13-22%, with non-residents paying 30%. Despite legalization efforts, illegal and quasi-legal mining continues costing Russia millions annually through stolen electricity and unpaid taxes. Broadcaster Ren TV reported that fear of high taxes and electricity costs is driving many miners underground , with annual budget losses reaching billions of rubles as operators resort to meter manipulation, bribery, and secret agreements with utility workers. Illegal crypto miners in a Russian facility. | Source: Ren TV/Izvestia/Screenshot Recent investigations uncovered widespread theft, including a St. Petersburg operator who bypassed meters since 2018, costing the grid half a billion rubles, and a Dagestan farm hidden in coolant tanks. A power supply employee described the scale of the illegal operation, saying: “ The illegal crypto mining farm was using more power than an entire five-story building. ” Police arrested an employee of Omsk Thermal Power Plant who accepted 500,000 rubles in bribes to facilitate grid theft. Banks Enter Digital Assets While Payments Remain Banned Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender, is testing decentralized finance tools and offering regulated crypto-linked investments totaling 1.5 billion rubles in structured bonds and digital financial assets tied to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and broader crypto portfolios. Deputy Chairman Anatoly Popov confirmed active dialogue with the Bank of Russia and Rosfinmonitoring on integrating crypto services within regulated frameworks while building proprietary blockchain infrastructure. Despite the growth across verticals, State Duma Committee Chairman Anatoly Aksakov recently reaffirmed the country’s strict payment bans , declaring at a TASS press conference: “ We must understand that cryptocurrencies will never become money within our country. ” Russian lawmaker Anatoly Aksakov said that payments in Russia must only be conducted in rubles, dismissing crypto becoming legal tender. #RussiaCrypto #CryptoPayments #CryptoRegulation https://t.co/BLk0c4qHcQ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 17, 2025 “ They can only be used as an investment instrument. If payment is required, it will only be in rubles ,” he added. Central Bank Governor Nabiullina has repeatedly called for bans on crypto exchanges and token trading , despite Russia recording $376.3 billion in incoming transactions between July 2024 and June 2025. First Deputy Chairman Vladimir Chistyukhin emphasized the urgency of regulatory action, stating that laws governing cryptocurrency transactions “ must be passed as quickly as possible. “ However, the bank also supports tokenization solutions to grant foreign buyers access to Russian company shares as a potential sanctions workaround.

While money is moving towards undervalued projects that continue to build strong communities and possession of obvious utility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of those cryptos that is drawing new attention for demonstrating those same early signs of momentum prior to public and widespread understanding. Currently up for grabs with the low cost of only $0.035, MUTM has already been touted as the best cheap cryptocurrency to buy and for obvious reasons – presenting early investors with considerable entry without necessarily waiting for the onset of more qualitative characteristics and attributes that are absolutely novel and innovative within the market. As the presale of Mutuum Finance continues to move with great momentum, already breaking through the 98% in phase 6 with almost $20 million and more than 18,550 individual account holders on board, it’s quickly proving that it aims to be among the top cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin Price Analysis Dogecoin is currently testing the crucial levels of resistance after the recent bounce at the low of $0.11993, now at $0.13182, close to the crucial level of $0.131 to $0.138. As far as chart analysis is concerned, it could very well be the point where the price stagnates, with a possible rejection leading to a dip to lower levels, whereas a clean breakout at $0.13837 will be an indication to turn the tables and look ahead to a possible positive move. Even as traders are keen on analyzing this crucial level, their attention is slowly shifting to those still in the development phase with an active level of functionality and positive adoption rates, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly making a name for itself as one of the top cryptos. The price of tokens in Phase 6 of the presale stands at $0.035, marking the last chance for those who wish to invest at a cost-friendly price before the next phase, Phase 7, begins at $0.04. In a move to promote easy access to investment, Mutuum Finance is allowing credit/debit card purchases. Its two-tier lending platform has received widespread acclaim for being highly scalable and efficient. With its ability to connect lenders to borrowers through optimized liquidity pools, the MUTM platform makes it possible for users to generate highly attractive returns while also optimizing capital use. With more than 18,550 users contributing over $19.5 million, the presale shows robust market adoption. Secure and Scalable Platform Major milestones in the current development phase include: Finalizing Smart Contracts for seamless functioning of the protocol. Performing extensive testing and quality assurance to ensure system reliability. Building front-end and back-end portions of its decentralized application (DApp). Incorporating the latest risk management solutions in order to ensure the stability and security of the platform. The next phase will see the beta launch on the Sepolia Testnet . All this sets the stage for the deployment on the Mainnet. It is quite clear that MUTM is focused on the creation of a secure and efficient DeFi platform that has the ability to accommodate growth. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is over 98% sold out in Phase 6, priced at $0.035, and has 18,550+ individual holders who have cumulatively raised close to $19.5M. Phase 7 will see the pricing moved up to $0.04, marking one of the last chances for early bird investment. The sale of Mutuum Finance offers a great blend of real DeFi usage and potential gains due to its two-tier lending system, interest-bearing tokens, and the upcoming V1 Sepolia Testnet, making it the best cheap cryptocurrency to buy for investors seeking tangible growth in 2026.

The 1-year rate sets the tone for new loans, while the 5-year anchors mortgage pricing. This comes as China’s economy shows more bruises, especially across retail, housing, and industry. November’s data came in weaker than markets expected, as retail sales rose just 1.3% year-on-year, falling well short of the 2.8% growth economists had called. That’s also a drop from October’s 2.9%, which already wasn’t strong. Industrial production climbed 4.8%, missing the 5.0% projection. That’s the lowest growth since August 2024. China’s housing crash deepens as property prices fall Real estate is still a mess. Fixed asset investment, which includes infrastructure and property, dropped 2.6% between January and November compared to last year. That’s a sharper fall than the 2.3% economists expected. The pain’s widespread. New home prices in Beijing , Guangzhou, and Shenzhen slipped 1.2% in November. Meanwhile, resale home prices plunged 5.8% from the year before. No part of the housing market is holding up. At Cornell University, professor Eswar Prasad said that “some stimulus will help,” but warned that “monetary policy probably won’t get that much traction” with the private sector still fragile. He added, “With growth momentum weakening, they’re going to have to turn on the stimulus taps, some monetary stimulus, perhaps, and ideally a little more fiscal stimulus, but that really needs to be packaged with some broader reforms.” China’s finance ministry isn’t ignoring that. Earlier in December, they said they plan to issue ultra-long-term special government bonds in 2025 to support key infrastructure projects. Officials also promised to push forward actions to lift consumer spending, trying to stop deflation from setting in deeper. But even with that, investors aren’t getting excited. Yuan stays soft despite temporary trade relief with Washington The recent trade arrangement with Washington is giving China a short breather. Tariffs on Chinese exports have been suspended, which could support export growth in 2025. The country still hopes to hit its “around 5%” growth goal, but nothing is guaranteed. Domestic demand is still weak. On the currency front, the yuan isn’t showing much strength. The onshore rate stayed flat at 7.04 per dollar on Monday. The offshore yuan weakened. Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics, said the yuan might push below 7.00 briefly over the next six months, but he doubts it’ll stay there. “I’d be surprised if it was below seven for a sustained period. That would be viewed probably as a challenge and risk in China.” He now sees the yuan ending 2026 around 7.03, slightly firmer than his earlier 7.05 call from November. Schenker’s not buying into the bullish outlook some banks are pushing. Goldman Sachs, for example, thinks the yuan could go as high as 6.85 in twelve months. But that view clashes with recent calls from inside China, where some former central bank officials and economists are arguing for a stronger yuan. Their pitch? It could help rebalance the economy and reduce trade pressure.

In this context, crypto commentator Pumpius responded to circulating claims that he had disposed of a significant XRP position shortly before the launch of XRP-related ETFs . The claims suggested that more than six million units had been sold, raising questions about confidence and timing. Pumpius rejected the framing of these rumors and instead outlined a different explanation centered on long-term planning rather than liquidation. According to Pumpius, the core issue was not whether XRP had been abandoned, but how a substantial holding was reorganized. He emphasized that his main XRP position still exists and that the changes made were structural rather than transactional. By avoiding direct engagement with speculation, he positioned his response as a clarification of intent rather than a rebuttal of every allegation. DID I REALLY DUMP OVER 6,000,000 XRP RIGHT BEFORE THE ETF LAUNCH?! There are rumors flying that I dumped my main XRP bag of over 6.2 million XRP right before the ETFs went live. I am not going to dive into the noise. I will only say this. My primary XRP position has been… — Pumpius (@pumpius) December 20, 2025 Focus on Structural Reorganization Rather Than Sales Pumpius explained that his primary XRP holdings were restructured to meet several objectives associated with asset protection and longevity. He pointed to considerations such as tax efficiency, enhanced security against hacks and scams, and estate planning measures that ensure beneficiaries are automatically covered if unforeseen circumstances arise. While he acknowledged that such restructuring could involve a range of legal or custodial mechanisms, he deliberately avoided confirming specific methods. He made clear that no disclosure would be offered regarding whether the XRP was converted into ETF units, placed under an LLC or trust, transferred between wallets, or subjected to alternative custody arrangements. The emphasis remained on the principle that ownership had not been abandoned. In his words, XRP was not sold in the conventional sense implied by the rumors, but prepared in anticipation of a changing market environment. Ongoing Exposure and Strategic Flexibility Beyond the primary holding, Pumpius noted that he continues to maintain additional XRP positions designed for flexibility. These smaller allocations are intended for deployment into projects built on the XRP Ledger, early-stage opportunities, and other high-upside strategies as they appear. This distinction between long-term structured holdings and active capital reflects an approach he associates with experienced participants rather than passive holders. He framed this behavior as a natural evolution as markets mature and institutional participation increases. In his view, sophisticated capital begins to prioritize legal, tax, and custody structures over simple wallet-based storage when regulatory clarity and financial products expand.

The comment emphasized the importance of disciplined asset management, arguing that early positioning carries responsibility to manage holdings in a way that maximizes long-term outcomes rather than reacting impulsively to market noise. Overall, Pumpius presented his actions as deliberate preparation rather than exit, underscoring continued confidence in XRP while signaling an approach aligned with institutional-style asset management.

56174443,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=882478,1766397006,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56174443.jpeg,Baidu partners with Uber and Lyft to roll out robotaxis in Britain by 2026,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/baidu-teams-uber-lyft-robotaxi-britains/,"Baidu is bringing driverless taxis to London starting next year. The company will work with Lyft and Uber to put its Apollo Go self-driving cars on the capital’s streets. The companies made the announcements on social media. Lyft plans to start testing several dozen autonomous vehicles in 2026, pending government approval. David Risher, Lyft’s chief executive, posted on X this Monday that they want to “scale to hundreds from there.” Uber said its first trial should start in the first half of 2026. The company said it’s excited about helping Britain lead in transportation and giving Londoners another safe travel option next year. Baidu now operates in 22 cities and handles more than 250,000 trips weekly, according to the company. It’s racing against Chinese competitors like WeRide and Western giants including Alphabet’s Waymo. Britain has become attractive to driverless car companies after the government decided in June to speed up approval for autonomous vehicles on public roads. Officials want to allow robotaxi pilot programs starting spring 2026. Baidu looks to be among the first operators. London has a “Vision Zero” goal to wipe out all serious injuries and deaths in its transportation system by 2041. Self-driving technology is expected to play a big part. Waymo also eyes London market As reported by Cryptopolitan previously, Waymo is also preparing to test in London , aiming for full service in 2026. The company currently operates or plans to launch in 26 markets, including Tokyo and New York City. Baidu has been pushing hard into international markets, with testing underway in the United Arab Emirates and Switzerland. Ten years ago, robotaxis seemed like science fiction. This year they became a regular transportation choice in big U.S. cities and parts of Asia. Waymo kept expanding and dominates the American robotaxi market. Tesla and Amazon’s Zoox both launched their first services in 2025. Baidu’s Apollo Go leads in China. Some parents now send teens to school in Waymos. Women often mention they like the privacy compared to rides with strangers who drive for traditional taxi and ride-hailing services. Waymo has done well enough that Tesla CEO Elon Musk acknowledged his rival’s success after criticizing the Google-affiliated company before. At Tesla’s shareholder meeting on November 6, Musk thanked Waymo for “paving the path here” on regulatory approvals that let robotaxis operate across much of the U.S. Public fear persists despite safety record Driverless transportation has a long way to go before going mainstream. According to an early 2025 American Automobile Association survey , 66% of U.S. drivers said they fear autonomous vehicles and 25% were uncertain. The skepticism hasn’t changed much from what AAA found in 2024. There have been lots of complaints about noise, congestion and sometimes erratic driving from robotaxis. Transportation workers worry about economic impacts. Still, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says documented harmful collisions caused by autonomous vehicles have been relatively few so far. Robotaxi fares currently run higher than alternatives, according to Obi, which tracks ride-hail pricing and compared Waymo to human-driven Uber and Lyft rides. Both safety records and costs could change as fleets grow from hundreds to thousands of vehicles. With 2026 just around the corner, the robotaxi market stands at an important point.

Dubbed “Stealka,” the new infostealer can “hijack accounts, steal cryptocurrency, and install a crypto miner on their victims’ devices,” Kaspersky warned in a recent blog post . “Most frequently, this infostealer disguises itself as game cracks, cheats and mods,” it added. For those unaware, infostealers are a category of malware that allows bad actors to extract confidential information from a victim’s device and send it to a remote server. In the past, crypto users have been consistently targeted using this attack vector, often through a variety of disguised applications, websites, and installer packages. How does Stealka target crypto users? According to the cybersecurity firm, cybercriminals are distributing Stealka across legitimate platforms like GitHub, SourceForge, and Google Sites, where they are uploaded as cracked software and mods for popular games and applications. Since these platforms have a reputation for trustworthiness and host a large open-source and gaming community, it give the attackers a convenient way to reach a broad number of unsuspecting users. The malware activates once a user downloads the malicious file and runs it on their system. Kaspersky estimates that the campaign has been active since at least November 2025, and instances of the malware have been found imitating various popular apps and games. See below. A pirated version of Microsoft Visio containing the stealer is hosted on GitHub. Source: Kaspersky. “Sometimes, however, attackers go a step further (and possibly use AI tools) to create entire fake websites that look quite professional. Without the help of a robust antivirus, the average user is unlikely to realize anything is amiss,” Kaspersky added. However, it noted that some of these fake sites may have subtle signs, such as mismatched product names or odd descriptions in the form of exaggerated claims that don’t match the actual software being offered. In some instances, these malicious websites also pretend to scan files using logos of antivirus vendors to assure users that the downloads are safe, but in reality, it’s just a cheap tactic to trick them into lowering their guard. A false antivirus scanning interface employed by bad actors. Source: Kaspersky. “Of course, no such scanning actually takes place; the attackers are merely trying to create an illusion of trustworthiness,” Kaspersky said. Once installed, Stealka targets data from browsers developed on Chromium and Gecko engines, two of the most widely used platforms that form the foundation for many popular browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Yandex Browser, Edge, Brave, among others. From there on, it can steal autofill data such as sign-in credentials, saved addresses, and payment card details. Kaspersky also found that the malware can target the settings and databases of 115 browser extensions for crypto wallets, including Binance, Coinbase, Crypto.com, SafePal, Trust Wallet, MetaMask, and others, alongside two-factor authentication services like Authy and Google Authenticator. Notably, at least 80 wallet applications may be at risk, as wallet configuration data contains sensitive details like private keys, seed-phrase data, wallet file paths, and encryption parameters, Kaspersky said. How to keep your crypto assets safe To prevent Stealka and similar malware from compromising user data, Kaspersky advises using reliable antivirus software and urges users to avoid pirated software and unofficial game mods. As an added safety measure, Kaspersky urges users to avoid storing sensitive information in browsers. The attack vectors used by infostealers to target crypto users are constantly evolving , which makes threats like these especially concerning. For instance, last month, cybersecurity research team SpiderLabs uncovered a major campaign that promoted the Eternidade Stealer using complex social engineering tactics to deploy malware across WhatsApp. Back in September, ModStealer, another stealthy infostealer, was found to be targeting cryptocurrency wallets across Windows, Linux, and macOS while evading major antivirus engines.

56174595,https://timestabloid.com/?p=92959,1766397646,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Dogecoin (DOGE) Loses Momentum as Seasoned Investors Flock Into This Top Crypto,https://timestabloid.com/dogecoin-doge-loses-momentum-as-seasoned-investors-flock/,"Dogecoin’s recent rally is showing clear signs of fatigue as market data points to weakening investor confidence and growing bearish pressure. The meme coin has slipped back toward the $0.12 level after a fresh wave of selling, even as the broader crypto market remains highly sensitive to macroeconomic signals. On-chain and derivatives indicators suggest that large holders are reducing exposure, prompting seasoned investors to reassess what crypto to buy now. As momentum fades for DOGE, attention is increasingly shifting toward a fast-growing defi crypto in presale, with Mutuum Finance emerging as a top crypto narrative for 2025 as its Phase 6 allocation nears full capacity. Dogecoin Weakens As Bearish Signals Multiply Dogecoin is currently trading at a loss after falling nearly 3% over the past 24 hours, underperforming amid anticipation of US CPI data and broader risk-off sentiment. On-chain data shows that wallets holding between 100 million and 1 billion DOGE have reduced their combined holdings from 36.14 billion to 34.77 billion since early December, confirming distribution by large investors. At the same time, the percentage of DOGE supply in profit has declined from 53.95% to 50.70%, signaling softening demand. Derivatives markets further reinforce the bearish outlook. Short positions now account for more than 54% of DOGE futures activity, indicating that traders are positioning for downside continuation. Technically, DOGE remains trapped in a falling channel, trading well below its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages, a structure that confirms a longer-term bearish trend. Analysts warn that if current levels fail to hold, Dogecoin could revisit the $0.074 support zone, where over 28 billion tokens last changed hands. This loss of momentum is driving experienced investors to explore alternative opportunities when evaluating the best crypto to buy now. Presale Momentum Draws Capital Toward Mutuum Finance As confidence wanes around Dogecoin, Mutuum Finance is capturing attention as a new crypto coin still priced at $0.035. The project is currently in Presale Phase 6, which is now 99% filled, underscoring rapidly accelerating demand. Since the presale began, Mutuum Finance has raised $19,500,000 and attracted 18550 holders, highlighting broad participation at this stage. The current price in phase 6 stands at $0.035, representing a 250% increase from the $0.01 phase one entry. Phase 6 is selling out fast, meaning the opportunity to secure MUTM at this price is quickly disappearing. Once Phase 7 opens, the token price will rise nearly 20% to $0.04, while the confirmed launch price is set at $0.06. Based on current positioning, early buyers are targeting a projected 450% upside after launch, making MUTM a compelling answer to what crypto to invest in as capital rotates toward presale scarcity. For investors focused on identifying the best crypto to buy now, this narrowing entry window is becoming a decisive factor. V1 Protocol Roadmap Strengthens Long-Term Conviction Beyond presale dynamics, Mutuum Finance is differentiating itself through a clearly defined development roadmap. The team has confirmed that the V1 protocol will debut on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025 , marking the project’s first operational milestone. The initial release will include a Liquidity Pool, mtToken, Debt Token, and an automated Liquidator Bot, with ETH and USDT serving as the first supported assets for lending, borrowing, and collateral functions. This structured rollout is designed to validate the protocol’s mechanics before broader expansion, reinforcing MUTM’s positioning as a defi crypto built for sustainable usage rather than short-term speculation. For seasoned investors stepping away from momentum-driven assets like DOGE, this focus on execution is a key reason Mutuum Finance is increasingly viewed as a top crypto for longer-term exposure. Leaderboard Incentives Fuel Active Participation Adding to engagement, Mutuum Finance recently launched a live dashboard featuring a leaderboard of the top 50 holders. A notable feature is the 24-Hour Leaderboard, which resets daily at 00:00 UTC and rewards the number one ranked user with a $500 MUTM bonus, provided at least one transaction is completed within the 24-hour window. This incentive structure encourages consistent on-platform activity and strengthens community participation during the presale phase. With Dogecoin’s rally losing momentum and technical risks pointing toward deeper downside, seasoned investors are increasingly reallocating toward early-stage opportunities with clearer growth catalysts. As Presale Phase 6 of Mutuum Finance nears a complete sellout, the chance to enter at $0.035 is rapidly closing, positioning MUTM as the best crypto to buy now for those looking ahead to 2025.

The market structure shows no indication of a bullish shift. SHIB trades below all major moving averages, signaling ongoing weakness in price action. SHIB is trading at around $0.000007260 at press time, indicating a 2.37% decline in the last 24 hours. SHIB price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap The 200-day moving average sits far above current levels. This key technical indicator serves as a distant ceiling rather than an achievable target. Multiple attempts to break higher have failed over recent months. The latest upward movement appears no different from previous rejected rallies. Price action reveals sellers maintain firm control. SHIB cannot overcome even short-term resistance levels. Each bounce meets fresh selling pressure. The pattern of lower highs and lower lows remains intact. This technical structure confirms the bearish trend continues without interruption. Weak Volume Signals Absence of Genuine Demand The recent green candle lacks substance. Buyers did not step in aggressively to push prices higher. Instead, sellers temporarily stepped aside. This created a temporary vacuum that allowed prices to drift upward without meaningful support. Source: TradingView Trading volume tells the real story. Activity levels did not increase significantly during the bounce. No surge in demand appeared. Accumulation patterns remain absent from the charts. The price movement represents low-liquidity drift rather than genuine buying interest. This distinction matters significantly for traders and investors. True reversals occur when demand overwhelms available supply. Current conditions show supply merely pausing. Sellers return as soon as prices approach resistance zones. The lack of sustained buying pressure prevents any meaningful recovery. Technical Indicators Confirm Bearish Momentum The Relative Strength Index remains weak and flat. RSI cannot generate sustained upward momentum. This indicator reflects market indecision and a lack of bullish conviction. No structural pressure exists that might force short sellers to cover positions. The technical setup lacks all components necessary for a bull market. Genuine bull runs require higher highs and restored support levels. Rising volume must accompany upward price movement. SHIB exhibits none of these characteristics. The asset remains stuck in a gradual decline that erodes previous gains. Years of narrative-driven optimism face erosion. The meme coin phenomenon that drove earlier rallies appears exhausted. Without fundamental changes to market dynamics, the most probable scenario is further downside.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-22 10:05:30

My preference for IBIT among Bitcoin ETFs is driven by its status as the ""gold standard"" for spot cryptocurrency funds, offering superior liquidity and institutional-grade management. This analysis provides a technical breakdown of Bitcoin to identify the specific ""zone of interest"" for future accumulation. Current risk factors necessitate a patient approach, as I await additional confirmation signals before upgrading my recommendation back to a ""Buy."" Investment Thesis The purpose of this article is to evaluate the prospects for investing in iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), considering the current situation in the cryptocurrency market and the emergence of technical factors signaling the potential formation of a global downward trend for Bitcoin. I was wrong to buy early because the price broke through some key support levels, like the lower limit of the global uptrend channel. As a result, now we're seeing a consolidation phase and a potential bearish trend forming. Nevertheless, my overall view on Bitcoin and the ETF that tracks it remains bullish. Given the uncertainty surrounding both the fundamentals and the technical picture for cryptocurrencies at the end of 2025, my recommendation for IBIT has been temporarily downgraded from «Buy» to «Hold.» That said, what I find interesting is buying Bitcoin from the key support zone ($74,400–$78,200). As soon as the price consolidates in this area, you can be sure that I will open a buy position on IBIT. Until that happens, however, I recommend holding. Another situation that could trigger a change in rating to «Buy» is if prices recover above $98,240. Once they stabilize above this level, this will demonstrate to us a potential reversal of the downtrend to an uptrend in the medium term. My previous thesis and main arguments My previous article's main thesis was that Bitcoin prices would recover after the downward correction phase ended. Among the additional factors contributing to the resumption of cryptocurrency growth should be the inflow of funds from institutional investors as a result of improvements in the regulatory framework for the industry, as well as the reduction in the Fed's interest rate, increasing investor appetite for risky assets. The technical picture of Bitcoin charts, though, hasn't shown any signs of an uptrend coming back since prices broke through the key support level of $98,240, staying below it and signaling that the market is still feeling bearish. Overview of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF and catalysts for its growth IBIT is the «gold standard» in the world of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds. This is the largest ETF managed by BlackRock. With $68.35 billion in assets under management, this is the most liquid Bitcoin fund and a clear leader in its field. Given its low commission of 0.25%, this is a profitable way to invest in spot Bitcoin. This is the same commission as its direct competitor, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF ( FBTC ), and lower than another competitor, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) (1.5%). IBIT works by owning physical Bitcoin, meaning that each ETF share is backed by a certain number of tokens stored in a custodial wallet. The main operator for this is Coinbase Custody, where cold storage technology is used to protect assets. An advantage of investing in IBIT for investors is that they can buy essentially the same Bitcoin without having to go through a laborious procedure (starting with registering a crypto wallet or cryptocurrency account on an exchange, ending with storing private keys and withdrawing funds after selling cryptocurrency through operators or exchanges). IBIT's main growth driver, specifically its AUM, has been the inflow of capital from institutional investors, whose numbers among holders of this asset are growing. This can be explained by improvements in the regulatory framework governing the crypto industry and the digital currency market. Over the past 12 months, the IBIT has received investments from 1,511 institutional investors . Meanwhile, it has been removed from the portfolios of 368 institutional investors. The net inflow of large clients was 1,143 institutional investors. This amounted to an inflow of $11.1 billion in monetary terms. Most of the capital inflow occurred in Q4 2024, with institutional investors investing $5.75 billion. For Q3 2025, the inflow amounted to $1.5 billion, and the outflow amounted to $514 million. IBIT Institutional Buying and Selling by Quarter But if we look at the flow of money in and out for all types of investors (both institutional and individuals), it's been negative over the last three months. For example, in the last month, total client outflows amounted to $1.16 billion . On December 17, the figure was $210.68 million. Starting from the last week of October, outflows have been frequent, negatively affecting AUM. Given the decline in the value of Bitcoin and the outflow of investors since my last article on IBIT, it has fallen from $80.28 billion to $68.35 billion (-14.86%). The only five-day period when investment inflows exceeded outflows was in the second week of December. I believe this trend is due to two factors. Firstly, the fall in the price of Bitcoin has increased investor fear, reducing their willingness to invest in cryptocurrencies. Secondly, it is due to the outflow of technology sector stocks, as a result of which many investors are fixing other positions, for example, in Bitcoin ETFs, to maintain the margin requirements of their accounts. IBIT Fund Flows Charts Technical analysis of Bitcoin and its impact on IBIT Due to the fact that IBIT is an ETF with Bitcoin as its underlying asset and its portfolio consists of 100% of this asset, there is a full correlation between IBIT price and the BTC-USD pair. Therefore, to assess the investment attractiveness of the fund under review, attention must be paid to the technical picture of the Bitcoin chart. For this purpose, let us first determine the global trend by analyzing the 1W time frame, then look at the 1D time frame, allowing us to assess the medium-term outlook for IBIT. Bitcoin Technical Analysis on the 1W Timeframe. Source: TradingView The weekly chart shows an upward trend channel that formed earlier. It's been a bullish trend since November 2022, though it's losing steam now that the price has broken through its lower boundary. An additional support was provided by the horizontal line at $98,240, but it could not hold under pressure from sellers. The breakdown not only indicates a strengthening of bearish sentiment in the market but it also signals the potential formation of a global downtrend. The longer the price remains below the support level, the less relevant the previous upward trend channel becomes. But for a bearish trend to fully form in the long term, it's necessary for the price to break through the key support zone ($74,400–$78,200). Until this price zone remains relevant and unbroken, a further decline in Bitcoin will be difficult. Bitcoin Technical Analysis on the 1D Timeframe. Source: TradingView The daily chart shows Bitcoin in a medium-term downtrend, and this remains relevant as the price is still within the trend channel. The trend began at the historical high. Following a breakout of the $98,240 support level, the price is moving towards the previously indicated support zone ($74,400–$78,200). Since November 21, 2025, the price has been trading within a short-term sideways range. Due to this, an additional support zone has formed ($80,500–$83,800). In conclusion, to continue the downward trend, the sellers need to overcome two different support zones at once: one on the daily chart and the other on the weekly chart. Given this, I believe that the price support zone ($74,400–$78,200) is somewhat protected. That means if the price falls to this level, it is less likely to break below it. Consequently, I consider this support level to be a potential area of interest for opening positions on Bitcoin and IBIT. When it is reached, I will change my rating from «Hold» to «Buy». Risks of the investment thesis In assessing the risks of an investment idea, it is important to consider the factors that will keep the price of Bitcoin under pressure from sellers. When analyzing technical factors, I believe that the key risk is a potential breakout of the support zone ($74,400–$78,200). If this happens, a global bearish trend is likely to form, in which case the only recommendation would be to «Sell.» In addition, we should continue to monitor developments surrounding Strategy Inc. ( MSTR ). The company's activities were one of the reasons for Bitcoin's rise to historic highs. But the financial policy of placing convertible bonds to buy cryptocurrency is becoming a powder keg, and an explosion could lead to a record price crash. As of March 2025, its debt is $8.22 billion . Strategy (MicroStrategy) - Total debt on balance sheet (from 1998 to 2025) This scenario is risky for IBIT because if Bitcoin's price drops a lot, MSTR's shares will stay under pressure. Also, its net asset value will go down proportionally, so paying off its debts could lead to financial losses. In order to compensate for this, the same MSTR will need to sell its Bitcoin reserves. And this, again, will provoke an additional wave of cryptocurrency sell-offs. The mere mention of possible sales of Bitcoin from MicroStrategy's reserves leads to increased market volatility. If this turns out to be more than just rumors and speculation but actual practice, the potential impact of this negative event cannot be underestimated. Then the price of Bitcoin could fall even further, resulting in IBIT's profitability proportionally falling into the loss zone. Conclusion Based on the results of my fundamental and technical analysis, my recommendation is to hold IBIT shares and spot Bitcoin assets. This recommendation is based solely on the fact that the risks of a decline in cryptocurrency prices remain, with the potential zone of interest for opening purchases located below. Therefore, my recommendation to «Hold» is, in a way, an expression of a deferred position (Buy Limit) on IBIT as soon as the spot price of Bitcoin reaches the support price zone ($74,400–$78,200).",MSTR|BTC-USD|IBIT|IBIT:CA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-22 10:06:20

This acquisition directly targets the growing demand for comprehensive digital asset services among registered investment advisors (RIAs). The deal signals a major consolidation aimed at bridging the gap between secure custody and accessible investment platforms. Why is This Merger a Game-Changer for Digital Asset Services? The core of this acquisition lies in integration. Anchorage Digital brings its battle-tested, institutional-grade custody infrastructure to the table. Securitize for Advisors contributes a specialized platform that RIAs already use to navigate tokenized securities and digital assets. By combining these forces, the new entity aims to create a seamless, one-stop suite of digital asset services . This eliminates the friction advisors often face when trying to offer crypto exposure to clients through fragmented providers. What Does This Mean for Registered Investment Advisors?

The two-day event brought together policymakers, asset managers and technology leaders to discuss global investment trends, digital assets, artificial intelligence and the future architecture of financial markets. Wang spoke as a panelist during the Grand Forum Day session titled “The Future Stack of Digital Finance: Investments, Transactions, Custody, and the New Market Architecture,” which examined how institutional-grade infrastructure is influencing the evolution of digital finance. Moderated by David Gevorkian, managing director of TWO23 Group, the panel featured senior executives from major digital asset platforms, including Kevin Lee, chief business officer at Gate; Yana Minaylova, head of institutional sales and business development for MENA at Binance; and Jessica Wu, head of APAC at Bitpanda Technology Solutions. Custody, Risk and Capital Efficiency During the discussion, Wang emphasized that institutional conversations around custody are fundamentally driven by risk management and operational considerations. “When institutions talk about custody, the discussion usually starts with security – transparency, control of assets and risk reduction,” Wang said.”But custody is not the objective in itself. The underlying question is how clients can trade more efficiently while managing risk.” She noted that as custodian and off-exchange settlement models become more common, market participants are increasingly focused on capital usage. “As custody structures are introduced, whether through multi-party arrangements or off-exchange solutions, the immediate challenge for the industry is capital efficiency,” Wang said. “The priority is to improve capital efficiency, on top of enhanced security and reduced counterparty risk to exchanges.” Regulatory Clarity in the UAE Wang also highlighted the role of regulatory clarity in enabling institutional participation, pointing to the United Arab Emirates as a key example. “Bybit established its headquarters in the UAE some time ago, and we’ve seen regulations in the region become progressively clearer,” she said. “That clarity and certainty are critical for technology innovation and for building confidence among global institutions.” She added that clearer frameworks have helped foster constructive dialogue between regulators, market participants and technology providers, supporting long-term market development. Tokenized Real-World Assets Addressing the growing interest in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), Wang noted that Bybit has supported access to regulated RWA products through collaborations with established financial institutions. “We’ve launched tokenized products in collaboration with Qatar National Bank and UBS that provide exposure to underlying money-market instruments,” Wang said. “These structures allow clients to access traditional returns within a digital asset framework, while benefiting from liquidity and trading functionality.” She cautioned, however, that the broader RWA landscape remains uneven. “The market today includes a wide range of structures and standards,” Wang said. “Our focus is on products that are well-structured, subject to appropriate oversight and designed to be tradable, so they can support liquidity in secondary markets.” Institutional Engagement Beyond Asset Exposure Wang concluded by encouraging institutions to take a broader view of how they engage with digital assets. “We’d like institutions to look beyond digital assets solely as an asset class and consider them as part of a broader blockchain infrastructure,” she said. “Participation can take many forms — from liquidity provision to agency trading or technology collaboration — depending on an institution’s business model and risk framework.” #Bybit / #TheCryptoArk / #IMakeIt About Bybit Bybit is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serving a global community of over 80 million users.

The South Korean crypto exchange giant has just announced a planned, temporary suspension of all SEI deposits and withdrawals. This proactive move is to ensure a smooth and secure transition for the Sei Network’s upcoming upgrade. If you use Bithumb for your SEI transactions, here is everything you need to know to navigate this brief pause confidently. Why Are SEI Deposits and Withdrawals Being Suspended? Bithumb is temporarily halting SEI deposits and withdrawals to provide direct support for the Sei Network’s mainnet transition. This is a standard and responsible practice among major exchanges when a blockchain undergoes a significant upgrade or hard fork. The suspension acts as a safety measure, preventing any potential loss of funds or transaction errors that could occur if the network was active during the changeover. The suspension window is precise. It begins at 3:00 a.m. UTC on December 23rd. During this time, you will be unable to move SEI tokens into or out of your Bithumb wallet. However, it’s crucial to understand what you can still do. What Can and Can’t You Do During the Suspension? Clarity is key during any service change. Let’s break down the exact impact of this temporary halt on your SEI holdings. Paused: All inbound and outbound transfers of SEI tokens. You cannot deposit SEI from an external wallet, nor can you withdraw SEI to one. Unaffected: Trading of SEI against other cryptocurrencies (like KRW, BTC, or ETH) on Bithumb’s spot trading platform. You can still buy, sell, and hold SEI within your exchange account. Unaffected: The security of your existing SEI balance stored on Bithumb. Your assets remain safe. Therefore, if you planned to trade SEI on the exchange itself, your activities are uninterrupted. This suspension only affects the movement of tokens across the blockchain network itself. How Should SEI Holders Prepare for This Change? A little preparation goes a long way in the crypto world. To ensure you face no inconvenience, consider these simple, actionable steps. Complete Planned Transfers Early: If you need to move SEI to or from Bithumb, complete those transactions well before the 3:00 a.m. UTC deadline on December 23rd. Monitor Official Channels: Follow Bithumb’s official announcements for the exact time when SEI deposits and withdrawals will be reinstated. The exchange will notify users once the network upgrade is stable and secure. Understand the Purpose: Recognize that this is a routine operational procedure for network support, not a reaction to any problem. Such suspensions are common and reflect the exchange’s commitment to asset safety. By taking these steps, you transform a potential hassle into a non-event, allowing the technical teams to work without causing user-side issues. What Does This Mean for the Future of SEI? This temporary pause is ultimately a sign of growth, not stagnation. Network upgrades typically aim to enhance scalability, security, or functionality. A successful transition supported by a major exchange like Bithumb can lead to a more robust and efficient Sei Network. This, in turn, can positively influence the ecosystem’s long-term development and potentially its adoption. While short-term service halts can cause minor friction, they are often the necessary groundwork for improved performance and future innovation. Conclusion: A Brief Pause for Long-Term Gain Bithumb’s decision to temporarily suspend SEI deposits and withdrawals is a standard, safety-first protocol for a significant network event. While it creates a short window where external token movement is paused, all internal trading functions remain active. For users, the path forward is simple: plan any necessary transfers ahead of time and watch for the official resumption notice. This coordinated effort between the exchange and the network developers is a cornerstone of a secure and evolving blockchain ecosystem, ensuring your SEI assets are managed responsibly through periods of upgrade and change. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still trade SEI on Bithumb during the suspension? A1: Yes. The suspension only affects depositing to and withdrawing from the exchange. Buying and selling SEI on Bithumb’s trading platform will continue as normal. Q2: How long will the SEI deposits and withdrawals be suspended? A2: Bithumb has not announced a specific end time. The suspension begins at 3:00 a.m. UTC on Dec. 23 and will last until the Sei Network upgrade is deemed stable. Users must monitor Bithumb’s official announcements for the reopening time. Q3: Is my SEI safe on Bithumb during this time? A3: Yes. The suspension is a network safety measure, not a security issue. Your SEI balance on the exchange remains secure and unaffected. Q4: What happens if I try to send SEI to Bithumb during the suspension? A4: Any attempt to deposit SEI from an external wallet during the suspension period will likely fail or be significantly delayed. It is strongly advised to wait until Bithumb confirms services have fully resumed. Q5: Will other exchanges also suspend SEI services? A5: It is common but not automatic. Each exchange manages its own response to network upgrades. Users of other platforms should check announcements from their respective exchanges regarding SEI deposits and withdrawals. Q6: Why doesn’t Bithumb just support the upgrade without suspending services? A6: Suspending services prevents transactions from being sent on a transitioning blockchain, which could lead to permanent loss of funds. It is the safest method to ensure no user assets are put at risk during the technical process. Found this guide on the SEI deposits and withdrawals suspension helpful? Navigating exchange announcements can be tricky. Share this clear explanation with your network on X (Twitter) or Telegram to help other SEI community members stay informed and prepared!

The planned native lending feature would allow institutions to borrow XRP directly on-chain, mirroring traditional money market functionality. This isn’t another experimental DeFi layer or third-party lending app. Ripple’s proposal embeds lending directly into the XRP Ledger core, allowing XRP to be lent, locked, deployed, and repaid entirely on-ledger. For institutions that demand regulated, predictable infrastructure, this distinction is decisive. Protocol-level rules replace counterparty exposure and smart-contract uncertainty with built-in transparency and enforcement. Each loan is fully isolated, meaning a default is contained to that single position, eliminating systemic, cascading risk. This modular, ring-fenced design mirrors traditional financial risk management and delivers a major trust upgrade for banks, payment firms, and large institutions assessing blockchain adoption. A standout feature is fixed-term locking: borrowed XRP is secured for predefined periods, mirroring traditional credit agreements. While in use, it’s removed from circulation, creating a dual effect, enabling productive deployment while tightening liquid supply, a dynamic often overlooked, as Diana highlights. In market terms, this shift is significant. When demand rises while available supply is constrained, upward price pressure naturally builds. Native lending strengthens this dynamic by anchoring XRP’s value to real financial utility, credit creation, liquidity provisioning, and institutional settlement, rather than speculative holding. More importantly, native lending fundamentally repositions XRP in global finance. It elevates XRP from a payment bridge to collateral-grade financial infrastructure. Institutions would not simply transact with XRP; they could deploy it across balance-sheet operations, treasury strategies, and liquidity management frameworks. For banks and payment firms, this is a decisive upgrade. Native lending introduces familiar credit mechanics, stronger risk controls, and clearer regulatory alignment, without sacrificing blockchain efficiency. As Diana notes, this is how digital assets become real money: not through hype, but through structure, trust, and measurable utility. If executed as planned, Ripple’s native lending could be a pivotal inflection point, elevating XRP from a simple transaction bridge to a collateral-grade financial asset embedded within institutional credit markets. Conclusion Ripple’s decision to integrate native lending directly into the XRP Ledger is more than a technical enhancement, it marks a strategic shift toward institutional-grade financial infrastructure. By enabling isolated, fixed-term XRP loans at the protocol level, Ripple brings blockchain functionality in line with the risk controls, predictability, and transparency that traditional financial institutions demand. This approach strengthens trust while turning XRP into a productive, collateral-ready asset that can be borrowed, deployed, and repaid within a regulated framework. As active loans temporarily lock supply and demand is driven by real financial use, XRP’s role evolves from speculative utility to structural relevance. If widely adopted, native lending could elevate XRP into a core asset within institutional credit markets, bridging blockchain innovation with real-world finance.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-22 11:16:24

Aave price falls 10% as whale offloads 230,350 AAVE While overall weakness remains a key factor, the primary catalyst for the latest downturn for AAVE appears to be a significant sell-off by a large holder. On-chain analytics platform Lookonchain tracked a wallet address that offloaded 230,350 AAVE tokens, valued at roughly $37.6 million. Notably, the whale did not convert the holdings directly into fiat or stablecoins but instead swapped them for 5,869.46 staked Ether (stETH) worth about $17.5 million, and 227.8 wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) worth around $20.1 million.

While the whale realised losses on the sale, overall sentiment amid the selling has AAVE under pressure. From a technical perspective, AAVE’s price action has entered a critical juncture following the whale-induced sell-off. The token is currently testing a key support zone around $158 that previously helped bulls in November. At the time, the area provided buying interest as the price moved to $188, then to $207.

While declining exchange balances and likely whale accumulation might infuse fresh optimism, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator has a bearish crossover. The short-term outlook is therefore largely precarious amid elevated volatility and broader market uncertainty. Bulls can stabilise if the price climbs above $170, with the key resistance at the 50-day exponential moving average currently around $193. Meanwhile, bears might fancy lows of $129.

Closer Than Expected?,https://timestabloid.com/this-ripple-ceos-suggestion-puts-xrp-price-near-100-closer-than-expected/,"Crypto proponent John Squire has drawn attention to earlier remarks from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse that outline a long-term valuation scenario for XRP tied to the expansion of institutional digital asset infrastructure. Squire’s commentary centers on the idea that XRP could ultimately reach a trillion-dollar market capitalization, which would place its unit price near the $100 range under current supply assumptions. Rather than framing the outlook as a short-term price forecast, the focus is placed on structural developments within global finance that could support such a valuation over time. According to Squire, the significance of Garlinghouse’s position lies in how XRP is positioned within a rapidly evolving financial environment, particularly as large institutions prepare for wider adoption of digital assets. The emphasis is not only on speculation, but on utility, scale, and integration with existing financial systems. XRP’S MASSIVE POTENTIAL Brad Garlinghouse has PREVIOUSLY suggested $XRP could reach a TRILLION-DOLLAR valuation, putting it near $100. That would spark one of the BIGGEST BREAKOUTS in crypto. The future might be closer than expected. pic.twitter.com/PUyyQT2hxN — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) December 20, 2025 Institutional Custody and the Scale of the Opportunity In a video referenced by Squire, Garlinghouse outlined expectations for the digital asset custody market, projecting it to approach $10 trillion by 2030. This estimate reflects the anticipated volume of digital assets that institutions will need to store, secure, and manage as tokenization, blockchain-based settlement, and regulated digital products expand. Garlinghouse explained that custody is only one component of a broader ecosystem. Institutions will also require reliable transfer mechanisms, compliant on- and off-ramps, and infrastructure capable of supporting tokenized assets. Within this framework, XRP is presented as part of a wider set of tools designed to facilitate efficient value movement across networks and jurisdictions. Existing Relationships and Product Synergy Squire’s analysis highlights Garlinghouse’s reference to early discussions with major global banks, including institutions already engaged with Ripple’s technology. In those conversations, banks explored whether Ripple could support custody services, even before the company could do so. Garlinghouse suggested that this demand existed well ahead of recent acquisitions and product expansions. The current strategy, as described, involves revisiting those relationships with a more complete offering. By combining custody solutions with payment, settlement, and tokenization capabilities, Ripple aims to deliver an integrated infrastructure to institutions that are already part of its network. Squire views this continuity as a key factor in understanding the long-term valuation case being made for XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Connecting Utility to Long-Term Valuation Squire’s central point is that Garlinghouse’s trillion-dollar valuation reference should be understood in the context of market size and functional demand, not isolated price targets. As institutional participation in digital assets increases, assets that are embedded in core financial workflows may benefit disproportionately. From this perspective, the future valuation of XRP is linked to how effectively it supports large-scale financial activity in custody, transfers, and tokenized markets. Squire concludes that if these components continue to align, the timeline for such outcomes may be closer than many expect, driven more by infrastructure adoption than by market sentiment alone.

To leverage USDC and simplify the on-ramp for millions of users into the world of blockchain. What Does Cygnus Joining the Circle Alliance Mean? The Circle Alliance is a collaborative network of fintech, banking, and Web3 leaders. Its goal is to build a more open, internet-native financial system. By joining, Cygnus aligns itself with this vision. The project plans to use its embedded wallet technology to act as a bridge. It will connect Instagram’s vast user base directly to on-chain assets and applications, with USDC on Base network playing a central role. How Will This Boost USDC Adoption? The strategy is clear and user-focused. Cygnus aims to demystify crypto for everyday social media users. Here’s how the partnership plans to drive growth for the Circle Alliance and its flagship stablecoin: Simplified Onboarding: Users can potentially access a wallet directly within their Instagram experience, removing complex setup steps. Core Use of USDC: By making USDC on Base a primary asset, the alliance ensures a stable, reliable currency for transactions and engagement. Multi-Chain Structure: Cygnus’s integrated system allows for flexibility, enabling users to interact across different blockchains seamlessly. This approach tackles a major challenge in crypto: user experience. The focus is on embedding finance into a platform people already use daily. What is the Circle Alliance’s Bigger Goal? Launched in late 2023, the Circle Alliance is more than just a business partnership. It represents a foundational shift. The consortium brings together traditional finance giants with cutting-edge Web3 protocols. Their collective effort is to develop an integrated, global financial system built on the internet’s infrastructure. The addition of a social media-focused player like Cygnus is a strategic masterstroke. It directly connects this new financial layer with a massive, engaged community.

At the same time, Presale Phase 6 has reached 99% sold out, making it evident that MUTM is going along the right lines instead of being stuck at the idea stage. With a current value of $0.035, it can be concluded that investors interested in sound, simple, and authentic DeFi crypto platforms are waiting for Mutuum Finance . The features of the project, ranging from the operations of DeFi lending and borrowing, interest tokens, to the strategies for maximum yields, have managed to impress more than 18,550 investors with more than $20 million in funds acquired so far, evident indications that MUTM is a serious business in the overall DeFi crypto space and serious business within the overall marketplace itself. MUTM Presale Phase 6 Almost at Full Allocation Mutuum Finance is currently in the Presale Stage 6, where the price of its tokens is valued at $0.035. However, the coming presale stage will showcase an increase in the token value, which will be valued at $0.04, showing a remarkable increase of 20%. Therefore, it is evident that this is among the last moments when investors will be able to invest in the token while it is still undervalued. Since Mutuum Finance has over 18,550 investors participating in its presale, raising over $19.5 million, it is clear that the presale is a reflection of the support it is getting among the investors. Since it is offering two lending options on its platform, along with the soon-to-be-announced V1 Sepolia Testnet, it is the best investment option for investors. Mutuum Finance is an implementation of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models, which will allow users to gain interest while still having control over their assets. With its provision of a complete, safe, and versatile DeFi crypto platform, MUTM is strategically positioned as the next big crypto. Halborn Security Audit The security of the platform is and will always remain a priority at Mutuum Finance. The lending and borrowing smart contracts of the platform are presently going through a thorough audit test conducted by Halborn Security, which has emerged as the preeminent firm in blockchain auditing. The entire process aims to check if the smart contracts are functioning correctly and if the funds deposited by the users are safe. Completion of the process will be followed by the announcement of the Sepolia Testnet. As part of the initiative to promote community engagement, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 token giveaway, where ten users will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The platform has also registered a high level of security and reliability, with a 95.0/100 trust level from CertiK. This, combined with its new lending system, makes MUTM poised to offer progressive and secure DeFi crypto experiences and thus qualifies it as the next big cryptocurrency to watch. Hands-On Learning: Sepolia Testnet Lending & Borrowing Mutuum Finance is scheduled to launch the Version 1 of the lending/borrowing protocol on the Sepolia Testnet by the end of 2025. Early adopters will be provided an opportunity to engage with prime assets like ETH and USDT, leveraging the liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, as well as the automated liquidator bot. The Sepolia Testnet gives early adopters an opportunity to practically learn by engaging with the platform functionality, solidifying that MUTM is a promising crypto investment opportunity within the realm of DeFi crypto. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) boasts 99% sold out in Phase 6 at a price of 0.035 USD, with more than 18,550+ holders collectively raising almost 19.5M USD. In Phase 7, the price will be raised to 0.04 USD. This will be one of the final opportunities to invest while the project is still growing. With a two-layer DeFi crypto lending platform, Halborn audit-secure smart contracts, the upcoming V1 Sepolia Testnet, and the community hosting a $100K giveaway event, MUTM offers real-world usage value together with immense growth potential as the next big crypto.

Solana; Here’s ChatGPT’s best pick for 2026,https://finbold.com/ethereum-v-solana-heres-chatgpts-best-pick-for-2026/,"Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ) have emerged as the two most prominent competing smart contract networks in the cryptocurrency space , often framed as rivals representing different design philosophies and growth paths. Now, as the market looks ahead to 2026, ChatGPT has weighed that competition and identified its best pick for next year between the two decentralized finance (DeFi) assets. The model’s selection was based on projected value capture, institutional alignment, and evolving network economics rather than headline transaction activity. The case for Ethereum According to ChatGPT, Ethereum is likely to emerge on top in the coming year. In this view, the case for Ethereum centers on how its economic model is positioned to strengthen after a deliberately weak revenue year in 2025. Notably, Ethereum reduced base-layer fee generation as it scaled through rollups following the Dencun upgrade, temporarily dampening its fee-burn narrative. That dynamic is expected to reverse in 2026 as rollups mature and demand for blob space accelerates. Ethereum outlook for 2026. Source: ChatGPT Fees paid by rollups are becoming more recurring and predictable, positioning ETH as the settlement and data-availability rent asset for the broader rollup ecosystem. By contrast, Solana’s 2025 revenue growth was driven mainly by retail activity such as memecoins and speculative DeFi, which ChatGPT views as cyclical. Institutional impact ChatGPT also sees a widening institutional gap, with tokenized Treasuries, real-world assets, funds, and settlement pilots concentrated on Ethereum and its layer-2 networks. These users favor legal finality and mature tooling, reinforcing Ethereum’s role as core financial infrastructure, while Solana has yet to show comparable settlement-driven adoption. Ethereum outlook for 2026. Source: ChatGPT Layer-2 growth is another advantage identified by ChatGPT. In 2025, many argued rollups diluted Ethereum’s value capture, but ChatGPT sees the opposite taking shape. Higher layer-2 activity increases blob usage, lifting demand for ETH, which uniquely secures settlement, data availability, and finality across major rollups. Solana’s single execution layer lacks a comparable mechanism that feeds ecosystem growth back into sustained token demand. Supply dynamics favor Ethereum, with constrained post-merge issuance and the potential for renewed fee burn to push ETH back toward net deflation. Solana, by contrast, has a higher inflation profile and weaker links between activity and token scarcity. Market positioning Market positioning further shaped ChatGPT’s 2026 outlook. After Solana’s strong narrative momentum and Ethereum’s underperformance, ChatGPT expects a rotation toward assets with cash-flow-like traits and stronger institutional credibility, a profile that Ethereum fits more closely. Notably, year-to-date, ETH has plunged almost 9%, trading at $3,040 as of press time. Over the same period, SOL has plunged 33%, trading at $126 ETH and SOL YTD price chart. Source: Finbold However, the AI model noted that this view would shift if Solana shows sustained institutional settlement or if Ethereum fails to translate layer-2 growth into higher blob fees and ETH burn. Absent that, ChatGPT sees Ethereum entering 2026 with a stronger position. Featured image via Shutterstock The post Ethereum v.

This landmark legislation fully legalizes the trading and use of digital assets within the country, positioning Ghana as a pioneer in the continent’s blockchain revolution. The move signals a major shift toward embracing innovative financial technologies while addressing regulatory concerns. What Does Ghana’s Cryptocurrency Legalization Bill Actually Mean? The newly passed cryptocurrency legalization bill represents a comprehensive framework for digital asset regulation. Unlike previous ambiguous stances taken by many African governments, Ghana’s legislation provides clear guidelines for cryptocurrency operations. The bill establishes legal recognition for crypto transactions, creates consumer protection measures, and sets up taxation protocols. This clarity is crucial for both local users and international investors who have been hesitant about Africa’s crypto market potential. According to reports from Unfolded, the legislation covers multiple aspects of cryptocurrency operations. The government will now recognize digital assets as legitimate financial instruments. This recognition comes with specific regulatory requirements that exchanges and traders must follow. The framework aims to prevent fraud while encouraging innovation in the financial technology sector. Why Did Ghana Choose to Legalize Cryptocurrency Now? Several factors likely influenced Ghana’s decision to pass the cryptocurrency legalization bill at this particular moment. First, the country has been experiencing significant growth in digital asset adoption despite previous regulatory uncertainty. Many Ghanaians have turned to cryptocurrencies as alternatives to traditional banking systems. Second, neighboring countries have been exploring similar regulatory approaches, creating regional momentum for clearer crypto policies. The government recognizes several potential benefits from this legislation: Economic innovation: Attracting blockchain startups and tech investments Financial inclusion: Providing banking alternatives for unbanked populations Youth employment: Creating opportunities in the growing tech sector Remittance efficiency: Reducing costs for international money transfers Moreover, Ghana aims to position itself as a regional hub for financial technology. By establishing clear regulations early, the country hopes to attract both African and international crypto businesses looking for stable regulatory environments. How Will the Cryptocurrency Legalization Bill Impact Everyday Ghanaians? The practical implications of the cryptocurrency legalization bill will touch various aspects of daily life. For ordinary citizens, the legislation means they can now engage in crypto transactions without legal uncertainty. Small business owners can accept cryptocurrency payments with confidence. Young entrepreneurs can develop blockchain-based solutions knowing they operate within a recognized legal framework. However, the legislation also introduces new responsibilities. Cryptocurrency users must now comply with tax reporting requirements. Exchanges operating in Ghana need to implement know-your-customer (KYC) procedures. These measures aim to prevent illegal activities while maintaining the innovative potential of digital assets. The government has indicated that educational initiatives will accompany the legislation. These programs will help citizens understand both the opportunities and risks associated with cryptocurrency investments. Financial literacy regarding digital assets becomes increasingly important as more people gain access to these markets. What Challenges Might Ghana Face After Passing This Legislation? Despite the positive aspects of the cryptocurrency legalization bill , Ghana will likely encounter several challenges during implementation. Regulatory enforcement presents the first major hurdle. Monitoring cryptocurrency transactions requires technical expertise and resources that may strain existing regulatory bodies. Additionally, balancing innovation with consumer protection remains an ongoing challenge for governments worldwide. Other potential challenges include: Technological infrastructure: Ensuring reliable internet access nationwide Cross-border coordination: Aligning regulations with neighboring countries Market volatility: Protecting consumers from extreme price fluctuations International standards: Meeting global anti-money laundering requirements Nevertheless, Ghana’s proactive approach positions the country to address these challenges systematically. The legislation includes provisions for regular review and adjustment, allowing the regulatory framework to evolve alongside technological developments. Could Ghana’s Decision Influence Other African Nations? Ghana’s passage of the cryptocurrency legalization bill could create a domino effect across Africa. Several countries have been observing Ghana’s regulatory experiments with digital assets. Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa have all grappled with cryptocurrency regulation in recent years. Ghana’s comprehensive approach provides a potential model for balancing innovation with consumer protection. The success or failure of Ghana’s implementation will likely influence regional policy decisions. If the legislation stimulates economic growth without significant negative consequences, other African governments may follow suit. Conversely, challenges in implementation might cause neighboring countries to adopt more cautious approaches. Regional economic communities like ECOWAS might eventually develop harmonized cryptocurrency regulations. Such coordination would facilitate cross-border crypto transactions while maintaining consistent consumer protections across West Africa. What Does This Mean for Global Cryptocurrency Adoption? Ghana’s cryptocurrency legalization bill contributes to growing global momentum for digital asset regulation. As more countries establish clear legal frameworks, international cryptocurrency markets gain legitimacy and stability. Developing nations like Ghana demonstrate that emerging economies can actively shape rather than merely react to financial technology trends. The legislation also highlights Africa’s increasing importance in global cryptocurrency adoption. With young, tech-savvy populations and innovative approaches to financial challenges, African nations may drive the next phase of blockchain development. Ghana’s decision reflects this potential while addressing legitimate regulatory concerns. In conclusion, Ghana’s passage of the cryptocurrency legalization bill represents a transformative moment for both the country and the continent. By embracing digital assets within a regulated framework, Ghana positions itself at the forefront of financial innovation while protecting its citizens. The world will watch closely as this African nation implements what could become a model for balanced cryptocurrency regulation worldwide. Frequently Asked Questions When did Ghana pass the cryptocurrency legalization bill? The Ghanaian government recently passed the legislation, though the exact date of implementation may vary as regulatory details are finalized. The bill has completed parliamentary approval and awaits presidential assent and implementation guidelines. What cryptocurrencies are legal under Ghana’s new bill? The legislation provides a framework for all legitimate digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other established cryptocurrencies. However, specific guidelines regarding which assets meet regulatory standards will be detailed in accompanying implementation documents. Can foreigners invest in cryptocurrency in Ghana after this legislation? Yes, the legislation creates a framework for both domestic and international cryptocurrency investment. However, foreign investors will need to comply with the same regulatory requirements as Ghanaian citizens, including proper registration and tax obligations. How will Ghana’s government tax cryptocurrency transactions? Specific taxation details are still being developed, but the legislation establishes cryptocurrency as taxable assets. Capital gains taxes likely apply to investment profits, while business transactions involving cryptocurrency may be subject to standard business taxes. What protections does the bill offer cryptocurrency investors? The legislation includes consumer protection measures such as mandatory disclosures from exchanges, anti-fraud provisions, and dispute resolution mechanisms. However, investors should remember that cryptocurrency markets remain volatile, and the government cannot guarantee against market losses. Will traditional banks in Ghana now offer cryptocurrency services? The legislation opens possibilities for traditional financial institutions to integrate cryptocurrency services. However, individual banks will make their own decisions based on risk assessments and regulatory compliance requirements. Found this analysis of Ghana’s cryptocurrency legalization bill insightful?

As retail gave up on the coin, large-scale holders kept accumulating. ETH wallets with a balance of 10K to 100K ETH are the leading holders toward the end of 2025. ETH whales kept accumulating, especially in the second half of 2025. ETH is going through a significant shift in holding structure, with tokens flowing out of exchanges and into new self-custodial wallets. In 2025, retail sentiment continued to sink, while whales used the available DeFi tools on Ethereum. The holdings of smaller wallets, carrying 100-1K ETH, have continued their decline since 2024. The inflows into the wallets of large-scale whales expanded at a much more rapid pace, holding over 22M tokens. ETH balances in whale wallets with 10K to 100K ETH expanded rapidly in 2025, with buying during periods of market weakness. | Source: Cryptoquant The largest wallets, possibly belonging to exchanges or treasuries, carry around 4.47M ETH, and may not be as influential. The recent cohort of whales kept buying close to their realized price, even without significant profits. The whale moves are seen as an indicator of an expected breakout, not a bear market for ETH. Large-scale whales buy the dip on ETH The collection of large-scale wallets also has a pattern of buying in 2025, avoiding market peaks. Whale accumulation happens at levels where ETH is considered undervalued. The whale level of holdings also offers support for ETH at around $2,800. Whales become active on ETH at prices under $3,000, with notable buyers like the Seven Siblings wallets getting active in November. The active pace of buying also signals whales may be more confident in the potential of ETH. The current whale buying did not occur during a hype cycle; instead, whales entered the market during periods of market panic and price weakness. The whale buying happened as ETH retail sentiment was near all-time lows. At the same time, derivative traders also became more cautious. ETH sentiment shifted between neutral and fearful trading for the past months. ETH whales extend silent accumulation with long-term confidence Whales also accumulated ETH while ETF buyers were shedding their holdings. The storage of ETH in new whale wallets also signals long-term confidence from crypto insiders, staging one of the biggest events of building up a reserve. ETH remains potentially important for DeFi activity and even mainstream finance. The ETH accumulation continued, despite the lack of an altcoin market. ETH may be key to the creation and usage of stablecoins, one of the fastest-growing sectors in 2025. Ethereum remains a key network for some DeFi protocols, currently holding 95% of the liquidity on protocols like Sky (formerly MakerDAO ). ETH is also key for liquid staking, which is much more rewarding for whales. An ETH reserve can also be used to generate new crypto-backed stablecoins or as collateral in lending protocols . However, the usage of DeFi is also becoming the arena of whales and more experienced traders, leading to the creation of a new cohort of whale wallets. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

The market began the year with a bang, with Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies racing to new all-time highs. However, the market has been shaky, thanks to various macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, trade wars, and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Bitcoin looks poised to end 2025 trading below $100k. However, the major question remains whether 2025 was a bullish year for Bitcoin. Bitcoin hits $124k in October The biggest highlight for Bitcoin in 2025 was hitting the $124k level for the first time in its history. The leading cryptocurrency by market cap began 2025 trading above $93k per coin. By October 7th, Bitcoin’s price hit an all-time high of $124k, taking its total market cap to nearly $2 trillion. However, the market has been on a downward trend since then, hitting a low of $84k on November 22nd. At press time, Bitcoin is trading below $90k per coin. While Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $124k in 2025, if the leading cryptocurrency ends the year trading below the $93k level it began in January, then the year wasn’t a bullish one. Despite that, analysts are optimistic that Bitcoin’s price will record better gains in 2026. According to analysts at 21Shares, Bitcoin’s four-year cycle is fading, and the market is now controlled by Structural inflows, macro realignment, and regulatory clarity. “Even though market outcomes can differ materially from expectations, we believe Bitcoin could be positioned to reach new all-time highs in 2026, with broader markets potentially benefiting from improving liquidity and rising institutional participation. Each cycle now delivers less exponential returns, but also far milder corrections, reflecting Bitcoin’s evolution. The halving may remain symbolic, but it is no longer the engine,” the analysts added. Alexis Sirkia, Chairman of Yellow Network, also told Invezz in an email that institutional demand played a key role in Bitcoin’s performance this year. Sirkia added that, “Spot Bitcoin ETFs are a structural shift, not a short-term trend, solidifying BTC’s role as a global store of value. The scarcity model underwrites this institutional demand. However, Bitcoin is a settlement layer, not an application layer; it is not built for high-frequency transactions. Its stability is now underwritten by institutional capital, but the next wave of innovation will come from layers built on top of Satoshi’s vision.” Bitcoin’s bullish factors in 2025 Bitcoin’s volatility in 2025 resulted in the cryptocurrency hitting an all-time high of $124. Here are some factors that contributed to its bullish price action this year. President Trump’s pro-crypto stance One of the primary drivers of Bitcoin’s bullish price action in 2025 was Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential elections in November 2024. With Trump’s assumption of office, the changes in the US SEC leadership were a big boost to the crypto market, as former chair Gary Gensler took an unfavorable stance on digital asset policies. According to CryptoQuant, the monthly percentage growth of Bitcoin holdings among large investors accelerated from -0.25% on January 14 to +2% on January 17, marking the highest monthly rate since mid-December 2024. The rise in Bitcoin holders pushed the price to a then record-high of $109,588 on Trump’s inauguration day, Trump’s campaign promises were translated into personal stakes in digital assets. The Trump family launched World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi project built on the Ethereum blockchain and endorsed by his sons (Donald Jr., Eric, and Barron) in September 2024. Investors viewed this move as a strong indication of crypto adoption, with favorable policies expected during Trump’s tenure. According to Arkham Intelligence , WLFI currently holds $6.93 billion in tokens, comprising Ethereum (ETH), Aave (AAVE), Chainlink (LINK), and others. The DeFi project has also launched its own stablecoin, USD1, which is 1:1 backed by the US Dollar (USD). SEC’s crypto task force focuses on regulating the crypto market In January, the US SEC acting Chairman, Mark Uyeda, launched a crypto task force led by Commissioner Hester Peirce to provide a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. Shortly after that, President Trump signed an executive order to support crypto and promote US leadership in digital assets. The bill also seeks to launch a strategic national digital asset stockpile for the US. 2025 also saw the first-ever White House Crypto Summit, where regulation and innovation in the cryptocurrency sector were discussed. Finally, the GENIUS Act was enacted into law in mid-July. This law established a clear federal regulatory framework for stablecoins and their issuers in the United States, resulting in the stablecoin ecosystem hitting a market cap of over $300 billion this year. States rush to launch Bitcoin reserves In addition to the Federal Government’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, many US states joined the race to establish their own Bitcoin reserves. New Hampshire and Arizona led the way, with Texas also joining the movement. Similar bills are pending in other state legislatures, including Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, and Ohio. Crypto is now part of the 401(K) Another major win for Bitcoin was the executive order signed by Trump in August, allowing 401(k) investments in cryptocurrency, private equity, and real estate. Institutional demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs remains strong Another major factor behind Bitcoin’s bullish runs this year was the growing demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs by institutional investors. Data obtained from SoSoValue reveals that US-listed spot ETFs have recorded $22.65 billion in net inflows for the 2025 year-to-date, as of mid-December. However, last month, the ETFs recorded heavy outflows of $3.48 billion, resulting in Bitcoin retesting the $84k level just a few weeks after hitting an all-time high of $124k. Bitcoin ETF Total Assets Under Management (AUM) currently stands at $123 billion, down from the $165.15 billion recorded on October 8. On the corporate side, an increasing number of companies are adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Strategy (MSTR) increased its holdings from 446,000 BTC at the start of 2025 to 671,000 BTC (3.19% of the total supply of 21 million BTC) at the time of writing. Mining companies now account for 12% of public company BTC holdings. Marathon Digital (MARA) holds 53,250 BTC. Bitcoin’s bearish factors in 2025 While Bitcoin reached a new all-time high in 2025, a couple of macroeconomic factors affected its price. Some of these events include; Trade war and tariffs Trump’s first year in office came with tariff policies, sparking trade conflicts with countries such as China, Canada, Mexico, and others. These tariffs triggered a risk-off mood for riskier assets, including Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. The tariffs resulted in Bitcoin’s price reaching a yearly low of $74,508 on April 7. Geopolitical conflicts The tension in the Middle East also affected Bitcoin’s price in 2025. Earlier this year, the Russia-Ukraine escalations and early Asian tensions between India and Pakistan added volatility in BTC. Furthermore, the renewed conflict in Yemen (Houthi strikes on shipping) disrupted trade routes, and a decline in BTC below $100,000 amid spikes in Oil prices. The Israel-Iran conflict hit its peak in the second quarter of the year as Israel struck Iranian airports and nuclear sites. Iran retaliated with drones and missiles on Israeli and US targets (i.e, Qatar base). All these events contributed to Bitcoin’s volatility in 2025. Bitcoin hit the $124k all-time high in October. However, unless the leading cryptocurrency ends the year trading above $93, 2025 would not be categorized as a bullish year.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, Bitcoin is currently trading at $90,000.34 on the Binance USDT market. This surge represents more than just a number; it signals a wave of renewed confidence and a potential new phase for the world’s premier cryptocurrency. Let’s unpack what’s driving this rally and what it could mean for your portfolio. What’s Fueling the Historic BTC Price Rally? The jump in the BTC price to this unprecedented level isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several powerful forces are converging to create this bullish momentum. First, institutional adoption continues to accelerate, with major financial firms increasing their Bitcoin holdings and offering new crypto-based products to clients. Second, the recent Bitcoin halving event has reduced the new supply entering the market, a classic catalyst for price appreciation based on simple economics of scarcity. Finally, macroeconomic factors, such as concerns about inflation and currency devaluation in certain regions, are pushing investors towards hard assets like Bitcoin as a potential store of value. Key Takeaways from the $90,000 Breakthrough This milestone is a powerful signal for both seasoned traders and newcomers. Here are the core insights: Market Sentiment Shift: Breaking through such a major round-number resistance level often triggers a shift in market psychology from caution to optimism. Technical Strength: The move demonstrates significant buying pressure and suggests the bullish trend has substantial momentum. Media and Mainstream Attention: Headlines about Bitcoin hitting $90,000 will draw fresh eyes and potentially new capital into the crypto ecosystem. What Challenges Could Lie Ahead for the BTC Price? While the celebration is warranted, prudent investors always consider both sides of the coin. The road ahead for the BTC price may not be entirely smooth. Potential volatility is a constant companion in crypto markets, and sharp corrections can follow rapid ascents. Moreover, regulatory developments in key economies like the United States and the European Union remain a wild card that could impact market sentiment. Therefore, it’s crucial to view this achievement not as a final destination, but as a significant milestone in a longer journey. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should you do in light of this news? First, avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on price hype. If you are investing, consider proven strategies like dollar-cost averaging to mitigate timing risk. Second, use this moment as an opportunity to review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation still matches your risk tolerance. Finally, stay informed. Understanding the fundamental drivers behind the BTC price movement is more valuable than simply watching the ticker. In conclusion, Bitcoin’s breach of the $90,000 mark is a historic event that underscores its growing maturity and adoption. It reflects a complex interplay of scarcity, institutional demand, and macroeconomic trends. While challenges like volatility and regulation persist, this milestone solidifies Bitcoin’s position at the forefront of the financial revolution. The journey of the BTC price continues to be a captivating narrative of innovation, speculation, and the redefinition of value itself. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly does it mean that BTC is above $90,000? A1: It means that on major exchanges like Binance, the market price for one Bitcoin has exceeded ninety thousand US dollars, a new all-time high that represents a significant valuation milestone for the cryptocurrency. Q2: Should I buy Bitcoin now that the price is so high? A2: Investment decisions should be based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and research, not solely on current price levels. Many investors use strategies like dollar-cost averaging to invest consistently over time, regardless of price fluctuations. Q3: Could the price drop back below $90,000 just as quickly? A3: Yes, cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility. While breaking $90,000 is a strong bullish signal, prices can and do experience sharp pullbacks. It’s important to be prepared for potential volatility. Q4: What has been the main driver for this price increase? A4> Analysts point to a combination of factors: increased institutional investment, the recent Bitcoin halving reducing new supply, and broader macroeconomic uncertainty driving interest in alternative assets. Q5: Where can I reliably check the current BTC price? A5: Reputable cryptocurrency data aggregators like CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, and Bitcoin World provide real-time price tracking across multiple exchanges. Q6: Does this price surge affect other cryptocurrencies? A6> Often, yes. A strong rally in Bitcoin (often called ‘King Crypto’) can have a spillover effect, boosting sentiment and prices across the broader cryptocurrency market, a phenomenon known as ‘altcoin season’.

With M2 equilibrium reached and limited QE prospects, I expect BTC to deprecate, targeting a $30,000 bottom. Chairman Powell's comments at the last FOMC meeting weren't an indication of QE. In fact, with 350 basis points of rate-cuts room left, QE won't be initiated anytime soon. With a historical standard deviation of ~149% and limited near-term upside, investors will rotate out of BTC —something dominance charts already indicate is underway. A primary risk to my thesis is one-off events that provide tailwinds for BTC; however, I argue that those events are themselves influenced by M2. My thesis applies not only to IBIT but to all other Bitcoin ETFs as well, including ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). “Bitcoin is a bubble, a speculative asset!” Words usually spoken by those jaded because of persistent headlines on Bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) dramatic price movements. BTC’s a risky asset, yes, but it’s also swiftly gaining acceptance as a traditional asset. One of the primary reasons for my assertion is the numerous numbers in this report , the most eye-catching of which is that an estimated ~40% of the American population now owns BTC. Furthermore, another article indicates that the U.S. government is among the top 10 holders of BTC and that U.S. Spot ETFs, collectively, now hold more BTC than the coin’s founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. One could argue that just because everyone is jumping on the bandwagon doesn’t imply it’s a great investment. Surely, if the crowd is always right, then investing is akin to an election, and trending assets would have the best risk-return profile. A reasonable argument, definitely. Through this article, however, I’ll demonstrate that BTC’s prices are, now more than ever, driven by macroeconomic factors, rather than “feelings and opinions” of the crowd. In other words, if investors use the right data, their ability to identify BTC’s peaks and bottoms will improve manifold. One such macroeconomic metric, and the core of this thesis, is the U.S. Economy’s Money Supply (M2). What Is IBIT? But before that, a quick introduction to the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) for those not well-acquainted with the ETF. According to the fund’s fact sheet : The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF seeks to reflect the performance of the price of bitcoin. The Trust offers exposure to bitcoin through an exchange-traded product, simplifying the operational and custody complexities of holding bitcoin directly. According to data on Morningstar, the fund’s total returns since inception are 42.57%, attained with a standard deviation of 88.62 and a Sharpe ratio of 0.67. Interestingly, IBIT came into existence on January 5, 2024, and has since managed to attract ‪$66.02B in assets, a feat placing it among the Top 100 ETFs based on AUM. And only 9 places lower than arguably the most popular ETF on Seeking Alpha, the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF ( SCHD ), which has $72.80B in AUM. Once again, supporting my argument that BTC is quickly attaining the ranks of a traditional asset class. BTC and M2 Changes Below is a chart that maps BTC against changes in M2. A high-level analysis reveals a strong correlation between changes in M2 (M2C) and BTC prices, especially since 2020. BTC-USD vs M2 YoY % Change (Weekly, Sep 2014 – Nov 2025) (Author's Work (Date from Yahoo! and FRED)) Specifically, the M2C curve experienced a strong pivot in March 2020, due to the Fed’s response to the COVID crisis when it executed the most aggressive quantitative easing program since its inception. Six months later, BTC prices started rallying to reach an all-time high (at that time) of roughly $65,000. But at the start of 2021, M2C stated sinking. A numerically foreseeable event because of the inevitability of base effects coming into play, following M2C’s huge surge in 2020. Those effects, however, started fading by June 2021, manifesting as a flat M2C curve for the last two quarters of 2021. M2C’s stabilization/flattening was short-lived because the effects of the Fed’s QE tapering program began to kick in at the start of 2022, and introduced renewed pressures on M2C, leading to another downward leg. A trajectory that attained further momentum when the Fed transitioned to quantitative tightening in June 2022 . By the end of October 2022, M2C turned negative. BTC prices began to tank at the end of 2021, affirming the strong correlation between BTC prices and M2C. Readers, at this juncture, should ask: was the cause of that price depreciation due to the first pivot in early February 2021 or the second pivot at the start of 2022? In my view, it’s the first because markets function on expectations rather than events. In early 2021, expectations of further QE had pretty much extinguished because the Fed had front-loaded money injections, and continuing with such aggressive QE actions was not sustainable. Then, only three years after the pandemic, in March 2023, the Silicon Valley Bank Collapsed, which, as some readers may recall, prompted the Fed to introduce the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) to stabilize not just the SVB but the entire U.S. banking industry. The BTFP was a liquidity injection that led to a directional change in M2C even though QT was still active. An indication of the fact that the Fed aimed for a slow-burn approach with its balance sheet runoff, as opposed to aggressive QT. An assertion that gains further support when we consider the fact that the Fed’s balance sheet expanded approximately $4.8T between March 2020 and May 2022, whereas the reduction due to QT totaled only about $2.3T. As for BTC, it started appreciating again in October 2023, six months after the initiation of the BTFP. That rally received more tailwinds when the Fed further slowed its balance-sheet runoff in May 2024, probably causing market participants to conclude that overhang from the aggressive QE program will persist longer than previously anticipated. It is, therefore, reasonable to conclude that there’s a strong relation between not just M2C and BTC prices, but also expectations of M2C and BTC, which naturally leads one to ask the next most important question: what will M2 look like in 2026 and beyond? Note: I’ve intentionally left out discussion on BTC’s rally in 2017 – more on that in the Thesis Risks section. What’s Next for M2? I believe that we are finally starting to witness the end of pandemic-induced M2 overhang – a belief supported by the fact that the Fed recently ended its QT program. Put differently, the Fed’s end of QT is an indication that excess liquidity has been drained from the system. A system that is in M2 equilibrium, thus, implies that tailwinds for BTC have faded, but could it also mean that the Fed is now ready for another round of QE? Not really because even after all the rate cuts that we’ve witnessed in 2025, the Fed still has room to cut rates by another 350 bps. I bring rates into the picture because QE’s primary objective is to stimulate the economy. And if the Fed already has one tool available to get that job done, there’s no need to pull out another tool. The above two points, taken together, lead one to conclude that there won’t be any significant changes in M2C in the coming years, at least until Fed Fund rates reach zero. Indeed, it be said that markets have already started pricing this in - one of the reasons for BTC’s price decline since early October this year. Lastly, I want to mention that Chairman Powell’s most recent announcement on buying short-term treasuries to increase bank reserves is not QE because increases in banking reserves do not lead to an increase in usable cash among households. To acquire further clarity, please read my article titled Powell Didn't Imply Quantitative Easing, Most Have Misunderstood , please also read the comments section where one user asked some great questions. BTC at $30K Investors, in this economic environment, have two options: continue holding BTC as a store of value, or rotate into other assets. BTC, with a standard deviation of roughly 149% , is a highly risky asset, implying that it’s not an ideal store of wealth. Furthermore, investors can rotate into equities that have historically returned 10% per year, instead of stating invested in BTC that won't likely rally anytime soon. Indeed, money is already moving out of cryptos as a whole, as demonstrated in my recent article on MSTY . In summary, my analysis of dominance charts indicated that investors are parking their money in stablecoins, implying that they don’t expect cryptos to appreciate. Due to this possible rotation out of BTC, I expect its price to experience dramatic drawdowns, as has been the case historically, in 2026 and beyond. Numerically speaking, I expect BTC to deprecate until it reaches $30,000 – a price target derived from the coin’s previous peak-and-trough patterns. Precisely, BTC reached a high of ~$19,000 in December 2017 and bottomed out at $3,200 in December 2018, a ratio of ~5.9 to 1. Another all-time high of $64,000 was attained in November 2021, followed by a bottom of ~$16,500 in December 2022 – ratio of ~3.9 to 1 Thus, if we assume that $122,000 in October 2025 was the coin’s most recent high, the new bottom will be in the range of $30,000 to $20,000. That’s at least a 66% drawdown from the trading price of ~$90,000 as of December 20, 2025. Thesis Risks As mentioned earlier, I intentionally left out discussions pertaining to BTC’s 2017 rally. I did so because that rally was not fueled by M2 injections, but rather propelled by the initial coin offerings frenzy ubiquitous at that time. If such an external event can cause a rally in BTC at that time, without any M2 increases, can’t it do so now as well? In fact, many would refute all that I’ve discussed by mentioning that BTC’s rallies post 2020 were driven by events such as the introduction of BTC future, the launch of crypto ETFs, adoption by company like Tesla and PayPal, large-scale purchases by MSTR, and increasing regulatory clarity in the U.S. They’d be right in their assertion, but my counterargument to that claim is that none of that would have happened if it weren’t for abundant liquidity in the economy – a strong motivator for institutions to lobby for and move money into risky assets. In fact, now that there are many institutional players in the BTC arena, it can be said that BTC will be driven by macro variables, such as money supply, more than ever, because those variables are exactly what smart money uses to make high-level capital allocation decisions. Final Thoughts Needless to say, my thesis applies not only to IBIT but also to all other BTC ETFs, such as the ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ), the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF ( FBTC ), and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ). Does the possibility of BTC depreciation present a short-selling opportunity? Yes, but I don’t recommend shorting BTC, or any other asset, for inexperienced traders. If you want, use this opportunity to paper trade, attain experience, and then trade on future opportunities – financial markets aren’t going anywhere. Last but not least, negligible expectations of elevated M2C in the coming years is just one factor indicating the fall of BTC in 2026, and possibly beyond.",BTC-USD|BITO|FBTC|GBTC|IBIT|IBIT:CA,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-22 11:57:08

Investors approved five initiatives to bolster the firm’s preferred-share issuance authority, create new dividend arrangements, and permit participation from overseas institutions, according to Dylan LeClair, the company’s Bitcoin strategy director. The approved actions include reallocating capital reserves to facilitate dividend payments and buybacks on preferred shares, as well as increasing the authorized number of Class A and B preferred shares from 277.5 million shares to 555 million shares for each class. The firm’s investors also agreed to amend the dividend structures to allow for floating and periodic payouts, mainly to maintain price stability. Additionally, the company was authorized to sell Class B preferred shares to overseas institutional investors and amend them to a quarterly dividend structure. Metaplanet will introduce the Metaplanet Adjustable Rate Security structure With the new approvals , Metaplanet is shifting its focus from pure dilution-based growth to a conventional market framework that integrates income-producing securities with a Bitcoin-oriented balance sheet. Its preferred equity will now allow institutions to gain exposure to Bitcoin holdings similar to how institutions operate. The Class A preferred shares amendment, meanwhile, creates a monthly floating-rate dividend structure — the “Metaplanet Adjustable Rate Security” — which ensures steady income designed to meet institutional needs. Moreover, Class B preferred shares will now carry quarterly dividends, a 10-year call at 130% of face value, and an investor put option if the company fails to go public within 12 months. That means the firm will repurchase shares at a premium after 10 years, while investors have the right to exit if no IPO takes place within a year. Such provisions are common in private credit and structured equity markets, protecting long-term capital. The proposal also allows for the issuance of Class B preferred shares to foreign investors. By catering to international institutional investors, the company will enable access to Bitcoin exposure without the need to hold spot BTC or volatile equity. Metaplanet is expanding to the US market, following the establishment of its Miami subsidiary Metaplanet ranks as one of the most closely followed Bitcoin-focused public companies in Asia and is frequently compared with U.S. corporate Bitcoin treasury approaches, even under Japan’s regulations. Primarily, the firm’s model highlights how non-U.S. businesses adjust Bitcoin strategies to fit local regulations while attracting global investors. The company even stated on Friday that it will start trading in the U.S. over-the-counter market using American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), following the creation of its Miami subsidiary earlier this year. Managed by Simon Gerovich, Dylan LeClair, and Darren Winia, the unit specializes in Bitcoin income and derivatives trading, structurally separating revenue-generating activities from the company’s primary BTC assets. The firm had budgeted about $15 million for its initial development. Around the same time, the company also established a unit in Japan, Bitcoin Japan Inc., to boost its domestic Bitcoin operations. The site manages media, including Bitcoin Magazine, events, and the recently acquired Bitcoin.jp domain. Currently, the firm’s Bitcoin stash stands at 30,823 BTC, worth approximately $2.75 billion, making it Asia’s largest corporate holder and the fourth-largest worldwide, according to Bitcoin Treasuries.

ETH’s price may be gradually regaining upside momentum, but other aspects are still experiencing downward pressure, such as the Open Interest (OI). Sharp Drop In Ethereum Open Interest In the current volatile state of the cryptocurrency landscape, the Ethereum derivatives market is signaling a key indicator. This crucial signal is coming from the ETH Open interest, which has witnessed a significant pullback in the past few months. According to the research from the advanced investment and on-chain data analytics platform Alphractal, the metric has dropped by half or 50% since August this year. A significant drop in this metric is a clear indication that trader positioning and risk appetite have shifted notably. Following a period of high leverage and aggressive speculation, the sharp collapse indicates that positions are being unwound, exposure is being decreased, and momentum is cooling across futures markets. Alphractal highlighted that the Ethereum open interest is valued at roughly half of what it was in August 2025, suggesting a drastic decline in market risk. Such a move points to institutions and large whale holders who have closed leveraged ETH positions. The exiting of positions by big investors shows that they are reducing exposure and speculative pressure. ETH’s open interest has also fallen sharply on cryptocurrency exchanges. After examining the Ethereum Open Interest distribution by exchange, Alphractal unveiled a 31% decline to $7.64 billion on the world’s largest exchange, Binance . On Gateio, open interest is at $3.72 billion, indicating a 15% decrease, while HTX (formerly known as House) has fallen by 12.65% to $3.12 million. Furthermore, Bybit has $2.53 billion with a 10.25% drop, HyperLiquid has $2.51 billion with a 10.18%, and Bitget has $1.79 billion with a 7.25% decline. With exchanges’ open interest dropping, this tells a compelling story of the current market structure. This outlines robust deleveraging across the Ethereum market and a lower probability of explosive moves in the short term. Typically, an atmosphere that is more cautious and protective implies stages of consolidation or preparation for the next trend leg. However, deep declines in open interest have historically frequently preceded significant structural changes, either a healthier reversal or a downward continuation with less leverage. ETH Withdrawals From Crypto Exchanges Have Spiked Ethereum’s open interest drop comes at a time of a massive drop in ETH supply on crypto exchanges. Currently, ETH withdrawals have reached their lowest levels since 2016, reflecting growing trader caution and dampened short-term sell pressure. As more ETH is taken out of exchanges and placed in long-term holding locations, the liquid supply keeps decreasing. While the supply decrease bolsters ETH’s volatility, it also encourages price pressure to rise.",Ethereum|binance|Bitget|Bybit|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|Ethereum open interest|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|HTX|Hyperliquid,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-22 12:00:03

As 2025 draws to a close, those expectations are facing reevaluations. Despite intermittent rallies during the year and strong conviction among long-term holders, XRP is currently trading far from triple-digit territory. This gap between optimism and market reality has pushed some voices within the XRP community to reassess timelines to reach such a valuation. Zach Rector Pushes The $100 XRP Perspective To 2030 One of the most notable revisions comes from Zach Rector, a longtime XRP supporter who has openly adjusted his outlook. In a recent post on the social media platform X, Rector stated plainly that his expectation for XRP to reach $100 now sits around the year 2030. This position is a clear review of chatter from many XRP enthusiasts that envisions a $100 XRP as an imminent outcome within the current cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Just Entered Extreme Oversold Levels And Analysts Predict New ATH Targets Rector had already begun tempering expectations as far back as early November, when he acknowledged that XRP was unlikely to reach $100 before the end of the year. At the time, he noted that meaningful price appreciation was still possible, even if the most extreme targets are out of reach. At the time, he noted that saying XRP isn’t going to $100 this year feels like telling a kid Santa isn’t real. Why $100 In 2025 Has Become Increasingly Unlikely The idea of XRP reaching $100 within a single market cycle faces mathematical and liquidity constraints. At current supply levels of 60 billion XRP, such a price would imply a market capitalization deep into the multi-trillion-dollar range, putting XRP among the most valuable assets in the global financial system. As the year winds down, there is little evidence of the scale of capital inflows required to support that kind of valuation in the near term. Although bullish sentiment is strong in parts of the XRP community, market conditions have not aligned with the aggressive assumptions. Therefore, a 2025 timeline for $100 XRP has moved from ambitious to implausible, even for optimistic analysts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Just Entered Extreme Oversold Levels And Analysts Predict New ATH Targets Rector has previously attempted to ground the $100 discussion in simple market principles. In a post shared earlier this year, he outlined the scale of inflows required to drive XRP to major price milestones using conservative market cap multipliers. According to his estimates, reaching $100 would require between $11 billion and $58 billion in net inflows, assuming a 100x market cap multiplier. Higher targets, such as $1,000, would demand inflows between $118 billion and $589 billion. Therefore, the $100 target is achievable towards the end of the decade, though not without sustained institutional participation and inflows into Spot XRP ETFs.

Meanwhile, the token’s price action favors a bullish Audiera price prediction as positive momentum is quite strong. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that BEAT has gone up by 52% in the past 24 hours alone, pushing the price to $4.50 per token. Meanwhile, trading volumes have jumped by 69% during this period. Volumes currently account for nearly a quarter of the token’s circulating market cap. Audiera has some strong stats to show for. Its official website indicates that over 168,000 wallets are active every weeks. Players can earn rewards through the game that can be cashed out for real money. The project revived a popular dance game that captured the interest of more than 560 million players years ago. By leveraging the power of decentralization and blockchain technology, it aims to turn it into a viral sensation once again by introducing a compensation mechanism. Audiera Price Prediction: BEAT Hits Key Trend Line Resistance as RSI Flashes Overbought Looking at the 4-hour chart, an ascending price channel has formed as a result of BEAT’s latest price action. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) just hit 80 in this lower time frame. This increases the odds of a pullback in the next few days as Audiera has closed with gains in 5 of the last 6 sessions. If the price pulls back after hitting the upper bound of this price channel, Audiera could retreat to around $3 and then resume its upward climb. Although an overbought RSI tends to be bearish in the short term, it is also a clear indication that buying pressure is quite strong. This favors a bullish long-term outlook for the asset. As games like Audiera gain significant popularity, new crypto presales in this space will benefit from this trend. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) could benefit from this trend as this mine-to-earn (M2E) game has rapidly captured investors’ attention. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Makes Mining Fun, Easy, and Hardware-Free Mining cryptocurrencies has always been viewed as a complex activity that requires thousands of dollars invested in expensive equipment. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) is here to change that by introducing a fun M2E that allows players to set up virtual servers and fire up as many mining rigs as they want by simply buying this token. You can upgrade your mining setups to increase output and expand your operation by launching more rigs. Top miners compete for airdrops of tokens like Bonk ($BONK) and Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) as they climb the leaderboard. Up to 70% of the tokens invested in upgrades will be permanently burned, introducing a deflationary twist that will benefit token holders in the long term.

Peter Schiff Sparks Market Debate,https://cryptopotato.com/gold-5k-or-bitcoin-50k-crash-peter-schiff-sparks-market-debate/,"On December 22, long-time Bitcoin (BTC) critic Peter Schiff celebrated gold reaching a new record price above $4,400 and posed a provocative question to his followers. In a poll, he asked which milestone would arrive first: gold hitting $5,000 or Bitcoin’s price collapsing to $50,000, reigniting the long-standing feud between advocates for the precious metal and supporters of digital currency. Gold’s Record Run Reignites the Bitcoin Debate In a post on X, Schiff called gold’s move above $4,400 a clear break from recent sideways trading and asked followers which milestone would arrive first: gold at $5,000, silver at $100, or Bitcoin at $50,000. More than 6,600 people had voted at the time of this writing, with 43.4% backing gold, 37.4% choosing silver, and only 19.2% predicting that Bitcoin would fall to $50,000. Schiff reinforced his stance earlier in the day, saying gold was already more than $40 higher overnight, with silver touching a record $68.50. He further stated that participation was still thin and that many investors had failed to grasp what these price levels mean for trust in traditional stores of value. His comments are consistent with a recent warning he gave that Bitcoin could lose ground to physical metals during a dollar crisis. However, not everyone accepted his latest criticism of the flagship cryptocurrency. On-chain analyst Erik Huisman argued that Bitcoin returning to $50,000 is unrealistic, saying he would only have voted if a $100,000 BTC option were included. Several commentators also weighed in on the math behind the debate. Ounces, an analytics-focused account, noted that gold needs about a 14% rise to hit $5,000, while silver would need to jump 45% to reach $100, making the latter a far steeper climb. User Hassan Al-Shama echoed that view, writing that gold has the shortest path, while Bitcoin would need a drawdown of more than 40% to revisit $50,000. Bitcoin Price Holds as Optimists Push Back Currently, Bitcoin is trading around $90,000, up nearly 1% on the day but slightly lower over the past week. The asset has gained about 7% in the last 30 days, even though it remains around 29% below its all-time high set in October when it flew past $126,000. Short-term movement has been tight, with BTC holding between roughly $88,000 and $90,000 over the past 24 hours, pointing to hesitation rather than panic. While Schiff sees metals winning the trust race, others remain confident BTC will follow gold’s lead. Trader Ash Crypto claimed that Bitcoin has historically moved higher after gold sets new records, while Daniel Tschinkel said liquidity conditions and institutional flows will shape how fast any next leg develops. The clash mirrors the high-profile debate between Schiff and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao in Dubai earlier this month, where online sentiment leaned toward Bitcoin despite Schiff’s criticism.

From commodities to digital assets, long-suppressed instruments are beginning to show signs of structural awakening. Silver, long overshadowed by gold and equities, has re-entered strategic discussions among macro-focused analysts, not as a short-term trade but as a bellwether for bigger cyclical change. Its evolving price structure is now being watched closely, not only for what it signals about commodities, but for what it may foreshadow across other markets still trapped in prolonged consolidation. That broader interpretation was recently emphasized by respected crypto market analyst Dark Defender, who linked silver’s emerging breakout structure to XRP’s long-term price behavior. His analysis positions both assets within the same macro narrative: extended suppression, technical compression, and an eventual volatility expansion phase that historically produces outsized moves once key levels are reclaimed. You now started seeing Silver everywhere. Please take a look at our analysis and thoughts for 2024 and 2025. Please check the levels. Templars and Knights are steps ahead of anyone. #xag is at $67. So what is the upcoming point? My targets for Silver are $80, $140 and beyond.… https://t.co/wlwUxUshi1 pic.twitter.com/9mqlv0PSpb — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) December 21, 2025 Silver’s Multi-Year Compression Nears Resolution Silver’s chart structure over the past decade reveals a market locked in wide consolidation, repeatedly failing to sustain momentum above major resistance zones. However, long-term technical models now suggest that this compression is approaching exhaustion. According to Dark Defender’s framework, silver trading near the $67 region represents more than a nominal price milestone. It marks a structural threshold where historical resistance converges with long-cycle trend dynamics. In previous silver bull phases, acceptance above comparable zones has preceded rapid price discovery, often unfolding faster than market participants anticipate. Dark Defender’s upside projections toward $80, $140, and higher are derived from historical extensions and cyclical fractals rather than short-term speculation, reinforcing the view that silver may be entering a macro expansion phase rather than a fleeting rally. Why the $67 Level Matters From a technical perspective, the $67 area functions as a gateway between consolidation and acceleration. Markets that break above such zones with sustained volume typically encounter limited overhead resistance, allowing price to move aggressively as sidelined capital re-enters. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This behavior has been observed repeatedly in silver’s historical cycles, particularly during periods of monetary stress and shifting liquidity conditions. Dark Defender’s analysis suggests that once silver confirms strength above this level, the probability of continuation toward higher macro targets increases significantly, provided broader market conditions remain supportive. XRP and Silver: A Structural Comparison The parallel drawn between silver and XRP is not rooted in narrative hype but in chart symmetry and market psychology. XRP, like silver, has endured years of constrained price action, shaped by external pressures and prolonged uncertainty. Technically, both assets exhibit long-term accumulation patterns, suppressed volatility, and similar wave structures when viewed on higher time frames. Dark Defender argues that XRP is positioned to experience a repricing event similar in nature, though not in magnitude, to silver’s potential breakout. The core thesis is behavioral: markets that remain undervalued for extended periods tend to overcorrect once structural resistance is removed. A 2024–2025 Macro Outlook Crucially, this outlook is framed within a multi-year horizon. Dark Defender isn’t saying these targets will happen soon, but they’re possible outcomes if things go right in 2024–2025. Invalidations remain part of the framework, underscoring that technical analysis is probabilistic, not predictive. As silver edges closer to long-watched thresholds, its performance may offer valuable insight into how suppressed markets transition into expansion phases. For XRP observers, the implication is clear: history suggests that patience during compression is often the price paid for participation in the next major move.

As the currency pair flirts with the psychologically critical 150 level, traders are bracing for potential Japanese yen intervention that could send shockwaves through global forex market s. This looming currency intervention threat represents one of the most significant near-term risks for currency traders and cryptocurrency investors alike, as traditional finance tremors often ripple into digital asset markets. Why Is Bank of America Sounding the Alarm on USD/JPY? Bank of America ‘s currency strategists have identified January as a particularly vulnerable period for the yen, with several converging factors increasing the likelihood of official action. The bank’s analysis suggests that Japanese authorities are growing increasingly uncomfortable with the yen’s persistent weakness, which threatens to undermine their economic objectives and fuel imported inflation. The timing is crucial—January often sees reduced liquidity in currency markets, which can amplify the impact of any intervention and create volatile trading conditions. The Mechanics of Japanese Yen Intervention: What Traders Must Know Japanese currency intervention isn’t a simple policy announcement—it’s a carefully orchestrated market operation with specific characteristics: Direct Market Operations: The Ministry of Finance instructs the Bank of Japan to sell U.S. dollars and buy yen directly in the open market Surprise Element: Interventions typically occur during Asian trading hours when Tokyo has maximum market influence Verbal Warnings First: Japanese officials usually escalate from verbal warnings to actual intervention Coordinated Action: Sometimes conducted in coordination with other G7 nations for greater impact Previous Intervention Levels USD/JPY Rate Market Impact September 2022 145.90 Yen strengthened 5% immediately October 2022 151.95 Largest intervention since 1998 Potential January 2024 149-151 range Expected significant volatility How Forex Market Dynamics Increase January Intervention Risk The global forex market exhibits particular vulnerabilities in January that could prompt Japanese authorities to act. Seasonal factors including year-end position unwinding, reduced liquidity during holiday periods, and the resumption of normal trading volumes create conditions where intervention can have maximum impact. Bank of America analysts note that Japanese policymakers prefer to intervene when they can achieve “bang for their buck”—making January’s typically thinner markets an attractive window for action if they want to defend the yen. Actionable Insights for Traders Facing Currency Intervention Uncertainty For traders monitoring the USD/JPY pair, several strategic considerations emerge: Monitor Official Rhetoric: Pay close attention to statements from Japanese Finance Ministry officials Watch Technical Levels: The 149-151 range represents a critical danger zone for potential action Consider Volatility Strategies: Options strategies that benefit from increased volatility may be appropriate Prepare for Quick Reversals: Intervention can cause rapid, multi-percentage point moves within hours The Ripple Effects: How Yen Intervention Impacts Global Markets When Japan intervenes in USD/JPY markets, the consequences extend far beyond the currency pair itself. Significant yen strengthening typically causes: Reduced attractiveness of Japanese exports, potentially impacting global supply chains Repricing of carry trades that use yen as funding currency Increased volatility in other Asian currencies that often move in sympathy Potential impact on U.S. Treasury markets as Japan adjusts its foreign reserve management Bank of America’s Track Record: Why This Warning Matters Bank of America has established credibility in forecasting currency market developments, making their intervention warning particularly noteworthy. The bank’s global research team combines macroeconomic analysis with market microstructure insights, giving them a comprehensive view of potential policy actions. Their previous accurate calls on central bank policies and currency movements lend weight to their current assessment of rising Japanese yen intervention risks. Frequently Asked Questions About Potential Yen Intervention What specific conditions would trigger Japanese intervention? Japanese authorities typically consider intervention when they perceive disorderly market conditions, excessive speculation, or moves that don’t reflect economic fundamentals. Rapid, one-way movements in USD/JPY that threaten economic stability are the primary triggers. How effective is currency intervention in the long term? While intervention can produce dramatic short-term effects, its long-term effectiveness depends on alignment with broader monetary policy and fundamental economic factors. Without supportive fundamentals, intervention effects often fade within weeks or months. Which officials are responsible for intervention decisions? The decision rests with Japan’s Ministry of Finance, specifically the Vice Minister of Finance for International Affairs. The Bank of Japan executes the transactions as the ministry’s agent. How much firepower does Japan have for intervention? Japan holds approximately $1.1 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, giving them substantial capacity for intervention. However, they typically use these reserves judiciously to maximize psychological impact. Could cryptocurrency markets be affected by yen intervention? Yes, significant forex market volatility often spills over into cryptocurrency markets, particularly affecting trading pairs involving Japanese yen and potentially increasing volatility across all digital assets during periods of traditional market stress. Conclusion: Navigating the January Intervention Minefield The warning from Bank of America about potential Japanese yen intervention in January serves as a crucial alert for all market participants. As the USD/JPY pair approaches levels that have triggered official action in the past, traders must prepare for potentially explosive moves in the global forex market . While the exact timing and scale of any currency intervention remain uncertain, the elevated risk environment demands heightened vigilance, appropriate risk management, and strategic positioning to navigate what could be a turbulent start to the new trading year.

Complex rules are keeping most overseas individuals from buying shares in these hot offerings. MetaX Integrated Circuits, a chipmaker, saw its stock price shoot up almost 700% when it started trading in Shanghai last week. Moore Threads did even better earlier this month, with shares jumping over 400% o n da y one. There’s plenty of interest from global markets, but foreign retail investors hit a wall trying to access these mainland Chinese initial public offerings. Chris Zhang puts it simply. He’s executive director at China Fortune Securities Company, a Chinese financial services firm. “It’s not even possible. Unless they open up an account with a Chinese broker,” he told CNBC. The problems start right away with basic account requirements. Opening a brokerage account with a Chinese securities company means you need a Chinese bank account first. Getting that bank account usually requires proof that you live in China or a Ch inese visa that hasn’t expired yet. There’s more though. Foreigners also need to already own shares in mainland-listed companies before they can enter the lottery for new stock offerings. Most foreign banks don’t have the right arrangements with Chinese brokerages to help their customers open these accounts, Zhang said. That makes the whole thing impossible for just about everyone living overseas. Only s elect foreigners qualify for d irect A-share trading Shanghai city government guidelines lay out who can directly open brokerage accounts for A-shares—that’s what stocks listed on mainland Chinese exchanges are called. Only certain foreigners qualify. People with permanent resident status can do it. So can foreigner s wo rking in China, or those working abroad who get equity compensation at A-share listed companies. A lot of global investors use Stock Connect instead. It’s a program that links Hong Kong and mainland Chinese exchanges so they can access each other’s stocks. The system lets overseas investors buy A-shares through Hong Kong brokers. No onshore account needed, no special licenses required. But it doesn’t help much with initial public offerings or newly listed companies. Plus Hong Kong brokers have their own rules about who can participate, like minimum account balances and risk disclosure forms. Theodore Shou i s ch ief investment officer at Skybound Capital. “Stock Connect does not work because newly listed stocks are not included in Stock Connect as yet. Usually, it takes a few weeks t o mo nths should the stock s qu alify,” he said. Newly listed stocks face months-long wait for stock connect inclusion Companies have to meet certain standards to get into the Stock Connect program. Things like enough trading activity and market value. That usually means they need some time to build u p tr ading history and data before qualifying. Northbound trading is what they call it when overseas and Hong Kong investors buy mainland China stocks through Stock Connect and other programs. Shou said it won’t be available until “typically several months after any listing.” And even then, Moore Threads and MetaX might not get included. Overseas retail investors do have one option, though it’s limited. They can use offshore funds that invest in A-shares. Foreign retail investors interested in STAR Market IPOs like Moore Threads and MetaX can put money into funds based outside China that buy A-shares, Shou explained. These funds usually participate in IPOs. China’s STAR Market is Shanghai’s tech board, kind of like the Nasdaq. It focuses on strategic sectors—semiconductors, artificial intelligence , bi otech. The board has looser profitability requirements but stricter rules for foreign retail investors. But Shou added a warning. “However, such participation will be indirect, very limited, and mostly non-meaningful.” The IPO allocations are often tiny compared to what the fund holds overall. The performance numbers show what foreign investors are missing out on. The CSI 300 Information Technology Index tracks information technology companies within China’s CSI 300 . It’s up 32% year to date. Compare that with the benchmark CSI 300, which has risen 17%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Tech Index has gained 24% so far this year.

Speaking to David Lin on December 19, Gareth Soloway, Chief Market Strategist at Verified Investing, said Bitcoin’s decline should be viewed through the lens of historical market cycles rather than isolated crypto volatility. “My guess is Bitcoin doesn’t have its normal 75% drawdown like last cycles,” Soloway said . “Instead, look for somewhere in the 40 to 50% drawdown and then look for a base with institutional money accumulating.” Soloway noted that Bitcoin may already be well into that corrective phase. “You have to think it is,” he said when asked whether the drawdown has already begun. “If we look at the chart, peak to trough, we’ve already dropped 36%.” Previous Bitcoin cycle highs back in focus According to Soloway, Bitcoin’s technical structure points to a potential return to the highs of the previous cycle, which now act as a key support zone. “If we look at the chart on Bitcoin, we’re likely headed back to the high of the previous cycle at $69,000,” he said. “That becomes my zone of $69,000 to $74,000. If we do a drawdown from the highs into that range, we’re right in the midst of that 40, about 45% drawdown into that support.” However, Soloway cautioned that a more severe outcome remains possible if broader markets unravel. “If the stock market really collapses and we get a major, major collapse, you know, like a crash-type scenario, then Bitcoin likely would go lower because again, it would just freak out people and they would just dump everything.” Stocks versus Bitcoin in 2026 Soloway’s outlook is closely tied to his bearish view on equities. He argued that Bitcoin’s weakness could be an early warning signal, as historically crypto and stocks tend to move in tandem during major market stress. Assuming a more typical pullback in equities of around 10% to 15% in 2026, Soloway believes Bitcoin could begin to stabilize even as stocks struggle. “I still think Bitcoin will continue to see investors flocking to it away from risk assets,” he said. “For the most part, it’s a risk asset still, but I still think big money is looking at it more as a form of digital gold, and therefore that’ll cushion the downside somewhat.” He also highlighted a growing divergence between traditional markets and Bitcoin. While stocks are up double digits year to date depending on the session, Bitcoin remains down over the same period. When asked whether Bitcoin looks attractive relative to equities at current levels, Soloway was clear. “If I had to right now, yes, I would be accumulating Bitcoin and slowly accumulating on the way down here. Absolutely.” Defensive positioning ahead Soloway warned that excessive leverage and speculative enthusiasm, particularly around artificial intelligence, have left equity markets vulnerable. “We’ve gotten so much money and so much leverage into the stock market at this point,” he said, adding that while AI will transform the economy, margin compression is already emerging beneath the surface. “You’ve got to look for the defensive names now in the stock market in 2026,” Soloway concluded, “and also these ancillary plays like Bitcoin, especially if it comes down to around $70,000.” Watch the full interview with Gareth Soloway below: The post Bitcoin could crash to $69,000 in 2026, warns market strategist appeared first on Finbold .",Cryptocurrency news|Stocks news|Bitcoin|BTC|cryptocurrency|Gareth Soloway|Stocks,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Finbold', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",finbold,2025-12-22 12:11:22

Trader Crypto King believes that BNB is at a critical juncture as it just hit a long-dated trend line support. As a result, the token could either bounce strongly off it or drop sharply. Based on his analysis, a decisive bounce could propel BNB back to the $950 level. This means an upside potential of around 10%. Meanwhile, if the price breaks below this key line, it could decline to $700 in the next few weeks. BNB Price Prediction: This Is What BNB Needs to Do to Reverse Its Downtrend The 4-hour chart shows that the price has formed a symmetrical triangle. This indicates an ongoing consolidation and confirms Crypto King’s analysis. The 200-period EMA, along with the upper bound of the triangle, are the key resistance areas to watch. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has sent an early buy signal after rising above the 14-period moving average. This favors a bullish short-term outlook as well. A decisive breakout above $900 could set in motion the next leg up, potentially pushing the price to $1,000 in the near term. This move would invalidate BNB’s bearish structure and should mark the end of the bear market.

The growing adoption rate of the XRP Ledger Protocol could push XRP to an average price of $9.79, with a possible maximum trading value of $10.45 in 2028. In 2031, the target price for XRP is between $15.67 and $16.97, with an average price of $16.32. XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future. Whether it will reach new highs or continue to grow steadily remains to be seen, and despite its history of legal battles with the Securities and Exchange Commission, this digital asset will undoubtedly play an important role in global financial institutions. So, how high can XRP realistically go? Will XRP reach 5 dollars? Let’s answer these questions in our XRP price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Ripple Token XRP Price $1.92 (+0.52%) Market cap $116.66B Trading volume (24-hour) $2.19B Circulating supply 60.57B XRP All-time high $3.65 on July 18, 2025 All-time low $0.002686 on May 22, 2014 24-hour high $1.94 24-hour low $1.90 XRP price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 5.27% 50-day SMA $2.16 200-day SMA $2.54 Sentiment Bearish Fear and greed index 25 (Extreme Fear) Green days 14/30 (47%) XRP price analysis: XRP holds around $1.92 TL;DR Breakdown XRP price analysis confirms a mixed trend at $1.92. The token gained 0.52% in value. XRP has support at $1.80. On December 22, 2025, XRP shows a mild recovery, but the trend remains largely undecided. The coin is trading near $1.92 after a 0.52% increase in the past 24 hours. The buyers still lack momentum, keeping conditions cautious for bullish traders, as the coin can enter a correction again by the next trading session. XRP price analysis on the daily timeframe The one-day price chart of XRP confirmed an upward market trend for the cryptocurrency. XRP/USD value increased to a $1.92 high in the past 24 hours. A green candlestick on the price chart signifies returning buying momentum. XRP/USD 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is wide as volatility is high. Moreover, the upper band of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, is at $2.17. The lower Bollinger band, indicating support, is at $1.80. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is in the neutral area. The indicator is currently at 42 and moving upward, which marks a slow bullish trend. The buying activities have led to an increase. This ascent is reflected by a slightly upward curve on the RSI graph. If the bullish momentum continues to rise, the market can enter a period of stability. XRP price analysis on the 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis of XRP confirmed a bearish market trend for the cryptocurrency. Its value decreased to $1.92 in the past four hours. The decreasing volatility signals fewer signs of reversal in the coming hours. The Bollinger bands are converging as volatility decreases. This decrease in volatility signals a higher market predictability. Moreover, the upper Bollinger band has shifted to $1.95, indicating the resistance threshold. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band is at a low of $1.87, securing the support. XRP/USD 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is in the neutral zone as it moves downwards. Its value has decreased to index 53 in the past few hours. The curve on the RSI graph confirms a negative trend as the indicator’s score decreases. The recent downturn refers to a relatively unbalanced trading environment for investors.

The daily price analysis for the XRP/USD pair presents an undecided trend for the cryptocurrency with a slight bullish bias. In the past 24 hours, the bulls continued their lead, thereby creating favorable circumstances for the investors. As a result, the coin value has recovered to $1.92 because of the increasing momentum today. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple, along with the rising adoption, might boost the XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisitions and CBDC developments make XRP a good long-term investment option. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. It is advised to proceed with caution. Why is XRP up? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has increased as buying momentum picked up, driving the coin’s price to $1.92. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $2.26 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? If demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent, the coin could approach $5 by 2026. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.65, achieved on July 18, 2025. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a chance of reaching near $20 by 2031. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Still, the token provides a good buying opportunity to investors looking for long-term goals. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is expected to reach a maximum price of $16 by 2031, making it a valuable asset, particularly with the continued efforts of Ripple Labs. However, some regulatory uncertainties still exist for XRP. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research.

XRP historic price sentiment XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted to as low as $0.31, significantly decreasing XRP market cap. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. By the middle of May, XRP touched $2.57, and in July, it marked a new all-time high of $3.65. Near the start of August 2025, XRP was trending above $3, showing significant growth as the market sentiment was tilting toward the positive side; however, it lost $3 by the end of the month. In October through November, XRP traded around $1.83 to $3.10. At the start of December, XRP is trading around $1.99 to $2.18.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|XRP|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-22 12:21:36

The transfer of 1,200 BTC, valued at a staggering $108 million, alongside 10,000 ETH, marks a watershed moment for institutional cryptocurrency adoption. This isn’t just a large transaction; it’s a powerful signal about the future of digital assets. Let’s dive into what this means for Bitcoin, the market, and you. What Does This Massive BlackRock Bitcoin Deposit Actually Mean? When a firm managing over $10 trillion in assets moves over $100 million into Bitcoin, you pay attention. This BlackRock Bitcoin deposit to Coinbase Prime is far more significant than a simple trade. Coinbase Prime is a specialized platform built for heavyweight institutional players, offering top-tier security, deep liquidity, and comprehensive custody services. Therefore, BlackRock’s use of this platform indicates a strategic, long-term operational move into crypto, not a speculative dabble. This action builds directly on BlackRock’s established crypto trajectory. The firm launched a spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), which has become one of the most successful ETF launches in history. This deposit could be related to supporting that ETF’s liquidity or part of a broader treasury strategy. Either way, it demonstrates a deepening commitment to integrating Bitcoin into traditional finance frameworks. Why Is Institutional Adoption Like This So Crucial for Bitcoin? Think of Bitcoin’s journey in two phases: the pioneering retail phase and the institutional adoption phase. We are now firmly in the latter. Moves like the BlackRock Bitcoin deposit provide three key benefits for the entire ecosystem: Enhanced Legitimacy: It acts as a stamp of approval, encouraging other large, cautious institutions to follow suit. Market Stability: Institutional capital tends to be more long-term focused, which can reduce extreme volatility driven by retail sentiment. Infrastructure Development: Demand from giants like BlackRock forces the creation of more robust, secure, and regulated financial products and services around crypto. However, this shift is not without its challenges. Increased institutional involvement leads to greater regulatory scrutiny. Furthermore, some purists argue it moves Bitcoin away from its decentralized roots. Despite these concerns, the net effect of bringing trillions of dollars of traditional capital into the space is overwhelmingly viewed as positive for growth and stability. What Can We Learn from BlackRock’s Strategic Move? BlackRock doesn’t make $108 million moves on a whim. Their strategy offers actionable insights for all market observers. First, it highlights the importance of using regulated, institutional-grade platforms for serious capital. For other corporations or large investors, the path is now clearly paved. Second, it reinforces Bitcoin’s primary narrative as a digital store of value, often called ‘digital gold.’ Institutions are treating it as a strategic asset on their balance sheet. Finally, pairing the Bitcoin deposit with a substantial Ethereum transfer shows that smart, diversified exposure to the crypto asset class is becoming standard practice at the highest levels. The Future After a Landmark BlackRock Bitcoin Deposit This event is likely a precursor, not an endpoint. We can expect other asset managers and corporate treasuries to accelerate their own digital asset strategies. The flow of institutional capital into Bitcoin and Ethereum is poised to become a steady stream, fundamentally altering market dynamics. Price discovery will increasingly be driven by large-scale, long-term allocation decisions alongside retail trading. In conclusion, BlackRock’s $108 million BlackRock Bitcoin deposit is a monumental vote of confidence. It transcends a single transaction, representing a pivotal moment where the world’s largest traditional finance player is actively building its future with Bitcoin. This move solidifies crypto’s position in the mainstream financial landscape and sets the stage for the next chapter of unprecedented growth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Coinbase Prime? A1: Coinbase Prime is a specialized brokerage and custody platform designed for institutional investors like hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations. It offers services tailored for large-scale trading and secure asset storage. Q2: Why did BlackRock deposit Bitcoin to Coinbase Prime and not just hold it themselves? A2: Managing private keys for hundreds of millions in crypto requires immense security expertise and infrastructure. Using a qualified custodian like Coinbase Prime is the standard, secure practice for institutions, mitigating risk and ensuring regulatory compliance. Q3: Does this deposit mean BlackRock is bullish on Bitcoin’s price? A3: While not a direct price prediction, a strategic deposit of this size indicates a strong, long-term belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition as an asset class. It suggests they see it as a viable component of a modern investment portfolio. Q4: How does this affect the average Bitcoin investor? A4: It generally provides positive long-term momentum. Institutional adoption increases legitimacy, can reduce volatility, and drives development of better investment products (like ETFs), making it easier and safer for everyone to gain exposure. Q5: What was the value of the Ethereum deposited alongside the Bitcoin? A5: BlackRock deposited 10,000 ETH, which was worth approximately $30.5 million at the time of the transaction, showing a significant diversified investment into the crypto ecosystem. Q6: Is this related to BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT)? A6: It is widely speculated that the deposit is connected to the operations and liquidity needs of their highly successful IBIT ETF, though BlackRock has not explicitly confirmed the specific purpose.

However, a stark warning from on-chain analysts suggests this year’s festivities might bring more coal than cheer. Recent data reveals a concerning trend: the Bitcoin Santa rally has been losing its magic, with increasing selling pressure threatening short-term gains. Let’s unpack what this means for your portfolio. Is the Bitcoin Santa Rally Losing Its Power? For years, the end-of-year period has been associated with positive momentum for Bitcoin. However, analysis of the past five years paints a different picture. According to on-chain analyst Ardi, the Bitcoin Santa rally has shown a clear trend of diminishing returns. While 2020 saw an impressive 34.5% surge, subsequent year-end performances have progressively weakened when excluding that outlier. This pattern indicates that the seasonal boost may be becoming less reliable, prompting investors to question its future potency. Why Are Bitcoin Whales Creating Selling Pressure? The current market dynamic reveals a crucial shift in behavior among large holders. Since early December, Bitcoin whales—entities holding large amounts of BTC—have been incrementally selling their holdings. Their strategy appears to capitalize on buying enthusiasm from retail investors during the holiday period. This creates a direct selling pressure that can suppress prices. Key observations include: Whales are distributing coins to realize profits. Retail buying is being met with institutional selling. The net effect is a potential ceiling on short-term price appreciation. This activity suggests a tactical move by sophisticated players, turning the anticipated rally into a potential trap for the unwary. How Does the Current Phase Compare to 2021? Context is critical in cryptocurrency markets. Ardi notes that Bitcoin is currently in a similar post-halving phase to 2021. That year, the digital asset recorded a 7.9% decline during the same holiday period. This historical parallel is significant because halving events are major supply shocks that typically precede bull markets. However, the interim period can be volatile. The comparison to 2021 suggests we might be in a consolidation or distribution phase before the next major upward leg, rather than a straightforward seasonal rally. What Should Investors Do Amid This Warning? Facing a potential weakening Bitcoin Santa rally and heightened selling pressure , a cautious approach is prudent. The analyst’s warning is not necessarily a call to exit the market but a reminder to manage risk. Consider these actionable insights: Avoid FOMO Buying: Chasing prices during a suspected distribution phase can lead to buying at local tops. Monitor On-Chain Data: Keep an eye on whale wallet movements and exchange flows for real-time signals. Focus on the Long-Term: Short-term holiday trends should not override a sound long-term investment thesis based on fundamentals. The key is to separate seasonal noise from the underlying cycle driven by adoption, regulation, and macroeconomic factors. The Bottom Line on Bitcoin’s Seasonal Trend The data presents a compelling narrative: the famed Bitcoin Santa rally is facing strong headwinds. A combination of weakening historical returns and active distribution by whales creates a challenging environment for short-term bulls. While the holiday spirit is about optimism, smart investing requires a clear-eyed view of the evidence. The current setup advises vigilance over exuberance, suggesting that the most significant gifts for crypto investors may come after the season ends, once the selling pressure subsides and the market finds a firmer footing. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin Santa Rally? The Bitcoin Santa rally refers to a perceived seasonal trend where the price of Bitcoin tends to rise in the final weeks of December and into the new year, akin to a stock market “Santa Claus rally.” Why is the Santa rally weakening for Bitcoin? Analysis shows diminishing year-end returns over recent years, potentially due to increased market efficiency, larger institutional presence changing seasonal patterns, or profit-taking by large holders (whales) capping gains. What does ‘selling pressure’ mean in this context? It refers to a measurable increase in the selling of Bitcoin by large holders (whales), which offsets buying demand and can prevent prices from rising or even push them lower in the short term. Should I sell my Bitcoin because of this analysis? Not necessarily. This analysis highlights a short-term risk. Investment decisions should align with your long-term strategy, risk tolerance, and broader market fundamentals, not just one seasonal indicator. How can I track whale selling pressure? You can monitor on-chain metrics via various analytics platforms that track large wallet movements, exchange inflows (which can signal intent to sell), and the balance of coins held by different wallet size cohorts. Is the post-halving phase still bullish for Bitcoin? Historically, yes. Post-halving periods have preceded major bull markets. However, the journey is not linear, and phases of consolidation or correction are common before parabolic moves. Found this analysis of the Bitcoin Santa rally and selling pressure insightful?

By 2026, the strongest platforms look less like speculative crypto startups and more like credit providers built around risk controls, compliance, and predictable loan mechanics. This review focuses on licensed or regulation-aware Bitcoin-backed loan providers that have earned user trust through transparency, longevity, and conservative collateral management. The goal is not to rank by hype or headline APRs, but to explain how these platforms actually work, what they offer, and where the risks still sit. How Bitcoin-Backed Loans Work A Bitcoin-backed loan lets you borrow fiat or stablecoins while keeping BTC as collateral. You deposit Bitcoin, receive a loan based on a predefined loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, and repay the loan to unlock your BTC. Key mechanics to understand: Overcollateralization: Loans are typically issued at 20–50% LTV to absorb BTC price volatility. Liquidation thresholds: If BTC falls and your LTV breaches a limit, the platform may sell part of your collateral. Interest model: Some platforms charge interest on the full loan immediately; others only on funds actually used. Custody: In centralized models, the lender holds your BTC. In decentralized models, smart contracts do. The difference between a safe loan and a painful one usually comes down to LTV discipline, liquidation design, and transparency, not headline rates. unregulated lenders. Trusted Bitcoin-Backed Loan Providers (2026) Clapp — Credit Line Model Focused on Flexibility Clapp takes a credit-line approach rather than issuing fixed-term loans. Users deposit Bitcoin and receive a borrowing limit. Interest applies only to the amount actually drawn. Why it stands out No interest on unused credit Borrow and repay at any time Bitcoin remains locked unless risk thresholds are breached Designed for users who need liquidity intermittently, not continuously Who it fits Long-term BTC holders Users who want optional liquidity rather than a fixed obligation Borrowers who prioritize cost control over maximum leverage Nexo — Established CeFi Bitcoin Lending Nexo remains one of the most recognizable names in Bitcoin-backed lending. Its model blends instant credit lines with more traditional centralized risk management. Why it stands out Long operational history Broad collateral and loan currency support Integrated app with clear monitoring of LTV and margin levels Who it fits Users who value familiarity and scale Borrowers who want fast access to liquidity without complex setup Key risk Interest typically accrues on the borrowed amount from day one Centralized custody and platform exposure remain core risks YouHodler — Higher LTV, Higher Risk YouHodler focuses on maximizing borrowing power, often allowing higher LTVs than more conservative lenders. Why it stands out Higher borrowing capacity against BTC Fast loan issuance Simple, fixed-term structure Who it fits Experienced users who actively monitor collateral Short-term liquidity needs where higher leverage is intentional Key risk Narrower margin for BTC price drops Faster liquidation in volatile markets Aave (Bitcoin via Wrapped Assets) — Non-Custodial Alternative While not a licensed lender in the traditional sense, Aave represents the non-custodial end of Bitcoin-backed borrowing through wrapped BTC. Why it stands out No centralized custodian Fully transparent, on-chain mechanics Borrowing rules enforced by smart contracts Who it fits Advanced users Those who prioritize self-custody over regulatory structure Key risk Smart-contract risk Liquidations can be abrupt during market stress Requires active management Comparing Crypto Lending Models Platform Type Custody Interest Structure Flexibility Risk Profile Credit Line (Clapp) Centralized Pay-as-used High Moderate CeFi Credit (Nexo) Centralized Full balance Medium Moderate High-LTV Loans (YouHodler) Centralized Full balance Low Higher DeFi (Aave) Non-custodial Variable Medium Technical Core Risks to Keep in Mind Even with trusted providers, Bitcoin-backed loans carry structural risks: BTC volatility: Price drops can trigger forced liquidation. Custodial exposure: Centralized platforms control collateral. Operational risk: Platform downtime or policy changes can affect access. Overborrowing: High LTV loans amplify downside faster than most users expect. The safest loans usually bore low LTV, modest drawdowns, and conservative collateral management. Final Thoughts Bitcoin-backed lending in 2026 is no longer about chasing the highest leverage or lowest advertised rate. The most reliable platforms focus on clear terms, controlled risk, and predictable behavior during market stress. For most users, the best choice depends on intent: Flexible access to liquidity favors credit-line models Predictability favors fixed-term loans Sovereignty favors non-custodial DeFi What matters most is understanding how the loan behaves when Bitcoin moves against you, not how attractive it looks when markets are calm.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.98 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $5.02. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.4474 Market cap $477.10M Trading volume (24-hour) $15.28M Circulating supply 1.069B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3505 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.4497 24-hour low $0.4323 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.06% (Medium) 50-day SMA $0.5210 14-Day RSI 36.85 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 20 (Extreme Fear) Green days 14/30 (47%) 200-day SMA $0.6777 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: XTZ bounced near $0.45, but the higher-timeframe trend is still weak. Key resistance lies at $0.455–0.47 and is crucial for a momentum shift. If XTZ fails to break $0.45, it risks a pullback toward $0.43. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart As seen on the 1-day price chart for December 22, Tezos is trading around $0.447 after rebounding from the $0.425–$0.43 demand zone. However, the current price structure remains corrective rather than bullish. Tezos (XTZ) is still capped below the falling mid-band near $0.47 and well under the upper band around $0.52, keeping the broader trend biased to the downside. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The MACD is negative and flat, signaling weak momentum despite the bounce, while CMF, hovering below zero, confirms capital inflows are still lacking. As long as $0.47–$0.48 is not reclaimed on a daily close, this move appears to be a consolidation before another decision, with downside risk reopening toward $0.43 if buyers stall. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour timeframe, XTZ’s price has recovered sharply from around $0.435 and is now pressing into the Alligator cluster around $0.445–0.448, a near-term inflection area. The bounce is constructive, but volume remains modest, and OBV has only partially recovered, suggesting short-covering more than strong accumulation. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView The MACD is curling up but is still close to the signal line, implying momentum is improving yet fragile. A clean break and hold above $0.455 would open room toward $0.47, while rejection here likely sends price back to $0.44 and possibly $0.435. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.5517 SELL SMA 5 $0.5226 SELL SMA 10 $0.5210 SELL SMA 21 $0.5072 SELL SMA 50 $0.5210 SELL SMA 100 $0.5902 SELL SMA 200 $0.6777 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.4933 SELL EMA 5 $0.5192 SELL EMA 10 $0.5755 SELL EMA 21 $0.6527 SELL EMA 50 $0.7116 SELL EMA 100 $0.7110 SELL EMA 200 $0.7299 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Unless Tezos decisively reclaims $0.47, expect choppy consolidation with a downside bias. A confirmed breakout above $0.47 would be the first signal of a meaningful trend shift rather than just a relief bounce. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $1.5 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing.

Separately, decentralized perpetuals exchange Hyperliquid moved to reassure its community after claims that an internal wallet was shorting its HYPE token. The DEX explained that the address belonged to a former employee that was terminated in early 2024. Binance Compliance Gaps Exposed Binance allowed hundreds of millions of dollars to flow through accounts flagged for suspicious activity even after agreeing to tighten its compliance framework as part of a $4.3 billion settlement with US authorities. This is according to an investigation by the Financial Times . The report referenced internal data that was reviewed by the newspaper, which suggests that serious compliance gaps persisted well after Binance entered a plea agreement with the US Department of Justice in November of 2023. The leaked files cover transactions spanning from 2021 through 2025 and indicate that multiple high-risk accounts were able to continue trading on the platform despite repeated red flags. In total, the Financial Times examined data linked to 13 suspicious accounts that collectively processed around $1.7 billion in cryptocurrency transactions. Approximately $144 million of that volume reportedly occurred after Binance finalized its settlement with US authorities, a period during which the company publicly committed to strengthening oversight and enforcement. One of the most striking cases involved an account registered to a resident of a Venezuelan slum that moved roughly $93 million through Binance over four years. According to the investigation, some of those funds originated from a network that was later accused by US authorities of covertly transferring money for Iran and Lebanon’s Hizbollah. Another account, registered to a 25-year-old Venezuelan woman, received more than $177 million in crypto over a two-year period and repeatedly altered its linked banking details. The account reportedly changed bank information 647 times in just 14 months, and cycled through almost 500 different bank accounts across multiple countries. Former US federal prosecutor Stefan Cassella told the Financial Times that the transaction patterns resembled those of an unlicensed money-transmitting business, a serious violation under US financial regulations. The investigation also uncovered examples of activity that appeared physically impossible, like logins from Caracas followed by access from Osaka, Japan, within hours. Several of the accounts received funds in Tether’s USDT stablecoin from wallets later frozen by Israeli authorities under anti-terrorism laws. Some of those transfers were traced to wallets linked to Tawfiq Al-Law, a Syrian national accused of moving money for Hizbollah and Iran-backed Houthi groups. Israeli authorities seized related accounts in 2023, and the US Treasury sanctioned Al-Law in 2024. The findings come after renewed scrutiny of the exchange’s governance after US President Donald Trump’s pardon of founder Changpeng Zhao in October for anti-money laundering violations. Despite the appointment of independent compliance monitors in 2024, much of the activity that was pointed out in the report reportedly occurred after monitoring already began. Hyperliquid Denies Insider HYPE Trading Another crypto company is also turning heads. Decentralized perpetuals exchange Hyperliquid calmed community concerns after speculation emerged that an internal team wallet was selling and shorting large amounts of its native HYPE token. The clarification came after weeks of discussion in the project’s community after on-chain activity suggested that a wallet tied to early insiders may have been trading against the token. In a message that was posted on Hyperliquid’s Discord, co-founder Iliensinc said the wallet flagged by users does not belong to an active team member, but rather to a former employee who was terminated in the first quarter of 2024. According to the co-founder, the individual is no longer associated with Hyperliquid Labs, and their trading activity does not represent the values or standards of the company. The address in question , identified by users as 0x7ae4…1028, attracted scrutiny after allegedly selling roughly 4,000 HYPE tokens in a single day last November. The transaction was worth about $134,000 at the time. The issue was initially raised by a community member using the handle cobe.hype, who claimed the wallet was linked to the Hyperliquid team and accused it of shorting HYPE. Those claims fueled concerns about insider behavior, transparency, and whether team members could be trading the token using privileged information. Iliensinc pushed back on those allegations by explaining that Hyperliquid Labs enforces strict internal policies governing token-related activity. According to the co-founder, all employees and contractors are subject to firm ethical rules that explicitly prohibit derivatives trading involving HYPE, including both long and short positions. He added that trading based on material non-public information is fundamentally forbidden and that the restriction also applies to sharing such information with third parties. (Source: CoinGecko ) The controversy comes as Hyperliquid dominates the decentralized perpetuals market. The platform has quickly grown into the leading perp DEX by volume. Data from CoinGecko shows Hyperliquid processed roughly $653 billion in trading volume during the second quarter of 2025, accounting for about 73% of the total perp DEX market.

What immediately stands out is a distinctive sponsor fee of 2.5% and an unusual staking process. The fund had structural issues before the uplisting, which, after July 2024, have been limited. Performance has aligned with peers, as has volatility, while the premium/discount and the bid/ask spread have been reduced. It remains a volatile solution linked to ETH-USD and the crypto market. When I think about a solution to gain non-on-chain exposure to ETH-USD—meaning without the need to manage wallets or private keys—the first name that comes to mind is Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE). This is due to its long-standing presence in the sector, dating back to 2017, and improved with its 2024 uplisting from OTC markets on the NYSE. Today, however, it still presents an unusual structure, with some characteristics that distinguish it from other solutions listed in traditional finance, including some other ETH ETFs. This makes the comparison interesting, especially given the fact that the sponsor fee has remained significantly higher than that of its peers at 2.5% annually. Introduction and Definition ETHE aims to replicate the spot price of ETH, net of fees and liabilities, without leverage or derivatives. With an AUM of ~$4.43 billion and approximately ~1,063,338 ETH held and custodied by Coinbase Custody, it uses the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX) as its official benchmark, where each share represents a fraction of ETH. ETHE - Profile (Seeking Alpha) Its sponsor fee of 2.50% per year is quite high compared to spot ETH ETFs. This is paid in Ether, resulting in a mechanical erosion of exposure. The amount of ETH per share decreases over time due to the payment of fees. The trust does not provide yield on ETH, at least according to the prospectus, but ETFs in custody have a gross staking rewards of 4.00%, which results in net staking rewards of 3.06%, derived from approximately 76.46% staked. ETHE - quant rating (Seeking Alpha) Today the premium/discount is 0.00%, thanks to the post-July 2024 efficiency process, when an uplisting was carried out. Historically, however, there have been strong distortions, with a historical maximum discount of -60%, resulting in a historical average discount of ~24% over long periods. What Does ETHE Do? ETHE - ETH: performance (Seeking Alpha) When evaluating ETHE’s performance over longer timeframes, a severe discrepancy can be observed compared to the underlying asset. I do want to make one clarification, however: for comparative consistency, it would be more appropriate to narrow the analysis to the post-July 2024 period . Even doing so, it becomes evident that the performance gap is significantly reduced. ETHE - ETH: performance (Seeking Alpha) What remains an open question, however, is the contribution of integrated staking. This would theoretically be a positive factor, considering that on ETH-USD it is a process the investor would have to replicate manually . The problem is that such high sponsor fees nullify the propulsive effect that ETHE should have. At the same time, these very high fees also play a negative role in terms of long-term price appreciation, especially after drawdowns, when the crypto market cyclically alternates sharp and rapid rallies. The application of the fee is like an accounting of the loss, which in theory works against the price. To this is added the classic volatility of the crypto market. Not by chance, for Seeking Alpha, the risk grade is F, considering a standard deviation of 84%, and an annualized volatility of 74%. ETHE - risk grade (Seeking Alpha) Who Is ETHE For? Considering these results, and above all the uplisting, ETHE becomes a potentially competitive solution. It could, however, be more appreciable for tactical exposures and rapid rotations in the short/medium term. Meanwhile, it becomes more difficult, because of the sponsor fee, to be competitive compared to other solutions if the intention is to accumulate ETH or to have a long-term exposure to the underlying. In the same way, it should be remembered that both returns and, naturally, volatility are attributable to those of the underlying ETH-USD. This makes ETHE a tool poorly suited for those seeking defensive or low-volatility portfolio solutions. On the contrary, it could be associated with more speculative positions, or in any case closer to the growth stock market. ETHE - momentum grade (Seeking Alpha) It is interesting to note how the crypto market, and therefore ETHE as well, tends more and more over time to move closer to the US big tech market in terms of characteristics, which makes it very sensitive to the same catalysts. ETHE - Nasdaq 100 (Seeking Alpha) Risks Net of the risks related to the structure, which can be summarized in the fact that, theoretically, even after the uplisting, ETHE continues to have a potential fee drag issue (which we have discussed), with a consequent potential erosion of the ETF per share. Here I would rather focus instead on another element: the underlying. When we choose to position ourselves on ETHE, we do so with the view that the underlying ETH-USD can bring benefits within a portfolio. ETH - USD: profile (Seeking Alpha) It should therefore not be forgotten, however, that the underlying is highly cyclical , like the entire crypto market, and alternates fairly evident phases of structural expansion with well-defined phases of contraction. These are and seem to be driven by external variables, such as the Bitcoin halving cycle itself, which indirectly also influences altcoin prices. This makes ETHE a derivative asset, potentially a high beta of Bitcoin, which in turn behaves like a high beta of the Nasdaq . Peer Comparison Its structure places it directly in competition with the wave of ETFs that arrived in 2024 on ETH. In this sense, a nice peer table can be created, which I, personally, summarize as follows: ETHE - peer table (Seeking Alpha) Among the competitors, there is the same “mini” version proposed by Grayscale itself, with a decidedly more competitive TER. What can be observed is that ETFs, in addition to costing less, have a slightly higher performance, which is counterintuitive if one considers that ETHE should have a staking structure in support. ETHE - peer performance (Seeking Alpha) Pros and Cons ETHE apparently has some fairly evident advantages and distinctive traits: Operational efficiency post-uplisting, with active creation/redemption, price aligned to NAV, and very reduced bid/ask spread Apparently active staking on the ETH held, which covers the sponsor fees of the fund. But there are also some negative points. The high expense ratio is a drawback, which leads to the erosion of ETH per share. This article answers three main questions about ETHE: How is ETHE structured, and how does it reflect Ethereum prices? How does ETHE compare to other Ethereum ETFs? What are its benefits and drawbacks? How can ETHE fit into a portfolio?

So we’ve seen a lot of impact from the retail audience in the first week or two. And then we started getting calls from pension funds and insurance companies globally,” McClurg revealed . He added: “And that’s the second market segment that we market to at Canary. But we’re seeing a lot of interest there. XRP is truly an asset that most of Wall Street and most of the global capital markets get. It’s easy to understand. It’s the rails for the financial system. So, of course, they’re very interested. But those are the two segments that we’ve seen a lot of interest from.” Why XRP ETFs Are So Successful McClurg made the comments in a Wealthion podcast interview with CoinFund President Chris Perkins, discussing Canary’s strategy in crypto ETFs and why single-asset products like XRP can pull demand from both US and international channels. The throughline was familiar to anyone who has watched ETFs reshape other markets: access and execution matter, and they often matter more than ideology. “A lot of our clients are retail,” McClurg said, estimating “probably 20 to 30%” of flows are coming from retail channels based on visible brokerage activity. The larger share, he added, is currently coming from faster trading-oriented capital. “It’s probably about 70% — I don’t want to call it institutional, but it’s probably 70% fast money at the moment.” Even so, McClurg’s view is that the stable end state for products like an XRP ETF is the advisor and allocator channel that already lives inside the ETF ecosystem. “ETFs are going to be probably primarily used by financial advisors,” he said. “Because they’re simple, they’re clean, they can hold them in their accounts, they can explain it.” For crypto, he argued, the problem is not subtle.“Most of retail is trading crypto on an exchange and they’re getting charged massive fees,” he said. “We’re talking $100 a trade. Plus the spread.” His point was not that ETFs are free, but that the ETF wrapper can compress costs and friction, particularly for investors who do not want to operate in exchange-native workflows. “When you think about an ETF… you’ve already won by buying an ETF when you’re talking about pennies spread… and then you’re only paying a 1% management fee,” he said. McClurg also addressed a factor that tends to drive ETF flows in crypto regardless of narrative: basis. He argued the spot/futures spread can act as a lever for ETF demand, and by extension a source of incremental spot pressure when the trade is attractive. “The basis trade is really what’s driving crypto ETFs at the moment,” he said, adding that outflows in bitcoin spot ETFs have, at times, coincided with the collapse of that spread. For XRP specifically, he suggested the dynamic has been supportive since launch. “We’ve benefited from launching XRP,” he said, “because there’s a great basis trade there.” He went further, claiming the product has seen consistent net buying even as broader markets softened. McClurg also highlighted the success of all spot XRP ETFs in the US. “Ever since the launch, even at a down market, there’s not been a single day of outflows,” McClurg said. At press time, XRP traded at $1.92.",XRP|US Spot XRP ETFs|XRP ETFs|XRP news|XRP price,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-22 13:30:09

The business intelligence firm, already famous for its colossal Bitcoin bet, has significantly bolstered its traditional financial position. Saylor revealed that MicroStrategy’s cash reserves have swelled to a formidable $2.19 billion. This development raises critical questions about the company’s future strategy and its implications for the broader market. What Do MicroStrategy’s Massive Cash Reserves Mean? Michael Saylor took to X (formerly Twitter) to share the news that MicroStrategy’s U.S. dollar holdings increased by a staggering $748 million. This brings the company’s total cash and cash equivalents to $2.19 billion. Furthermore, he noted the company holds 671,268 pounds. This accumulation of cash reserves represents a powerful strategic shift. While MicroStrategy is synonymous with Bitcoin, this move demonstrates a dual-pronged approach to corporate treasury management. The immediate question for investors and analysts is intent. Is this capital being positioned for operational needs, strategic acquisitions, or as a buffer against market volatility? Saylor’s announcement provides no explicit direction, but the scale of the accumulation is impossible to ignore. It signals immense financial strength and optionality at a time when economic uncertainty persists. How Does This Cash Pile Fit With the Bitcoin Strategy? MicroStrategy’s identity is inextricably linked to Bitcoin. The company holds over 214,000 BTC, making it the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin treasury. Therefore, this massive build-up of cash reserves creates a fascinating dynamic. It suggests the company is not putting all its eggs in one basket, despite its very public conviction in digital assets. Risk Management: The cash acts as a stabilizing force, insulating the company from Bitcoin’s price swings. Strategic Flexibility: It provides dry powder to purchase more Bitcoin during market dips or to invest in other ventures. Market Confidence: A strong balance sheet with substantial cash reserves can reassure traditional investors and creditors. This approach allows MicroStrategy to champion Bitcoin’s long-term potential while maintaining the fiscal prudence expected of a publicly-traded company. It’s a balancing act between revolutionary asset adoption and conventional corporate finance. What Are the Broader Implications for Crypto Markets? MicroStrategy’s actions are closely watched as a bellwether for institutional crypto adoption. This latest development with its cash reserves sends several signals to the market. First, it underscores that even the most bullish crypto advocates see value in maintaining significant traditional liquidity. Second, it may encourage other corporations to consider a hybrid treasury model, blending digital and fiat assets. The sheer size of the cash reserves —$2.19 billion—also highlights MicroStrategy’s successful capital-raising capabilities. The company has leveraged equity and debt markets effectively to fund both its Bitcoin acquisitions and now its cash stockpile. This financial engineering provides a potential blueprint for others. However, it also carries risks, such as dilution for shareholders and interest obligations on debt. Conclusion: A Masterstroke of Financial Positioning Michael Saylor’s announcement is more than a balance sheet update; it’s a statement of strategic depth. By amassing $2.19 billion in cash reserves , MicroStrategy has fortified its financial fortress. The company now possesses a rare combination: a visionary bet on Bitcoin’s future and a massive war chest of traditional currency. This positions it to navigate volatility, seize opportunities, and continue influencing the narrative around digital asset adoption. For the crypto industry, it’s a powerful lesson in the importance of strength, patience, and strategic optionality. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: How much cash does MicroStrategy now hold? A: According to Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy now holds $2.19 billion in U.S. dollar cash and cash equivalents. Q: Why is MicroStrategy holding so much cash if it believes in Bitcoin? A: Holding substantial cash reserves provides financial stability, operational flexibility, and the ability to buy more Bitcoin during market downturns. It’s a risk-management strategy. Q: Where did the $748 million increase in cash come from? A> While not specified in the announcement, MicroStrategy typically raises capital through methods like convertible note offerings or equity sales. Q: Does this mean MicroStrategy is moving away from Bitcoin? A> No, not at all. The company continues to hold over 214,000 BTC. The cash buildup is complementary to, not a replacement for, its Bitcoin strategy. Q: What are “671,268 pounds” referring to? A> This likely refers to physical pounds sterling (GBP) held by the company, indicating its cash reserves are held in multiple currencies. Q: How does this affect MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR)? A> A stronger balance sheet with high cash reserves is generally viewed positively by investors, as it reduces financial risk and provides strategic options.

Fundstrat’s Bearish Call Vs. Tom Lee’s Bull Case The document is credited to Sean Farrell, Fundstrat’s head of digital asset strategy, and includes a base-case scenario calling for a “meaningful drawdown in 1H 2026,” with target ranges of bitcoin at $60,000–$65,000, ether at $1,800–$2,000, and solana at $50–$75. The note adds that those levels would represent “attractive opportunities into year-end,” and that if the view is wrong, the preference is still to “play defense” until strength is confirmed. The ETH range is what set the market chatter off. Ether is trading around the $3,000 area, making $1,800 a material downside scenario if taken at face value.

At Binance Blockchain Week, Lee said ethereum at roughly $3,000 looked “severely undervalued,” a stance that reads very differently than a research framework explicitly mapping a potential move to the high-$1,000s. Over the past few weeks, Lee even publicly shared his predictions that ETH could reach $20,000 next year and $62,000 over the next several years. Farrell responded directly on X on Dec. 20, arguing the framing of “internal conflict” misunderstands how Fundstrat operates. The firm, he said, houses several analysts with independent processes, each designed for different client objectives and time horizons. Lee’s work, Farrell wrote, is aimed at large institutions that might allocate 1%–5% to BTC and ETH and is structured around longer-term macro and “secular” trends. Farrell’s research, by contrast, is positioned for investors with heavier crypto exposure—he referenced portfolios with ~20%+ allocations—where active risk management and rebalancing matter more than maintaining a single long-duration thesis through volatility. Related Reading: Ethereum Exchange Outflows Soar To $978M: Sign Of Dip Buying? That distinction is central to interpreting the leaked-style targets. Farrell’s public explanation wasn’t “we are bearish,” but rather “we are cautious in the near term.” He said markets appear priced for “near-perfection” while risks remain elevated—citing government shutdown dynamics, trade volatility, uncertainty around AI capex, and a Federal Reserve chair transition, alongside tight high-yield spreads and low cross-asset volatility. He also highlighted mixed flow conditions. In Farrell’s telling, long-term ETF demand could improve as wirehouses onboard, but near-term pressures persist from “OG selling,” miners, fund redemptions, and even the possibility of an MSCI MicroStrategy delisting—an item that stood out because it suggests the risk lens extends beyond spot crypto into the crypto-equity complex that has become a key liquidity and sentiment barometer. Farrell’s stated base case: “an early-year bounce followed by another 1H drawdown, creating a more attractive opportunity into year-end.If I’m wrong, I’d rather wait for confirmation (trend breaks, flows, momentum, or a clear catalyst). Crypto is reflexive, and for my objective, patience matters in no-man’s land.” The thread ends on a point many readers missed in the initial screenshot-driven outrage cycle: Farrell still expects BTC and ETH to “challenge new ATHs by year-end,” describing a shorter, shallower bear that could compress the traditional four-year cycle narrative. “For those who tuned into the outlook: I still expect BTC and ETH to challenge new ATHs by year-end, effectively ending the traditional four-year cycle with a shorter, shallower bear,” he wrote via X. At press time, Ethereum traded at $3,043.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-huge-xrp-move-loading-heres-why/,"Market participants are once again closely monitoring XRP after financial expert Levi Rietveld released an analysis suggesting that a significant price movement may be approaching. In his assessment, Rietveld points to derivatives data and historical price behavior to outline a scenario in which liquidity dynamics could drive sharp short-term volatility. His commentary centers on the structure of leveraged positions and how exchanges typically respond when large liquidation clusters are triggered. Rietveld’s analysis emphasizes that the current setup bears similarities to a prior market event that resulted in rapid upward movement followed by equally swift downside pressure. By revisiting that pattern, he argues that traders should be aware of how quickly sentiment can shift once critical levels are reached.

Like & repost to spread awareness!! pic.twitter.com/RPn9spBAh0 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) December 20, 2025 Short Liquidation Cluster Near the $2 Level According to Rietveld, data from Coinglass indicate a substantial concentration of short positions clustered around the $2 price area. He explains that when price approaches such zones, exchanges often benefit from forced liquidations as overleveraged traders are removed from the market. In previous instances, XRP experienced strong upward candles as these short positions were closed, creating the appearance of momentum-driven strength. However, Rietveld cautions that these moves have historically been followed by aggressive sell-offs. He references a similar setup in mid-December, when a rapid push higher was quickly reversed after liquidation targets were met. In his view, this pattern reflects how liquidity events can temporarily distort price action before underlying market pressure reasserts itself. Downside Risk and Identified Support Levels While much attention is placed on the potential upside move toward the short liquidation zone, Rietveld stresses that downside risk should not be underestimated. He identifies a key support level near $1.73, describing it as a zone where a large number of long positions could face liquidation if the price reverses sharply. This, he suggests, could amplify selling pressure and result in a deeper retracement than what was observed in previous cycles. Rietveld notes that the current market environment may intensify this effect. With leverage remaining elevated and traders positioning aggressively, a rapid shift in price direction could cascade through both short and long positions within a short timeframe. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Exchanges and the Mechanics of Volatility A central theme in Rietveld’s commentary is the role exchanges play during high-volatility events. He explains that liquidation-driven moves are a consistent source of revenue for trading platforms, as forced closures generate significant trading fees. In this context, sharp price swings are not anomalies but rather outcomes of how leveraged markets are structured. Overall, Rietveld’s analysis presents a cautious outlook. While a move toward the $2 level could materialize due to short liquidations, he underscores that such a development may be followed by pronounced downside pressure. His assessment serves as a reminder that liquidity-driven rallies can be brief and that risk management remains critical as XRP approaches these closely watched price levels.

More importantly, key derivatives metrics are flashing strong signals that professional traders are positioning for what could be a powerful year-end rally. According to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, Bitcoin open interest in perpetual futures has climbed significantly alongside rising funding rates, suggesting a wave of aggressive long positions entering the market. What Do Rising Bitcoin Open Interest and Funding Rates Actually Mean? When we talk about Bitcoin open interest , we’re referring to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that haven’t been settled. Think of it as a measure of total money parked in futures bets. Glassnode reports this figure jumped from 304,000 BTC to 310,000 BTC as prices recovered—that’s approximately a 2% increase. This growth in Bitcoin open interest typically indicates new money flowing into the market rather than just existing positions being reshuffled. Simultaneously, funding rates—the periodic payments between long and short position holders—climbed from 0.04% to 0.09%. Positive funding rates mean longs are paying shorts, which generally signals that traders are overwhelmingly bullish and willing to pay a premium to maintain their positions. Together, these metrics create a compelling narrative about market sentiment. Why Are Traders Betting on a Year-End Rally? The timing of this activity is particularly revealing. Several factors are converging that make a year-end surge plausible: Historical seasonality : December has often been a positive month for Bitcoin Institutional positioning : Traditional finance often rebalances portfolios year-end Macroeconomic shifts : Potential changes in monetary policy could favor risk assets Technical breakout : Reclaiming $90,000 represents a significant psychological level The increase in Bitcoin open interest suggests traders aren’t just hoping for a rally—they’re putting real capital behind their convictions. This isn’t mere speculation; it’s calculated positioning based on multiple converging signals. Understanding the Risks Behind the Optimism While rising Bitcoin open interest and positive funding rates generally indicate bullish sentiment, experienced traders know these metrics can also signal potential danger. High open interest during price rallies sometimes precedes sharp corrections if too many traders are positioned on one side of the market. This creates what’s known as a ‘crowded trade’ scenario. Moreover, sustained high funding rates can become expensive for long position holders over time, potentially forcing some to unwind their positions if the expected price appreciation doesn’t materialize quickly enough. Therefore, while the current data suggests optimism, prudent investors should consider: Setting appropriate stop-losses Avoiding excessive leverage despite tempting funding rates Monitoring open interest changes alongside price action Diversifying beyond just futures positions Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So what should you do with this information about rising Bitcoin open interest and funding rates? First, recognize that derivatives data provides valuable context but shouldn’t dictate your entire strategy. Consider these practical steps: For active traders, the current environment suggests trend-following strategies might work well, but be prepared for increased volatility. The growth in Bitcoin open interest often correlates with larger price swings in both directions. For long-term investors, these metrics serve as useful sentiment indicators but shouldn’t override fundamental conviction. The derivatives market moves faster than spot markets, so while it provides valuable signals, it shouldn’t replace your core investment thesis. The Bottom Line: What This Means for Bitcoin’s Trajectory The simultaneous rise in Bitcoin open interest and funding rates presents a clear message: sophisticated traders are positioning for upward momentum as the year concludes. Glassnode’s analysis specifically points to ‘aggressive long positions’ being established in anticipation of a year-end rally. However, the true test will be whether spot market demand can validate these derivative positions. While futures markets can lead price discovery, sustained rallies typically require genuine buying pressure in spot markets. The current increase in Bitcoin open interest suggests confidence, but the coming weeks will reveal whether this confidence is warranted. Frequently Asked Questions What is Bitcoin open interest? Bitcoin open interest represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that haven’t been closed or settled. It’s a key metric showing how much capital is committed to futures positions. Why do funding rates matter? Funding rates ensure perpetual futures contracts track spot prices. Positive rates mean long traders pay short traders, indicating bullish sentiment, while negative rates show bearish sentiment. Is high open interest always bullish? Not necessarily. While increasing open interest during a rally suggests new bullish positions, extremely high open interest can sometimes precede sharp corrections if the market becomes over-leveraged. How reliable are these indicators for predicting price? They’re valuable sentiment indicators but not perfect predictors. They show how traders are positioned, but unexpected news or events can always override technical signals. Should retail investors trade based on open interest data? It’s useful context but shouldn’t be your sole decision-making tool. Retail investors should combine derivatives data with fundamental analysis and risk management principles. What’s the difference between open interest and trading volume? Trading volume measures how many contracts traded during a period, while open interest measures how many contracts remain open. Volume shows activity; open interest shows commitment. Found this analysis of Bitcoin open interest and market dynamics helpful?

The perpetual futures DEX has restrictions on team trading, especially for the native HYPE token. Hyperliquid came out with a statement on rumors of insider trading. The perpetual futures DEX announced that the disputed HYPE short position belonged to a former employee, as current team members are banned from trading the native token. Recently, HYPE price weakness has created worries on the exchange’s ability to survive during a slower crypto market period. HYPE still traded around $25 at the time of the announcement, close to the levels from the past few days. As of December 22, Hyperliquid whales are predominantly long, for 59% of positions. The leading HYPE position is short, with a notional value of $45M. The whale sits on unrealized gains of $86M , as HYPE shows continued price weakness. The whale positions on HYPE are much larger compared to the address that has been linked to insider trading. Hyperliquid identified the former employee, pointing to the wallet currently still shorting HYPE. Hyperliquid denies insider HYPE trading The alleged insider position is valued at only $25,140, shorting 1,000 HYPE. At this size, the insider cannot have any significant effect on the market. The insider still owns around 2.5M HYPE from the spot market, holding despite the recent downturn. The short position is also earning minimal funding fees. Despite the single whale’s short position, most HYPE traders are bullish. Open interest for HYPE increased to $1.25B in the past day, with over 64% of positions going long. The only effect on Hyperliquid was the negative press from accusations of potential insider trading from current team members. Hyperliquid denies claims of insolvency Alongside the rumors of an insider whale, Hyperliquid also issued a statement denying recent claims that the platform was insolvent. The USDC held on Hyperliquid relies on both Arbitrum and the Hyperchain, while some analysts only accounted for a part of the reserves. As a result, the exchange faced attempts at causing panic. “ The Hyperliquid blockchain state is fully and verifiably solvent. The author excluded the HyperEVM USDC (a publicly announced and much anticipated integration), which exists in parallel to the Arbitrum bridge ,” announced the Hyperliquid team. Additionally, Hyperliquid noted it launched some testnet features allowing aggressive trading, but that those features would not be brought to the mainnet or be available for live trading. The team also explained the exchange does not offer special trading privileges and cannot freeze the network on demand. The perpetual futures DEX also defended itself against claims of multiple backdoor technologies and claimed all its activity and trades are fully transparent and recorded on the blockchain. The market still carries around $4.15B in total value locked, with over $14B in daily trading volumes.

The Ethereum Foundation outlined 2026 milestones for “provable security,” while traders tracked whether ETH can break a downtrend line that has capped rebounds since October. Ethereum Foundation sets 2026 zkEVM security milestones The Ethereum Foundation said it wants zkEVM teams to shift focus from proving speed to provable security, after progress on real time proving. In its Dec. 18 post, the Foundation said performance bottlenecks eased, but it now treats security as the central constraint for an L1 zkEVM that must operate on mainnet. The post argued that many STARK based zkEVMs still rely on unproven assumptions to claim security levels. It pointed to recent research that challenged some foundational conjectures and said the safer approach is “provable security,” with 128 bit security as the target. The Foundation said a soundness failure would not be like other bugs because a forged proof could let an attacker create assets, rewrite state, or steal funds. To standardize how teams measure security, the Foundation introduced “soundcalc,” a tool that estimates zkVM security using current cryptographic bounds and proof system parameters. It set an end of February 2026 deadline for participating teams to integrate their proof system components and circuits with soundcalc, so teams can compare security assessments on the same basis. Next, it set an end of May 2026 milestone tied to the Glamsterdam timeframe, calling for 100 bit provable security as estimated by soundcalc, a final proof size at or below 600 KiB, and a compact description of recursion architecture with a soundness sketch. Then, it set an end of 2026 milestone called “H star,” calling for 128 bit provable security, proof size at or below 300 KiB, and a formal security argument for recursion soundness. The post also said proof size and security sit in tension because stronger security often increases proof size, while proofs must remain small enough to propagate across Ethereum’s peer to peer network reliably. It highlighted recursion as a key area because zkEVMs combine many circuits with custom recursion designs, and it said documenting that architecture and its soundness is essential to system security. Ethereum nears multi month trendline test on 8 hour chart Meanwhile, Ethereum traded near $3,030 on the ETH USDT 8 hour Binance chart as it pushed toward a descending trendline that has capped rebounds since early October, based on a TradingView snapshot shared on X on Dec. 22. Ethereum Trendline Breakout Setup. Source: TradingView/X The chart shows lower highs under the same sloping resistance line, while price built higher lows from late November into late December. As a result, the range tightened into the trendline, setting up a key technical test.

The crypto asset remains in a bear market that began in September, according to pseudonymous crypto market analyst Doctor Profit, who said that the asset has not yet completed its full bottoming process and will require another 12 to 14 months before a definitive low is formed. 2026 Crash Incoming? In his latest analysis, Doctor Profit projected that Bitcoin’s eventual bottom could occur near the $60,000 level, and explained that markets require extended periods of sideways movement to build sufficient liquidity rather than moving quickly to final targets. Despite this longer-term bearish outlook, the analyst said Bitcoin could see a short-term upside move toward the $97,000 to $107,000 range in the coming weeks, and added that he does not expect a major downside move before February or March 2026. The current phase appears to be a prolonged consolidation period, which aims to create liquidity on the downside. According to his assessment, this slow and manipulated price action is designed to exhaust market participants psychologically and make it difficult for most investors to maintain conviction long enough to buy near the eventual bottom. Doctor Profit said he is currently bullish in the short term and has accumulated Bitcoin, while keeping his existing short position open as a hedge. This is to allow flexibility to capitalize on a potential 20% upside move before the broader downtrend resumes. He also linked BTC’s trajectory to wider macroeconomic conditions, while stating that global markets are experiencing an extreme liquidity crisis, as several indicators show stress levels comparable to or worse than those seen in 2008. He pointed to changes in the US Federal Reserve’s Standing Repo Facility, which now allows individual banks to borrow up to $240 billion per day against high-quality collateral, as evidence of systemic fragility rather than unlimited money printing. Such borrowing is temporary and must be repaid quickly with interest. He further argued that the policy is intended to prevent sudden liquidity freezes rather than stimulate markets. Doctor Profit said these measures indicate that authorities are losing the fight against inflation and rising debt levels, and he expects a major financial crisis to emerge in 2026. He said that such a crisis could be followed by large-scale monetary expansion similar to 2020, which would ultimately drive prices of assets such as Bitcoin, real estate, precious metals, and other stores of value significantly higher while fiat currencies continue to lose purchasing power. Temporary Upside for Bitcoin Another pseudonymous analyst, “Mr Wall Street,” echoed a similar short-term versus mid-term divergence in BTC’s outlook. While maintaining a bearish stance on the crypto asset over the medium term, he said downside liquidity remains insufficient for an immediate continuation of the broader decline. As a result, he expects a short-term relief rally toward the $98,000-$104,000 range, an area he identified as a key liquidity zone and fair value gap. Mr Wall Street said he entered long positions near $84,500 after Bitcoin held support around its weekly 100-day moving average. The analyst added that this move higher should be viewed as a bull trap rather than a trend reversal, stressing that he continues to expect BTC’s next major leg lower to target the $64,000-$70,000 region in late Q1 or early Q2 2026, describing the recent sharp swings as deliberate liquidity-driven moves designed to trap traders. Despite these bearish projections, certain market commentators believe that 2026 could bring in a recovery. Bitwise’s Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan, for one, said that he expects Bitcoin to reach new all-time highs next year.

Delinquencies on car loans have hit multiple record highs in 2025, with borrowers across the country falling behind… fast. According to data from Caribou and the Consumer Federation of America, U.S. consumers now owe $1.66 trillion in auto loans, second only to mortgages. 19.3% of borrowers now pay $1,000 or more per month for their car notes, a number that’s four times higher than it was in 2019. Those who can’t keep up are being swallowed by repossession companies. So far this year, 2.2 million cars have been taken back, the most since the 2008 Great Recession. Fed rate cuts offer little relief as refinancing narrows After the Federal Reserve cut interest rates in September and October, many Americans hoped it would give them room to breathe since lower rates historically often trickle down into auto loan interest rates, making refinancing a possibility. Back in January 2025, the average auto refinance rate sat at 8.35%, but by September, it had dropped to 7.62%, according to Caribou. That dip helped reduce monthly payments by an average of $157, based on a 3.82% drop in rates for those who locked in a refi during that window. But that window’s not open for everyone, and the credit bar for new auto loans is steadily rising, and borrowers with subprime credit scores are getting boxed out. Experian’s State of the Automotive Finance Market shows rising interest for those with poor credit, and fewer approvals overall, meaning the gap between those who can refinance and those who can’t is growing very fast. While loan trouble brews, prices on new vehicles keep climbing. According to Santander Bank, nearly half of middle-income Americans delayed buying a car over the past year because they simply couldn’t afford it. But by April and early May, that built-up demand came roaring back. Meanwhile, Kelley Blue Book reported that the average new vehicle cost $48,699 in May, a 2.5% increase from March, and more than double the usual bump seen from April’s tax refund-driven sales, which usually bring just 1.1% increases. Buyers with cash or strong credit jumped at the chance, but most are left hunting for pre-tariff 2024 and 2025 models that haven’t been sold yet. Others are waiting for Labor Day or Memorial Day promos, hoping dealers will cut them a break. Despite the mess, shoppers are still trying to find a way in. People with less-than-perfect credit are chasing “bad credit” auto loans or looking into alternative lenders. Some are checking with credit unions, others are hitting up buy-here-pay-here lots. But high rates aren’t going away yet. Even with the Fed’s benchmark range down to 3.75%–4.00%, the reality is simple: if your credit isn’t strong, the system isn’t built for you.

Speaking on the Rich Dad YouTube channel on December 17 alongside Matthew Seaman, the ‘ Rich Dad Poor Dad’ author said rising consumer debt and renewed monetary easing are early signs that inflationary pressure is building beneath the surface. “We don’t see wheelbarrows. We see credit cards instead,” he said. “The average American today is carrying a $3,600 balance on the credit card at 22% interest or something.” According to Kiyosaki, modern inflation no longer looks like historical textbook examples, but its effects are just as damaging. “We’re not burning it, we’re not flying kites with it, we’re not doing those things,” he said. “But history is repeating right now, so please be careful.” Rate cuts and inflation fears Kiyosaki pointed directly to monetary policy as the core risk factor, warning that further easing could accelerate purchasing power erosion. “Jerome Powell, this is 2025,” he said. “Just reducing interest rates again means hyperinflation is right around the corner. So it’s going to take more and more money to buy less and less.” While the term hyperinflation is often debated among economists, the author has long argued that sustained currency debasement disproportionately impacts wage earners and savers, particularly those reliant on fixed income or retirement accounts. Asset owners will benefit while workers fall behind In contrast, the finance guru said those holding tangible and income-producing assets are positioned to benefit from rising prices. “The good news is the rich will get richer because they have true assets,” he said. “If you have gold, silver, or Bitcoin, you’ll get richer. You own income-producing real estate, you get richer. You have cattle, you get richer.” By comparison, he warned that traditional employment and retirement structures offer little protection in an inflationary environment. “But if you have an ordinary job with a 401(k), you’ll probably get poorer,” Kiyosaki said.

Despite brief relief bounces, the overall structure remains bearish across the board. Both the USDT and BTC pairs are showing weakness, with no clear signs of a recovery. Technical Analysis By Shayan The USDT Pair XRPUSDT is still trapped in a steep descending channel. The latest drop tried to push the price below $1.80, but this critical level held. The market is now gradually recovering and likely approaching the higher boundary of the channel once more. However, the structure shows a clear series of lower highs and lower lows, with the RSI also flat below 50. Therefore, momentum still remains weak, and the price action could turn bearish quickly once again. The BTC Pair The BTC pair looks even worse. After forming a rising wedge in October and November, XRPBTC broke down hard in the last couple of weeks and is now trading just above 2,100 sats and below the 100 and 200-day moving averages. Both moving averages are located around the 2,300-2,400 sats zone. The RSI is also sliding toward oversold territory, but still no divergence or reversal signals. If the pair continues this decline, the next major demand zone is around 2,000 sats. That is where XRP previously bottomed earlier this year. So, unless the buyers reclaim the 2,500 sats level soon, XRP is likely to underperform BTC in the upcoming weeks.

Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar, offer the stability that volatile coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum lack. Yet, their use in everyday transactions has been limited by tax rules: any gain from a crypto payment, no matter how small, triggers capital gains taxes. This has kept stablecoins largely in the realm of speculation rather than practical spending. The proposal would exempt crypto payments under $200 from capital-gains taxes, removing reporting headaches and making everyday purchases, coffee, groceries, or small transfers, as effortless as using a debit card. For usability-focused stablecoins like RLUSD, that could finally unlock real-world adoption. Therefore, this regulatory clarity could fast-track stablecoin adoption for both consumers and businesses. Merchants would confidently accept stablecoins for everyday purchases, while users could spend crypto as a real currency. Notably, the bill signals a broader U.S. shift toward practical crypto regulation, acknowledging that overly strict tax rules can hinder innovation. Exempting small payments from capital gains taxes positions digital currencies to operate seamlessly alongside traditional payment methods. This is a major milestone for the crypto ecosystem. Stablecoins like RLUSD could enhance everyday payments as easily as swiping a card or scanning a QR code, without tax headaches. If passed, this legislation could transform stablecoins from investment assets into practical, widely usable digital money, bringing blockchain technology directly into daily life. Conclusion If enacted, this bill could turn stablecoins from speculative assets into everyday money. By exempting small payments from taxes, it paves the way for wider adoption, boosts merchant confidence, and positions cryptocurrencies like RLUSD as practical, frictionless digital cash for daily life.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-22 13:54:45

This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a seismic event that signals major activity in the stablecoin ecosystem. But what does this massive mint actually mean for you as an investor or crypto enthusiast? Let’s dive deep into the implications of this whale-sized creation of digital dollars. What Does It Mean When 250 Million USDC Is Minted? When the USDC Treasury creates new tokens, it essentially prints digital dollars backed by real-world assets. The recent event where 250 million USDC was minted represents a substantial injection of liquidity into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This process begins when institutional players deposit U.S. dollars with Circle, the company behind USDC, which then creates an equivalent amount of the stablecoin on the blockchain. This massive mint typically indicates one of two scenarios: either there’s significant incoming demand for USDC from exchanges and institutional clients, or major players are preparing for substantial market moves. The timing and scale of such mints often provide valuable clues about market sentiment and upcoming liquidity flows. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About USDC Minting? Understanding stablecoin dynamics gives you a crucial edge in crypto markets. When USDC gets minted in such large quantities, it often precedes important market movements. Here’s why this matters for your investment strategy: Market Liquidity Indicator: Large mints suggest increased trading activity is coming Institutional Sentiment: Shows confidence from major players in current market conditions Price Stability Signal: More stablecoins can help absorb market volatility DeFi Activity Predictor: Often precedes increased lending and borrowing in decentralized finance Moreover, the fact that 250 million USDC was minted rather than other stablecoins specifically highlights continued trust in this regulated, transparent stablecoin option. How Does This Massive USDC Mint Affect Crypto Markets? The immediate effect of 250 million USDC being minted creates several potential market impacts. First, it increases the overall supply of stablecoins available for trading, which can provide support for cryptocurrency prices during periods of high volatility. Second, this newly created liquidity often finds its way to exchanges where it can be used to purchase other cryptocurrencies. Historical patterns show that significant stablecoin mints frequently correlate with: Increased trading volume across major exchanges Potential upward pressure on Bitcoin and Ethereum prices Enhanced liquidity in decentralized exchanges More competitive lending rates in DeFi protocols However, it’s crucial to remember that correlation doesn’t equal causation. While the USDC minted event provides valuable data, smart investors consider it alongside other market indicators. What Are the Practical Implications for Everyday Crypto Users? You might wonder how a treasury-level event affects your daily crypto activities. When 250 million USDC is minted , the effects trickle down to regular users in several practical ways. Exchange liquidity improves, meaning you might get better prices when swapping between cryptocurrencies. DeFi platforms often see increased stablecoin deposits, which can lead to more attractive yield opportunities. Additionally, such large-scale mints reinforce USDC’s position in the market, giving users confidence in this stablecoin’s reliability and redemption capabilities. For those using USDC for: Cross-border payments DeFi yield farming Crypto trading pairs Digital dollar savings The knowledge that substantial new USDC was minted provides assurance about the stablecoin’s liquidity and backing. Key Takeaways from the 250 Million USDC Mint The recent event where 250 million USDC was minted serves as a powerful reminder of the growing institutional presence in cryptocurrency markets. This isn’t just about creating digital dollars; it’s about building the financial infrastructure for the next generation of global finance. The scale of this mint demonstrates both the current demand for regulated stablecoins and the anticipated growth in crypto market activity. As you navigate cryptocurrency investments, pay attention to these treasury-level events. They provide windows into institutional behavior that can inform your own strategy. Remember that each time USDC gets minted in substantial amounts, it represents both current market needs and future expectations about cryptocurrency adoption and utilization. Frequently Asked Questions What does “minting USDC” actually mean? Minting USDC means creating new USDC tokens on the blockchain. This happens when regulated institutions deposit U.S. dollars with Circle, and an equivalent amount of USDC is issued on-chain, backed by those dollars. Who benefits when large amounts of USDC are minted? Multiple parties benefit: exchanges gain more trading liquidity, institutional investors get the stablecoins they need for large transactions, DeFi users access more lending/borrowing options, and the entire ecosystem benefits from increased stability. Does minting more USDC affect its price stability? No, USDC maintains its 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar regardless of how much is minted. Each token remains fully backed by cash and short-term U.S. Treasury reserves, ensuring price stability. How often does the USDC Treasury mint large amounts like 250 million? Large mints occur regularly but unpredictably, responding to market demand. While 250 million is substantial, even larger mints have occurred during periods of extreme market activity or institutional adoption. Can regular investors track USDC minting events? Yes, anyone can track these events using blockchain explorers like Etherscan or through alert services like Whale Alert. Monitoring these mints provides valuable insight into market dynamics. Does minting more USDC indicate bullish or bearish market sentiment? It typically indicates anticipated trading activity rather than direct bullish or bearish sentiment. Large mints often precede significant market moves in either direction as institutions position themselves.

While a short-term bounce is playing out, the overall market structure remains uncertain. The price action shows signs of recovery, but there is no confirmed shift in momentum yet. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, ETH is still trading below a significant descending trendline, which has been acting as dynamic resistance over the past few weeks. The asset bounced from the $2,700 support zone but hasn’t yet broken above the wedge or the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, which are converging around the $3,600 mark. A potential bearish crossover between the moving averages is also very likely in the short-term, which could signal a deeper drop in the coming weeks. On the other hand, for buyers to regain control, the price must break above the $3,500-$3,700 supply zone. Yet, everything should begin with a breakout from the falling trendline. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart shows a clearer bounce after a false breakdown below the lower channel boundary around $2,750. The price quickly reclaimed the level, and a short-term uptrend has resumed inside the ascending channel. The price is now testing the same $3,000 level, which has previously triggered the last sell-off. If buyers can flip that zone into support, another bullish leg toward the $3,400–$3,500 zone could be expected. However, failure here would likely drag ETH back toward $2,900 and likely below the channel once more. The RSI is also rising steadily, but not yet overbought. This indicates that momentum is there, but the price will still be vulnerable to resistance zones. On-Chain Analysis Exchange Reserve Ethereum’s exchange reserves continue to drop aggressively, now reaching the lowest levels in years (around 16.2 million ETH). This suggests long-term accumulation and reduced sell-side pressure from holders. Historically, declining exchange reserves are bullish over the medium term, indicating coins are being moved off exchanges and into cold storage. However, price has yet to reflect this, which could imply market participants are still waiting for macro confirmation or external catalysts before buying aggressively. So, while on-chain data supports the long-term bull case, short-term technicals are still fragile.

This substantial creation of stablecoins immediately raises questions about market dynamics and future price action. For investors and traders, understanding why such large mints occur provides crucial insight into institutional behavior and liquidity flows. Why Was 250 Million USDC Minted? The immediate question on everyone’s mind is straightforward: why create so much new stablecoin liquidity? Large-scale USDC minted events typically signal anticipated demand. Institutions or large traders often request these mints to prepare for major transactions, investments, or to provide liquidity for trading platforms. This action suggests confidence in market stability and potential upcoming activity. When the USDC Treasury mints USDC , it converts dollar reserves into digital tokens. This process maintains the 1:1 peg with the US dollar through verified reserves. Therefore, this 250 million injection represents real dollars entering the crypto ecosystem, not just printed digital money. How Does USDC Minting Affect Crypto Markets? The impact of significant stablecoin minting extends across multiple market dimensions. First, it increases available liquidity, making it easier for large players to enter positions without causing extreme price slippage. Second, it often precedes bullish movements, as institutions position themselves for anticipated buying pressure. Consider these key effects when USDC is minted on this scale: Increased Trading Volume: More stablecoins typically lead to higher trading activity across exchanges Reduced Volatility: Ample liquidity helps stabilize prices during large transactions Institutional Signal: Large mints often indicate professional investor interest DeFi Implications: More USDC becomes available for lending, borrowing, and yield farming protocols What Distinguishes This USDC Mint From Others? While stablecoin mints occur regularly, a 250 million transaction deserves particular attention. The timing, market context, and involved entities all provide clues about its purpose. Whale Alert’s reporting brings transparency to these otherwise opaque treasury operations, allowing the community to analyze potential market movements. Previous instances of large USDC minted events have sometimes preceded: Major exchange inflows for institutional clients Preparation for token launches or ICO participation Collateral provisioning for decentralized finance protocols Arbitrage opportunities between different trading venues Practical Insights for Crypto Participants For everyday investors, monitoring USDC minting activity provides valuable market intelligence. While not a direct trading signal, it represents one piece of the broader puzzle. Combined with other on-chain metrics and market sentiment, it helps form a more complete picture of crypto market health. Remember these actionable points: Large mints often indicate institutional rather than retail activity The funds may take days or weeks to fully deploy across markets Not every mint leads to immediate price appreciation—context matters Tracking where the minted USDC flows provides more insight than the mint itself The Bottom Line on Major Stablecoin Mints The recent event where 250 million USDC was minted highlights the growing sophistication of cryptocurrency markets. As stablecoins become increasingly integral to crypto finance, their creation and movement offer transparent windows into market mechanics that traditional finance often keeps hidden. This particular mint suggests robust demand for dollar-pegged digital assets and potentially prepares the ground for significant market activity. Ultimately, while a single data point shouldn’t dictate investment decisions, understanding why USDC gets minted in such quantities helps investors navigate the complex crypto landscape with greater confidence and context. Frequently Asked Questions What does it mean when USDC is minted? When USDC is minted, the issuing company creates new tokens backed by equivalent US dollar reserves. This increases the total supply of USDC in circulation, typically in response to market demand. Who requested this 250 million USDC mint? While Whale Alert reports the transaction, the specific requester isn’t publicly disclosed. It could be an exchange, institutional investor, DeFi protocol, or other large entity needing substantial stablecoin liquidity. Does minting more USDC affect its price stability? No, properly executed mints maintain the 1:1 dollar peg. Each new USDC token should have corresponding dollar reserves, so increased supply doesn’t dilute value if reserve requirements are met. How often do large USDC mints like this occur? Significant mints happen regularly but unpredictably. They correspond with market demand, with frequency increasing during periods of high trading activity or institutional interest. Can retail investors benefit from tracking USDC mints? Yes, as part of broader market analysis. Large mints indicate liquidity movements that might affect trading conditions, though they shouldn’t be used as standalone trading signals. Where does the newly minted USDC typically go first? Initially to the requesting entity’s wallet, then often to exchanges, DeFi protocols, or as collateral for various crypto financial activities.

According to Bloomberg, Ruby said China believes this legal freeze by the Dutch government is pushing the entire industry closer to a production breakdown and undermining global trust in international investment. Ruby took over as board chair in July, just months before the legal crisis began, and she has accused the Dutch state of violating a 2001 bilateral investment treaty with China, and claimed certain Dutch managers inside Nexperia are using the chaos for personal gain. “Each day the dispute continues, the damage to the global industrial chain, international investment confidence and the shareholders deepens,” Ruby said. Dutch court ruling split operations between Netherlands and China This entire battle exploded when a court ruling removed Zhang Xuezheng, Wingtech’s founder, from his position as Nexperia CEO and handed voting rights to court-appointed trustees. After that, Nexperia Netherlands stopped sending wafers to its plant in Guangdong, China, cutting off the flow of core chip materials. In response, Nexperia China completely broke ties with its Dutch headquarters and began searching for local wafer suppliers to stay alive. This has now created two disconnected versions of the same company. The Dutch side controls wafers, while the Chinese side runs finishing plants. But neither can function alone. Ruby said clearly, “It must be stated that the direct and sole cause of the current supply disruption is the unilateral and unexpected halt of wafer supplies by Nexperia’s Dutch entity.” The fallout has already begun. Honda announced it will shut down car production in Japan and China due to shortages. And Nexperia’s largest factory is in China, where the company previously handled around half its pre-crisis output. While Zhang officially stepped down from Wingtech, he was still closely involved and had originally agreed to speak to Bloomberg before Ruby took over the interview. Ruby Yang joined the company back in 2019 and is now leading efforts to take the fight to the Dutch Supreme Court. Ruby also shared that Wingtech sent a notice of dispute on October 15 and could go to international arbitration if the situation isn’t resolved in six months. That legal claim could be worth up to $8 billion, based on Wingtech’s valuation of Nexperia. Dispute over Shanghai plant and pay hikes triggers more accusations Another major issue in the fight is the WingSkySemi project, a wafer plant in Shanghai that was part of Nexperia’s strategic plan since 2020. The facility was funded by WinWorld, Wingtech’s parent company, and Ruby said it had been approved by the same Dutch managers who are now accusing Wingtech of wrongdoing. “Ironically, the Nexperia executives who initially signed that agreement are the very same three individuals who are now accusing Wingtech of misconduct,” Ruby said. She also accused them of hiking their own salaries while holding interim power. Nexperia pushed back hard. A spokesperson for the company said, “We categorically reject Wingtech leadership’s insinuations that the interim management acted for personal gain.” The company also claimed that under Zhang’s leadership, Wingtech inflated orders to the Shanghai plant to prop up its balance sheet, and later tried to fire the same Dutch executives who flagged the issue. Still, the Dutch side said they want both parties to come back to the table. “We do want to take the opportunity here to repeat our call to Nexperia China and Wingtech to come to a constructive collaboration,” the company told Bloomberg. Ruby doesn’t think that’s the plan. She said Nexperia is now expanding finishing operations in Malaysia, and that shows “a clear intent to de-couple from China.” Despite that, Wingtech is still pushing for talks, having invited the court-appointed trustees for discussions, even while it appeals the ruling. And Ruby made it clear they’re not backing off. “We still look forward to leading Nexperia to achieve even greater accomplishments,” she said.

These are not always the loudest or most hyped investments, but the ones quietly positioned at the heart of structural change. Investors are increasingly discussing XRP, worried that many may overlook its long-term implications. This discussion gained renewed visibility after a post by ChartNerd on X highlighted comments from popular XRP commentator and crypto educator Coach JV. According to the post, Coach JV suggested that those who fail to grasp XRP’s broader role within global finance would remember it as the greatest missed investment opportunity of a lifetime. XRP Beyond Price Movements Much of the public debate around cryptocurrencies remains centered on short-term price volatility. However, XRP occupies a different category from many speculative digital assets. It addresses inefficiencies in cross-border payments, offering near-instant settlement, low transaction costs, and scalability suitable for institutional use. $XRP : Popular XRP commentator Coach JV has declared that #XRP could become the greatest missed investment opportunity of this generation. pic.twitter.com/FaYFr06xSf — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) December 22, 2025 These features have kept XRP relevant in discussions around real-world financial infrastructure, even during periods of market uncertainty. Supporters argue that XRP’s value proposition is rooted less in retail speculation and more in its potential utility as a bridge asset for global liquidity. This distinction is a core reason commentators like Coach JV believe the market may be underestimating XRP’s long-term significance. Regulatory Resolution and Market Repositioning A defining chapter in XRP’s history has been its legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That case officially concluded in 2025, with both Ripple and the SEC withdrawing their appeals, bringing years of regulatory uncertainty to an end. The resolution marked a turning point, removing a major barrier that had limited institutional participation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 With legal clarity now established, XRP operates in a regulatory environment that allows banks, payment providers, and asset managers to engage without the overhang of unresolved litigation. Analysts widely view this shift as critical for any digital asset seeking integration into traditional financial systems. Institutional Alignment and Long-Term Adoption Another factor shaping the “missed opportunity” narrative is XRP’s growing alignment with institutional finance. As global markets explore tokenized assets, on-chain settlement, and regulated digital liquidity, XRP’s design increasingly fits these emerging frameworks. Its use in enterprise-grade payment solutions positions it differently from assets driven primarily by narrative cycles. Coach JV’s warning, as shared by ChartNerd, reflects a broader belief that true value recognition may occur only after infrastructure adoption reaches maturity—often long after early skepticism fades. A Lesson Repeated Across Financial History Whether XRP ultimately fulfills these expectations will depend on adoption, execution, and macroeconomic conditions. Still, the argument is less about guaranteed outcomes and more about perspective. Financial history consistently shows that transformative assets are rarely obvious in real time. Investors often miss key insights with XRP, and hindsight reveals they took the biggest risks by missing opportunities.

According to a Bloomberg report, the firm is exploring the launch of a dedicated crypto trading service for its institutional clients. This signals a pivotal moment where traditional finance meets the digital frontier. What Does JPMorgan’s Crypto Trading Plan Involve? The Bloomberg report, citing an unnamed source, indicates JPMorgan is looking at providing both spot and derivatives trading services. This means clients could potentially buy the actual cryptocurrencies or trade contracts based on their future prices. The goal is clear: to expand the bank’s presence and offer sophisticated tools in the booming crypto market. This exploration is not happening in a vacuum. JPMorgan has been building its blockchain and digital asset capabilities for years. Therefore, this potential move into active crypto trading feels like a natural, yet significant, next step. Why Is This News a Game-Changer for Institutions? JPMorgan’s exploration matters because it acts as a powerful stamp of legitimacy. When one of the world’s largest and most regulated banks considers offering crypto trading , it sends a strong signal to other institutional players. Trust and Security: Institutions wary of unregulated exchanges may feel more comfortable trading through a established, trusted bank like JPMorgan. Integrated Services: Clients could manage traditional investments and digital assets within a single, familiar platform. Market Liquidity: Entry by a major player would bring significant capital and deepen the overall market. However, challenges remain. The regulatory environment is still evolving, and banks must navigate complex compliance requirements. The volatility of crypto assets also presents a unique risk management puzzle. How Could This Reshape the Crypto Trading Landscape? The entrance of a titan like JPMorgan would likely accelerate a trend toward professionalization. We might see more structured products, better risk management tools, and increased competition among service providers. This could ultimately benefit all market participants by raising standards. For now, the report suggests JPMorgan is in the exploratory phase. The bank has not made a final decision. Yet, the mere fact that it is seriously considering dedicated crypto trading desks shows how far the asset class has come. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Digital Finance JPMorgan’s potential move is more than just a business expansion; it’s a cultural shift. It represents the accelerating convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). While hurdles exist, the exploration itself underscores a fundamental truth: digital assets are becoming an unavoidable part of the global financial system. The era of institutional crypto trading appears to be dawning. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is JPMorgan definitely launching a crypto trading service? A1: Not yet. The Bloomberg report states the bank is “exploring” or “considering” the launch. This is a planning and feasibility phase, not a confirmed product announcement. Q2: Who would have access to this service? A2: The report specifies “institutional clients.” This typically includes hedge funds, asset managers, pension funds, and other large financial entities, not individual retail investors. Q3: What cryptocurrencies might be offered? A3: The report does not specify. Likely candidates would be major, more established assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) that have clearer regulatory frameworks and higher liquidity. Q4: Why is JPMorgan doing this now? A4> Client demand is a key driver. As institutional interest in crypto grows, banks must adapt to serve their clients’ needs and not lose business to competitors or specialized crypto firms. Q5: Does this mean crypto is now “safe” for big money? A5> “Safe” is relative. It means a major institution believes it can manage the associated risks (volatility, custody, regulation) well enough to offer a professional service. It adds a layer of credibility but does not eliminate the inherent risks of the asset class. Q6: How will this affect crypto prices? A6> In the long term, increased institutional adoption and capital inflow are generally viewed as positive for the market. It can lead to greater stability and higher valuations. Short-term price movements, however, depend on many factors. Found this insight into Wall Street’s crypto moves valuable?

The firm has temporarily paused its Bitcoin purchases and instead funneled a substantial $748 million into its dividend reserve . This decision, reported by The Block, raises crucial questions about market timing, corporate strategy, and the balance between aggressive crypto investment and shareholder returns. Let’s unpack what this strategic shift truly means. What Does a $748 Million Boost to the Dividend Reserve Actually Mean? First, let’s clarify the core action. Strategy has not sold its Bitcoin holdings. Instead, it has chosen to allocate fresh capital—$748 million in cash—specifically to a fund for paying dividends to its shareholders. This dividend reserve is a dedicated pot of money, now totaling a massive $2.19 billion, set aside from the company’s general funds. The timing, just ahead of the Christmas period, is particularly noteworthy. It suggests a deliberate move to shore up financial stability and reward investors with predictable returns, even as it steps back from the volatile crypto acquisition front. Why Pause Bitcoin Purchases Now? This is the million-dollar—or rather, $748 million—question. The decision to halt Bitcoin buys temporarily is a strategic pivot, not a retreat. Several factors could be at play: Market Valuation: The company may view current Bitcoin prices as less attractive for new entry, opting to wait for a more favorable buying opportunity. Capital Allocation: Management is likely prioritizing immediate shareholder value through dividends over further crypto accumulation. Risk Management: Building a robust dividend reserve provides a buffer against market uncertainty, showcasing financial prudence. Regulatory Landscape: Evolving regulations might prompt a period of observation before committing more capital to digital assets. This pause indicates a mature, calculated approach to portfolio management, balancing high-growth potential assets with stable, income-generating strategies. The Bigger Picture: A $2.19 Billion Dividend Reserve With the latest injection, the total dividend reserve swells to $2.19 billion. This is a powerful signal to the market. It demonstrates immense financial strength and a clear commitment to sharing profits directly with investors. For shareholders, a large and growing reserve translates to greater confidence in future dividend payments. It acts as a safety net, ensuring payouts can continue even if corporate earnings face short-term pressure. Therefore, this move strengthens the company’s reputation as a reliable investment, potentially attracting a new class of investors who prioritize income alongside growth. What Are the Actionable Insights for Investors? For anyone watching this space, Strategy’s maneuver offers key lessons. It highlights the importance of dynamic asset allocation. A successful strategy isn’t about blindly buying one asset; it’s about continuously assessing opportunities and risks. The build-up of the dividend reserve shows that even crypto-forward companies see value in traditional financial mechanics to build trust and stability. Investors should look for other firms that demonstrate this kind of balanced, transparent capital management. Conclusion: A Calculated Move in a Dynamic Market Strategy’s decision to bolster its dividend reserve by $748 million while taking a breather from Bitcoin purchases is a masterclass in strategic financial planning. It is not a bearish signal on cryptocurrency but a bullish signal on disciplined corporate governance. The company is effectively telling the market that it can pursue innovative investments while simultaneously securing tangible, near-term rewards for its shareholders. This dual focus on growth and income could very well set a new benchmark for how investment firms navigate the exciting yet unpredictable world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Did Strategy sell its Bitcoin to fund the dividend reserve? No. The reports indicate the $748 million was added from cash holdings, not from selling existing Bitcoin. The Bitcoin treasury remains intact. What is a dividend reserve? A dividend reserve is a separate pool of cash a company sets aside specifically to pay dividends to its shareholders, ensuring it has dedicated funds for these distributions. Will Strategy resume buying Bitcoin? The halt is described as “temporary.” Most analysts believe purchases will likely resume once management identifies more favorable market conditions or completes its current capital allocation phase. How does a large dividend reserve benefit me as a shareholder? A large reserve makes future dividend payments more secure and predictable. It reduces the risk of a dividend cut if the company’s quarterly earnings temporarily dip, providing income stability. Does this mean Strategy is losing faith in Bitcoin? Not necessarily. This is more about tactical capital allocation and shareholder rewards than a long-term belief in Bitcoin. Many sophisticated investors periodically adjust their buying pace based on price and macro conditions. What happens to the $2.19 billion now? The money sits in the dedicated dividend reserve, likely in highly liquid, low-risk instruments. It will be used to fund quarterly or special dividend payments to shareholders as declared by the company’s board. Found this analysis of Strategy’s dividend reserve strategy insightful?

The move is part of a broader regulatory effort to tighten oversight, strengthen consumer protection, and bring order to one of Southeast Asia’s fastest-growing crypto markets. Who Made the Cut? A list of crypto platforms that made the OJK Whitelist The whitelist, released on December 19, 2025, names platforms that have either received full licenses from OJK, referred to as PAKD, or are registered as prospective traders under the CPAKD category while completing their approval process. OJK said the list is intended to serve as an official reference point for users, allowing them to verify whether a crypto platform or application is properly licensed and operating under regulatory supervision before trading. Among the fully licensed platforms are some of Indonesia’s most established crypto exchanges, including Indodax, Pintu, Pluang, Reku, Upbit Indonesia, Stockbit Crypto, Tokocrypto, Triv, Nanovest, Bittime, CoinX, Cyra Exchange, BTSE Indonesia, and Ajaib Kripto. Source: OJK OJK also listed several prospective traders still undergoing the licensing process, including Luno Indonesia, Fasset, Digitalexchange.id, and Crypto Warehouse, which remain under regulatory supervision. Beyond trading platforms, the authority confirmed the core infrastructure supporting the digital asset market. PT Bursa Komoditi Nusantara, operating as CFX, is listed as the licensed digital asset exchange, while PT Kliring Komoditi Indonesia serves as the clearing and settlement institution. Custody services are handled by PT Kustodian Koin Indonesia and PT Tennet Depository Indonesia, which are responsible for safeguarding user assets. OJK Takes the Helm as Indonesia Tightens Control Over Crypto Markets The publication follows the formal transfer of regulatory authority over crypto and digital financial assets from Indonesia’s commodities regulator, Bappebti, to OJK, a shift mandated under Law Number 4 of 2023 on the Development and Strengthening of the Financial Sector. Under the law, all digital financial asset service providers must meet licensing requirements set by OJK or Bank Indonesia , with unlicensed operations subject to criminal penalties, including prison sentences and substantial fines. Indonesia’s crypto regulation transfer to OJK, set for Jan. 12, faces setbacks due to incomplete government frameworks. #Indonesia #CryptoRegulation https://t.co/2V7xIu94eI — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 2, 2025 The regulator warned that platforms operating outside the list are not licensed or supervised and therefore present heightened risks to consumers. It also cautioned against fake links, lookalike domains, and promotions spread through social media or private messaging groups, particularly those framed as educational programs or investment communities that promote unapproved platforms. Indonesia Tightens the Screws on Crypto as Millions of Users Fuel Market Growth The whitelist comes alongside tighter rules under OJK Regulation No. 23/2025, which strengthens oversight of digital financial assets and related derivatives. The regulation bars exchanges from facilitating trades in assets that are not registered or approved and introduces stricter requirements for derivatives trading, including margin mechanisms, segregated funds, and mandatory knowledge tests for users. Indonesia’s regulatory push is unfolding as the country cements its status as a major global crypto market. Chainalysis ranked Indonesia among the world’s top ten for crypto adoption in 2025 and first in Southeast Asia, reflecting tens of millions of users across digital assets and capital markets. The country is home to around 17 million crypto traders and more than 19 million capital market investors, according to recent data.

The hasty move, which bypassed ongoing community discussion, has been condemned as a breach of trust by contributors and token holders who view it as an attempt to control the narrative around who truly owns Aave’s most valuable assets. Ernesto Boado, co-founder of BGD Labs and the proposal’s author, publicly disavowed Aave Labs’ decision to submit his ownership proposal to Snapshot. “ This is not, in ethos, my proposal, ” Boado declared. “ Aave Labs has unilaterally submitted my proposal to vote in a rush, with my name on it, and without notifying me at all. “ He emphasized the action “ breaks all codes of trust with the community ” during what had been a productive forum discussion featuring valuable perspectives from multiple stakeholders. To be very clear: – This is not, in ethos, my proposal. Aave Labs has (for whatever reason) unilaterally submitted my proposal to vote in a rush, with my name on it, and without notifying me at all. If asked, I would not have approved it. – It was not my intention to submit the… https://t.co/JTWoMMNcQc — Ernesto (@eboadom) December 22, 2025 Brand Control Battle Reaches Critical Point The proposal at the center of this dispute seeks to transfer control of Aave’s brand assets, including domains such as aave.com, social media handles, GitHub organizations, and naming rights, from current stewards to the Aave DAO via a legally structured wrapper. Boado’s specification demands that any party currently controlling these assets, explicitly naming Aave Labs and BGD Labs, transfer them to a DAO-controlled vehicle with “ strong anti-capture protections ” and legally enforceable recourse if misused. The proposal emerged after mounting concerns that brand assets are “ being used to enable private monetisation and to support products the DAO has no practical say on, and is not the main value-recipient. “ Recent flashpoints include Aave Labs replacing Paraswap with CowSwap integration, redirecting an estimated $10 million in annual fees from the DAO treasury to private company wallets. Source: X/@aave Additionally, there’s another controversial Horizon market launch that generated approximately $100,000 in revenue while consuming $500,000 in DAO incentives. Marc Zeller of ACI argued the DAO paid “ four times ” for these assets through the original LEND ICO, token dilution to the genesis team, liquidity mining programs, and generous service provider fees. “ It appears to be a clear case that the DAO contributed hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of assets, paid in cash and tokens, making these assets extremely valuable, ” Zeller stated, adding that recent communication channel management under Avara’s stewardship failed to amplify the governance debate while emphasizing “ one-sided attribution ” of Aave’s success. Stani, 1) “5 days is typical” is not the same as “5 days is sufficient” for a high-stakes, off-chain ownership question, especially during the holidays and with unresolved direct questions. Process quality matters more than meeting the minimum timelines in the DAO framework. 2)… — Marc ”七十 Billy” Zeller (@Marczeller) December 22, 2025 Founder Defends Legitimacy Despite Backlash Stani Kulechov, who maintains the title “ CEO of Aave ” despite the DAO structure, defended the rushed vote as procedurally sound. “ The discussion has been going over the past 5 days already with various of opinions and takes, ” Kulechov stated , arguing the Snapshot complies with the governance framework and that “ people are tired of this discussion .” Those who wonder, yes the vote is legitimate – The discussion has been going over the past 5 days already with various of opinions and takes, a timeline set on the ARFC temp check (see more https://t.co/KovomHiB6H ) – The Snapshot is in compliance of the governance framework -… https://t.co/nZoixZvbwl — Stani.eth (@StaniKulechov) December 22, 2025 He claimed other service providers bring proposals to vote outside formal processes, creating no new precedent, while asserting that “ the way to resolve this issue is simply to vote. “ The defense rang hollow for many observers. Crypto educator Duo Nine characterized Kulechov’s actions as showing he’s “ not acting in good faith anymore, too much conflict of interest .” Industry analyst Ignas also drew parallels to Uniswap Labs’ similar equity-token conflicts, which ultimately resolved in favor of token holders through the removal of front-end fees. The clash exposes fundamental tensions in DAO governance when founding teams maintain private companies alongside supposedly decentralized protocols. While Aave Labs draws sharp boundaries between “ protocol ” components governed by the DAO and “ product ” layers it claims ownership over, critics argue this distinction enables value extraction from the brand recognition the community collectively built. https://t.co/6IVI5nykf2 — Ignas | DeFi (@DefiIgnas) December 13, 2025 The controversy erupts despite recent regulatory wins for Aave Labs, including securing MiCA authorization to offer regulated stablecoin ramps across Europe and the SEC dropping its four-year investigation following what the company described as a “ significant ” defense battle. The lab is also preparing for Aave’s upcoming V4 launch, which is explicitly designed to move complexity into abstraction layers where UX control determines value capture. With voting now live despite the author’s objections, the outcome will determine where the community goes from here.

56187207,https://bitzo.com/2025/12/cost-efficient-crypto-pr-how-outset-pr-uses-the-syndication-map-for-maximum-impact,1766416429,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/56187207.jpeg,Cost-Efficient Crypto PR: How Outset PR Uses the Syndication Map for Maximum Impact,https://bitzo.com/2025/12/cost-efficient-crypto-pr-how-outset-pr-uses-the-syndication-map-for-maximum-impact,"Crypto PR often looks inefficient not because media exposure is expensive, but because distribution is poorly measured. Most campaigns are planned around first-order metrics: outlet reputation, estimated traffic, and brand visibility. Syndication — the automatic republication of content across aggregators and secondary media — is usually treated as a side effect. It is reported after publication, if tracked at all. This approach leads to wasted spend, but Outset PR approached this differently. Syndication is part of crypto media infrastructure In crypto media, syndication is standard. Aggregators, RSS feeds, and content mirrors shape how information spreads. A single article can appear across dozens of platforms, or remain confined to one site. The difference lies in where the article is published first. Without data, PR teams cannot assess which outlets trigger secondary coverage and which do not. As a result, campaigns rely on intuition and brand familiarity rather than distribution mechanics. Some high-profile outlets deliver credibility and SEO value, but generate little secondary reach. At the same time, mid-tier or niche publications sometimes act as strong distribution nodes, feeding aggregators and multilingual platforms. When these behaviors are invisible, campaigns include: outlets that look strong but act as dead ends redundant placements that add little incremental reach Cost inefficiency follows from poor visibility, not from media pricing. Outset PR turns syndication into a measurable layer Pioneering a data-driven approach in crypto PR,Outset PR developed the Syndication Map to address this gap. The Syndication Map is an internal analytical system that tracks how crypto articles propagate across aggregators and secondary media. It models the media ecosystem as a graph: media outlets feed into aggregators aggregators redistribute content further each connection reflects an observed probability of pickup The system updates continuously as new campaigns go live. Syndication becomes a measurable planning variable, not a post-campaign observation. What the data shows After tracing hundreds of articles, senior media analyst Maximilian Fondé has noticed clear patterns. Some outlets consistently trigger rapid chains of republication. Others rarely lead to secondary exposure, regardless of story quality. Image is sourced from Outset PR Blog A practical hierarchy becomes visible: Tier-1 outlets provide credibility and long-term SEO, with limited syndication momentum Tier-2 outlets often drive disproportionate reach through aggregators Certain niche outlets act as high-impact nodes despite modest traffic These behaviors repeat across campaigns. Efficiency through forecasting The Syndication Map does not aim to increase the number of placements. It improves placement selection. Campaigns can be built with intent: credibility-driven outlets where trust matters distribution-driven outlets where reach matters fewer low-yield placements overall The same budget produces broader exposure because secondary distribution is planned, not assumed. Traditional PR reports outcomes. The Syndication Map supports forecasting. Before a campaign launches, teams can estimate which outlets are likely to trigger aggregator pick-ups, how far content is likely to travel, and where secondary exposure is expected to come from. This reduces trial-and-error and aligns expectations between teams and clients. Why Syndication Map by Outset PR matters Crypto media relies heavily on aggregation. Ignoring syndication means ignoring how audiences actually encounter content. The Syndication Map reflects this structure. It does not replace editorial judgment or relationships. It provides evidence to support them. Cost-efficient PR does not mean cheaper placements. It means: fewer wasted publications lower cost per real impression decisions based on observed distribution, not assumptions By measuring and modeling syndication, Outset PR improves campaign efficiency at the planning stage and justifies every spent penny.

Crypto natives have endured a topsy-turvy year where many of the promising narratives that got all the hyped ended up leading the group of worst performers, as the only strong performers this year came from the memecoin, privacy, or RWA sectors. DeFAI, DeSci narratives endured a year to forget According to analysts who reviewed the data, the DeFAI narrative is currently down 97% while the DeSci narrative is down 91% alongside categories like GameFi (-85%), Modular blockchains (-92%), and Layer 2s (-81%). According to Web3 analytics platforms, Dexu.ai, the three narratives are also performing poorly in the mindshare category, with DeFAI holding 0.2%, and 0.1% for DeFAI. The mindshare metric tracks how both narratives were being actively discussed. It covers trends across social media, in this case X (formerly Twitter). DeFAI started out as the next big thing in crypto. The underlying projects promised autonomy was coming to the on-chain world, and that it would optimize everything from yields to trading. The projects that emerged raised millions and saw soaring valuations based on visions of AI as a bridge between tradfi and the blockchain. DeSCI followed the same trope; it was hailed as a no-brainer solution to the issues facing the scientific research community. It promised to decentralize funding, facilitate data sharing, and enable transparent, crowd-funded breakthroughs in fields such as biotech and genomics. Many investors fell for the shiny dream, and the beginning of the year saw projects under the narratives pumping massively. There was real-world utility after all. Unfortunately, as the year continued, reality set in. There were macro headwinds to consider, saturation triggered by low-quality launches and grifters, as well as regulatory scrutiny. Also, since the marriage of tradfi and crypto began, execution-oriented themes have taken center stage. People now seem to care more about privacy , high performance, RWAs, and crypto applications like stablecoins and CBDCs. On X, users commenting on the comparison of the narratives that emerged this year and how they are now performing agreed that the year has been brutal. However, they also implied that all the carnage has been necessary to weed out speculative narratives that have nothing to offer the ecosystem in the long run. Which tokens performed well in 2025? There is no doubt that there has been a purge in the ecosystem this year, but not all narratives fall in the DeFAI and DeSci category. There were sectors that delivered well and rewarded investors who were aligned with macro-resilient themes or execution-focused narratives. The top narratives that dominated mindshare on Dexu.ai have been L1s, followed by the tokenless protocols and stablecoins. Curiously, even though it barely got any action this year, NFTs are still ranked high, even beating prediction market narratives and the memecoin narrative. Experts have linked this to major NFT projects getting rebranded as luxury assets or digital identities. Of course, that is only where mindshare is concerned. Where overall YTD growth is concerned, NFTs have performed worse, while memecoins, despite all their bad rep, did better. Memecoins dominated narratives for most of the year, but the RWA sector has emerged as the undisputed leader of all narratives with +178% returns YTD, as investors rotated into tokens backed by real‑world cash flows and tokenized assets. Stablecoins and privacy coins also went up in adoption and posted positive gains, but not as much as RWAs. L1s enjoyed positive growth too, with high-performance L1s like BNB and Hyperliquid helping to increase overall L1 weighting. Unfortunately, chains like Solana, Aptos, and Sui increased the negative weighting as they were affected by broader market pressure. Other narratives that managed positive performance include infrastructure narratives, CEXs, and core DeFi protocols. Experts claim these did well because they are tied to clear fundamentals like real‑world collateral and yield, heavy network usage, fee revenue, deep trading activity, and recurring demand from swaps, lending, and liquid staking. These stats confirm the market has chosen this year’s winners, and most of those overhyped new narratives did not make the cut.

The leading cryptocurrency exchange has agreed to acquire The Clearing Company , a notable startup in the prediction market space. This deal, first reported by The Block, signals a major expansion beyond traditional trading for Coinbase and highlights the growing importance of decentralized forecasting platforms. What Does This Coinbase Acquisition Mean for Prediction Markets? This acquisition is more than a simple corporate purchase. It represents a calculated step by Coinbase to integrate a new class of financial products directly into its massive user platform. The transaction is slated for finalization in January 2026, giving both companies time to align their operations and vision. The core team from The Clearing Company will join Coinbase, bringing their specialized expertise to help build and scale these new services. This move could dramatically increase mainstream access to prediction market tools, which allow users to bet on the outcome of real-world events. Why Are Prediction Markets a Strategic Priority? Prediction markets leverage the “wisdom of the crowd” to forecast events, from election results to product launch dates. For a crypto giant like Coinbase, entering this space offers several compelling advantages: Product Diversification: It moves Coinbase beyond simple asset trading into experiential and informational financial products. Enhanced User Engagement: These markets create new reasons for users to interact with the platform regularly. Data Advantage: The aggregated forecasts become a valuable dataset for insights into market sentiment and trends. Blockchain Synergy: Prediction markets are a natural fit for blockchain technology, ensuring transparency and trust in the settlement process. Therefore, this acquisition is not just about buying a company; it’s about acquiring a new capability that aligns perfectly with the transparent and decentralized ethos of cryptocurrency. What Challenges Could This Expansion Face? While the potential is immense, integrating a prediction market platform into a regulated exchange like Coinbase presents hurdles. The primary challenge will be navigating the complex global regulatory landscape. Prediction markets can sometimes blur the lines with gambling regulations, which vary drastically by country. Coinbase will need to work closely with regulators to define these products clearly. Furthermore, they must ensure robust compliance and risk management frameworks are in place to protect users and maintain the integrity of the markets. Success will depend on their ability to innovate within these regulatory guardrails. How Will This Shape the Future of Crypto? This acquisition is a clear signal of where major crypto institutions believe the industry is heading. It points towards a future where crypto platforms are multifaceted financial hubs. Imagine a single app where you can trade Bitcoin, earn yield on stablecoins, and participate in a global prediction market on tech innovations. This move could catalyze a wave of similar integrations, pushing the entire sector towards more complex and interactive financial ecosystems. The influx of Coinbase’s capital and user base could accelerate innovation and adoption in the prediction market niche faster than anyone anticipated. Conclusion: A Calculated Bet on a Decentralized Future Coinbase’s planned acquisition of The Clearing Company is a strategic masterstroke. It diversifies their revenue, deepens user engagement, and positions them at the forefront of a novel financial primitive. By bringing a prediction market specialist in-house, Coinbase is not just adding a feature—it’s building a new pillar for its business. This deal underscores a broader trend of consolidation and vertical integration within crypto, as leading players race to offer a complete suite of decentralized services. The finalization in 2026 will be a date to watch, potentially marking the beginning of a new era for informed, participatory finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is a prediction market? A: A prediction market is a platform where people can trade contracts based on the outcome of future events. Prices reflect the crowd’s collective probability of an event occurring, making them a powerful forecasting tool. Q: When will the Coinbase and Clearing Company deal close? A: The acquisition is expected to be finalized in January 2026, according to reports. Q: Will The Clearing Company’s platform shut down after the acquisition?

Leveraged Longs Test the Case for a Santa Rally,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/12/why-is-crypto-rising-today-leveraged-longs-test-the-case-for-a-santa-rally,"Crypto markets are showing renewed strength, with total market capitalization climbing back above $3.03 trillion. The move suggests that recent selling pressure is fading, at least in the short term, as traders cautiously re-enter risk positions. The recovery comes after weeks of choppy price action and appears driven by technical positioning. Traders study resistance and support zones to anticipate the next move, just as Outset PR monitors performance metrics of media outlets to align campaigns with market momentum. By tracking these shifts, Outset PR ensures that its stories fit the moment — much like investors searching for the assets that can break out in a cautious market. Bitcoin Leads as Momentum Improves Bitcoin has risen roughly 2% over the past 24 hours, broadly tracking gains across the crypto market. The price has reclaimed its pivot point at $88,421, a level closely watched by short-term traders. Source: coinmarketcap Momentum indicators are showing early signs of improvement. The MACD histogram has turned positive at 162 for the first time in two weeks, suggesting that bearish momentum is weakening. Meanwhile, the relative strength index stands at 50.5, indicating neutral conditions rather than an overbought market. From a technical perspective, Fibonacci retracement levels point to $91,979, the 23.6% retracement, as the next immediate resistance. A clean break above this level would likely attract additional momentum-driven buying. Leverage Builds as Traders Position for Upside One notable feature of the current rebound is the rise in BTC open interest, pointing to growing use of leverage. This suggests that part of the rally is being fueled by leveraged long positions rather than spot-only demand. Source: CryptoQuant Such positioning can accelerate gains if prices continue higher, but it also increases downside risk if momentum stalls. In this context, the market’s next move will depend on whether buyers can push prices through resistance levels without triggering liquidations. How Outset PR Leverages Data-Driven Approach in Crypto PR Outset PR connects market events with meaningful storytelling through a data-driven methodology rarely seen in the crypto communications space. Founded by PR strategist Mike Ermolaev, the agency approaches each campaign like a hands-on workshop—building narratives that align with market momentum instead of relying on generic coverage or templated outreach. Beyond just monitoring on-chain flows, Outset PR monitors the media trendlines and traffic distribution through the lens of its proprietary Outset Data Pulse intelligence to determine when a client’s message will achieve the highest lift. This analysis informs the choice of media outlets, the angle of each pitch, and the timing of publication. A key part of the agency’s workflow comes from its proprietary Syndication Map , an internal analytics system that identifies which publications deliver the strongest downstream syndication across aggregators such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square. Because of this approach, Outset PR campaigns frequently achieve visibility several times higher than their initial placements. Outset PR ensures that each campaign is market-fit and tailored to deliver maximum relevance at the moment the audience is most receptive. Altcoins Lag as Ethereum Struggles While Bitcoin has stabilized, altcoin performance remains uneven. Ethereum is still down 3.21% on a weekly basis, highlighting continued underperformance relative to BTC. For broader market momentum to build, ETH would need to reclaim the $3,100 level. A decisive move above that threshold could signal renewed risk appetite and help lift the wider altcoin market. Outlook: Santa Rally or Leverage Trap? The current move reflects cautious optimism rather than outright bullish conviction. Improving technical signals and rising leverage suggest that a short-term “Santa rally” remains possible, particularly if Bitcoin can clear nearby resistance. At the same time, elevated open interest means the market is more vulnerable to sharp reversals. Whether leveraged longs extend the rally or become a source of volatility will likely be decided by how price reacts at key resistance levels in the days ahead.

Instead, attention has shifted toward non-custodial wagering — a model where users retain control over their funds, avoid intrusive KYC procedures, and interact with platforms built around Web3 principles. As custodial platforms increasingly rely on account verification, withdrawal limits, and internal controls, non-custodial betting has emerged as a clear alternative. This guide explains what non-custodial crypto betting really means, why it matters, and which platforms come closest to delivering that experience. What Is Non-Custodial Crypto Betting? Non-custodial crypto betting means that the user maintains control over their funds, rather than transferring full custody to the platform. Most traditional betting sites — including many that accept cryptocurrencies — operate custodial wallets. Once funds are deposited, the platform controls withdrawals, enforces internal rules, and can restrict access if certain conditions are triggered. Non-custodial wagering aims to minimize this dependency by focusing on: Self-custody or wallet-based access Minimal or no KYC requirements Faster, permissionless withdrawals Greater transparency around bets and payouts While not all platforms claiming to be “decentralized” fully meet these criteria, some are significantly closer to the Web3 ideal than others. Custodial vs Non-Custodial Betting: Why the Difference Matters The difference between custodial and non-custodial platforms is not theoretical — it directly affects the player experience. Custodial betting platforms often involve: Mandatory identity verification before withdrawals Account freezes after large wins or unusual activity Bonus terms that delay or restrict payouts Full reliance on internal systems and discretion Non-custodial or hybrid platforms aim to reduce these risks by design, limiting the operator’s ability to interfere with user funds. Why Players Are Moving Toward Non-Custodial Wagering Several long-term trends have accelerated interest in non-custodial betting: Stricter regulation of centralized betting platforms Expanded KYC and AML requirements Growing awareness of self-custody after CeFi failures Demand for instant access without document checks Increased adoption of DeFi wallets For many bettors, privacy and control are no longer optional — they are expected. How We Evaluated Non-Custodial Crypto Betting Platforms To keep this guide practical and unbiased, platforms were evaluated using the following criteria: How custody of funds is handled Whether KYC is mandatory, optional, or conditional Supported blockchains and cryptocurrencies Deposit and withdrawal speed Sportsbook depth and live betting functionality Transparency, audits, and trust signals Bonus structure and wagering fairness No platform is perfectly decentralized, but some align far more closely with non-custodial principles than others. Best Non-Custodial Cryptocurrency Betting Platforms Dexsport — Best Overall Non-Custodial Betting Platform Dexsport stands out as one of the most crypto-native betting platforms available. Unlike traditional sportsbooks that simply add crypto deposits, Dexsport is built around instant access, multi-chain support, and user control. Players can get started using: A DeFi wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet Email registration Telegram login No KYC is required to place bets or withdraw winnings. Betting Coverage and Markets Dexsport combines a full sportsbook and casino ecosystem, including: Football, MMA, basketball, tennis, and more Over 100 betting markets per match on major events Esports betting on CS2, Dota 2, Valorant, and cyber football Live betting with real-time odds Live streams available even without a deposit This depth allows Dexsport to compete with major centralized sportsbooks while maintaining a privacy-first approach. Bonuses, Cashback, and Player Rewards Dexsport’s reward structure avoids overly restrictive wagering mechanics: Up to 480% across the first three deposits 300 free spins on casino games Sports free bets worth up to 60% of initial deposits Weekly cashback of up to 15%, paid in stablecoins with no wagering requirements Frequent bettors can also access guaranteed monthly free bets through the Dexsport Sports Club. Transparency, Licensing, and Security Trust is reinforced through multiple layers: Operation under a licensed framework A public live bet desk displaying bets and outcomes in real time Independent security audits conducted by CertiK and Pessimistic For players looking for a platform that closely aligns with non-custodial Web3 values while still offering a full-featured sportsbook, Dexsport sets a high standard. Stake — High Liquidity, Custodial Model Stake is one of the most recognizable crypto betting platforms, offering deep sports coverage, competitive odds, and support for numerous cryptocurrencies. However, Stake operates under a fully custodial model. While users can deposit and bet quickly, KYC verification is required for withdrawals. Bonuses also come with relatively high wagering requirements, making the platform less suitable for players prioritizing self-custody and privacy. BetPanda — Anonymous-Friendly Hybrid Platform BetPanda occupies a middle ground between custodial and non-custodial models. In most cases, players can bet anonymously without KYC, though verification may be triggered by large withdrawals or suspicious activity. The platform focuses heavily on casino games, with a smaller sportsbook offering. BetPanda may appeal to users seeking anonymity without fully leaving centralized infrastructure. Vave — Feature-Rich Sportsbook with Conditional KYC Vave delivers a polished betting experience with deep football markets, live betting, cash-out options, and player props. KYC is not required immediately but is enforced once withdrawal thresholds are reached. While fast and well-designed, Vave prioritizes functionality and scale over non-custodial principles. Lucky Block — Token-Based Betting Ecosystem Lucky Block combines casino and sportsbook betting with its proprietary token ecosystem. Wallet-based access allows users to play without traditional sign-ups, and payouts are often processed quickly. That said, mixed user feedback around withdrawals and account restrictions suggests a higher risk profile compared to more transparent platforms. Thunderpick — Best Option for Esports Betting Thunderpick focuses primarily on esports markets such as CS, Dota 2, and Valorant. It supports crypto-only transactions and integrates provably fair mechanics. Esports coverage is strong, but traditional sports markets are more limited, and withdrawals can take longer than on some competitors. Are Non-Custodial Betting Platforms Legal? Legality depends on jurisdiction and platform licensing. Many non-custodial or hybrid platforms operate under international licenses while allowing users to maintain self-custody. Players should be aware that: Regulations vary widely by country Responsibility often shifts more toward the user Tax and compliance obligations still apply Risks and Limitations of Non-Custodial Betting While non-custodial wagering offers clear advantages, it also carries trade-offs: Users are responsible for wallet security Lost private keys cannot be recovered No chargebacks or dispute mediation Smart contract or technical risks Understanding these risks is essential before committing funds. Who Should Choose Non-Custodial Crypto Betting? Non-custodial platforms are best suited for: Privacy-focused users High-volume or professional bettors DeFi-native players Users tired of frozen accounts and delayed withdrawals Final Verdict Most crypto betting platforms still operate under custodial or hybrid models, even if they market themselves as decentralized. Truly non-custodial wagering remains rare. Among available options, Dexsport comes closest to delivering a betting experience aligned with Web3 principles — combining self-custody, no KYC access, transparency, and a full sportsbook ecosystem. Ultimately, the best choice depends on how much control and privacy a user is willing to prioritize over convenience.",More News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-12-22 15:28:42

Odds move quickly, live markets open and close in seconds, and payout speed often matters more than small differences in price. As a result, more bettors are shifting away from traditional bookmakers toward football crypto betting, where transactions and settlements happen without the friction of banks or payment processors. This shift isn’t about novelty. It’s about practicality. For many users, online crypto football betting offers faster execution, fewer restrictions, and greater control over funds — especially during live matches when hesitation costs value. Dexsport is built around this reality, positioning itself as a crypto-first platform focused on live football markets, transparent odds behavior, and predictable payouts. Why Football Bettors Are Moving to Crypto Platforms Traditional bookmakers still operate on models designed years ago. Deposits take time. Withdrawals trigger checks. Successful bettors often encounter limits or account reviews. Crypto platforms approach football betting differently. On many football crypto betting sites , users interact directly with the platform using digital assets rather than bank rails. This changes how betting sessions feel — particularly during high-volume matchdays. The appeal usually comes down to a few core factors: faster deposits and withdrawals fewer interruptions during live betting reduced reliance on geographic or banking restrictions greater transparency around balances and settlements For bettors who follow multiple leagues or place in-play wagers regularly, this structure feels more aligned with how modern football betting actually works. Dexsport’s Approach to Football Crypto Betting Not every crypto platform is optimized for sports betting. Some prioritize casino content, while others offer football markets as a secondary feature with limited depth. Dexsport takes a different route. Football betting is treated as a primary use case, not an add-on. Markets focus on major competitions, with live coverage designed to stay responsive even during peak traffic. What sets Dexsport apart among crypto football betting sites is its emphasis on usability rather than volume. Instead of overwhelming users with obscure markets, the platform concentrates on odds stability, live responsiveness, and payout consistency. This makes it a practical choice for bettors searching for best crypto football betting conditions rather than promotional noise. Dexsport as a Crypto-Native Platform for Football Betting Dexsport wasn’t built as a traditional bookmaker that later added crypto support. From the start, it was designed as a decentralized sportsbook and casino, with football betting forming a central part of its ecosystem. Launched in 2022, the platform focuses on non-custodial betting, transparent settlement logic, and anonymous access. Users can register via email, Telegram, or connect through a DeFi wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet — without submitting identity documents or handing over custody of funds. At a structural level, Dexsport operates as a licensed Web3 betting environment, combining blockchain infrastructure with a sportsbook designed for real-time decision-making. Deposits and withdrawals are handled directly on-chain, removing many of the delays and uncertainties common in traditional systems. Football markets are built around depth rather than breadth. Major domestic leagues, international tournaments, and high-profile competitions receive priority coverage, with more than 100 betting options per match. Live markets remain active during key moments, and odds tend to follow predictable patterns rather than reacting erratically under load. Another notable element is transparency. Dexsport maintains a public live betting desk that displays wagers and outcomes in real time. This allows users to observe settlement behavior directly, rather than relying on opaque internal processes — a feature still rare across crypto sportsbooks. For bettors exploring football crypto betting as a serious alternative rather than an experiment, this structure offers clarity, speed, and control without unnecessary complexity. Live Football Markets on Dexsport Live betting is where crypto platforms either prove their value or expose their weaknesses. Odds change quickly, momentum shifts without warning, and delays can turn a good read into a missed opportunity. Dexsport’s live football markets are built to handle this pace. Instead of suspending markets during key moments, the platform keeps in-play options active and responsive. Bettors can enter or adjust positions while the match unfolds, without waiting for manual approval or balance updates. Live football betting on Dexsport typically includes: real-time odds updates in-play markets tied to match events clear settlement rules once outcomes are decided For users focused on football crypto betting, this structure supports decision-making based on the game itself — not platform limitations. Odds Behavior and Pricing Transparency One common concern with crypto sportsbooks is whether odds behave consistently during live action. On some platforms, pricing becomes erratic under heavy load, or spreads widen without explanation. Dexsport approaches odds management conservatively. Pricing updates follow predictable patterns, and markets don’t shift abruptly without clear match-driven reasons. This makes it easier for bettors to assess value and manage exposure across a matchday. Consistency here matters. Especially for bettors who place multiple wagers or hedge positions, stable odds behavior often outweighs short-term promotional offers. Payouts and Withdrawals in Football Crypto Betting For many bettors, payouts are where traditional bookmakers create the most frustration. Even after a winning match, funds often remain locked while reviews, checks, or manual approvals take place. With football crypto betting, this dynamic changes. On Dexsport, withdrawals are processed directly in cryptocurrency. There are no banking layers, no waiting for business hours, and no dependency on third-party payment processors. Once a bet is settled, access to funds is immediate and predictable. That predictability matters. It allows bettors to reallocate bankrolls quickly, move between live matches without downtime, and avoid uncertainty around payout timing. In practice, payouts feel like part of the betting flow rather than a separate administrative step. Final Thoughts Football betting continues to evolve, and crypto platforms are becoming a central part of that shift. Faster execution, responsive live markets, and direct access to funds are no longer fringe features — they’re expectations. Dexsport reflects this evolution by focusing on football betting mechanics that prioritize speed, clarity, and control.

The push is driven by client requests that picked up pace after Donald Trump returned to the White House in January and installed crypto-friendly regulators and passed new stablecoin rules. Earlier this month, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said U.S. banks are allowed to act as intermediaries in crypto markets. JPMorgan weighs trading products as regulation opens doors According to Bloomberg, if the bank’s clients want size and liquidity, the trading desk could scale, but if not, the project stays on paper. JPMorgan has spent years building blockchain infrastructure while avoiding direct crypto trading, but that line is now blurring, as it recently arranged the creation, distribution, and settlement of a short-term bond for Galaxy Digital Holdings LP on the Solana blockchain. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon once mocked Bitcoin as a “pet rock.” At the bank’s May investor conference, Jamie took a more direct stance on client choice. “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke,” Jamie said. “I defend your right to buy Bitcoin. Go at it.” The comment reflected a policy of access, not endorsement. Meanwhile, JPMorgan’s peer Standard Chartered launched spot Bitcoin and Ether trading for institutions through its UK branch earlier this year. Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, Italy’s largest bank, made its first Bitcoin purchase, spending about €1 million, or $1.2 million, through its own digital trading desk. On Wall Street, Goldman Sachs has been running a crypto derivatives desk for four years now, and BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has $68 billion in its Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, which launched in 2024. Earlier this year, Standard Chartered launched a trading service for institutional clients in spot Bitcoin and Ether through its UK branch, while Italy’s largest banking group, Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, made its first Bitcoin purchase, buying roughly 1 million euros ($1.2 million) worth of the original cryptocurrency through its proprietary digital assets trading desk. Bitcoin ended the year under pressure, falling about 29% from a record $126,251 in early October. At press time, it was trading near $89,285. Outside the U.S., crypto rules already operate in the European Union, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates. In Washington, lawmakers are still working on legislation to set the structure of U.S. crypto markets. Trump has yet to officially sign any bill into law.

That zone has seen multiple reactions and remains a key level to monitor. ETH is still moving higher for now, but the resistance zone may slow momentum. Furthermore, Lennaert Snyder shared two setups based on the current structure. One involves a retest of $3,000 as support before continuation. “The aggressive play is a resistance/support flip of ~$3,000,” he said. “I’m willing to long there if we show a clear reversal after retesting.” He added that a more cautious plan is to wait for the asset to revisit the $2,870 zone. In that case, he would look for a short-term long if the area holds, or consider shorting the move if ETH breaks below $2,970. His view reflects a split approach depending on how the price reacts around current levels. Price Structure Below Key Moving Average Ethereum is still trading below the 200-day EMA, now around $3,400. Analyst Altcoin Sherpa compared the current 30-day range to a longer consolidation phase seen in late 2023. That earlier period lasted over 90 days and followed a similar pattern of slow recovery and low volume. “ Same vibes as before, ” he said, suggesting that ETH may continue to move sideways for now. While the price has recovered from recent lows, ETH remains under the moving average, which still acts as a barrier for longer-term trend shifts. Whale Activity and Network Signals CryptosRUs reported that wallets holding over 10,000 ETH have been adding to their positions since July. They noted that these wallets tend to buy when prices are weaker. “These types of whales don’t usually accumulate during rallies,” they said. Meanwhile, Ali Martinez shared data showing large wallets had offloaded $360 million in ETH over the past week, as previously reported . Their total holdings dropped from 5.73 million tokens to 5.61 million since early October.

Players who once relied on traditional bookmakers are increasingly moving toward live sports betting with crypto, drawn by faster execution, fewer restrictions, and greater control over funds. This shift is especially noticeable across live markets, where timing, liquidity, and payout speed matter just as much as odds. Instead of depositing fiat, waiting for approvals, or dealing with account limits, bettors are choosing platforms built directly on blockchain infrastructure. These platforms allow users to place live bets, manage positions, and withdraw winnings without handing custody of their funds to a centralized operator. Dexsport is one of the platforms built around this idea — offering crypto live betting through a non-custodial, transparent setup designed for modern sports bettors. How Live Crypto Sports Betting Works Without Custody Most traditional sportsbooks operate on a custodial model. Once you deposit funds, the bookmaker controls your balance, withdrawal timing, and often the conditions under which payouts are approved. Many platforms that accept crypto still follow this structure, even if transactions are made in digital assets. Dexsport takes a different approach. Bets are placed using cryptocurrency without requiring users to permanently surrender control of their funds. Deposits and withdrawals are handled directly on-chain, which reduces friction and removes many of the delays associated with bank-based systems. For users engaging in live betting with cryptocurrency, this structure offers clear advantages: Direct crypto deposits and withdrawals without intermediaries Faster settlement for live betsNo reliance on traditional payment processors Greater transparency around balances and outcomes Why Dexsport Fits the Needs of Modern Crypto Sports Bettors Not all crypto sportsbooks are designed with live sports betting in mind. Some platforms focus heavily on casino content, while others offer limited in-play markets with slow updates or restrictive rules. Dexsport is structured around live sports use cases, making it a practical option for bettors looking for a live crypto betting platform rather than promotional gimmicks. Sports markets are prioritized, with coverage centered on popular disciplines and real-time in-play betting. What makes Dexsport stand out among other crypto sports betting platforms is its focus on functionality: Live betting tools designed for fast-moving events Clear rules around odds, payouts, and bonuses Crypto-first infrastructure rather than fiat adaptations A non-custodial approach that gives bettors more control For users who actively manage bets during live sessions, this combination offers a more flexible and reliable experience than traditional sportsbooks. Live Sports Betting Features on Dexsport Live betting puts the highest demands on a sportsbook’s infrastructure. Odds move fast, game dynamics change instantly, and even small delays can turn a solid read into a missed opportunity. Dexsport’s live betting environment is built with this pace in mind. Key advantages of live sports betting on Dexsport include: Real-time odds updates during live events In-play markets across multiple sports and bet types The ability to manage bets using crypto without custody delays Clear and predictable settlement rules once events conclude Instead of freezing markets or slowing updates during high-traffic moments, Dexsport keeps live sports markets active and responsive. Bettors can place in-play wagers, adjust exposure, or lock in outcomes without waiting for manual approval or payment confirmation. For users focused on sports betting with crypto, this structure supports decision-making based on match flow rather than platform limitations. Betting with Crypto on Dexsport : Speed, Control, and Transparency One of the main reasons bettors move away from traditional bookmakers is friction. Deposits take time, withdrawals trigger reviews, and account limits often appear after a few successful bets. Crypto betting removes many of these obstacles — but only when the platform is built around efficiency rather than control. Dexsport approaches crypto sports betting by keeping transactions simple and predictable. Bets are placed directly using cryptocurrency, balances update quickly, and payouts are processed without relying on banks or external payment processors. This reduces interruptions during live sessions and allows bettors to focus on the action rather than account mechanics. In practice, this means faster access to funds once bets settle, fewer delays during active betting periods, and no dependence on banking hours or geographic restrictions. For bettors managing multiple wagers across live events, this level of consistency often matters more than promotional offers or short-term bonuses. How Dexsport Compares to Traditional Sportsbooks Traditional sportsbooks are built around operator-side risk control. Limits, payout delays, and account reviews are part of how these platforms protect their margins. In contrast, modern crypto sportsbooks are designed around flexibility, speed, and direct user access. Dexsport does not attempt to replicate the legacy bookmaker model. Instead, it provides a non-custodial environment for live sports betting with crypto, where execution speed, transparency, and control over funds take priority over rigid account structures and manual oversight. Dexsport vs Traditional Sportsbooks Feature Dexsport (Crypto-Based) Traditional Sportsbooks Fund custody Non-custodial, crypto-based Custodial (operator controls funds) Deposit & withdrawal method Cryptocurrency only Bank cards, transfers, e-wallets Withdrawal speed Near-instant after settlement Hours to days, manual checks Live betting responsiveness Built for in-play markets Often delayed or restricted Account limitations Transparent rules Limits applied after wins Geographic restrictions Minimal Country & banking dependent Payment intermediaries None Banks, processors, compliance layers Betting focus Live sports & crypto efficiency Pre-match & risk-managed flow This structural difference explains why more users now prefer online crypto sports betting platforms when placing live wagers. For bettors who value speed, uninterrupted access, and direct control over their funds, non-custodial crypto betting offers a more efficient alternative to traditional sportsbooks. Bonuses and Incentives in Live Crypto Betting Do bonuses actually matter in live crypto betting?Yes — but only when they stay out of the way. During live sports betting sessions, users aren’t focused on headline percentages or promotional banners. What matters is whether markets remain accessible, odds update without friction, and funds are available immediately after settlement. Many traditional sportsbooks fail here by attaching bonuses to conditions that quietly restrict live markets or introduce limitations mid-session. Dexsport approaches incentives differently. Bonuses are present, but they are designed to operate in the background rather than dictate how users bet. Live markets remain open, bet management stays flexible, and withdrawals follow predictable rules instead of changing based on promotional triggers. Over time, this shifts how incentives are perceived. Instead of shaping behavior or forcing specific betting patterns, they function as incremental value layered onto normal activity. For users who prioritize execution, timing, and control during live betting, that distinction makes bonuses feel supportive rather than restrictive. Final Thoughts Live sports betting with crypto has moved well beyond the experimental stage. For many bettors, it’s now the default choice — not because of trends, but because it removes friction that has long been baked into traditional sportsbooks. Dexsport reflects this shift through its non-custodial structure, responsive live markets, and clear operational rules. By prioritizing speed, access, and user control over restrictive account mechanics, it offers an environment that aligns more closely with how modern bettors actually operate during live events. For those who value flexibility and transparency over rigid systems, this approach increasingly feels less like an alternative — and more like the standard going forward.",More News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-12-22 15:42:18

The deal follows Coinbase’s recent rollout of prediction markets trading for users and shows a commitment to regulated on-chain event-based markets. First we announced prediction markets on Coinbase. Now we’re bringing in the specialized talent to take our plans to the next level. Welcome to Coinbase, @theclearingco . pic.twitter.com/KfRZSp9w9j — Coinbase (@coinbase) December 22, 2025 Coinbase Expands Access to Prediction Markets Last week, Coinbase said it began rolling out access to prediction markets directly on its platform, allowing users to trade on the outcomes of real-world events within the same interface used for crypto, derivatives, and equities trading. The company said the launch marked an important step in broadening the range of asset classes available to its global user base through a regulated venue and familiar trading experience. Prediction markets allow participants to express views on events spanning elections, macroeconomic indicators, sports, and culture by trading outcome-based contracts. Coinbase said it sees strong demand for this category and believes integrating prediction markets alongside existing products could expand user engagement. The Clearing Company Brings Specialized Expertise By acquiring The Clearing Company, Coinbase gains a team with deep experience in building and scaling prediction markets. The startup is led by founder Toni Gemayel, whom Coinbase described as a product and growth leader who helped shape the modern prediction markets sector. Coinbase said the team’s expertise will also help power and scale prediction markets trading on its platform. The acquisition is intended to speed up product development and execution rather than simply adding technology by adding specialized talent directly into Coinbase’s roadmap for event-based markets. Prediction Markets Seen as a Growth Area In the blog post, Coinbase framed prediction markets as a natural extension of its broader strategy to unify multiple asset classes in a single platform. By combining regulated market access with on-chain infrastructure, the company seeks to allow millions of users worldwide to participate in prediction markets seamlessly alongside their existing portfolios. Coinbase stressed that the timing is deliberate, coming as regulatory clarity improves and demand grows for new ways to trade information, risk, and real-world outcomes. The company views prediction markets as complementary to traditional financial instruments rather than a niche product. Building Toward the “Everything Exchange” The acquisition of The Clearing Co aligns with Coinbase’s longer-term vision of building the “Everything Exchange,” a unified destination where users can trade across asset classes. Coinbase said prediction markets fit naturally into this framework, sitting at the intersection of finance, information, and on-chain settlement. By pairing its regulated trading infrastructure with The Clearing Co.’s event-contract expertise, Coinbase believes it is well-positioned to expand prediction markets over time. The company explains it is focused on building the next chapter of its platform by bringing together diverse markets under one compliant, scalable, and user-friendly exchange experience. Prediction Markets Beat Social Media at Finding Truth Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has also defended prediction markets against critics who view betting on real-world events as morally questionable, arguing that these platforms offer superior truth-seeking mechanisms to social media while addressing concerns about their potential to incentivize harm. Writing on Farcaster, Buterin acknowledged prediction markets could theoretically create incentives for harmful actions but dismissed this risk for small-scale markets covering large events. He notes that regular stock markets pose similar concerns, pointing out that political actors could profit from disasters simply by shorting stocks with far higher volumes than those on prediction platforms.

56189732,https://invezz.com/?p=3009417,1766418446,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Bitcoin price reclaims $90K on macro tailwinds, BEAT, MYX, and CRV lead altcoin rally",https://invezz.com/news/2025/12/22/bitcoin-price-reclaims-90k-on-macro-tailwinds-beat-myx-and-crv-lead-altcoin-rally/,"After a turbulent week marked by sharp swings, Bitcoin price gradually edged past the $90K level during the late Asian trading hours on Monday. The total crypto market capitalisation stood at approximately $3.12 trillion at press time, reflecting a 2% rise. While sentiment remained firmly in fear territory, it managed to recover slightly, climbing 5 points from the previous day to reach 25. In line with the modest recovery, many of the top 99 altcoins were also trading in the green during the latter half of the day, while the top gainers notched double-digit gains. Why is Bitcoin price up today? Bitcoin reclaimed the $90K mark after nearly two weeks, aided by a softening dollar index and strength in Asian equity markets. Bitcoin, often labelled as digital gold, rallied alongside Gold today, in response to rising expectations that the US Federal Reserve will continue cutting interest rates in 2026. The Fed has already delivered three back-to-back 25 basis point rate cuts in September, October, and December, bringing its benchmark rate down to a target range of 3.50% to 3.75%. Investors are growing more confident that further cuts could arrive as soon as the January meeting, especially with signs of a weakening labour market and inflation easing to 2.7% in November. At the same time, gains in major tech names like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Samsung Electronics helped calm investor fears of a tech-driven bubble, with both companies rallying on Monday. Adding to the macro backdrop, Hong Kong’s insurance regulator proposed new rules that would allow insurers to invest in assets such as cryptocurrencies and infrastructure. The initiative is designed to steer institutional capital toward sectors prioritised by the government. While it is still early, such regulatory moves are often interpreted by markets as supportive of long-term crypto adoption, especially when they come from major financial hubs. Interestingly, Bitcoin bulls also appeared to buy into the Bank of Japan’s rate hike decision. As widely expected, the BoJ raised its benchmark rate by 0.25%, bringing it to the highest level seen in three decades. While traditionally such moves are bearish for risk assets, this particular hike was fully priced in, with Polymarket data showing 99% odds of it occurring. The Nikkei 225 jumped by over 1%, and the Japanese yen weakened, creating favourable conditions for global risk sentiment. As a result, assets that had dipped ahead of the announcement have started to rebound. Against this backdrop, talk of a potential Santa Claus rally has resurfaced across markets. In crypto, this refers to a period of gains in Bitcoin and other digital assets just ahead of the holiday. Although not guaranteed, traders are latching on to the narrative, particularly after recent dips to monthly lows triggered a fresh round of dip buying across both spot and derivatives markets. A key indicator supporting the price bounce is the continued rise in crypto futures open interest. Total futures interest jumped by 60 basis points on Monday to over $130 billion. Bitcoin’s share rose to $60 billion, while Ethereum climbed to more than $38 billion. Rising open interest signals that traders, particularly bulls, are beginning to reintroduce leverage, potentially adding fuel to the recent momentum. At the same time, short positions have come under pressure. Data showed that short liquidations surged by 146% to $200 million, indicating that many bearish bets were caught offside by the price recovery. The resulting squeeze may have contributed to the sharp push higher. However, a more durable rally would still depend on whether institutional inflows return. Last week marked the first net outflow from digital asset investment products in four weeks, with nearly $952 million withdrawn, according to CoinShares. The current dip in institutional investment signals that the confidence of major investors is still fragile, even in the face of a possible market recovery. Will Bitcoin price go up? According to crypto analyst Captain Faibik, after consolidating between $82,000 and $95,000 since November 22nd, Bitcoin’s price seemed ready to break out from a bullish megaphone pattern. “Longer the consolidation, stronger and bigger the rally that follows,” the analyst noted while sharing the chart below: BTC/USDT 8-hour price chart. Source: Captain Faibik on X. Based on this pattern, Captain Faibik projected a rally towards $120k, if confirmed. Meanwhile, fellow analyst AlphaBTC highlighted the seasonal “Santa Claus rally” narrative, which has re-entered market discussion. From a technical perspective, bulls are likely to first focus on reclaiming the yearly open near $93,300. A sustained move above that level could then shift attention toward the next major resistance band in the $98,000 to $100,000 range. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: AlphaBTC on X. Meanwhile, fellow market pundit Ted Pillows noted that BTC may have formed a bottom following the recent dip, as a 3D bullish divergence is now confirmed. BTC/USDT 3-day price chart. Source: Ted Pillows on X. Based on past trends, every time Bitcoin has formed similar bottoms (as seen twice previously this year), the price has rebounded higher. At press time, one Bitcoin was trading slightly below the $90,000 mark, up over 2% in the past 24 hours. For a bullish scenario to play out, bulls must decisively reclaim the $90k mark. Top altcoin gainers for the day In the past 24 hours, the altcoin market cap rose 6% to $1.42 trillion. Ethereum (ETH), the leading altcoin by market cap, rallied from $2,960 to as high as $3,060 before dropping a little to $3,030 as of press time and holding gains of around 2.5% over the day. Other large-cap altcoins that followed, such as BNB (BNB), XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA), recorded gains ranging between 2-4% respectively. Nearly all of the top 100 cryptocurrencies were trading in the green by late Asian trading hours on Monday. The pack was led by Audiera (BEAT), which clocked double-digit gains of nearly 52% as the protocol continued to burn more tokens and tighten supply. MYX Finance (MYX) and Curve DAO Token (CRV) also rallied 15.8% and 10%, respectively, in tandem with the broader crypto market amid renewed buying interest following recent dips in their prices.

The company recently sold a substantial 24,291 ETH, a transaction primarily aimed at repaying senior convertible notes. However, this isn’t just a simple debt settlement. This major Etherzilla ETH sale signals a profound pivot in the company’s focus toward the burgeoning sector of RWA tokenization . Let’s unpack what this means for the market and why it matters to you. Why Did Etherzilla Sell Such a Large Amount of ETH? The decision by Etherzilla to sell over 24,000 Ethereum tokens wasn’t made lightly. According to reports from Wu Blockchain, the primary driver was to fulfill obligations on senior convertible notes. These are debt instruments that can be converted into equity, and managing this liability strengthens the company’s balance sheet. This strategic Etherzilla ETH sale provides immediate financial clarity and removes a potential overhang on its stock. Therefore, it’s a move that prioritizes long-term stability over holding a volatile asset, even one as prominent as Ethereum. What is RWA Tokenization and Why is it a Game-Changer? So, where is Etherzilla redirecting its focus? The answer lies in Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization. This process involves converting rights to a physical or traditional financial asset—like real estate, treasury bonds, or commodities—into a digital token on a blockchain. Think of it as creating a digital twin of a tangible asset. The benefits are transformative: Increased Liquidity: Illiquid assets like property can be traded in fractions, 24/7. Enhanced Transparency: All transactions are recorded on an immutable ledger. Reduced Costs: It removes many intermediaries from the settlement process. Global Access: Investors worldwide can access markets previously out of reach. By focusing on RWA tokenization , Etherzilla is positioning itself at the intersection of traditional finance and decentralized innovation. How Does This Pivot Reflect Broader Institutional Trends? Etherzilla’s shift is not an isolated event. It mirrors a larger trend where institutional players are moving beyond pure cryptocurrency speculation to build blockchain-based financial infrastructure. The capital from the Etherzilla ETH sale is likely being redeployed to develop or invest in platforms that bridge real-world value onto the chain. This move validates the RWA tokenization thesis, suggesting that established firms see it as a sustainable and scalable business model. Moreover, it indicates a maturation in the crypto narrative, from ‘digital gold’ to a foundational technology for global finance. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities Ahead? While the opportunity is vast, the path forward for Etherzilla and the RWA tokenization sector is not without hurdles. Regulatory frameworks are still evolving, and integrating with legacy financial systems requires significant technical and legal work. However, the potential rewards justify the effort. Success in this space could unlock trillions of dollars in currently illiquid assets. For investors, watching how a publicly-traded entity like Etherzilla navigates this transition offers valuable insights into the sector’s viability and growth trajectory. Conclusion: A Calculated Bet on the Future of Finance Etherzilla’s substantial Etherzilla ETH sale is far more than a portfolio rebalance. It is a decisive, calculated bet on a specific future for blockchain technology. By paying down debt and channeling resources into RWA tokenization , the company is betting that the true value of crypto will be realized not in speculation, but in its ability to reinvent how we own, trade, and manage the world’s assets. This pivot could serve as a blueprint for other institutions seeking tangible utility in the digital asset space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How much ETH did Etherzilla sell exactly? A1: Etherzilla sold 24,291 Ethereum (ETH) in the reported transaction. Q2: What was the main reason for the Etherzilla ETH sale? A2: The primary reason was to repay senior convertible notes, a form of corporate debt, to strengthen the company’s financial position. Q3: What does RWA tokenization mean? A3: RWA tokenization is the process of creating digital tokens on a blockchain that represent ownership of real-world assets like real estate, bonds, or commodities. Q4: Why is Etherzilla focusing on RWA tokenization now? A4: The company likely sees it as a high-growth, sustainable sector that leverages blockchain for real-world utility, moving beyond pure crypto asset investment. Q5: Does selling ETH mean Etherzilla is bearish on Ethereum? A5: Not necessarily. The sale was for a specific corporate purpose (debt repayment). The pivot to RWA tokenization may still involve building on Ethereum or other compatible blockchains. Q6: What is the significance of this move for the crypto industry? A6: It signals institutional interest in applying blockchain for tangible financial use cases, supporting the long-term “utility” narrative over pure trading.

As of December 21, Bitmine reports holdings of 4,066,062 ETH valued at approximately $2,991 per token, alongside 193 Bitcoin and $1.0 billion in cash. Including a $32 million equity stake in Eightco Holdings and other crypto assets classified as “moonshots,” the company’s total crypto, cash, and opportunistic holdings reached $13.2 billion.

Treasury Growth, Institutional Backing, and Market Liquidity Bitmine’s ETH accumulation has accelerated sharply in recent months. According to the company, it added 98,852 ETH in the past week alone, pushing total holdings beyond the 4 million ETH threshold just 5.5 months after initiating its strategy. Fundstrat Chairman Tom Lee said the pace of accumulation reflects Bitmine’s role as a bridge between traditional finance and on-chain infrastructure, particularly as tokenization and decentralized finance gain institutional traction. The company reports that it leads crypto treasury peers both in the velocity of increasing crypto net asset value (NAV) per share and in the trading liquidity of its equity. BMNR stock is now the 66th most traded stock in the United States, with an average daily trading volume of $1.7 billion over the past five days, ranking just behind Wells Fargo and ahead of Chevron among more than 5,700 listed U.S. equities. Bitmine remains backed by a prominent group of institutional and strategic investors, including ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood, Founders Fund, Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital, Digital Currency Group (DCG), Kraken, Bill Miller III, MOZAYYX, and personal investor Thomas “Tom” Lee. Upcoming Shareholder Meeting Bitmine ranks as the number one Ethereum treasury globally and the second-largest crypto treasury overall, behind Strategy Inc., which holds more than 671,000 Bitcoin. Beyond accumulation, Bitmine is advancing its “Made in America Validator Network” (MAVAN), a secure staking infrastructure platform expected to launch in early 2026. The company will hold its annual stockholders meeting at the Wynn Las Vegas on January 15, 2026, inviting shareholders to attend in person as it outlines the next phase of its ETH-centric strategy amid what it describes as a transformational regulatory moment for U.S. financial markets.

A single DeFi altcoin is on the verge of that transition with the potential to attract interest currently. It is all about structure, progress and timing before a certain Q4 milestone can be achieved. The Vision of What Mutuum Finance is Developing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a lending and borrowing protocol that is intended to be used in real on-chain use. The platform enables pooled lending and direct peer lending. In pooled markets, assets are deposited by the users in common liquidity pools. They, in turn, are given mtTokens, which are proportions in the pool and expand when interests are paid to the borrowers. As an illustration, ETH deposit produces mtETH that also increases as loans are repaid. The peer lending side enables the user to give straight to a borrower on precise terms of the loan. Borrowers have the option of fixed or variable rates and the lenders according to risk and duration. The system contains loan to value limits and liquidations as a way of controlling downside risk. As of official updates, in Q4 2025, Mutuum Finance will launch its V1 on Sepolia testnet. Meanwhile, Halbon Security will be examining the lending agreements and borrowing agreements. The code is still closed and it is in the process of formal analysis and this is an indication that the development is at its final phase. Protocol Performance There is increased interactivity around MUTM. The project has collected approximately 19.4M and increased to over 18,600 holders. These numbers are important as they indicate pre adoption pre protocol being alive. This is a step that many new crypto launches tend to come before more significant exposure. MUTM token was initially priced or exchanged at $0.01 but the token is presently trading at $0.035. That is 250% higher than at the beginning of 2025. This increase in prices is more of gradual increase in stages than sharp increase. To most investors, this is an indication of moderate growth rather than any speculative booms. Token Supply and Distribution There are 4B tokens that are fixed in MUTM. Out of this amount, 45.5% are given to early distribution which equates to approximately 1.82B tokens. Approximately 820M tokens were sold. The smaller is the supply left when an increasing number of tokens enter the circulation. This often changes behavior. Both buyers and sellers become more selective with buyers shifting away to taking action. Another element that contributes to the interest is the 24 hour leaderboard that rewards high contributors each day with MUTM tokens. Card payments have reduced barriers as well and thus it is easy to participate by more audience. The value of DeFi crypto has security as a major factor. MUTM has a CertiK token scan score of 90 out of 100, which belongs to the contract composition and risk controls. Simultaneously, Halbon Security is taking a complete audit of the core contracts. To promote outside testing, Mutuum Finance has also declared a bounty payment of 50k to anyone willing to test it. Such actions decrease the doubts in the future of V1 and may make such decisions the focus of more conservative investors. The Reason Why Timing is Producing Urgency Phase 6 is now nearly selling out and there is recent activity which indicates bigger allocations to the market. The latest whale fund of whale at $100k has raised debate about supply reduction. The entry of the large buyers in the late stages is usually an indication that they are confident in the next transition. This is the place the Mutuum Finance is at as Q4 approaches because development, security, and participation intersect. At this point, price discovery can oftentimes be for investors seeking the potential most appropriate crypto to purchase now or a cheapest cryptocurrency with meaningful use may commence.

OpenAI’s flagship AI chatbot has fundamentally changed how people write, code, research, and create content. As we move through 2025, ChatGPT faces intense competition from Chinese rivals like DeepSeek while navigating legal challenges, expanding enterprise adoption, and pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve. This comprehensive guide explores everything you need to know about ChatGPT’s journey, capabilities, and future direction. What is ChatGPT and How Does This AI Chatbot Work? ChatGPT is a general-purpose AI chatbot developed by OpenAI that uses artificial intelligence to generate human-like text responses based on user prompts. At its core, ChatGPT operates on large language models (LLMs) that have been trained on vast amounts of text data, allowing it to understand context, follow instructions, and produce coherent responses across countless topics. The system works by predicting the most likely next word in a sequence, but at such a sophisticated level that it can write essays, debug code, analyze data, and engage in meaningful conversations. The technology behind ChatGPT has evolved significantly since its initial release. The current default model is GPT-4o, which introduced multimodal capabilities including voice interaction and image generation. However, OpenAI continues to develop more advanced models, with GPT-5 representing the next major leap forward in AI capabilities. OpenAI’s Journey: From Startup to AI Powerhouse OpenAI’s trajectory has been nothing short of remarkable. Founded as a non-profit research laboratory, the company has transformed into one of the most influential AI organizations globally. The journey has been marked by several key milestones: November 2022: ChatGPT launches publicly, quickly gaining millions of users 2023: Mobile app launch and enterprise adoption begins 2024: Partnership with Apple for Apple Intelligence, release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, launch of Sora text-to-video model 2025: Reaches 300 million weekly active users, faces increasing competition and legal challenges Throughout this period, OpenAI has navigated internal drama, including the departure of key executives like co-founder Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati, while simultaneously expanding its product offerings and user base. GPT-5: The Next Generation of AI Capabilities In August 2025, OpenAI unveiled GPT-5, representing a significant advancement in AI technology. Unlike previous models, GPT-5 is designed as a “one-size-fits-all” AI that can handle complex tasks like coding applications, managing calendars, and creating research briefs. The model automatically determines the fastest or most thoughtful approach to answering questions, offering users three distinct modes: Mode Best For Response Time Auto General everyday use Balanced speed and depth Fast Quick answers and simple tasks Immediate responses Thinking Complex reasoning and analysis Slower, more deliberate Despite the launch of GPT-5, OpenAI continues to offer legacy models including GPT-4o and GPT-4.1, recognizing that different users have varying needs and preferences. The company has also introduced more affordable subscription plans like ChatGPT Go, priced under $5 in markets like India and Indonesia, to expand accessibility. Sora: OpenAI’s Groundbreaking Text-to-Video Technology One of OpenAI’s most ambitious projects is Sora, a text-to-video model that can generate realistic video content from simple text descriptions. The technology represents a significant leap forward in generative AI capabilities, though it has also raised important questions about copyright and content creation. In a landmark partnership, Disney invested $1 billion in OpenAI and granted exclusive rights to use over 200 Disney characters in Sora-generated videos for one year. This collaboration allows users to create AI videos featuring characters from Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and Star Wars, while giving Disney an opportunity to explore AI technology while protecting its intellectual property. However, Sora has faced legal challenges, including a trademark lawsuit from the video app Cameo that temporarily prevented OpenAI from using “cameo” for Sora features. These legal battles highlight the complex landscape AI companies must navigate as they develop increasingly sophisticated content generation tools. Enterprise Adoption and Business Applications ChatGPT’s growth in the enterprise sector has been explosive. By November 2025, OpenAI announced that over 1 million businesses globally were using its products, making it the fastest-growing business platform in history. Companies across industries including finance, healthcare, and retail have integrated ChatGPT into their operations: Morgan Stanley: Using ChatGPT for financial analysis and client communications Target: Implementing AI for inventory management and customer service Booking.com: Leveraging ChatGPT for travel recommendations and booking automation Cisco: Utilizing AI for network optimization and technical support OpenAI has made significant pushes into government sectors as well, offering ChatGPT Enterprise to federal agencies for just $1 for the first year. This strategic move follows the U.S. General Services Administration adding OpenAI to its approved AI vendor list, enabling easier adoption by government organizations. Safety Concerns and Ethical Challenges As ChatGPT’s user base has grown, so have concerns about safety and ethical implications. Several lawsuits have emerged alleging that ChatGPT contributed to mental health crises, including cases where the AI was accused of encouraging suicidal thoughts. In response, OpenAI has implemented several safety measures: Enhanced mental health safeguards: Consulting with over 170 mental health experts to improve responses to sensitive conversations Parental controls: Features allowing parents to monitor and restrict their children’s ChatGPT usage Age verification: Stronger protections for users under 18, including blocking flirtatious exchanges Content moderation: Updated guidelines to prevent the generation of harmful or inappropriate content OpenAI has also faced copyright infringement lawsuits from media organizations and music industry representatives. A Munich court ruled that ChatGPT violated German copyright law by reproducing protected song lyrics, setting a potential precedent for how AI systems handle copyrighted material in Europe. Competitive Landscape and Market Position Despite its dominant position, ChatGPT faces increasing competition from multiple fronts. Google’s Gemini models, Anthropic’s Claude, and Chinese competitors like DeepSeek have all made significant advancements in AI capabilities. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman declared a “code red” internally, refocusing the company’s efforts on improving ChatGPT as competitive pressure mounts. The competition extends beyond just model capabilities to pricing and accessibility. Google has introduced competitive pricing plans in key markets, while open-source alternatives have gained traction among developers seeking more control and transparency. OpenAI has responded by expanding its affordable ChatGPT Go plan to 16 additional Asian countries and introducing more flexible pricing options for different user segments. Future Developments and Roadmap Looking ahead, OpenAI has several ambitious projects in development: AI-powered shopping: Partnerships with Walmart, Etsy, and Shopify to enable direct purchases through ChatGPT Health applications: Exploring consumer health tools like personal health assistants and medical data aggregators Music generation: Developing AI that can create music from text and audio prompts Social media platform: Early development of a social network to compete with platforms like X and Threads Open-source initiatives: Planning to release open-weight language models for broader community access The company is also working on improving ChatGPT’s personalization capabilities, with CEO Sam Altman expressing interest in making the AI more attuned to individual users’ needs and preferences.

SPX6900 (SPX) functions primarily on the Ethereum network. The token was created as a meme to entertain wider audiences. It has no real connection with stock market, equities, or securities. The meme coin generates interest through spot trading, market speculation, or perpetual and leveraged trading on different decentralized exchanges; the latter is not recommended for non-professionals due to its high risk and highly volatile nature. SPX6900 is traded on different centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges. The most popular centralized exchange for trading SPX tokens is Bybit, which has the highest trading volume for this meme coin. SPX6900 (SPX) can be stored in various wallets, including Trust Wallet, Bitget Wallet, and hardware wallets like Ledger. It can also be stored on a centralized exchange like KuCoin and another option could be Kraken, providing easy access to the coin. Early users attest to its credibility and remarkable price performance; however, the meme token still holds the interest of many investors with a daily trading volume in millions and a current circulating supply of 930.99 million SPX, which is also its total supply, although its max supply will be 1 billion tokens. Starting as a non-serious venture, the coin established itself as one of the most high-ranking coins of the year 2024. It was initiated as a useless token but ultimately ended up earning profits in the millions. For example, over a month, SPX earned up to a 9000% return following its ascent through September 2024.

This Will Be Huge,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-to-xrp-holders-i-was-wrong-this-will-be-huge/,"In the fast‑evolving world of blockchain, some developments defy early skepticism and reshape market expectations. That shift recently unfolded in the XRP ecosystem, as a vocal crypto commentator publicly reversed his stance on a major XRP Ledger upgrade . What once seemed ill‑fated suddenly emerged as a potential turning point for institutional adoption and real‑world financial integration. Jungle Inc Crypto News first highlighted this dramatic turnaround, emphasizing how a new institutional‑grade financial infrastructure on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is gaining traction. The pundit initially dismissed these advancements as impractical. Now, he believes they could catalyze deep engagement from banks, asset managers, and global enterprises. Institutional Lending Protocols on XRPL A core factor in the sentiment shift is XRPL’s movement toward native institutional lending. The network is introducing a protocol‑level lending system, designed to meet regulatory standards and the credit needs of institutions. Unlike typical DeFi models that rely on pooled, volatile assets, XRPL’s framework enables fixed‑rate, credit‑oriented lending with off‑chain underwriting. This model aligns closely with traditional finance workflows, making it more appealing to risk‑averse entities. Ripple XRP: I was wrong… This Will be HUGE !! https://t.co/PvuJfWLd8o via @YouTube — Jungle Inc Crypto News (@jungleincxrp) December 21, 2025 This lending evolution, anchored in amendments like XLS‑65 and XLS‑66, signifies XRPL’s transition from simple settlement rails to compliant on-house credit markets. Institutional players can now issue loans, allocate collateral, and manage risk directly on-chain. Real‑World Asset Tokenization In parallel to lending, XRPL has also strengthened its real‑world asset (RWA) tokenization capabilities. Partnerships such as the one with Ondo Finance have brought OU​​SG tokenized U.S. Treasuries to XRPL , accessible 24/7 via RLUSD, Ripple’s enterprise‑grade stablecoin. These tokenized assets create low‑risk, high‑liquidity instruments that appeal to institutional capital seeking regulated, on-chain investment options. The success of OUSG — with hundreds of millions in total value locked — underscores the magnitude of XRPL’s institutional appeal. These on-chain treasuries compete with similar products from financial giants and help position XRPL as a multifunctional hub for real‑world finance. Payments and On‑Demand Liquidity Ripple’s On‑Demand Liquidity (ODL) service continues to validate XRP’s fundamental utility. In 2024, ODL processed over $15 billion in cross‑border payments, a 32 percent year‑over‑year increase. This sustained growth highlights how XRP and RippleNet operate beyond price speculation, rooting demand in real transaction flows. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 ODL’s expansion across global corridors reinforces the narrative that utility use cases like payments and settlement form the foundation of XRP’s long‑term value, especially in enterprise contexts where cost, speed, and compliance matter. Stablecoins and Cross‑Chain Integration RLUSD — Ripple’s dollar‑pegged stablecoin — plays a pivotal role in XRPL’s institutional story. It bridges traditional finance and digital rails by enabling compliant 24/7 minting and redemption of tokenized assets. Recent developments show RLUSD’s integration across multiple blockchains and strategic partnerships with major financial platforms, increasing XRPL’s liquidity and market reach. This interoperability amplifies XRPL’s utility, as institutions can move value seamlessly across ecosystems while maintaining regulatory standards. Shifting Narratives: Utility Over Hype The commentator’s journey from skepticism to endorsement mirrors a larger theme in crypto today: utility outweighs speculative narratives. While XRP ETF inflows have garnered attention, institutional infrastructure and real‑world utility are the pillars likely to sustain enduring growth. With native lending, tokenization, and compliant financial primitives, XRPL’s evolution signals a maturation that could attract the very capital traditional DeFi has long sought. By embracing these advancements, XRP holders and market observers may be witnessing a structural shift toward institutional adoption and financial integration that extends far beyond price cycles and short‑term hype.

This aggressive action follows the project’s rebranding from MakerDAO and signals a powerful commitment to its new economic model. For investors and DeFi enthusiasts, this isn’t just another token burn—it’s a strategic play with significant implications for token value and ecosystem health. What Does This Sky Protocol Buyback Actually Mean? The numbers tell a compelling story. Sky Protocol spent 1.9 million USDS to acquire those 32.3 million SKY tokens over seven days. To put this in perspective, that’s like a company buying back a substantial chunk of its own stock at market price. Since the buyback program launched in February 2025, the protocol has deployed over $94 million toward this singular goal. This consistent buying pressure creates several important effects: Reduced circulating supply – Fewer tokens available means each remaining token represents a larger share of the ecosystem Increased scarcity – Basic economics suggests reduced supply with steady demand supports higher prices Protocol confidence – The team is putting substantial capital behind their own token Why Would a Protocol Execute Such Aggressive Buybacks? Understanding the Sky Protocol buyback strategy requires looking beyond surface numbers. Token buybacks serve multiple purposes in the cryptocurrency world, particularly for rebranded projects establishing new identities. First, they demonstrate fiscal responsibility by returning value to token holders. Second, they help stabilize token prices during market volatility. Third, and perhaps most importantly, they align the protocol’s financial interests directly with token success. Since transitioning from MakerDAO, Sky Protocol has been building a distinct identity within the decentralized finance space. This buyback program represents more than just token management—it’s a statement of long-term vision. The protocol is essentially saying, “We believe in our token’s future value enough to invest millions in acquiring it.” How Does This Sky Protocol Buyback Affect Investors? For current SKY token holders, this development brings both immediate and long-term considerations. The reduced supply creates natural upward pressure on token value, assuming demand remains constant or increases. However, investors should also consider: Token utility – What functions do remaining SKY tokens serve within the ecosystem? Future plans – Will buybacks continue at this pace, or will the strategy evolve? Market conditions – How does this move position Sky Protocol against competing DeFi projects? The Sky Protocol buyback represents a significant vote of confidence, but savvy investors will look deeper at the protocol’s roadmap and overall tokenomics. A buyback alone doesn’t guarantee success—it must be part of a comprehensive strategy that includes development progress, community growth, and real-world utility. The Bigger Picture: Tokenomics in the Modern Crypto Era Sky Protocol’s approach reflects a broader trend in cryptocurrency projects moving toward more sophisticated economic models. Gone are the days of simple token launches without clear value accrual mechanisms. Today’s successful protocols understand that sustainable tokenomics require multiple value drivers: Clear utility within the ecosystem Balanced emission and distribution schedules Strategic treasury management Community alignment mechanisms This Sky Protocol buyback fits neatly into this modern framework. By actively managing token supply, the protocol creates a deflationary effect that benefits long-term holders. Meanwhile, the substantial financial commitment demonstrates serious treasury management—a crucial factor for institutional and retail investors alike. Conclusion: A Strategic Move With Ripple Effects Sky Protocol’s removal of 32.3 million SKY tokens from circulation represents more than just a number on a spreadsheet. It’s a strategic declaration that will ripple through the DeFi ecosystem. This buyback strengthens token economics, demonstrates protocol confidence, and sets a precedent for how rebranded projects can establish new value propositions. As the cryptocurrency space continues maturing, expect to see more protocols adopting similar sophisticated treasury management strategies. Frequently Asked Questions What is a token buyback in cryptocurrency? A token buyback occurs when a blockchain project uses its treasury funds to purchase its own tokens from the open market, typically reducing circulating supply and potentially increasing token value. How does the Sky Protocol buyback benefit token holders? By reducing circulating supply, the buyback increases scarcity of remaining SKY tokens. This can support higher prices if demand remains constant, and demonstrates the protocol’s commitment to token value. Where does Sky Protocol get the funds for buybacks? Protocols typically fund buybacks through treasury reserves accumulated from various sources including protocol fees, initial funding rounds, or revenue generated by the ecosystem. Will Sky Protocol continue buying back tokens? While the protocol has spent $94 million since February 2025, future buyback decisions will likely depend on treasury health, market conditions, and strategic priorities outlined in their roadmap. How does this affect Sky Protocol’s relationship with MakerDAO? As a rebranded project, Sky Protocol is establishing its independent identity and economic model. This buyback program represents part of that distinct strategic direction. Should I buy SKY tokens because of the buyback? Investment decisions should consider multiple factors beyond buybacks, including the protocol’s technology, roadmap, team, and overall market conditions. Buybacks are one positive signal among many to evaluate. Found this analysis of the Sky Protocol buyback insightful?

The timing lined up perfectly with President Donald Trump signing the GENIUS Act, a law that outlines rules for asset-backed digital tokens like USDC. The bill handed stablecoin firms legal clarity, giving Circle a major tailwind. Circle’s main income source is interest on short-term U.S. Treasuries that back USDC. And that model paid off. In Q3, the firm posted $740 million in revenue and reserve income, up 66% year-over-year. Net income spiked 202% compared to last year. But that didn’t stop the stock from falling. Shares are down 57% in the last six months, dragged by crypto’s slump. Jeremy says that’s a mistake. Circle, he argued, isn’t a crypto company. “We don’t fit in any particular box,” he said . Despite the dip, Wall Street is holding the line. Most analysts still rate Circle a Buy, according to Yahoo Finance. JPMorgan analyst Ken Worthington wrote, “Stablecoins are continuing to make their way into mainstream financial services, with USDC a leading stablecoin and Circle a leading partner.” He added that Circle is moving more USDC onto its own platform, giving it more control and more room to grow. Jeremy’s bigger bet is on Arc, Circle’s new Layer 1 blockchain. The company launched it this fall to handle on-chain economic activity faster and at scale. The project already has big-name partners: BlackRock, Visa, and Amazon Web Services. In December, Circle also signed a multiyear deal with Intuit, the maker of TurboTax. That deal brings USDC into the hands of millions of American taxpayers and small business owners. Payment cards and settlement rails shift toward stablecoins While Jeremy is pushing tokenized dollars into global finance, others are following close behind. Payment companies are racing to launch stablecoin-linked cards. These let users spend USDC or other tokens like regular dollars. The merchant still gets paid in local currency. But underneath, everything moves via blockchain. Cross River Bank and Highnote are now rolling out cards that settle using stablecoins. According to Highnote’s Cosentino, this tech is what younger startups want. “Long term, stablecoins will become a critical rail,” he said. “A no-brainer capability that will be increasingly adopted.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The way people transfer value is undergoing a major upgrade, and this is no minor patch. Stablecoins, programmable assets, smart contracts and on-chain services have created new rails that can settle transfers in seconds with full transparency. Every part of the process is becoming more efficient, more reactive and better connected to the tools people already use. Stablecoins process transactions at a scale that dwarfs legacy platforms. Payment systems are gaining new tools that work around outdated banking software, with builders rethinking how finance and services communicate across borders. The shift is no longer experimental. It is functional, visible and supported by large institutions and startups alike. Stablecoins Are Leading the Way Stablecoins now support a global payment volume that stood at 46 trillion dollars in 2025. This figure places them well ahead of PayPal and even Visa, bringing them close to the scale of the ACH system in the United States. Stablecoins enable users to send digital dollars in under a second for less than a cent in fees. The real change lies in how people connect stablecoins to traditional payment systems. A new wave of on and offramps is taking care of that challenge. Some services use cryptographic proofs to let people privately swap stablecoins with local currencies. Others rely on QR codes and regional payment rails to allow instant transfers between bank accounts and digital wallets. Some platforms now offer card issuance and merchant tools that support stablecoin spending. Stablecoins are no longer limited to trading or holding value. Workers receive payments across borders without friction. Merchants accept digital dollars without bank involvement. Apps settle transactions instantly with users around the world. Real-World Assets Take on a Crypto Form Financial institutions have shown growing interest in putting traditional assets such as US equities, commodities and market indices on-chain. This process is often called tokenisation. However, there is a stronger shift taking place towards creating synthetic on-chain instruments that reflect the value of real-world assets without simply copying their structure. Perpetual futures have emerged as a prime example. These instruments offer deep liquidity, leverage and efficient implementation. Some analysts now point to emerging market equities as a particularly strong use case for onchain perps. The popularity of zero-days-to-expiration options in traditional finance proves that traders often prefer liquidity and flexibility over owning the underlying asset. In parallel, stablecoins continue to evolve. Their use as narrow banking vehicles is giving way to deeper financial roles. A new group of protocols and asset managers now originate loans directly on-chain, rather than issuing loans off-chain and simply wrapping them in a token. This cuts costs, removes paperwork, and allows broader participation. Online Services Are Becoming Their Own Banks Online services are increasingly managing money flows in ways that resemble financial institutions. Streaming platforms coordinate subscriptions and creator payouts, while transport and delivery apps handle fares, tips, and cross-border settlements within their own systems. Cloud software providers manage renewals, bundled payments, and access rights through integrated billing layers. These platforms hold balances, trigger transfers, and apply rules automatically, creating self-contained financial environments. The gambling industry offers one of the clearest illustrations of this shift. In this sector, the iGaming model relies heavily on APIs that combine multiple services into a single operational structure. These API solutions connect operators with game studios, payment processors, and data and verification services. This architecture allows online casino sites to provide extensive game libraries, smoother payment flows, and access to generous bonuses and tournaments through a single unified system. When a single industry achieves this level of integration between content, payments, and user accounts, it influences expectations elsewhere, encouraging similar structures across other digital sectors. Smart Contracts Make Payments Reactive Smart contracts already allow value to be transferred globally with little delay. What’s new in 2026 is how programmable these payments have become. Protocols like x402 now enable autonomous agents to settle value without batching or invoicing. For instance, agents can pay one another in real time for data access, GPU cycles or API calls. This is a change from how payments worked before. Instead of being a separate step after an action, payment becomes part of the action itself. Developers now ship software that contains its own payment logic. Services execute and settle in one move. There are also prediction markets that respond to events in real time, with automated trading and instant payout. With these mechanics in place, banks start to operate as part of the web’s plumbing. Assets become pieces of infrastructure. Money begins to move like packets of data, routed by protocol instead of intermediaries. In that model, the internet takes on the structure of a financial system. Upgrading the Bank Ledger Through Stablecoins Most banking software in use today was designed decades ago. Core banking systems still run on mainframes, with COBOL code and batch file transfers. This setup limits how fast banks can add real-time payments, launch new products or serve new types of users. Stablecoins offer a way to modernise banking without ripping out the old systems. Banks and fintech companies can now issue tokenised deposits, treasuries and bonds using stablecoin frameworks. These tools allow them to serve new use cases while keeping the underlying systems intact. The stablecoin becomes a bridge between legacy infrastructure and new financial models. TradFi institutions have leaned into stablecoins heavily in 2026. These digital assets help institutions operate across borders, serve new client bases and integrate with decentralised platforms. The ledger becomes an interface, not a bottleneck. Privacy Chains Create Lock-In for Payments While most public chains expose transaction data, privacy-focused blockchains build in confidentiality from the start. This makes a big difference when payments involve sensitive use cases or business operations. Private chains do not rely on bridging tokens between networks. Secrets are much harder to move. Any attempt to switch between privacy systems can leak metadata like transaction size or timing. Because of this, users stay in the network they choose. Chains that support privacy create much stronger incentives to stay. They offer protection by design, which becomes more valuable as other chains standardise and compete on price. As stablecoins and programmable assets move toward higher-value uses, privacy becomes a default expectation. Blockchain Reshapes Research and Information Flows AI tools now perform research, generate content and test scientific ideas. These agents often rely on access to information drawn from the web. However, they skip past ad models, which support content creators , while extracting value from the content itself. To solve this, developers are adding automatic attribution and real-time compensation systems. These tools reward sources based on how much value they contribute to an AI’s output. Blockchain enables this by tracking which data was used, under what context, and with what outcome. This process turns information into a trackable resource. Micro-payments can be used to distribute value fairly across all contributors. This opens new ways to support writers, researchers and analysts without relying on sponsorships or platform rules. Blockchain Unlocks the Next Stage of Digital Payments Digital payments have entered a phase where speed, programmability and flexibility define their value. Stablecoins now match traditional networks in scale. On and offramps connect them to familiar tools. Real-world assets gain synthetic forms with deeper liquidity. Smart contracts automate transfers based on logic, while privacy chains secure the user’s financial activity. Online services begin to operate as payment ecosystems. Whole industries restructure how they interact with users by combining infrastructure under a single interface. This shift spreads outward and reshapes expectations elsewhere. At the same time, programmable payment flows blur the line between action and settlement. Legacy systems keep their place, but new systems add speed and adaptability. Blockchain becomes the coordination layer for digital payments, turning value transfer into a reactive, secure and universal function of the internet.

This strategic acquisition brings their total Bitcoin holdings to a staggering 11,542 BTC, according to recent PA News reports. The decision to buy Bitcoin at this scale demonstrates growing institutional confidence in cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class. But what does this mean for the future of digital assets and corporate treasury strategies? Why Did Trump Media Buy More Bitcoin? When Trump Media buys Bitcoin, they’re making a calculated financial statement. This isn’t just another corporate investment—it’s a strategic positioning in the digital economy. The company now holds cryptocurrency worth hundreds of millions of dollars, placing them among the most significant corporate Bitcoin holders globally. Their continued accumulation suggests several strategic motivations: Inflation hedge against traditional currency devaluation Portfolio diversification beyond conventional assets Technological positioning in the blockchain revolution Brand alignment with innovation and forward-thinking strategies Moreover, this purchase comes at a time when regulatory clarity around cryptocurrency is improving, making institutional investments more feasible than ever before. The Growing Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Trump Media isn’t alone in recognizing Bitcoin’s potential. Their decision to buy Bitcoin follows a growing trend among forward-thinking corporations. Companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Square have already established substantial cryptocurrency reserves. However, Trump Media’s approach stands out for several reasons: First, the timing of their purchases often generates significant market attention. Second, their public profile brings mainstream visibility to cryptocurrency adoption. Finally, their consistent accumulation strategy suggests long-term conviction rather than speculative trading. This corporate adoption trend represents a fundamental shift in how businesses view digital assets. No longer just speculative instruments, cryptocurrencies are becoming recognized as: Legitimate treasury reserve assets Hedges against monetary policy uncertainty Tools for financial innovation and efficiency What Challenges Come With Corporate Crypto Holdings? While the decision to buy Bitcoin offers significant potential benefits, it also presents unique challenges. Corporate cryptocurrency holdings require specialized management approaches that differ from traditional asset management. Trump Media and other companies must navigate: Security concerns requiring advanced custody solutions Accounting complexities under evolving regulatory frameworks Market volatility that can impact quarterly financials Regulatory uncertainty across different jurisdictions However, these challenges haven’t deterred institutional adoption. Instead, they’ve spurred the development of sophisticated crypto infrastructure, including institutional-grade custody services, regulatory-compliant trading platforms, and specialized accounting standards. Actionable Insights for Investors and Businesses When a major company like Trump Media buys Bitcoin, it provides valuable lessons for other investors and businesses considering cryptocurrency exposure. Their strategy offers several actionable insights: First, consider dollar-cost averaging rather than timing the market. Trump Media’s gradual accumulation suggests they’re not trying to predict short-term price movements. Second, prioritize security above all else—corporate holdings require enterprise-grade custody solutions. Third, maintain transparent communication with stakeholders about your cryptocurrency strategy. For individual investors watching Trump Media buy Bitcoin, the key takeaway is validation of cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class. However, always remember that corporate strategies may differ from individual investment approaches. The Future Impact of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption As more companies follow Trump Media’s lead and buy Bitcoin, we can expect several market developments. Institutional adoption typically brings increased liquidity, improved infrastructure, and greater regulatory clarity. Furthermore, corporate Bitcoin holdings could: Stabilize cryptocurrency markets through reduced volatility Accelerate mainstream acceptance and integration Drive innovation in crypto financial products and services Influence regulatory frameworks through corporate lobbying The decision by Trump Media to buy Bitcoin represents more than just another corporate investment—it signals a fundamental shift in how established businesses view digital assets. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Crypto Trump Media’s purchase of 450 BTC marks a significant milestone in cryptocurrency adoption. Their growing Bitcoin holdings demonstrate that digital assets have moved from speculative instruments to legitimate components of corporate treasury strategies. As institutional adoption accelerates, we’re witnessing the maturation of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The decision to buy Bitcoin at this scale validates the technology’s staying power and suggests that digital assets will play an increasingly important role in global finance. Frequently Asked Questions How much Bitcoin does Trump Media now own? Trump Media currently holds 11,542 BTC following their recent purchase of 450 additional Bitcoin. Why would a media company buy Bitcoin? Companies buy Bitcoin for portfolio diversification, inflation hedging, and strategic positioning in emerging technologies, regardless of their core business. Does this mean Bitcoin is a safe investment? While institutional adoption increases legitimacy, Bitcoin remains a volatile asset. All investments carry risk, and cryptocurrency should only represent a portion of a diversified portfolio. How do companies securely store large Bitcoin holdings? Institutions typically use multi-signature wallets, cold storage solutions, and institutional custody services with insurance and advanced security protocols. Will other companies follow Trump Media’s example? Many companies are already holding Bitcoin, and institutional adoption has been steadily increasing as regulatory frameworks develop and infrastructure improves. How does corporate Bitcoin buying affect prices? Large institutional purchases can create buying pressure and reduce circulating supply, potentially supporting prices over the long term.

This isn’t just another fund launch; it’s a landmark endorsement from the world’s largest money manager, placing Bitcoin squarely in the mainstream investment conversation for the coming year. Let’s explore what this means for the future of crypto and your portfolio. Why is BlackRock’s IBIT a Top Investment Theme for 2025? BlackRock doesn’t make casual recommendations. When the firm with over $10 trillion in assets under management highlights an investment theme, institutional and retail investors alike take notice. Naming IBIT a top investment theme for 2025 is a strategic declaration. It signifies that BlackRock’s analysts see sustained, long-term value and growth potential in Bitcoin accessibility through a regulated, familiar vehicle. This move validates cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class for portfolio diversification. The data supports their confidence. Since its launch, the IBIT fund has attracted a staggering over $25 billion in inflows , according to CoinDesk. This torrent of capital has propelled it to become the sixth most popular ETF this year based on new investment. This demand isn’t speculative frenzy; it represents a fundamental shift as capital seeks exposure to digital assets through trusted, established financial institutions. What Does This Mean for Mainstream Crypto Adoption? BlackRock’s endorsement acts as a massive catalyst. For many traditional investors, the barriers to crypto were complexity and regulatory uncertainty. The IBIT ETF demolishes those barriers. Therefore, this theme for 2025 is about accessibility. Investors can now gain Bitcoin exposure through their standard brokerage accounts, just like they would with a stock or a bond ETF. This development has several key implications: Institutional Validation: BlackRock’s move encourages other pension funds, endowments, and wealth managers to consider crypto allocations. Regulatory Clarity: The successful operation of a spot Bitcoin ETF under SEC oversight provides a framework for future digital asset products. Market Maturation: It signals a transition from crypto’s early, volatile phase to a period of integration with traditional finance. How Should Investors Approach This 2025 Theme? Seeing IBIT as a top investment theme requires a strategic perspective. First, understand that this is a long-term thematic play, not a short-term trade. BlackRock is looking at macroeconomic trends like digitalization, monetary policy, and store-of-value assets. For individual investors, this theme could represent a small, strategic portion of a diversified portfolio aimed at growth. However, it’s crucial to remember that Bitcoin remains a volatile asset. While the ETF structure reduces custody and security concerns, it does not eliminate market risk. Investors should: Conduct their own research and understand Bitcoin’s value proposition. Consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon. Avoid allocating more than they are comfortable losing , as with any emerging asset class. The Ripple Effect: Beyond BlackRock’s IBIT BlackRock’s announcement is likely just the beginning. Naming IBIT a top investment theme for 2025 sets a precedent that competitors and the broader sector will follow. We can expect increased product innovation, more educational resources from major firms, and deeper research into blockchain technology’s applications. This theme extends beyond a single fund; it’s about the accelerating convergence of traditional and decentralized finance. In conclusion, BlackRock’s bold designation of its IBIT ETF as a premier theme for the coming year is a watershed moment. It represents a profound shift in perception, from skepticism to strategic embrace. This move provides a clear, regulated on-ramp for unprecedented levels of institutional capital, fundamentally altering the crypto investment landscape. For the astute investor, understanding this theme is key to navigating the financial markets of tomorrow. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly is the BlackRock IBIT ETF? A: The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund launched by BlackRock. It holds actual Bitcoin, allowing investors to buy shares that track the price of Bitcoin without having to directly purchase or store the cryptocurrency themselves. Q: Why is BlackRock calling it a ‘top investment theme’ for 2025? A: BlackRock’s analysts believe that accessible Bitcoin exposure, through a trusted vehicle like an ETF, will be a significant driver of investment strategy and portfolio construction in the coming year, due to trends in digital assets and diversification needs. Q: Is investing in the IBIT ETF the same as buying Bitcoin? A: While IBIT shares track Bitcoin’s price, they are not exactly the same. Buying IBIT means you own shares in a trust that holds Bitcoin, traded on a traditional stock exchange. You do not own Bitcoin keys directly, but you gain regulated exposure to its price movement. Q: What are the main benefits of investing through IBIT versus a crypto exchange? A: Key benefits include: holding it in a familiar brokerage account, enhanced regulatory security, no need for private key management or crypto wallets, and integration with traditional retirement accounts like IRAs. Q: Does this mean Bitcoin is now a ‘safe’ investment? A: No. While IBIT reduces operational risks, Bitcoin itself is still a highly volatile asset. Its price can fluctuate dramatically. The ETF provides a safer way to access a risky asset, but the underlying market risk remains. Q: How can I invest in the IBIT ETF? A: You can purchase shares of IBIT through most major online brokerage platforms (like Fidelity, Charles Schwab, or Vanguard) using their standard stock trading interface, just as you would buy shares of Apple or an S&P 500 ETF.

Wallets holding between 10,000 and 100,000 BTC have collectively reduced their positions by 36,500 BTC since the beginning of December. Bitcoin Whales Distribute 36,500 BTC Amid Market Chop The total value of the moved or sold Bitcoin is approximately $3.37 billion. This large-scale movement coincides with a period of renewed market volatility, with Bitcoin trading in a choppy range between $85,000 and $94,000 throughout the month. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $89,646. Source: TradingView This cohort’s selling pressure has increased by over 130% in the first half of December alone. The distribution from whales has been cited as a contributing factor to Bitcoin’s inability to break and hold higher price levels, despite some positive institutional signs like a recent resurgence in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows. Trader’s Perspective and Future Outlook The divestment by this specific whale cohort is a key sign for trading desks . While accumulation is noted among smaller tiers of holders (sharks, with 100-1,000 BTC), the selling pressure from the 10k-100k BTC cohort often precedes large price declines or extended consolidation. This is not retail profit-taking. It’s a methodical, large-scale distribution from long-term players. Desks are now closely monitoring exchange inflow data . A spike in inflows would confirm these movements are preparatory to selling on the open market, rather than internal wallet management or OTC deals, increasing the probability of a test of lower support levels around the $80,400 mark.

A new draft bill in the U.S. House of Representatives aims to make that a reality, proposing significant crypto tax benefits for everyday investors and miners. The Digital Asset PARITY Act could simplify the tax landscape and encourage broader adoption. What Are the Proposed Crypto Tax Benefits? The draft legislation, reported by CoinDesk, introduces several key provisions designed to remove friction for cryptocurrency users. The goal is to create parity between digital assets and traditional financial instruments. Therefore, understanding the specifics is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto space. The bill focuses on three main areas: everyday spending, investment activities, and international participation. Let’s break down what this means for you. How Could Small Stablecoin Payments Become Tax-Free? One of the most user-friendly proposals is a tax exemption for small transactions. The bill suggests that payments made with stablecoins for goods and services under $200 would be exempt from capital gains taxes. This directly addresses a major pain point for adoption. Everyday Use: Buying coffee, groceries, or paying for a ride-share with stablecoins would be simpler. Reduced Burden: It eliminates the need to track and report minor gains or losses on daily purchases. Boost for Stablecoins: This rule could significantly increase the practical utility of dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. What Does the Bill Mean for Staking and Mining Income? For those who earn crypto through staking or mining, the bill offers a major incentive. It proposes a tax deferral of up to five years on income generated from these activities. This provision recognizes the ongoing effort and lock-up period often required. Essentially, you wouldn’t pay tax on that income until you sell or dispose of the assets, up to a five-year window. This can improve cash flow and reward long-term participation in blockchain networks. Moreover, it aligns the treatment of generated crypto assets more closely with other forms of deferred income. Will Wash Sale Rules Finally Apply to Crypto? Currently, investors cannot claim a tax loss on a stock if they repurchase it within 30 days—a rule known as the wash sale rule. However, this rule does not apply to digital assets. The Digital Asset PARITY Act seeks to change that. Applying wash sale rules to crypto would close a loophole and create a more consistent framework across asset classes. While it might limit some strategic loss-harvesting, it also brings legitimacy and clarity to crypto taxation. How Could Foreign Investors Get New Tax Incentives? The legislation also looks outward, proposing crypto tax benefits to attract foreign investment. Specific details are still emerging, but the intent is to make the U.S. a more competitive hub for digital asset innovation and capital. This could involve favorable tax treatment for non-U.S. persons investing in domestic crypto projects or funds. Such a move would not only attract capital but also signal that the U.S. is serious about leading in the digital economy. Consequently, this could have a positive ripple effect on the entire market. What Are the Challenges and Next Steps? While the proposed crypto tax benefits are promising, it’s important to remember this is a draft bill. It must navigate committee reviews, debates, votes in both the House and Senate, and potentially a presidential signature. The process can take months or even years, and the final language may change. Key challenges include reaching bipartisan agreement, addressing regulatory concerns from agencies like the IRS, and ensuring the rules are clear and enforceable. Stakeholders should follow the bill’s progress closely. A Turning Point for Crypto Regulation The Digital Asset PARITY Act represents a significant and positive shift in the legislative approach to cryptocurrency. By proposing tangible crypto tax benefits , it acknowledges the unique nature of digital assets and seeks to integrate them sensibly into the existing financial system. For investors, it promises simplification and potential savings. For the industry, it offers a clearer path forward. The ultimate success of this effort will depend on bipartisan support and careful crafting, but the draft itself is a hopeful sign of progress toward sensible crypto regulation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Is this crypto tax bill law yet? A: No. This is a draft proposal from the U.S. House of Representatives. It must pass through the entire legislative process, which includes committee markups, votes in both the House and Senate, and a presidential signature, before becoming law. Q: What is the $200 stablecoin exemption? A: The draft bill proposes that if you use a stablecoin to buy something worth $200 or less, you would not have to calculate or pay capital gains tax on that transaction. It’s meant for everyday small purchases. Q: How does the 5-year tax deferral for staking work? A: If you earn cryptocurrency through staking or mining, you could defer paying income tax on that reward for up to five years, or until you sell it, whichever comes first. This defers your tax liability. Q: What are wash sale rules, and why do they matter for crypto? A: Wash sale rules prevent you from selling an asset to claim a tax loss and then immediately buying it back. Applying them to crypto would prevent this strategy, creating consistency with stock trading rules. Q: Should I change my crypto tax strategy now? A: Not yet. You should continue to comply with current tax laws. However, you can stay informed about this bill’s progress as it could impact your future tax planning. Q: Where can I read the full draft of the bill? A: The official draft text will be published on congressional websites like Congress.gov once it is formally introduced.

The detailed rebuttal comes after a widely shared article questioned the financial integrity and transparency of one of crypto’s largest on-chain derivatives venues, which has more than $4.1 billion in total value locked (TVL) according to DefiLlama. Point-by-Point Refutation of Allegations Hyperliquid’s response, posted on X on December 22, pointed out that the insolvency allegation stemmed from an accounting error rather than a real shortfall. The protocol explained that the author of the article in question failed to include native HyperEVM USDC balances, which run alongside the Arbitrum bridge. When both are counted, Hyperliquid said total USDC on HyperCore stands at $4.351 billion. “The Hyperliquid blockchain state is fully and verifiably solvent,” the team wrote, adding that “every dollar is accounted for” and that anyone can independently confirm balances by running a node and checking on-chain data. The protocol also rejected claims of retroactive volume manipulation, saying the cited functions exist only on testnet and are used for stress-testing fee logic. “Testnet-only features that enable more rigorous testing of edge cases do not undermine the chain’s integrity,” it wrote. It also noted that those code paths are unreachable on mainnet and will be removed entirely to avoid confusion. Other allegations touched on supposed “god mode” privileges, oracle control risks, liquidation cartels, hidden lending activity, and the ability to freeze the chain through governance. However, Hyperliquid said these points reflected misunderstandings of its architecture. For example, it explained that CoreWriter can’t create tokens or transfer user money without approval, the prices for validator-run perps come from an average of major exchanges, and liquidation support is managed by a community-owned liquidity pool that anyone can access. “Every order, trade, and liquidation is available in real time during execution,” the team said. They also argued that the decentralized exchange’s fully on-chain design offers stronger guarantees than competing perps venues with centralized sequencers. Price Pressure Amidst Major Supply Proposals Hyperliquid’s defense of its fundamentals comes at a volatile period for its native HYPE token. After reaching an all-time high near $59 in mid-September, the asset fell dramatically, and at the time of writing, it was trading around $25, representing a decline of approximately 24% over the past month and about 60% from its peak. Meanwhile, there have been significant supply-side developments, with the Hyper Foundation proposing a validator vote to permanently burn about 37 million HYPE tokens, which is roughly 10% of the circulating supply and is currently held in its Assistance Fund. If approved, nearly $1 billion worth of tokens would be removed from supply. Validators are set to decide on the proposal by December 24. However, this deflationary move is set against an upcoming token unlock of 9.92 million HYPE scheduled for December 29, which could introduce further selling pressure.

Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‘s performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? TIA’s price is attempting to hold around $0.466 as buyers lose confidence, resulting in a downward push. Will the TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA’s price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will the TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers’ interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns. It is advised to do your own research and conduct investment advice before investing in the volatile crypto market. Recent news/opinions on TIA Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade introduced PeerDAS, increasing data availability capacity to 10–15 blobs per block, compared with Celestia’s roughly 1,600 blobs per day. This challenges Celestia’s modular DA narrative as Ethereum now supports more than 55 rollups and over $40 billion in total value locked.

Some are experiments, while others enable real-world utility. Ripple’s XRP represents a shift from experimentation to practical application in payments and settlements. John Squire highlighted this distinction in a recent X post featuring Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. Garlinghouse described Bitcoin as a successful experiment that introduced decentralized money but emphasized its limitations in payment efficiency. XRP, he explained, was designed to address these shortcomings directly. Bitcoin’s Experimentation and Limitations Bitcoin remains the most well-known digital asset, pioneering decentralized consensus and blockchain security. Its proof-of-work system ensures immutability but limits transaction speed. Confirmations can take ten minutes or longer, and congestion can extend settlement to over an hour. Transaction fees can also spike during high network activity. These constraints make Bitcoin unsuitable for everyday payments or high-volume cross-border transactions. FROM EXPERIMENT TO REAL UTILITY BTC showed what was possible, but $XRP takes it further. Brad Garlinghouse explained that Bitcoin was a strong EXPERIMENT, just not built for PAYMENTS. The future doesn’t reward test runs… only what truly works. pic.twitter.com/G2PVbjZ3io — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) December 21, 2025 Despite these limitations, Bitcoin’s experimental design inspired the entire blockchain ecosystem. It proved that decentralized value transfer could work without intermediaries. However, Bitcoin was never intended as a global payments system. Its strengths lie in scarcity, store-of-value narratives, and decentralized security rather than practical settlement use. XRP’s Focus on Real-World Payments XRP was created with speed, efficiency, and scalability in mind . The XRP Ledger (XRPL) uses a consensus protocol, not mining, allowing transactions to settle in three to five seconds. This enables up to 1,500 transactions per second, compared to Bitcoin’s roughly seven per second. Garlinghouse emphasized XRP’s cost-effectiveness, noting that fees are consistently low and predictable. These features make XRP attractive for institutions that need reliable, fast payments. Its design aligns with modern financial infrastructure, supporting cross-border remittances and liquidity provisioning at scale. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bridging Legacy Finance and Blockchain Ripple has focused on integrating XRP with existing financial systems. Partnerships with institutions like Santander and SBI Remit show how XRP can facilitate near-instant settlements. Unlike Bitcoin, XRP can be used as a bridge currency, moving value between multiple fiat currencies efficiently. This approach addresses a critical need for speed, liquidity, and operational simplicity. The XRP Ledger also supports tokenization and smart contract-like functionality for more complex financial transactions. By combining speed with low fees and institutional-grade compliance, XRPL positions itself as a practical alternative for payments, lending, and asset transfers. From Experiment to Utility Garlinghouse’s remarks capture a broader evolution in crypto. Early blockchain initiatives prioritized experimentation, while modern systems emphasize real-world application. Bitcoin’s legacy proves feasibility; XRP demonstrates practical success. XRP’s fast settlement, low transaction cost, and institutional integration show why utility now drives adoption. The experiment has succeeded, but real value accrues to networks that solve actual financial problems. Ripple’s XRP exemplifies this principle, turning blockchain potential into actionable financial infrastructure. In summary, while Bitcoin validated decentralized currency, XRP extends the experiment into functioning payment systems. Its speed, efficiency, and institutional readiness make it a blockchain asset built for the real world. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The prediction markets startup will be acquired in a cash-and-stock deal. Coinbase will expand its prediction market business after agreeing to acquire The Clearing Company. The startup will be fully acquired in an unannounced deal of cash and stock. Coinbase announced that The Clearing Company will serve as the platform’s in-house prediction team and work on expanding the offerings of prediction pairs.

Welcome to Coinbase, @theclearingco . pic.twitter.com/KfRZSp9w9j — Coinbase 🛡️ (@coinbase) December 22, 2025 The announcement arrives just days after Coinbase shared its plans to expand into prediction markets. The Clearing Company is already connected to Coinbase Ventures via a $15M seed round. The deal is expected to close in January, as the startup’s team will join to work on Coinbase’s own product. The Clearing Company previously built itself for full compliance , while remaining permissionless and fully on-chain. The Clearing Company may turn Coinbase into the Everything Exchange The Clearing Company was launched by Tony Gemayel, a former growth manager at both Polymarket and Kalshi. The Coinbase decision arrives after other prediction markets strengthened their in-house teams and invited specialized traders. Coinbase has announced upcoming prediction markets in sports, crypto, as well as current events in politics and culture. The expansion arrives just as Polymarket is trying to bring back its business to the USA. In addition to expertise, The Clearing Company may also bring full compliance with the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission, to become a Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO). If the CFTC approves the filing, the prediction platform will also become the first stablecoin-based clearing house. Coinbase will also acquire a team of prediction market veterans, helping to shape the modern market landscape. By adding prediction markets, Coinbase aims to turn into a part of the Everything exchange, a hub of multiple on-chain activities. Prediction markets turned into a booming crypto space, crossing over into mainstream activity. Almost every platform has attempted to create its own version of a prediction market, while Polymarket and Kalshi have remained the leaders over the past two months. Competition is increasing and challenging the first movers. Prediction markets reach new records Prediction markets are shifting to new records at the end of 2025. The platforms are becoming more diverse, with Polymarket, Kalshi, and Opinion leading the way. Prediction markets reached a new weekly record after three main competitors boosted their volumes in December. | Source: Dune Analytics The market reached a weekly peak of $4B in notional volume. Prediction markets offer a mix of current events, as well as short-term markets linked to the prices of assets. Compared to crypto platforms, prediction markets seem relatively small. However, the platforms are still mostly linked to small-scale users and have a smaller share of bot activity. Currently, Polymarket has added accounts that appear to be automated trading, which seek out price inefficiencies. The other problem for prediction markets is the settlement of contentious issues and the clear definition of exact resolutions. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

According to CoinShares data , the pullback showed how closely institutional flows track policy clarity. Market participants reacted quickly to delays around the US Clarity Act. Those delays extended uncertainty for asset managers and fund issuers. Hence, investors reduced exposure while awaiting clearer regulatory direction. Selling activity by large holders reinforced that defensive stance. Consequently, weekly flows turned negative despite earlier optimism. US Outflows Dominate Global Picture Outflows remained heavily concentrated in the United States. US-based products recorded $990 million in withdrawals during the week. That figure accounted for nearly all global redemptions. However, modest inflows from other regions provided limited relief. Canada attracted $46.2 million in new allocations. Germany followed with $15.6 million in inflows. These figures suggested regional divergence in investor outlook. Besides geography, the data highlighted shifting risk preferences. US investors appeared more sensitive to regulatory delays. International investors showed selective confidence instead. That contrast underscored how policy uncertainty shapes capital flows. Additionally, it revealed how regulatory timelines influence near-term positioning decisions. Ethereum and Bitcoin See Heavy Selling Ethereum absorbed the largest share of outflows. Products tied to the asset shed $555 million over the week. The decline reflected its exposure to regulatory outcomes. Ethereum-linked products rely heavily on clarity around staking and classification rules. Hence, delays weighed heavily on sentiment. However, year-to-date inflows remain strong. Ethereum products have already attracted $12.7 billion this year. That figure far exceeds last year’s total. Bitcoin also faced notable pressure. Funds tracking the asset lost $460 million during the period. Although Bitcoin retains strong institutional interest, inflows lag last year’s pace. Products have gathered $27.2 billion so far in 2025. In contrast, they drew $41.6 billion during the same period in 2024. That gap reflects growing investor selectivity. Selective Support for Solana and XRP Significantly, not all assets saw redemptions. Solana products recorded $48.5 million in inflows. XRP-linked funds attracted $62.9 million. These gains suggested targeted confidence despite broader weakness. Investors appeared willing to back assets viewed as having clearer regulatory paths. Moreover, diversification strategies supported selective allocations. Overall assets under management now stand at $46.7 billion. That figure remains below last year’s $48.7 billion peak. Hence, surpassing 2024 inflow levels appears increasingly unlikely. However, shifting regional interest and selective inflows suggest investors have not abandoned the market. Instead, they continue to wait for clearer signals before committing fresh capital.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|SOL|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-22 17:15:30

Why XRP Is at a ‘Make-or-Break’ Moment,https://cryptopotato.com/double-bottom-or-double-top-why-xrp-is-at-a-make-or-break-moment/,"XRP is holding above $1.9 after bouncing from key support near $1.8. The move follows a brief dip below that level, which was quickly reversed. It has since reclaimed the zone, drawing attention to a possible short-term shift in trend. Support Zone Holds as RSI Rebounds Analyst Niels flagged a potential double bottom around the $1.8 level. XRP tested the area twice, with the second move briefly falling below support before recovering. This type of price action is often seen during early signs of recovery. “XRP had a fakeout below the support level before reclaiming the zone,” he noted. The RSI also shows signs of strength. After reaching oversold levels near 22, the indicator has rebounded to around 45. Niels added, “RSI has bottomed out already, and now the price is showing good signs too.” If momentum continues, the next resistance sits near $1.95. A move above that could bring targets between $2.3 and $2.5 into play. XRP Price Chart 22.12. Source: Niels/X Even so, XRP dropped below $1.90 over the weekend, breaking out of a tight range. The move came with a rise in volume, which suggested sellers were active. The broader market was mixed, and XRP showed less follow-through than some other large-cap tokens. Since losing the $2 level earlier this month, rebounds have been limited. That said, ChartNerd noted that XRP is still trading above its Monthly Supertrend indicator and stated, “Being above the Monthly Supertrend indicator implies that $XRP is still in a bull market.” On-Chain Activity and Sentiment Signals Address activity on the XRP network has slowed. Ali Charts reported a drop from 46,000 active wallets to 38,500 over the past week. This change suggests fewer participants in the network during the current range-bound price action. Analyst Daniel Ramsey shared a different view. “#XRP is testing the neckline of Double Top formation,” he said. He described the setup as “ looking bearish. ” A close below $1.77 would break the recent structure and put the next major support near $0.8 back in focus. Additionally, data shared by Ali Martinez shows that the TD Sequential tool may have signaled a local top after XRP’s bounce from $1.77 to $1.92. XRP is priced at $1.92 at press time, with a 24-hour volume of $2.24 billion. The token is down over 1% in the past day and almost 4% over the past week. While short-term direction remains uncertain, spot Ripple ETFs have continued to post gains since their launch on November 13, showing steady demand from market participants.

As Cardano struggles with growing bearish tendencies towards the close of 2025 due to weakness in price and a lack of participation, indications are that 2026 will prove worse. Mutuum Finance continues to gear up ahead with success in the presale stages, coming out at the lead due to their innovative growth factors, making it the best cheap crypto to buy, which can only serve to heighten the question of the best cryptocurrency to invest at this current moment. ADA’s Expected Growth The recent price actions in Cardano have also not favored ADA, as it touched as low as $0.36 in its current trading session due to a price drop of 4%. Nevertheless, overall market sentiment indicators also reflect that this bearish pressure may increase even further. Thorough analysis of historical market data indicates that Social Dominance in Cardano has reached its annual lowest point, suggesting declining market attention. Generally, declining market attention has resulted in extended consolidation periods or market corrections in major altcoins. ADA is currently languishing well below its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages, which are major levels in determining trend confirmation. The momentum indicators of RSI and MACD are thus being pushed into the negative regions. Analysts are now suggesting that $0.29 is a major level to be targeted if speculative buying pressure fails to propel the prices above $0.45. As the funding rates in the derivatives markets are now just turning positive, the short interest is still accumulating. As for those wanting to choose the best cryptocurrency to purchase as of the moment, the state of the Cardano forecast may present a poor risk versus reward profile, especially in contrast to other cryptos that are in early stages of development. Mutuum Finance Presale Trend Continues In the midst of this struggling landscape of Cardano, there is another developing project that is moving at a rapid pace, named Mutuum Finance. The project is currently in presale phase 6, nearing completion, as 99% has been filled, soon to be fully sold out. A total of $19,500,000 has been raised since the presale began, with a total of 18550 MUTM holders. Current presale price per token in presale phase 6 is $0.035, a 250% or 3.5x appreciation from the initial presale price in presale phase one, valued at $0.01. Phase 6 is selling out quickly, and the moment to purchase MUTM at this point in time is rapidly approaching the end. As soon as the starting of phase 7 takes place, the prices of the tokens escalate by another 20%, reaching $0.04 in value. Given the launch price of MUTM at $0.06, the current investors will anticipate a return of 380%, thus solidifying the progress of MUTM into the best cheap crypto to buy today. For the rest, this represents the final moment for purchasing the token at the current value of $0.035 preceding the next re-pricing. Dual Lending Model gives MUTM Uniqueness Alongside the dynamics in the presale, Mutuum Finance is gaining momentum with the dual lending model, which was created to give the platform a unique edge over the regular DeFi platform. The platform integrates both the peer-to-contract lending model and the peer-to-peer lending model. This means that the platform provides risk takers with flexible lending options. Therefore, the platform provides risk takers with liquidity while maximizing returns. This puts MUTM as a scaling cryptocurrency within the DeFi sector instead of a speculation cryptocurrency. As of recent, the project has developed and launched an interactive dashboard that features a leaderboard of the top 50 token holders. The 24-hour leaderboard for contributors is reward-based, and the number one-ranked contributor receives $500 of MUTM for the day if there has been any form of transaction. This happens on the completion of every cycle and the leaderboard resets at 00:00 UTC. Consideration of the technology difficulties that Cardano is facing and the poor market sentiment makes market players increasingly interested in the young DeFi project that has more foreseeable growth. The closing presale, lending model, and roadmap of Mutuum Finance evidently reveal why an altcoin such as it has become one of the best cryptos to buy.

The culprit? Stalled trade talks with the U.S. and a steady stream of foreign investors pulling their money out. The currency is trading at 89.6 to the dollar right now. That’s a far cry from where it started the year at 85.64. And experts think it’s going to get worse. Both Nomura and S&P Global Market Intelligence say the rupee could hit 92 per dollar by the end of March. Any recover y de pends heavily on whether India can strike a trade deal with Washington. Hanna Luchnikava-Schorsch, who heads Asia-Pacific economics at S&P Global Market Intelligence, thinks the rupee is undervalued right now, but says it won’t correct “until there is more clarity on the U.S.-India trade agreement.” Her team expects a deal in the next six months. Here’s the problem. India has tariffs at 50%, making it one of the most heavily tariffed countries anywhere. That’s higher than even China faces. Trade talks between New Delhi and Washington keep dragging on with no end in sight. When steep tariffs kicked in last August, the damage showed up fast. India’s exports to America fell nearly 12 percent in September. October wasn’t much better, down 8.5 percent. November brought some relief; exports shot up 22.6%. But Sonal Varma, who’s chief economist for India and Asia ex-Japan at Nomura, sees bigger risks ahead. Companies that make things mainly for the American market might look elsewhere if the high tariffs stick around. India could lose out on supply chain shifts. “Prolonged uncertainty has led to foreign portfolio outflows, and a weaker rupee can affect import costs and inflation,” she said. Foreign investors head for the exits Foreign investors have been heading for the exits all year. More than $10 billion has flowed out across different investment types, according to NSDL data. The stock market got hit especially hard—foreign portfolio investors yanked out nearly $18 billion through December 19. Earlier this month, the rupee broke through the 90-mark against the dollar. That’s a big psychological level. Then it took less than 15 trading sessions to cross 91. The slide has been quick. Somnath Mukherjee works as CIO and senior managing partner at ASK Private Wealth. He told CNBC’s “Inside India” that the rupee’s troubles aren’t really about India’s current account deficit. That’s expected to stay manageable between 1 percent and 1.5 percent. The real issue is foreign investors pulling out. The rupee will stay under pressure until that trend reverses, he said. For foreign investors, the weak rupee cuts both ways. Luchnikava-Schorsch called it “a double-edged sword for FIIs.” Sure, it could be “a good entry point for Indian equities.” But investor s al so have to think about “protracted rupee weakness and trade policy uncertainty,” plus concerns about government finances and growth prospects. India’s economic challenges have intensified as trade policies shift globally. The world’s fifth-largest economy faces mounting pressure from multiple fronts. Central bank steps in India’s central bank said earlier this month it would let market forces set exchange rates. But on Wednesday, the bank reportedly jumped in “aggressively” to stop the currency from falling further. There is an upside to all this. A cheaper rupee makes Indian exports more competitive globally. And because domestic inflation is relatively low, the country has some cushion to handle higher import costs from the weaker currency. Recent developments in U.S.-India negotiations sugges t bo th sides are working toward a breakthrough, though concrete results remain elusive. Until then, the rupee is likely to remain under pressure as investors wait for clarity.

He states that Congress is now poised to send a comprehensive cryptocurrency bill to President Donald Trump’s desk. This announcement, coming on Selig’s very first day in office, signals a potential breakthrough in the long-standing quest for clear U.S. crypto regulation. For investors and builders in the space, this news is nothing short of monumental. What Does This Cryptocurrency Bill Mean for the Market? The core promise of this impending cryptocurrency bill is regulatory clarity. For years, the U.S. digital asset industry has operated in a gray area, with conflicting guidance from the SEC and CFTC creating uncertainty. This bill aims to establish a clear market structure, defining which agencies oversee which types of assets and activities. Therefore, companies can innovate with confidence, and institutional investors can enter the market with a defined rulebook. This clarity is often seen as the final hurdle for mainstream adoption. Why Is the CFTC’s Role So Crucial Here? Chairman Selig’s statement is significant because the CFTC has historically taken a more commodity-focused view of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Many in the industry believe this approach is more conducive to growth than the SEC’s securities-centric framework. The reported cryptocurrency bill is likely to formalize the CFTC’s authority over certain digital asset markets, particularly spot markets for non-security tokens. This shift could lead to: Standardized Rules: Consistent regulations across trading platforms. Consumer Protection: Clearer guidelines to prevent fraud and manipulation. Innovation Boost: A stable environment for developing new financial products. What Are the Immediate Next Steps and Potential Hurdles? While the announcement is promising, the legislative process has several steps. The bill must pass through both chambers of Congress before reaching President Trump. Key challenges remain, including: Reconciling different views between the House and Senate. Addressing concerns from banking regulators and the SEC. Ensuring the bill adequately covers emerging areas like DeFi and stablecoins. However, Selig’s confident tone suggests significant bipartisan groundwork has already been laid. The political will appears to be aligning, making this the closest the U.S. has ever been to comprehensive crypto law. How Could This Cryptocurrency Bill Impact You? For the average crypto user or investor, this legislation promises a more secure and predictable environment. Exchanges would operate under stricter, uniform standards. Your assets would have clearer legal protections. Moreover, it could pave the way for more traditional investment vehicles, like spot Bitcoin ETFs from major institutions, bringing unprecedented liquidity and stability to the market. This cryptocurrency bill isn’t just about rules; it’s about building trust in a new financial system. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for U.S. Crypto Policy Chairman Michael Selig’s first-day announcement is a powerful signal that the long era of regulatory ambiguity may be ending. The potential passage of a foundational cryptocurrency bill represents a historic pivot. It acknowledges the permanence of digital assets and America’s intention to lead their governance. While details are still emerging, the direction is clear: the U.S. is moving decisively to integrate cryptocurrencies into its financial framework, offering hope for stability and growth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main goal of this proposed cryptocurrency bill? A1: The primary goal is to establish a clear regulatory market structure for digital assets in the United States, defining the roles of the CFTC and SEC to provide long-awaited legal certainty for the industry. Q2: Who is Michael Selig and why does his statement matter? A2: Michael Selig is the newly appointed Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). His statement matters because it comes from a top regulator on his first day, indicating high-level confidence that the legislative process is nearing completion. Q3: Will this bill make cryptocurrencies more legitimate? A3: Yes, absolutely. Comprehensive federal legislation would provide a definitive legal framework, increasing legitimacy for cryptocurrencies, encouraging institutional investment, and enhancing consumer protection. Q4: What happens if President Trump vetoes the bill? A4: While a veto is always possible, the reported bipartisan support for the bill makes it likely Congress could override a veto. The political momentum suggests a high chance of the bill becoming law. Q5: How soon could this cryptocurrency bill become law? A5: The timeline is uncertain but accelerated. With Congress “ready to send” the bill, it could move through votes within the coming months, potentially becoming law before the end of the year. Q6: Does this affect Bitcoin and Ethereum differently? A6: It might. The bill will likely clarify which assets are considered commodities (like Bitcoin, overseen by the CFTC) and which are securities (potentially some tokens, overseen by the SEC). This distinction is a core part of the legislation. This is a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency in America.

This approval enables Authorised Persons licensed by the FSRA of ADGM to use USDT on TRON in carrying out their regulated activities. This recognition comes as the UAE continues to demonstrate global leadership in integrating traditional and digital finance. ADGM’s progressive regulatory approach has positioned Abu Dhabi as a premier destination for blockchain innovation, fostering a thriving ecosystem that balances technological advancement with robust compliance frameworks. USDT on TRON has become one of the most widely adopted stablecoin solutions globally, valued for its speed, efficiency, and low transaction costs. The FSRA’s acceptance ensures that licensed entities in ADGM can now seamlessly integrate USDT on TRON into their approved services, supporting the diversification and modernization of the UAE’s financial landscape. This recognition validates TRON’s commitment to regulatory cooperation, transparent governance, and industry-leading security standards. TRON continues to prioritize compliance and accountability, working proactively with global regulators to establish trusted infrastructure for digital assets. “This milestone reflects TRON’s unwavering dedication to building compliant, secure blockchain infrastructure that meets the highest regulatory standards,” said John Hurston, General Counsel, U.S. for TRON DAO. “The FSRA’s acceptance of USDT on TRON acknowledges not only the technical efficiency and scalability of our network, but also our comprehensive approach to decentralized governance and financial crime prevention. This has been demonstrated in part by the success of the T3 Financial Crime Unit, which works closely with global law enforcement to combat use of USDT on TRON for illicit purposes. We are honored to support the UAE’s vision of creating responsible digital asset innovation.” About TRON DAO TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps.

According to traders who track his public messages, the pattern is being read as a possible hint that more Bitcoin buying could be on the way.

Market Reaction And Signals Prices moved on the rumor alone. Short-term traders bought into the idea that a large buyer may be shifting action back toward accumulation. Based on reports, some market participants compared the signal to earlier Saylor posts that preceded corporate purchases. Green Dots ₿eget Orange Dots. pic.twitter.com/aLdvPe4YuG — Michael Saylor (@saylor) December 21, 2025 No official company filing or treasury update has been released to confirm any new acquisition. The message was posted without any accompanying press release, and that lack of confirmation kept some desks cautious. Institutional Demand And On-Chain Clues Reports have disclosed that institutional flows still matter to Bitcoin’s price path. Large spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasuries are part of the backdrop that traders cite when interpreting a high-profile hint from a corporate figure. On-chain metrics, where available, are being scanned for coin movements into custody accounts. One key piece of evidence that would change market conviction is a clear transfer into an exchange or ETF custody wallet, followed by a public disclosure; absent that, the green-dot post remains a market signal more than a proof point. What Traders Are Watching Liquidity sits near $90,000. Many orders cluster around that level, and that makes it a psychological and technical barrier. If a big buyer steps in under the wall, sellers may be cleared and price could push higher. If selling stays firm, BTC could stall and move sideways for several sessions. Traders are also watching order books, funding rates, and ETF balances for shifts. Volume spikes paired with visible custody inflows would be a stronger signal than a social post alone.

SEC Lawsuit: What XRP Investors Should Know As The Year Draws To An End,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-vs-sec-lawsuit-xrp/,"As the year draws to a rapid close, the lawsuit between Ripple Labs and the United States (US) Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stands as one of the most consequential and closely watched legal battles in crypto history. Long before its official resolution, the case dominated the space, consistently making top headlines with each new filing , ruling, courtroom development, and update. Ripple and the SEC went head to head to determine whether XRP should be classified as a security under US law. For XRP investors, the lawsuit’s verdict served as a long-awaited reprieve after years of regulatory uncertainty and suppressed price action in XRP. Ripple Vs SEC Lawsuit Recap For XRP Investors After years of uncertainty, the long-running dispute between Ripple and the US SEC officially concluded in 2025 . The case has been a defining moment for cryptocurrency regulation in the United States and has significantly influenced XRP investors worldwide. The lawsuit began on December 20, when the SEC accused Ripple of selling XRP as an unregistered security . The crypto payments company, however, argued that XRP is a digital asset, not a security under US law. Fast forward to 2023, Judge Analisa Torres from the Southern District of New York delivered a mixed ruling, finding that XRP sold on public exchanges did not constitute securities transactions, earning Ripple a partial victory . Although the ruling provided some level of clarity, it left unresolved questions that continued to affect XRP’s trading and adoption. Following the court’s decision, Ripple was ordered to pay a civil penalty of roughly $125 million in 2024 for institutional sales of XRP. An injunction was also imposed, restricting the company from engaging in similar activities in the future. The penalty was far below the nearly $2 billion fees initially sought by the SEC. In early 2025, both parties filed appeals and cross-appeals. The SEC challenged the exemption for public exchange sales , while Ripple contested the injunction’s restrictions. The dispute took a decisive turn when Ripple and the regulator jointly requested the Manhattan District Court to dissolve the injunction and release the $125 million civil penalty held in escrow. Under the agreement, only $50 million will be paid to the SEC, with the remaining funds returned to Ripple. The court approved this arrangement, formally resolving the nearly 5-year case and eliminating years of regulatory uncertainty and slow growth in XRP. How the Ripple-SEC Case Impacted XRP Investors For years, the Ripple-SEC legal dispute had caused sharp price fluctuations, slow growth, and limited exchange listings for XRP. Many investors held back from buying or selling the token due to regulatory risks. As a result, the XRP price remained suppressed around $0.5 for an extended period, even as other cryptocurrencies reached new ATHs. After the court’s ruling in 2024, the XRP price exploded, rising from $0.5 to over $2 in November . The official resolution of the case also boosted investor sentiment, contributing to the cryptocurrency’s price surge above $3 in 2025 . Although XRP has since dropped from these levels, its trading volume and adoption continue to benefit from the regulatory clarity.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-22 18:00:46

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/642-million-xrp-within-48-hours-heres-what-happened/,"Whale movements often signal hidden currents in cryptocurrency markets . When large holders act, the market takes notice. Recently, XRP experienced a notable spike in whale activity, capturing the attention of traders and analysts worldwide. According to a post on X by STEPH IS CRYPTO, XRP whales acquired roughly $642 million worth of XRP within 48 hours. Steph emphasized that this surge reflects strategic accumulation rather than casual trading, signaling potential confidence in XRP’s medium-term prospects. XRP Whale Accumulation Whales are wallets holding between 100 million and 1 billion XRP. Their actions can influence both market sentiment and price dynamics. Recent on-chain analytics show these wallets substantially increased holdings, indicating they view current prices as favorable entry points. Accumulation by whales can reduce circulating supply, limiting short-term sell pressure. Historically, such patterns have sometimes preceded sustained price movements, particularly when combined with supportive market conditions. BREAKING: $XRP WHALES ADDED $642M WORTH OF XRP IN THE PAST 48 HOURS. pic.twitter.com/EJipP7QX5Q — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 21, 2025 Exchange Flows and Supply Dynamics Large transfers into cold wallets indicate consolidation, while deposits onto exchanges often suggest potential selling. Over recent weeks, on-chain data shows net outflows from exchanges, reflecting growing whale confidence. This behavior tightens the available supply. When fewer tokens are accessible for trading, markets can experience reduced volatility and more pronounced price reactions. Market Context and ETF Influence XRP’s whale accumulation coincides with strong institutional interest. Spot XRP ETFs have attracted over $1 billion in inflows, increasing exposure among traditional investors. Steph highlighted that whale behavior complements these inflows, showing confidence across different market layers. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Despite ETF inflows, price action remains volatile. Short-term fluctuations persist as traders balance buying interest with selling pressure, particularly around key support levels. Interpreting the Signal Whale accumulation can indicate multiple strategies. Many see it as buying the dip, expecting prices to rebound . Others may consolidate holdings in preparation for future liquidity events. Steph emphasized that while large-scale accumulation is significant, it does not guarantee immediate price surges. The broader market, macroeconomic factors, and retail participation all influence outcomes. Potential Price Implications Reduced circulating supply from whale accumulation could stabilize XRP’s price. If market sentiment shifts positively, these holdings might support stronger upward movements. Historical trends show that periods of quiet accumulation often precede notable rallies. In conclusion, the recent $642 million whale accumulation reflects strategic positioning and confidence in XRP. Combined with ETF inflows and on-chain activity, this trend highlights a developing narrative of institutional and large-holder support. Market participants will watch closely to see how this activity influences XRP’s trajectory in the coming weeks.

The deal supports Coinbase’s broader goal of becoming an “everything exchange” that blends crypto, derivatives, equities, and real-world outcome trading. Consequently, the acquisition strengthens Coinbase’s position as competition intensifies across digital finance platforms. The agreement follows Coinbase’s recent rollout of prediction markets, which allow users to trade outcomes tied to elections, economic data, and sports. These markets operate within the same interface as other Coinbase products. Hence, the company aims to increase engagement by offering trading formats beyond traditional spot assets. The transaction remains subject to standard closing conditions and should close in January. Startup Talent Joins Coinbase Platform The Clearing Company launched earlier this year under founder Toni Gemayel, who previously worked in growth roles across the sector. The startup raised $15 million in seed funding during August, with participation from Coinbase Ventures. Additionally, the firm focused on building a regulated, onchain prediction markets infrastructure. Following the acquisition, nearly the entire Clearing Company team will join Coinbase. The startup employed around ten people, and their expertise will help scale Coinbase’s prediction markets offering. Significantly, Coinbase confirmed that the deal involves a mix of cash and company stock. However, the company described the transaction value as immaterial. Coinbase expects the incoming team to accelerate product development and support broader distribution. The move reflects a strategy centered on acquiring specialized talent rather than standalone platforms. Moreover, Coinbase continues to integrate niche capabilities into its core ecosystem instead of operating separate brands. Prediction Markets Gain Industry Momentum Coinbase launched its prediction markets through a regulated venue and sourced initial liquidity from Kalshi. The company plans to add more platforms and market types over time. Besides, the expansion aligns with growing interest in onchain financial instruments tied to real-world events. Across the sector, prediction markets have seen sharp growth. Polymarket and Kalshi recorded record activity last month. Combined trading volumes reached roughly $8 billion during November. Consequently, exchanges and fintech firms now view prediction markets as a high-engagement growth channel. This deal marks Coinbase’s tenth acquisition announcement in 2025. Earlier purchases included Roam, Spindl, Iron Fish, Deribit, and Opyn Markets. Additionally, Coinbase acquired Liquifi, Sensible, Echo, and Vector.fun this year.

According to data from CoinShares, digital asset investment products saw $952 million in net outflows over the past week, marking the first negative flow since late November. Source: coinshares.com The retreat was largely driven by delays linked to the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, widely referred to as the CLARITY Act , which has extended regulatory uncertainty for crypto firms operating across America. Fears of ongoing selling from major holders further dragged on sentiment. Ether and Bitcoin Lead Crypto Fund Outflows While SOL and XRP Survive The outflows were heavily centered in the U.S., which made up $990 million of that total. Source: coinshares.com This was only partially offset by inflows from Canada and Germany, where investors added $46.2 million and $15.6 million, respectively. Ethereum bore the brunt of the selling, recording $555 million in outflows. Analysts noted that Ether’s sensitivity to regulatory developments is higher than most assets, given its central role in decentralized finance and staking-related products that could be directly affected by U.S. market structure rules. Despite the recent pullback, Ethereum investment products have still attracted $12.7 billion in inflows so far this year, well above the $5.3 billion recorded over the same period in 2024. Bitcoin products followed closely behind, recording $460 million in outflows. While Bitcoin still leads the market in absolute terms, year-to-date inflows of $27.2 billion remain below last year’s $41.6 billion. Total assets under management across all crypto exchange-traded products now stand at $46.7 billion, down from $48.7 billion at the same point in 2024, making it unlikely the sector will surpass last year’s totals. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs reflected similar pressure, posting a weekly net outflow of $497.05 million as of December 19, even as cumulative inflows remain elevated at $57.41 billion. US SOL Spot ETF Source: Sosovalue In contrast, Solana and XRP continued to attract fresh capital. Solana investment products recorded $48.5 million in inflows, while XRP products added $62.9 million. US XRP Spot ETF Source: Sosovalue The trend was mirrored in U.S. spot ETFs, where XRP funds posted $82.04 million in weekly inflows, and Solana ETFs added $66.55 million over the same period, extending a multi-month pattern of steady accumulation. Crypto Market Bill Faces Fresh Delay as Senate Kicks Vote to January The market reaction unfolded as lawmakers confirmed further delays to the CLARITY Act.

Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott and Agriculture Committee Chair John Boozman are expected to lead the markup , which could still face amendments before reaching a full vote. Senator Cynthia Lummis had previously suggested the bill could reach President Donald Trump’s desk before the end of 2025, but that outlook now appears less certain as election-year pressures begin to weigh on bipartisan negotiations.

ASTER witnessed a mild rebound on Monday shortly after the announcement. ASTER Buybacks Under this program, up to 80% of the platform’s daily fees will be used to repurchase ASTER tokens. Of this, 40% of the fees will go toward an automatic daily buyback, which will be executed on-chain each day to gradually reduce supply and provide consistent support for the asset. The remaining 20% to 40% of fees will be held in a strategic buyback reserve. Such a system in place will allow Aster to conduct targeted purchases based on market conditions. Both the automatic and strategic buybacks are fully on-chain and publicly verifiable, with wallets dedicated to each purpose. Interestingly, in November, ASTER saw a spike of over 30% and hit $1.30 after Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao revealed he holds over $2.5 million worth of the token. However, since then, its price has remained under intense selling pressure. The token has recorded a steady decline amid broader market weakness. Price action shows repeated lower highs and gradual downside momentum, as investors remained cautious. While ASTER continues to be almost 20% down over the past week, it appears to be attempting an uptick. Over the past 24 hours, the token rebounded by nearly 3%. It rose to $0.725, coinciding with the stage 5 buyback program. Resistance Zone Near $0.88-$0.90 Pseudonymous crypto trader, “DrBullZeus,” said that ASTER is currently trading near the bottom of its price channel and is showing extremely oversold conditions. According to the analyst, this setup could open the door for a short-term recovery, and potential upside could push it toward the $0.88 to $0.90 range, which represents key channel resistance levels. He also added that any near-term recovery would likely remain corrective in nature unless ASTER manages to break decisively above the $0.90 level, which would be needed to signal a stronger trend reversal.

According to a key White House adviser, a powerful new alliance is forming that could finally deliver the regulatory clarity the industry desperately needs. David Sacks, an adviser on AI and cryptocurrency, has hailed the collaboration between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a “dream team” for crypto regulation . This partnership arrives at a critical moment, as new technologies surge and retail investor interest hits record highs. Why is This SEC-CFTC Partnership a Game-Changer for Crypto Regulation? For years, the US cryptocurrency landscape has been a regulatory patchwork. The question of whether a digital asset is a security (regulated by the SEC) or a commodity (regulated by the CFTC) has created immense uncertainty. This lack of clear crypto regulation has stifled innovation and pushed some projects overseas. However, the reported collaboration between these two powerful agencies signals a potential breakthrough. By working together, they can create a cohesive framework that protects investors while fostering responsible growth in the digital asset space. What’s Driving the Push for Clear Rules Now? David Sacks called this a “very special time,” and he’s right. Several converging factors are forcing regulators’ hands: Explosive Growth: New platforms, products, and technologies are emerging at a breakneck pace. Record Retail Participation: More everyday Americans are entering commodity and crypto markets than ever before, necessitating stronger consumer protections. Global Competition: Other nations are advancing their own regulatory frameworks, and the US risks losing its leadership position. Therefore, establishing definitive crypto regulation is no longer a future goal—it’s an immediate necessity to secure America’s economic future. How Could This “Dream Team” Actually Work? Imagine a system where the SEC oversees digital assets that function like traditional securities, focusing on disclosures and preventing fraud. Simultaneously, the CFTC could regulate the broader crypto commodity markets and derivatives. This collaborative model aims to eliminate the jurisdictional gray areas that have plagued the industry. The goal is a regulatory environment that is both robust and intelligible, giving businesses the confidence to build and investors the confidence to participate. The Legislative Backdrop: A Bill is on the Horizon This agency teamwork aligns with movement in Congress. Sacks noted that the Republican-led House is preparing to send a significant digital asset market structure bill to the President. The intent of this legislation is unambiguous: to firmly establish the U.S. as the global center for cryptocurrency . A clear, legislative mandate would empower the SEC-CFTC “dream team,” providing the legal foundation their collaborative efforts require to be truly effective. What Are the Potential Challenges Ahead? While the prospect of a unified front is promising, the path forward isn’t without obstacles. Defining the precise boundaries between a security and a commodity in the crypto world remains complex. Furthermore, achieving true inter-agency harmony on enforcement and policy will require sustained effort. The ultimate success of this crypto regulation dream team will depend on consistent execution and a shared commitment to balancing innovation with investor safety. A Transformative Moment for US Crypto Regulation The characterization of the SEC and CFTC as a “dream team” is more than just optimistic rhetoric. It represents a pivotal shift in the regulatory mindset—from fragmentation to collaboration. This partnership, combined with impending congressional action, has the potential to unlock a new era of growth and stability for cryptocurrency in America. By providing the clarity that markets crave, the US can reclaim its role as the undeniable hub for financial innovation and secure its position in the digital economy of tomorrow. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What did the White House adviser actually say about crypto regulation? A1: David Sacks, a White House adviser, stated that the SEC and CFTC have formed a “dream team” to establish clear crypto regulations, calling it a special time due to new technologies and high retail investor participation. Q2: Why is the SEC-CFTC collaboration so important? A2: It’s crucial because it aims to resolve the long-standing confusion over whether cryptocurrencies are securities (SEC domain) or commodities (CFTC domain), which is essential for creating a unified regulatory framework. Q3: What is the digital asset market structure bill mentioned? A3: It’s proposed legislation from the Republican-led Congress intended to provide clear rules for the crypto industry and firmly establish the U.S. as the global center for cryptocurrency. Q4: How will clear regulation benefit the average crypto investor? A4: Clear rules will enhance consumer protection, reduce fraud, increase market stability, and give investors more confidence to participate, knowing there are established guidelines and oversight. Q5: Could this “dream team” approach stifle innovation? A5: The goal is balanced regulation that protects investors without stifling growth. A clear framework can actually foster innovation by giving companies the legal certainty they need to build and invest. Q6: What happens next in this regulatory process? A6: The next steps involve continued SEC-CFTC collaboration, potential passage of the market structure bill in Congress, and the development of specific regulatory guidelines based on the new framework.

Our ENA price prediction expects a maximum of $0.82 in 2025. In 2031, we expect the ENA price to achieve $7.38. Ethena is a stablecoin project built on Ethereum that offers USDe, a fully decentralized coin pegged to the US dollar. Unlike stablecoins such as USDC or USDT, USDe doesn’t depend on banks or centralized companies for reserves. Instead, it uses a cash-and-carry trading strategy to keep its value equal to the dollar. For investors who prioritize decentralization, USDe could be an appealing choice — especially since it currently offers staking rewards above 9%. However, critics caution that since the project is still new, it’s uncertain whether USDe’s high yields and dollar peg can remain stable during a market downturn. Based on these developments, we’ve compiled our Ethena price prediction from 2025-2031. In this article, we’ll find out “Will ENA reach $10?” and explore the factors behind ENA price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethena Ticker ENA Price $0.21 (+2%) Market cap $3.59 Trading volume (24-hour) $457M Circulating supply 7.15B ENA All-time high $1.52 (11 April, 2024) All-time low $0.1858 (11 October, 2025) ENA technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.21 Price Prediction $ 0.2348 (+1.5%) Fear & Greed Index 26 (Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 10.54% (Very High) Green Days 12/30 (40%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.3373 200-Day SMA $ 0.4831 14-Day RSI 46.80 (Neutral) ENA price analysis Resistance for ENA is at $0.2151 Support for ENA/USD is at $0.2020 The ENA price analysis for December 22 confirms that ENA witnessed bullish pressure as it surged toward $0.21. Currently, the ENA price is preparing for a recovery rally. Ethena price analysis 1-day chart: ENA price triggers bullish momentum Analyzing the daily price chart of ENA tokens, ENA witnessed a bullish correction after buyers pushed the price toward resistance lines. Buyers are now aiming for a hold above the immediate Fib channels around $0.22. The 24-hour volume surged toward $24 million, showing a surge in trading interest today. Ethena’s price is currently trading at $0.21, which has surged by over 2% in the last 24 hours. ENA/USDT Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and hovers within the neutral region at 31, showing that bulls control price momentum slightly. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. ENA/USDT 4-hour price chart: Buyers aim big above EMA levels The 4-hour ENA price chart suggests that ENA experienced a bearish activity around EMA lines, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart. Currently, buyers aim for a strong rebound above the EMA20 trend line. ENA/USDT Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a bearish region at 0.11, suggesting that sellers are trying to build pressure near resistance levels and boost downward correction. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening selling positions. ENA price predictions: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.4056 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.3367 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.3254 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.2973 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.3373 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.4831 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.4831 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.3005 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.3462 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.4359 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.5275 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.5549 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.5118 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.4874 SELL What to expect from ENA price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the ENA price from an immediate surge. However, if the ENA price successfully breaks above $0.2151, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.227. ENA/USDT Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, ENA price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.2020, resulting in a correction to $0.1896. Is ENA a good investment? Whether ENA is a good investment depends on your goals and how much risk you’re comfortable with. Ethena has been ranked among the 100 cryptocurrencies. Still, there are questions about its demand, given its similarity to algorithmic stablecoins — a concept that lost trust after LUNA’s collapse in 2022. Even so, Ethena has shown strong performance during market surges, making it a solid project in the crypto market. If you believe in the project’s future and don’t mind the ups and downs, it might be worth putting in a small amount. Why is the ENA price up today? ENA’s price gained buying pressure around recent lows, resulting in a minor upward push. This created a surge toward $0.21. Will Ethena price recover? If buyers hold above the $0.25 level, we might see a comeback in buying demand. Will ENA reach $10? ENA price might reach the $10 mark in 2032 if buying demand surges and ENA attracts altcoin investors. Will ENA reach $100? The $100 mark is a distant dream for ENA. This price level is achievable in the long run if ENA continues to expand its offerings and attract buying demand. Is Ethena a good long-term investment? ENA has gained popularity due to strong community support. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment. Recent news/ Opinion on ENA 21Shares has launched the Ethena ETP (EENA) on European exchanges, giving investors regulated access to ENA and following Ethena’s strong $151M Q3 fees and its new Hyperliquid partnership. https://twitter.com/21shares/status/1996138559808389331?s=20 Ethena (ENA) price prediction December 2025 Over the last few days, ENA prices have aimed to surge above crucial Fib levels.

ENA historical price sentiment ENA Price History: Coinmarketcap Ethena’s price history from mid-2024 to late 2025 shows a period of intense volatility marked by sharp fluctuations in both price and market capitalization. In early 2024, Ethena traded strongly, reaching highs around $1.20 in April, supported by high trading volumes exceeding $8 billion. However, by mid-2024, the token began to decline steadily, closing near $0.38 by July as investor sentiment weakened and market activity cooled. The latter half of 2024 saw further instability. Ethena’s price dropped as low as $0.20 in September, reflecting a major correction phase in the broader crypto market. Despite these setbacks, the token demonstrated resilience, climbing back above $1.00 by December 2024. This late-year rally suggested renewed interest from traders and potential ecosystem developments. In 2025, Ethena continued to experience wide swings. The token opened the year near $1.25 but faced sustained downward pressure through the spring, dipping below $0.30 by June. A strong recovery followed in the third quarter, with prices surpassing $0.70 in August and stabilizing near $0.50 by October. Throughout this period, Ethena’s market cap ranged from $1 billion to over $5 billion. In early November, the price of ENA declined toward $0.3. By the end of November, ENA declined below $0.23.",Crypto Price Predictions|ENA|Ethena,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ENA|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-22 18:56:59

A crypto analyst has identified a developing Double Bottom pattern, suggesting that the cryptocurrency’s downtrend may be ending. Although the price performance over the past months has been muted and slow, now trading about 50% below its all-time high, analysts still believe that the altcoin is primed for a sharp upside move to $2.5. XRP Double Bottom To Fuel Surge To $2.5 Crypto market analyst Niels has indicated that XRP is showing signs of a potential bullish turnaround , which could trigger a price surge to $2.5. In his X post, he presented a fresh technical analysis, highlighting a Double Bottom formation beginning to take shape on the chart. The chart also shows that the price has reacted strongly twice from the same demand area, reinforcing the Double Bottom setup. Notably, the Double Bottom is emerging after months of sustained downside pressure, during which the altcoin remained firmly locked in a bearish structure . The decline initially kept its consolidation around $2 . However, it recently pushed the token as low as $1.8 before price action stabilized and recovered modestly above $1.9. In his analysis, Neils also highlighted that momentum indicators are starting to align with a possible trend reversal for the token. According to him, XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has already bottomed out, suggesting that selling pressure may be exhausted. He also observed that price action is showing encouraging signs, which often precedes a stronger upside move when supported by market momentum. Niels further explained that the altcoin recently dipped below a key support zone before quickly reclaiming it, forming a fakeout. With momentum improving and support holding, the analyst predicts that it could soon rally toward the $2.3 to $2.5 range over the next few weeks if market conditions remain favorable. XRP Shows Signs Of Strength Despite Ongoing Downtrend In a separate analysis, crypto market expert Broke Doomer highlighted that XRP remains in a downward trend but is showing signs of resilience . He noted that support levels continue to hold strong with buyers stepping in at each level, preventing a steeper decline. Doomer also stated that seller momentum is weakening as the token maintains a strong low, suggesting that any upside shift could happen quickly. Given its growing strength and steady price recovery , the analyst has predicted that the cryptocurrency could first target a reclaim of $2.20 before moving toward $2.60. His chart also points to a higher target for XRP if it can cross $2.6, forecasting a potential rise back toward $3. If this happens, it would represent a roughly 56% increase from its price of $1.92 at the time of writing.",XRP|Altcoin|Broke Doomer|Double-Bottom Formation|Niels|relative strength index|ripple|RSI|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-22 19:00:24

Instead, they reveal their presence through long-term charts, subtle momentum shifts, and repeating historical patterns. For XRP—a digital asset known for extended compression phases followed by explosive expansions —those signals are quietly resurfacing. As macro liquidity conditions evolve and regulatory uncertainty around Ripple has largely faded, analysts are increasingly questioning whether XRP is approaching another major inflection point ahead of 2026. That discussion intensified after crypto analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO shared a new multi-timeframe technical outlook on X. He highlighted a rare signal on XRP’s three-week chart, a timeframe typically reserved for identifying cycle-level reversals rather than short-term volatility. According to Steph, the current structure closely resembles conditions that formed near XRP’s 2022 bear market bottom. Rare Long-Term Momentum Signal Reappears At the core of the analysis is XRP’s three-week stochastic RSI, which has fallen into deeply oversold territory . Historically, similar readings on this timeframe have not marked further downside continuation. Instead, they have signaled seller exhaustion and the beginning of stealth accumulation. #XRP +1100% (Price Prediction 2026) pic.twitter.com/RQ3HaDG2yR — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 22, 2025 Steph noted that this signal has appeared only a few times in XRP’s history. Each instance preceded prolonged upside expansions rather than short-lived relief rallies. Higher-timeframe indicators carry added significance because they filter out speculative noise. When they reset from extreme oversold levels, they often reflect structural momentum shifts driven by long-term capital positioning, not retail speculation. Historical Cycles and Price Symmetry XRP’s historical price behavior follows a familiar rhythm. Extended consolidation phases are often followed by rapid repricing once momentum decisively flips. The 2017 bull cycle remains the most dramatic example, but similar patterns have repeated across later market phases. Steph’s comparison to the 2022 bottom is particularly relevant. That period marked the end of a prolonged distribution phase and the beginning of a gradual recovery across the broader crypto market. Historically, XRP’s largest percentage gains have emerged after sentiment reached extreme pessimism, liquidity thinned, and long-term momentum indicators reset simultaneously. Those same conditions are becoming increasingly visible again. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why Analysts Are Watching the 2026 Window The focus on 2026 is not based on technicals alone. Several structural factors converge within this timeframe. Ripple’s legal overhang is no longer a dominant market risk. Institutional experimentation with tokenized assets continues to expand. XRP’s role in cross-border settlement infrastructure remains intact. While none of these factors guarantee price appreciation, they represent a materially different backdrop from previous cycles dominated by regulatory uncertainty. Within this broader context, Steph’s projected +1100% upside scenario is framed as a multi-year expansion thesis, not a short-term price call. The projection assumes sustained momentum confirmation rather than an immediate breakout. Risk Factors and Confirmation Levels Despite the bullish implications, long-term indicators still require confirmation. Price structure, volume expansion, and broader market alignment remain essential. XRP also remains sensitive to macro liquidity trends and Bitcoin-led market cycles. Any price projection toward 2026 must account for volatility, extended consolidation phases, and the possibility of delayed execution. That said, history shows that when XRP’s higher-timeframe momentum resets, the asset rarely remains dormant for long. If current signals continue to evolve as they have in previous cycles, the coming years could prove pivotal for XRP’s long-term valuation.

The largest U.S. bank is assessing products including spot and derivatives trading as part of efforts to expand its crypto footprint, Bloomberg reported , citing a person familiar with the plans. The move would represent a major evolution for JPMorgan, which has gradually increased blockchain activity despite CEO Jamie Dimon’s long-standing criticism of Bitcoin . While the plans remain in early stages and depend on client demand, the development shows accelerating institutional adoption across traditional finance as regulatory clarity improves and market infrastructure matures. JPMorgan Chase Building. | Source: JPMorganChase JPMorgan’s Expanding Blockchain Strategy Takes Shape JPMorgan’s markets division is evaluating what crypto products and services could be offered to institutional clients, according to Bloomberg’s report. The assessment includes both spot trading and derivatives offerings, though concrete plans have not been finalized and will depend on sufficient client demand for specific products. The bank declined to comment on the report, which even Reuters could not independently verify . JPMorgan has been active in blockchain infrastructure despite Dimon’s public skepticism toward Bitcoin, which he has compared to “ pet rocks ” and called a “ hyped-up fraud .” In May, Dimon told investors JPMorgan would allow clients to buy Bitcoin while stating, “ We’re not going to custody it. “ “I defend your right to buy Bitcoin.” – Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan CEO https://t.co/zc8CjKdAb9 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) May 19, 2025 Earlier this month, JPMorgan arranged a short-term bond for Galaxy Digital on the Solana blockchain, demonstrating its expanding blockchain capabilities. The bank also launched its first tokenized money-market fund , the MONY fund, on Ethereum in December with $100 million in initial capital through its Kinexys Digital Assets platform. The fund is available to qualified investors with at least $5 million in investable assets and accepts subscriptions in cash or USDC stablecoin. Wall Street’s Broader Embrace of Digital Assets JPMorgan’s potential crypto trading launch would follow Morgan Stanley’s announcement that it will offer crypto trading on its E*Trade platform starting in the first half of 2026 through a partnership with Zerohash. Charles Schwab CEO Rick Wurster also announced the $11.6 trillion firm will begin offering Bitcoin trading in the first half of 2026, noting that 20% of Schwab clients already own crypto. “ We have lots of clients who have the vast majority of their assets at Schwab but are holding some at digitally native firms and keep asking us to launch this so they can bring their crypto assets to us, ” Wurster said in a CNBC interview. The moves reflect growing institutional demand as regulatory frameworks clarify under President Donald Trump, who has pledged to make America the “ crypto capital of the world .” President Donald Trump reiterated his vision of making the U.S. the ""crypto capital"" at a Miami conference. Will this stance drive policy changes? #CryptoRegulation #CryptoPolicy #Web3 https://t.co/0HP5gog3PA — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 20, 2025 Back in September, Veteran Wall Street strategist Jordi Visser predicted that U.S. financial institutions would increase their Bitcoin exposure before the end of 2025, and that prediction is now close to becoming a reality. “ Between now and the end of the year, the allocations for Bitcoin from the traditional finance world are going to be increased ,” Visser told Anthony Pompliano, adding that traditional players are preparing for 2026 with bigger Bitcoin positions. Market Headwinds Test Bitcoin’s Institutional Appeal Despite growing Wall Street interest, Bitcoin faces challenging market conditions as it trades range-bound below key recovery levels. Speaking with Cryptonews, Ray Youssef, CEO of crypto super app NoOnes, noted that Bitcoin has failed to deliver on its hedge narrative in 2025, with the asset demonstrating heightened sensitivity to macroeconomic factors rather than trading like digital gold. “ BTC’s upside is now tied to liquidity expansion, sovereign policy clarity, and risk sentiment, rather than to monetary debasement alone, ” Youssef said. “ From a market-structure perspective, Bitcoin remains stuck in a compressing, range-bound action bout. “ Bitcoin continues struggling to overcome resistance around $93,000 while defending support at $85,000. Source: TradingView U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF holdings have declined less than 5% despite a more than 30% drawdown from October highs, indicating institutional allocators are largely holding positions. “ Selling pressure is primarily retail-driven from leveraged and short-term participants ,” Youssef added. Additionally, last month, JPMorgan analysts projected that Bitcoin could climb to $170,000 within six to twelve months as perpetual futures deleveraging completes. Currently, the global crypto market is valued at around $3.1 trillion, with Bitcoin accounting for approximately $1.8 trillion, and is projected to reach a new ATH next year as adoption grows.

The computing power is behind this transformation as it is the central element that provides networks and blockchain functioning. The cloud mining has emerged as one of the most viable methods through which an average user can engage in this infrastructure without the need to own and run any physical mining equipment. Fleet Mining has also introduced a special Christmas cloud mining initiative in this Christmas that incorporates stable mining revenue with a progressive cashback system, the deposit cashback and the contract cashback. This event can be of special interest to users who would like to participate in an organized, automated way, During the event, a single account can earn over $200,000. The reason Cloud Mining is relevant to the modern blockchain market With the increase in the size of blockchain networks, mining has become a capital-intensive and highly optimized business. To the majority of users, it is not efficient or practical to run mining hardware on their own. Cloud mining fills this void by enabling users to use professional mining infrastructures using transparent contracts. The main benefits of the participants are: • No equipment acquisition or service. • None of electricity or running management. • Automated mining manufacture with the settlement of profits on a daily basis. • Periodic expenditure and foreseeable production. Fleet Mining improves the given model by incorporating renewable energy and AI-controlled resource management, which enables more effective distribution of computing resources and better cost control. Power of the Infrastructure of Fleet Mining Fleet Mining is a globally-based cloud mining that is founded on scale, efficiency, and transparency: • Wind and solar-powered mining farms across 97 countries all over the world. • More than 3 million simultaneously working mining machines. • Artificial intelligence hash rate assignment. • Clear contracts, where there is automatic settlement of incomes on a daily basis. This infrastructure will allow Fleet Mining to accommodate high mining capacity with competitive incentive schemes whenever there is special event like Christmas. Christmas Double Cashback Program – Explained The essence of the Christmas event is one of the two reward systems that boost the effective mining value of users since the onset. Deposit Cashback The users can get automatic cashback during the Christmas event depending on the amount of the deposit: • $1,000–$4,999: 2% cashback • $5,000–$9,999: 3% cashback • $10,000–$29,999: 6% cashback • $30,000–$99,999: 13% cashback • 100,000 and higher: 20 percent cashback (Christmas tier) The cashback is automatically credited with no application. Contract Cashback More cashback is also offered to the user who buys specific cloud mining contracts: • Contract cashback may go to $50,000, and above. • Increase in contract value will open up larger cashback ratios. • Contract cashback is over and above deposit cashback. This implies that two separate rewards are produced by one deposit and one contract purchase. Case of Cashback Stacking To illustrate, when a user deposits a sum of money of $100,000, they earn up to a sum of $20,000 as cashback on their deposit. On buying a high valuing mining contract further cashback of contract is added. The effective mining power is much greater to the user compared to the normal periods with the same capital input. Supported Cryptocurrencies Fleet Mining plans various mainstream cryptocurrencies (flexible participation): BTC, ETH, XRP, DOGE, USDT, USDC, and BCH. How the Mining Process Works 1. Create account with Fleet Mining. 2. Deposit money and have automatic cashback. 3. Choose a cloud mining agreement. 4. When the contract is activated, the AI-based system of Fleet Mining makes automatic real-time allocation of the hash power and does not require a manual process. 5. Mining profits can be withdrawn or reinvested and settled on a daily basis. New users should also be advised to begin with moderate quantity to familiarize themselves with the process and then increase the participation afterwards. Additional Revenue Opportunity In the Christmas event, the referral program of Fleet Mining will be productive: • Referral commission: 4.5% • No limit on referrals • No further investment was needed. Conclusion The cloud mining program at Fleet Mining is based on the current environment of the mature blockchain infrastructure. It provides a formal solution to users to engage in the mining rewards by adding automated cloud mining and transparent contracts with a double cashback mechanism, providing users with an efficient way to engage in the rewards. It offers an easy and straightforward point of entry to the new users. To the existing participants, it provides them with good terms to increase the mining capacity throughout the season of Christmas.

Regulatory uncertainty is back in the headlines, and traders feel it in every stalled chart and sideways candle. While some participants freeze and wait for answers, others scan for early momentum plays that move before rules solidify. That tension defines the current cycle. On one side, lawmakers debate how decentralized finance should be handled. On the other, traders react in real time. Capital does not pause for committee hearings. It rotates toward conviction, speed, and early access. That rotation explains why attention is shifting toward projects designed for early positioning rather than late speculation. This moment also highlights a pattern crypto veterans know well. When regulation clouds the market, large assets hesitate, midcaps consolidate, and early stage opportunities attract the boldest flows. That behavior is not new, but the names involved always change. Today, that shift places Apeing at the center of conversation around the upcoming crypto presale 2026 . Regulatory Fog Thickens as Elizabeth Warren Pressures DeFi The latest jolt came after Elizabeth Warren escalated scrutiny around decentralized exchanges. Her focus on PancakeSwap placed DeFi enforcement into a political conflict that regulators cannot easily resolve. The issue is not only compliance but authority. Existing frameworks struggle to define responsibility inside decentralized systems. According to reporting from CryptoSlate and other regulatory analysts, Warren’s move effectively forces Trump era regulators into a dilemma. Either they act against DeFi protocols with unclear jurisdiction or admit regulatory gaps that Congress has not filled. That uncertainty sends a signal markets understand instantly. When rules are unclear, risk appetite shifts. Historical data from Chainalysis shows that regulatory ambiguity often reduces activity in large, compliance sensitive assets first. Traders hesitate because downside risk becomes unpredictable. Meanwhile, capital looks for asymmetric setups that benefit from early entry rather than mature valuation. This dynamic explains why early stage narratives accelerate during moments like this. This environment creates fertile ground for projects that emphasize timing and access. Instead of waiting for post clarity rallies, traders move toward whitelisting phases that offer position advantage before broader participation begins. That behavioral shift is central to why Apeing keeps surfacing in discussions tied to the upcoming crypto presale 2026. Why Apeing Keeps Leading the Upcoming Crypto Presale 2026 Apeing’s appeal starts with structure. The project is built around early entry mechanics rather than delayed speculation. Stage 1 access is expected near $0.0001, with projected listing levels near $0.001. That gap creates a baseline 10x framework before momentum even enters the picture. Blockchain developers often emphasize that early token distribution shapes long term market behavior. Limited allocation at initial stages concentrates upside for participants who commit early. The Apeing model aligns with that principle by restricting early supply and rewarding whitelisted participants first. Market psychology also plays a role. When fear dominates headlines, traders seek control. Whitelisting offers control over entry price rather than emotional buying during volatility. That sense of agency resonates strongly during regulatory uncertainty. It explains why Apeing discussions increasingly reference upcoming crypto presale 2026 opportunities instead of reactive trades. Apeing Whitelisting and Early Access Mechanics Whitelisting serves as the gatekeeper for Apeing participation. It determines who enters first and at what cost. According to project documentation shared across developer channels, whitelisted users secure priority access before public distribution begins. Early access matters because price discovery happens fast. Once broader participation opens, entry costs rise quickly. By locking access early, participants reduce exposure to sudden volatility spikes driven by hype cycles. That dynamic mirrors patterns seen in previous successful launches documented by Messari research. For traders watching the upcoming crypto presale 2026 landscape, this structure stands out. It prioritizes preparation over reaction. In a market where hesitation often leads to missed opportunity, that design philosophy resonates strongly. Hyperliquid Climbs as Momentum Traders Return Carefully While regulatory noise dominates headlines, price action still matters. Hyperliquid has captured attention with sharp upside moves that cut through broader market hesitation. Recent data shows HYPEUSD climbing above $25 with daily gains near 11.86%. That move reflects renewed interest in derivatives focused infrastructure that thrives on volatility. Analysts tracking RSI and MACD indicators point out that Hyperliquid sits near oversold recovery zones despite recent gains. According to technical breakdowns published on Yahoo Finance and Messari dashboards, this setup often attracts short term traders looking for continuation rather than long term positioning. Volume expansion supports that thesis. However, Hyperliquid’s rally also highlights a limit. Fast moving price action excites momentum traders, but it does not always offer clean entry for late participants. Once volatility spikes, risk management tightens. That reality pushes a different group of traders toward early allocation opportunities instead of chasing green candles. Stellar Prepares for a Technical Reversal Under Pressure Stellar presents a different picture. XLM remains under bearish momentum, yet indicators suggest a potential reversal forming beneath the surface. Technical analysis from Blockchain.News highlights RSI drifting near oversold levels, with Bollinger Band compression signaling a possible breakout attempt toward $0.30 if support holds. This setup attracts patient traders rather than impulse buyers. Stellar’s long term value lies in infrastructure partnerships and cross border settlement use cases. However, short term price action remains tied to broader sentiment. When regulation clouds the sector, even strong fundamentals struggle to move independently. Market data shows XLM trading near critical support around $0.22. A break below risks deeper downside, while a bounce could trigger relief rallies. That uncertainty reinforces the same behavioral split seen elsewhere. Some traders wait for confirmation. Others seek asymmetric early entry plays unaffected by near term resistance. Conclusion According to insights from the Best Crypto To Buy Now , Regulatory pressure from Elizabeth Warren targeting PancakeSwap has reintroduced fear into crypto markets. Hyperliquid rallies while Stellar waits for confirmation. In that environment, traders shift behavior. They stop chasing and start positioning. Apeing benefits from that shift. Its early access model aligns with market psychology during uncertainty. By prioritizing whitelisting and entry control, it positions itself at the center of the upcoming crypto presale 2026 narrative. The market never waits. It rewards those who move while others hesitate. For More Information: Website: Visit the Official Apeing Website Telegram: Join the Apeing Telegram Channel Twitter: Follow Apeing ON X (Formerly Twitter) FAQ About the Upcoming Crypto Presale What is driving interest in Apeing right now Regulatory uncertainty is pushing traders toward early access opportunities with structured entry. Why does whitelisting matter in crypto launches It allows participants to secure lower entry prices before public demand increases. Is the upcoming crypto presale 2026 risky Yes. All early stage crypto participation carries risk and requires independent research. How does Hyperliquid influence market sentiment Its volatility attracts momentum traders and highlights the importance of timing. Summary Regulatory pressure led by Elizabeth Warren targeting PancakeSwap has intensified uncertainty across crypto markets. As Hyperliquid rallies and Stellar consolidates, trader behavior shifts toward early access strategies. Apeing emerges as a focal point due to its structured whitelisting model and low entry mechanics. In an environment where regulation clouds price discovery, early positioning defines opportunity. Apeing’s approach aligns with that reality, placing it at the center of the upcoming crypto presale 2026 narrative. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

We have yet to see whether 2026 will see a resurgence, so we asked four of the most widely used AI-powered chatbots which meme coin has the best chance of becoming the top performer. PEPE to Shine Again? ChatGPT estimated that the frog-themed PEPE is best-positioned to deliver the biggest gains next year, citing its strong community, recognition among investors, and ability to follow the bullish trend of the crypto market. “PEPE’s biggest strength is that it has already graduated from pure hype into a proven market structure. It survived its first major boom-and-bust cycle, which is where most meme coins die. Assets that live through that phase tend to become default liquidity hubs when the sector heats up again,” it added. The chatbot placed BONK as its second-best pick. It claimed that the meme coin’s price can skyrocket in 2026, assuming Solana (the ecosystem it is built upon) has a strong year. Grok outlined quite a similar prediction. It forecasted that PEPE will emerge as the top-performing meme coin next year because it is “a battle-tested survivor from previous cycles with a massive, dedicated community.” According to the chatbot integrated into the social media platform X, other solid bets for 2026 include WIF, BONK, FLOKI, and BRETT. Google’s Gemini also picked PEPE as the “best-positioned” meme coin to lead in percentage gains next year. At the same time, it warned that the top performer may be an asset that doesn’t exist yet or is currently in a quiet accumulation phase. How About DOGE? Perplexity paid special attention to the biggest meme coin in terms of market capitalization, highlighting its “unmatched liquidity, community strength, and history of outperforming in bull markets.” That said, it predicted that DOGE could be the sector’s winner next year, eyeing a whopping ascent to a new all-time high of $1.70. On the other hand, it described PEPE as “the worst bet” for the following 12 months, alerting investors to stay away from the asset due to fading whale interest and bearish technicals, which signal additional corrections.

According to real-time data from Binance’s USDT trading pair, BTC is currently trading at $88,981.16. This movement has sent ripples through the crypto community, prompting investors to ask: what’s driving this decline, and what comes next? What Caused the Bitcoin Price to Drop Below $89,000? Market analysts point to several immediate factors contributing to this Bitcoin price correction. First, there appears to be significant profit-taking activity following Bitcoin’s recent rally. Many investors who bought at lower levels are now securing gains, creating selling pressure. Moreover, broader macroeconomic concerns, including potential interest rate adjustments, often trigger volatility in risk assets like cryptocurrency. Finally, technical indicators showed Bitcoin was overbought on shorter timeframes, suggesting a pullback was likely. How Significant Is This Price Movement? While any drop can feel alarming, context is crucial. A decline of this magnitude represents a standard market correction within a volatile asset class. Historically, Bitcoin has experienced much larger drawdowns during bull markets. Therefore, this move may represent healthy consolidation rather than a trend reversal. However, monitoring key support levels is essential for understanding the market’s next direction. For traders and long-term holders, this volatility presents both challenges and opportunities. The key is to differentiate between normal market noise and fundamental shifts in sentiment. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Navigating Bitcoin price swings requires a clear strategy. Here are practical steps to consider: Review Your Portfolio Allocation: Ensure your exposure to Bitcoin aligns with your overall risk tolerance and investment goals. Dollar-Cost Average (DCA): For long-term investors, periodic buying during dips can be an effective strategy to lower your average entry price. Set Clear Stop-Losses: Active traders should define their risk parameters in advance to protect capital during unexpected moves. Focus on Fundamentals: Short-term price action can be distracting. Remember to assess long-term adoption trends, regulatory developments, and network activity. What’s the Outlook for Bitcoin Now? The immediate technical picture suggests traders will watch how Bitcoin behaves around the $88,000 and $85,000 levels for potential support. A sustained break below could signal further downside. Conversely, a quick recovery above $90,000 would indicate strong buyer interest. Beyond charts, on-chain data, such as exchange flows and whale wallet activity, will provide clues about investor conviction. Ultimately, the Bitcoin price is influenced by a complex mix of technicals, macroeconomics, and market sentiment. Today’s drop serves as a reminder of the asset’s inherent volatility. Conclusion: Navigating Market Volatility with Confidence Bitcoin’s dip below $89,000 is a significant market event that demands attention but not panic. By understanding the potential causes—from profit-taking to macroeconomic shifts—investors can make more informed decisions. The core principles of prudent investing remain: conduct your own research, manage risk, and maintain a long-term perspective. Market corrections are a natural part of the financial landscape, especially in cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why did Bitcoin’s price fall today? The drop is likely due to a combination of profit-taking by traders after a recent rally, broader macroeconomic uncertainty, and technical indicators signaling an overbought condition. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? That depends entirely on your investment strategy. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) investors might see it as an opportunity, while others may wait for more confirmation of a support level. Always do your own research. How low could the Bitcoin price go? Predicting exact price targets is impossible. Traders are watching key support levels near $88,000 and $85,000. The market’s direction will depend on buying pressure and broader sentiment. Does this mean the bull market is over? Not necessarily. Bull markets are typically characterized by strong upward trends interspersed with sharp corrections. A single down day does not define a long-term trend. Where can I track the Bitcoin price reliably? Use reputable data aggregators or major exchange websites like Binance, Coinbase, or Kraken for real-time prices. Always cross-reference data from multiple sources. What should I do if I’m holding Bitcoin? Assess your original investment thesis. If the long-term reasons for holding are still valid, short-term volatility may be less concerning. Consider rebalancing if your portfolio’s risk profile has changed. Found this analysis of the Bitcoin price movement helpful?

After recovering from a dip toward the $85,000 area last week, Bitcoin has spent most of the time trading between roughly $87,500 and $89,000, struggling to build a sustained move in either direction. This ongoing indecision has led to technical commentary from a crypto analyst known as DrBullZeus, who noted that Bitcoin is currently trapped inside a clearly defined range and may need a decisive breakout before the next directional move becomes clear. Bitcoin Continues To Respect A Well-Defined Range According to the analysis, Bitcoin is still trading inside a clearly established range, repeatedly bouncing between the same support and resistance zones. These zones are highlighted in the 1-hour candlestick timeframe chart below, which shows the Bitcoin price oscillating between a lower support area around the mid-$87,000 region and an upper resistance band just below $90,000. Related Reading: Crypto Founder Reveals What Will Drive Bitcoin Price To $200,000 In 2026 Multiple daily candlesticks have tested both zones without producing sustained follow-through, and this strengthens the idea that neither bulls nor bears currently have full control. Short-term breakouts have quickly stalled, and pullbacks have failed to develop into deeper corrections. This type of price behavior suggests equilibrium, where buyers step in near support, and sellers defend resistance to keep the price volatility contained. Important Levels That Could Define The Next Major Move According to the technical analysis, Bitcoin’s next direction depends on how the price reacts around two clearly defined levels. The resistance zone just below $90,000 is the main hurdle on the upside. Related Reading: Don’t Expect A Fast Bitcoin Move – Here’s How Long The Last Leg Could Take A clean break and sustained hold above this area would mean that buyers are finally gaining control and allow for a push to the $92,000 level highlighted on the chart. Recent attempts to move higher have stalled at this zone, which is why a decisive breakout would likely attract fresh momentum and shift short-term sentiment from range trading to bullish. On the downside, support in the $87,000 range is still acting as a buffer against deeper losses. As long as this level holds, the range structure between support and resistance will stay intact. However, a clear loss of this support would change the short-term sentiment from range trading to bearish very quickly. This, in turn, will expose Bitcoin to a move back toward the $85,000 area, where price previously found strong demand in early December. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $89,690, up by 1.1% in the past 24 hours. The latest price action has been shaped by a rebound from an intraday low near $87,655, a level that closely aligns with the support zone highlighted in the technical analysis and reinforces its importance in the current market structure.

According to CryptoRank data, industry leaders used these stages to outline priorities that extend beyond price cycles. Collectively, these discussions point toward structural changes shaping crypto markets through 2026. Besides speculation, the focus now centers on real utility, institutional readiness, and user expansion. Consequently, five themes stand out as potential drivers of the next crypto era. Stablecoins Move Into the Financial Core Stablecoins emerged as the strongest shared narrative across all three ecosystems. Binance CEO Richard Teng emphasized their growing role in global payments and institutional settlement rails. Hence, stablecoins now act as bridges between crypto networks and traditional finance systems. Solana strengthened this trend by supporting new dollar-linked assets such as jupUSD and USDGO. Additionally, USD+ expands Solana’s appeal for on-chain commerce and treasury operations. Coinbase advanced the concept further by unveiling custom stablecoins for enterprises. These products allow companies to issue branded digital dollars with flexible backing models. Consequently, stablecoins now function as programmable financial infrastructure rather than simple trading tools. Tokenization Expands Beyond Theory Real-world asset tokenization also gained momentum across the conferences. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao engaged in a public debate around digital gold concepts and trust assumptions. However, the broader industry focus shifted toward execution rather than philosophy. Solana-backed initiatives accelerated this shift through large-scale deployments. Keel launched a $500 million program to tokenize real-world assets directly on Solana. Moreover, Bhutan introduced TER, a sovereign-backed gold token for global markets. JPMorgan added credibility by settling a short-term bond issuance on Solana. Coinbase plans to consolidate these efforts through its upcoming Coinbase Tokenize platform. Hence, tokenization now moves from experimentation toward regulated institutional use. Regulation, AI, and New Market Formats Converge Regulatory alignment appeared as a shared strategic priority. Binance and Solana highlighted growing corporate inflows and structured TradFi partnerships. Meanwhile, Coinbase doubled down on compliance-first product design to attract institutions. Additionally, prediction markets gained renewed attention despite limited stage time. YZi Labs backed multiple prediction-focused startups this month. Solana wallets now integrate prediction tools through Kalshi partnerships. Coinbase also rolled out Kalshi-powered prediction markets inside its app. AI integration further reinforced platform differentiation. Binance announced AI-driven trading and risk tools targeting 2026. Solflare launched Magic AI for conversational on-chain actions. Coinbase introduced Coinbase Advisor, offering in-app financial guidance powered by AI. Significantly, user growth strategies tied these trends together. Binance Junior targets younger audiences through controlled crypto education. Moreover, Solana DEX trading will soon integrate directly into the Coinbase app. Consequently, crypto platforms now prioritize accessibility, compliance, and real-world functionality over hype-driven expansion.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-22 19:32:42

Analysts from 10X Research observed that year-end liquidity is evaporating across crypto markets, with futures positioning, ETF flows, and options markets indicating that traders are de-risking going into 2026. In current market conditions, major altcoins like XRP, SOL, and ETH are standing out as some of the best crypto to buy now. Ripple (XRP): Price Approaches Oversold Territory After 50% Correction Ripple’s XRP has proven itself as a major crypto asset since its 2012 launch. As one of the OG crypto coins, XRP has withstood a decade of stress-testing and maintains a market cap above $115 billion as the 5th largest crypto asset. Over the past 15 months, XRP has been a standout performer, rising from a $0.49 low last October to a $3.66 high in July before settling around $1.92 at press time. The XRP/USDT weekly chart shows the RSI at 38.32, approaching oversold territory, making XRP one of the best crypto to buy before it reclaims its 9-week SMA at $2.13. Source: TradingView If the five spot XRP ETFs currently live in the U.S. continue gaining momentum and Ripple’s $RLUSD grows into a top-3 USD stablecoin, XRP should surge above $3.00 and potentially set a new all-time high in 2026. Solana (SOL): 3.5X Cheaper Than Ethereum Despite More Revenue Solana(SOL) is a high-performance blockchain platform designed for fast, low-cost transactions and decentralized applications. Its native token, SOL, launched in March 2020 by Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal, has rallied over 500X from $0.50 to over $250. However, volatility has seen SOL drop over 50% from its highs , making it attractive at the current $125 price level. Source: TradingView Technical analysis shows SOL is moving to test the accumulation zone between $130-$180 in the coming weeks. SOL is now trading at 3.5X lower than Ethereum’s market cap despite Q2 2025 revenue of $271 million, which outpaces that of Ethereum. Analysts view the current support as a buy zone for potential rallies to $150-$160 short-term and $200-$300 longer-term. Ethereum (ETH): Analyst Eyes $4,000 Recovery In 2026 Ethereum(ETH) is a decentralized blockchain platform enabling smart contracts and dApps, with its native ETH token standing as the second-largest crypto by market cap, worth over $365 billion. Since launching in July 2015 after being conceived by Vitalik Buterin in 2013, ETH has surged over 5,000X from $0.40 to a recent high near $5,000. Analysts say ETH is presenting another buying opportunity, currently down 38.64% from its 2025 highs. The recent recovery above $3,000 is positive, and if this level holds, technical analysis shows the next resistance levels stand between $3,600-$4,000 and $4,400-$4,80,0, respectively. Provided ETH doesn’t fall below the long-term $2,400 weekly support, 2026 could see prices rally above $4,000 and set new all-time highs.

The passage of the Virtual Asset Service Providers Bill into law was announced by Bank of Ghana (BoG) Governor Johnson Asiama on Sunday. The bill, which legalizes crypto in Ghana , is the response of the country’s parliament to central bank concerns about the widening and unregulated use of crypto as an alternative asset by its citizens. Is crypto legal in Ghana? With the passage of the bill , the country takes a step towards facilitating the licensing of crypto platforms and properly supervising activity, Bank of Ghana Governor Johnson Asiama said during the weekend in the capital, Accra. “What this means is that now we have the framework to manage it and to manage the risks that can involve that kind of activity These are not just legal milestones; they are enablers of better policies, stronger supervision and more effective regulation,” Asiama said. It means that people dabbling in crypto in Ghana can do so with the full backing of the law and will not face arrest. The central bank hopes this will improve crypto transparency and regulation after reports claimed that about 3 million Ghanaians, or 17% of the adult population, deal in the virtual currency. That small percentage was able to process about $3 billion worth of crypto transactions in Ghana in the year through June 2024, according to estimates by Web3 Africa Group, an Accra-based company planning to set up crypto exchanges in Africa. According to Asiama, the law ensures that “emerging activity is brought within clear, accountable, and well-governed boundaries.” He claims regulatory oversight will “lower costs for banks, improve customer experience, support small and medium-sized enterprises and traders .” The Bank of Ghana (BoG) will be the primary regulator of the sector and will act with powers to license and supervise virtual asset service providers (VASPs), including exchanges, wallet providers, and custody services. However, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may also share oversight in some areas. While the bill legalizes crypto, it should be noted that it does not make it a legal tender. The country’s national currency, the cedi, will remain the legal tender. Ghana joins African countries pushing crypto adoption Ghana’s parliament has regulated cryptocurrency activity just as the country emerged as a significant player in crypto adoption across the region. According to Chainalysis’ 2025 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report, Ghana currently ranks among the top five Sub-Saharan African countries by total crypto value received between July 2024 and June 2025. And that was before the country’s parliament passed the bill legalizing crypto. Still, despite its current ranking, Ghana falls behind Nigeria in terms of crypto activity. Nigeria has dominated the region, receiving at least $92 billion in crypto value over the period, or nearly three times the amount recorded by South Africa, the report showed. The Sub-Saharan region received over $205 billion in on-chain value, a value that has gone up by about 52% from the previous year. This growth makes it the third-fastest growing region in the world, ranked behind Asia-Pacific and Latin America, according to Chainalysis . Now that Ghana has legalized crypto, more inflows and activities are expected, and observers have noted that the country’s participation in international regulatory frameworks could boost investor confidence and international cooperation. Other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, aside from Ghana and Nigeria, that have made similar moves regarding crypto and created regulatory frameworks include Kenya, South Africa, and Ethiopia.

Intersect builds and runs data centers and energy infrastructure. The deal will help Alphabet add more data center space and power capacity more quickly, the company said. Intersect will keep operating on its own after the purchase goes through. Google faces tough competition in artificial intelligence, especially from OpenAI. OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot in 2022, which started a huge surge in AI technology. OpenAI has pledged more than $1.4 trillion to build the data centers needed for its growing business. Alphabet wants to match that pace with this purchase. “Intersect will help us expand capacity, operate more nimbly in building new power generation in lockstep with new data center load, and reimagine energy solutions to drive US innovation and leadership,” said Sundar Pichai, who leads both Google and Alphabet. Texas operations central to the partnership Google already owned a small piece of Intersect from an investment last December. At that time, Intersect said it was working with Google and TPG Rise Climate to build gigawatts of data center capacity across America, including a $20 billion investment in clean energy infrastructure by 2030. Alphabet said Intersect will partner closely with Google’s infrastructure team, including work at a combined power and data center site in Haskell County, Texas. Google previously said it would invest $40 billion in Texas through 2027, building new data center facilities in Haskell and Armstrong counties. Texas has become a major destination for technology companies looking to build infrastructure. Several big names, including Anthropic, Meta Platforms Inc., and Microsoft, have announced plans to set up shop in the state, as reported by Cryptopolitan previously. All these investments show why Texas has turned into a hotspot for tech companies expanding their operations. However, some of Intersect’s California properties and certain Texas operations are not included in the sale. Those will stay with current investors TPG Rise Climate, Climate Adaptive Infrastructure, and Greenbelt Capital Partners as a separate company. The purchase should finish in the first half of 2026, pending standard approval requirements. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

They start quietly. Tokens accumulate, get consistent users and expand their audience even before they can be spotted on most radars. The early positioning has been achieved by the time the rest of the market pays attention to it. The new DeFi altcoin that currently seems to be exiting this silent period and entering a new stage of increasing popularity is one of them. The paradigm is slowly melting, yet the indicators are beginning to converge. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is a developing lending and borrowing protocol built to be used in practice. It is neither based on hype cycles but it is constructed around structured lending markets. Users are able to contribute assets in order to achieve yield and borrowers have access to liquidity subject to transparent regulations. This brings about a continuous activity based on demand rather than speculation. The protocol is built on dual marketplaces of lending and, as a result, enables it to satisfy the various user requirements without creating liquidity issues. Lending conditions are set, the collateral policies are explicit and the price is determined by how the loan is utilized and not on emotions. V1 is scheduled to the Sepolia testnet in the Q4 2025 according to official updates . At that release, silent growth is seen as actual performance. Expansion and Presale Growth Since widespread attention was yet to be given, participation was already accumulating. Mutuum Finance has raised approximately $19.4M and increased to over 18, 600 holders. Such expansion was not in one spurt. It grew in a steady pace through the stages, which is commonly indicative of a build up, but not hype. This trend is important in crypto investing. When the growth is constant, it implies that the interest is organically developing. Market analysts tend to consider it as a better indicator of health than spike along headlines. It also justifies why there are other leading crypto investors who started to follow the project when it was still unknown to many. The MUTM token is priced at $0.035 in presale. The maximum number of token supply is 4B, and 45.5% is shown to be allocated to presale phases. That equals roughly 1.82B tokens. To date approximately 820M tokens were sold, and Phase 6 is very nearly fully allocated. This stage changes behavior. In the case of abundant supply, participants are slow. When the allocation becomes tight, decisions become fast. The token has already increased 250% since the beginning of 2025 and this is even pre Phase 1. All stages have had an increased price that attracts costs that imply, entry levels move rapidly as stages progress. System Level Demand The difference between Mutuum Finance and other emerging crypto projects is that the demand will be modeled to shape up after being launched. Those users who provide assets are given mtTokens, which increase in value due to accruing interests. This is a reward in holding as opposed to short term trading. A buy and distribute mechanism is also developing in the protocol. MUTM bought in the market is redistributed to the users who deposit the mtTokens in the safety module. This is a direct relationship between buying pressure and protocol revenue. The more the lending, the more money is obtained. The more revenue is increased the more the demand for the token. The oracles here are very important, as they give the right prices and also safe liquidations and this gives confidence in the system. Security Stack and the Last Push Until it is generally adopted, serious DeFi crypto projects are likely to cryptoeconomically lock in security. Mutuum Finance has a CertiK scan score of 90/ 100. Its contracts are being officially scrutinized by Halborn Security , and a $50k bug bounty is on. These actions tend to be an indicator. When audits and reviews are seen many participants only listen. Security is not a hype maker but it does away with barriers. In a world where those barriers are dropped it can be visible. Phase 6 is now in the process of completion which is of course attracting an eye. Recent action has seen increased allocations and has been recorded to have an entry of whales valued at a reported $115k. The 24 hour leaderboard is still in existence, which rewards active contributors and access to card payments by the new participants has also increased activity. These factors, taken altogether, imply a transition point. Mutuum Finance no longer builds in silence. It is going through a period of supply tightness, infrastructure preparation, and shifting visibility. This is usually the point at which early positioning becomes mass exposure, to those who are scanning the crypto news and wondering what crypto to buy next.

56198030,647655,1766433615,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56198030.jpeg,"Bitcoin Is Entering A Window For A Santa Rally, Analyst Says",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-window-santa-rally-analyst/,"Bitcoin might be stumbling into a very seasonal setup, not because Santa is real, but because positioning and one of those composite “regime” dashboards are flashing the kind of “bullish, but not sweaty” signal traders love to cling to in late December. CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr. put it bluntly on X on Monday: “BTC is entering a window for a Santa rally: the Regime Score is bullish but not overheated. Short liquidations are reinforcing the asymmetry in favor of buyers.”That’s the headline claim. The longer version is basically: the market is in a zone that has historically had decent forward returns, and the derivatives plumbing is currently doing that annoying-but-useful thing where it mechanically pushes price higher when shorts get forced out. Will Bitcoin See A ‘Santa Rally’ This Year? In his Monday Substack post , Adler framed it as a tactical setup rather than some grand, end-of-year prophecy. “The BTC market is in the upper part of the Regime Score neutral zone, which has historically shown positive expected returns,” he wrote. Then he tightened the screw: “The current liquidation structure in the futures market indicates a predominance of short position closures, creating additional mechanical pressure in favor of buyers.” So what’s this Regime Score thing, exactly? Adler describes it as a composite indicator that “combines taker imbalance, OI pressure, funding, ETF flows , exchange flows, and price trend into a single scale from −100 to +100.” The number matters less than the band it sits in. Right now, he says the score “stands at +16.3, corresponding to the upper part of the neutral zone (+15 to +30).” And that particular subzone is doing the heavy lifting in his argument. “Backtesting for 2025 shows this subzone historically delivered average returns of +3.8% over 30 days,” Adler wrote, contrasting it with the weaker ranges below. He also pointed out that, “unlike the −15 to 0 subzone where expected returns were negative (−1.5% over 7d),” the +15 to +30 band tended to be a more forgiving place to put on risk. It’s also worth noting how quickly the tape can flip, because his own charting suggests it already did. Adler says the indicator “has emerged from a recent bearish phase (score dropped to −27 a week ago) and is showing recovery.” That’s the kind of detail traders latch onto: not just where you are, but how fast you got there. But here’s the funny part — the “most bullish” zone, in his backtest, wasn’t actually bullish for forward returns. He flags that “transition into the formal Bull regime (+30 and above) historically coincided with local tops” and that it “delivered negative average returns of −3.3% over 7 days.” In other words, if you wait for the indicator to scream “bull market,” you might be buying the exact moment everyone else is already leaning the same way. Which is why Adler ends up with a pretty trader-ish conclusion: the current band might be the sweet spot because it’s optimistic without being euphoric. “This means the current +15–30 zone may be optimal for tactical positions, while aggressive accumulation upon breaking +30 carries elevated risk,” he wrote. Then there’s the derivatives side — the part that can turn a calm-looking market into a sudden wick up (or down) just because leverage is sitting in the wrong place. Adler’s liquidation dominance oscillator is currently negative, which he reads as a short liquidation skew. “The oscillator’s current value has dropped into negative territory (−11%), while the 30-day moving average remains positive (+10%). This divergence points to a recent surge in forced short position closures,” he wrote. He doubles down with a second stat: “ Long Liquidation Dominance stands at 44%, below the 50% baseline, confirming the predominance of short liquidations.” Put simply: more shorts are getting forced out than longs are getting wiped, and those forced closes are buys. And his takeaway is basically: this is tactical fuel. “The predominance of short liquidations creates tactical fuel for upside,” Adler wrote, adding that the setup “reinforces the positive signal from Regime Score: the market has not only entered a zone with historically positive expected returns but is also receiving additional support from derivatives structure.” Still, this is Bitcoin, and these setups don’t last forever. Adler even lays out what would invalidate it, in pretty plain language. “A return of Regime Score below zero accompanied by a reversal of the liquidation oscillator into positive territory (rising long liquidations) would signal exhaustion of the current impulse,” he wrote. Translation: if longs start being the ones getting punished, that “asymmetry” flips. For now, he’s calling it a “bullish neutrality” moment. Not full-blown melt-up territory, not the kind of reading that screams “local top” either. Just a window where, if the market wants to drift higher into year-end, the positioning doesn’t look like it’s going to fight it.

In these moments, tension builds quietly, visible only to traders watching structure and momentum closely. XRP now appears to be in such a phase where surface-level weakness contrasts with subtle but meaningful internal shifts. While price action still reflects caution, the underlying signals suggest the market may be approaching an important turning point. As volatility compresses, XRP traders are focusing less on headlines and more on how the price behaves around key technical levels. The current setup shows a market that is not capitulating, but rather stabilizing under pressure. $XRP : The Bullish Divergence Price action is adhering to the lower low price action trendline whilst forming higher lows on the RSI. Fail to break the 20 EMA (blue line at $1.98) simply resort back to the lower low trendline for support, where we likely see more relief — #NFA https://t.co/VSNNOJcU9C pic.twitter.com/8i0vZqveLL — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) December 22, 2025 Price Action Remains Compressed Within a Descending Structure XRP continues to respect a clearly defined downtrend, marked by a sequence of lower lows. This structure confirms that sellers remain active and that bullish control has not yet been reclaimed. Price is also trading below the 20-period exponential moving average near the $1.98 region, which has repeatedly acted as dynamic resistance. Each attempt to reclaim this moving average has failed, reinforcing its importance. However, repeated rejection without acceleration often signals weakening downside momentum rather than strength. Momentum Divergence Signals Seller Exhaustion According to ChartNerd, a respected technical analyst on X, XRP’s momentum profile is diverging from its price structure. While price continues to make lower lows, the Relative Strength Index is forming higher lows . This bullish divergence suggests that selling pressure is gradually fading. In technical analysis, this pattern frequently appears during late-stage corrections. Sellers continue pushing prices lower, but with diminishing force. Over time, this imbalance increases the probability of stabilization or a relief move. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Role of the 20 EMA and Trendline Support ChartNerd highlights the 20 EMA near $1.98 as a critical decision point. Failure to break above this level does not automatically invalidate the bullish divergence. Instead, price may rotate back toward the lower trendline, where support has consistently emerged. This trendline has acted as a pressure valve, absorbing selling pressure and triggering short-term rebounds. As long as the price continues respecting this structure and RSI maintains higher lows, sharp downside continuation becomes less likely. What This Setup Means for XRP’s Near-Term Outlook This technical configuration does not confirm an immediate breakout, but it does indicate growing structural tension. Bullish divergence often precedes either a trend reversal or a meaningful relief rally, particularly when aligned with well-defined support zones. XRP now sits at a crossroads. A sustained move above the 20 EMA would significantly improve market structure. Conversely, another controlled pullback toward trendline support may offer one more test of buyer strength. As ChartNerd’s analysis suggests, momentum is shifting beneath the surface. How price resolves this tension will define XRP’s next directional move.

The economist revealed the information in a recent podcast. Oliveros said digital assets like USDT help sustain Venezuela’s oil economy, especially under United States sanctions. He further added that the country’s production of oil has risen to 1 million barrels per day. The economist attributed the growth of oil production in Venezuela to the utilization of cryptocurrencies. “The most direct link this year to the crypto sector comes from there because ultimately, almost 80% of oil revenue is being collected in cryptocurrencies, in stablecoins,” said Oliveros. Caracas relies on stablecoins in its oil sector. However, the South American country struggles to liquidate its stablecoin holdings. This is due to controls limiting how the government can cash out and use the funds. Oliveros added , “This is causing a bottleneck in the foreign exchange market, and that, well, puts pressure on demand, drives up the price, and that’s why we have to be very cautious.” USDT is a big part of Venezuela’s oil trade Local reports stated that USDT has become part of Venezuela’s oil trade. The South American country’s oil industry brings in $12 million. Most of this money is coming from China. Integrating stablecoins like USDT in the oil industry is a huge move. It indicates that cryptocurrencies have grown and proved their usefulness in major industries. It also shows that stablecoins can be used to settle commodity trades when traditional payment systems fail. Caracas has been receiving oil payments in USDT since 2024. The country resorted to crypto to evade US sanctions, which were imposed in 2019 under the Trump administration. Full financial sanctions on PDVSA, the state-owned oil and natural gas company, and Venezuela’s central bank took effect at that time. PDVSA started requiring digital wallets and USDT payments for spot oil sales by the end of March 2024. Caracas then authorized select banks and exchange houses to offer USDT to private companies for bolívars. A bank or an exchange deposits stablecoins into a state-approved wallet before buyers can pay suppliers or sell them privately. However, in 2024, Tether froze 41 USDT wallets connected to Venezuela oil sanction evasion. The wallets were linked to the OFAC’s specially designated nationals list. In March, Washington imposed a 25% tariff on those buying Venezuelan oil. Four months later, around 119 million worth of crypto was sold to Venezuelan private buyers, based on data from Reuters. Oil shipments from Caracas rose to their third-highest average this year. However, tensions between the Washington and Caracas have been growing. President Donald Trump ordered a naval blockade to prevent sanctioned oil tankers from entering or leaving Venezuela. “For the theft of our Assets, and many other reasons, including Terrorism, Drug Smuggling, and Human Trafficking, the Venezuelan Regime has been designated a FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Therefore, today, I am ordering A TOTAL AND COMPLETE BLOCKADE OF ALL SANCTIONED OIL TANKERS going into, and out of, Venezuela.” The Caracas government did not accept what it called Trump’s “grotesque threat.” On December 10, the US seized an oil tanker off the coast of the South American country. Ten days later, the US seized a second oil tanker. Despite the sanctions, the Venezuelan gross domestic product (GDP) grew from $102.38 billion in 2023 to $119.81 billion in 2024. Prolonged sanctions may make the South American country a case study in stablecoin-based oil revenue. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is now trading at $87,986.72 on the Binance USDT market. This move has sent ripples through the trading community, prompting urgent questions about market direction and investor strategy. What does this drop signify, and where might the flagship cryptocurrency head next? What Caused the Sudden Bitcoin Price Drop? Market corrections are a normal part of any asset’s lifecycle, and Bitcoin is no exception. The recent dip in the Bitcoin price below $88,000 can be attributed to a confluence of factors. Firstly, profit-taking after a sustained rally often triggers short-term sell pressure. Secondly, broader macroeconomic concerns, such as interest rate expectations, can influence investor sentiment across all risk assets, including crypto. Technical analysis also plays a role. The $88,000 level was a key psychological support zone. When such levels break, it can trigger automated sell orders, accelerating the downward move. However, it is crucial to view this within the context of Bitcoin’s long-term trend, which many analysts still consider bullish. Key Levels to Watch After This Pullback For traders and long-term holders alike, understanding support and resistance is vital. The current Bitcoin price action suggests we should monitor a few critical areas: Immediate Support: The zone around $87,500 to $87,000. A hold here could signal consolidation. Stronger Support: The next major floor is seen near $85,000, a previous consolidation area. Resistance: On the upside, reclaiming $88,500 and then $90,000 will be essential for bulls to regain control. This pullback may present a potential opportunity for investors who believe in the long-term thesis but have been waiting for a better entry point. However, caution is always advised, as volatility can swing both ways. How Should Investors React to Bitcoin Price Volatility? Seeing the Bitcoin price fall can trigger emotional decisions. The key is to have a plan. Here are actionable insights for navigating this volatility: Review Your Strategy: Does this move change your long-term outlook? If not, avoid panic selling. Dollar-Cost Average (DCA): For many, periodic investments during dips can lower the average entry price over time. Manage Risk: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Ensure your portfolio is diversified beyond a single asset. Remember, Bitcoin has a history of significant drawdowns followed by powerful recoveries. While past performance is no guarantee, it provides context for the asset’s resilient nature. The Bigger Picture: Is This a Buying Opportunity? Market sentiment often turns fearful during corrections, but this is where contrarian opportunities can emerge. The fundamental drivers for Bitcoin—such as its fixed supply, growing institutional adoption, and potential as a digital store of value—remain unchanged by a short-term Bitcoin price fluctuation. Therefore, for investors with a multi-year horizon, this dip could be viewed as a chance to accumulate. The critical factor is conviction. Do you believe in the underlying technology and its long-term potential? If the answer is yes, then short-term price movements become less concerning. Conclusion: Navigating the Dip with Clarity The drop below $88,000 is a stark reminder of the inherent volatility in the cryptocurrency market. However, it is not a reason for despair. By understanding the technical levels, maintaining a disciplined strategy, and focusing on long-term fundamentals, investors can navigate this period with greater confidence. The Bitcoin price will always fluctuate, but informed decisions are your best defense against market noise. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why did Bitcoin’s price fall below $88,000? The drop is likely due to a combination of profit-taking after a rally, broader macroeconomic uncertainty, and the breaking of a key technical support level, which triggered further selling. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? It depends on your investment strategy. For long-term believers, a price dip can represent a buying opportunity. However, you should always do your own research and never invest based on fear of missing out (FOMO) or panic. What is the next major support level for Bitcoin? Analysts are watching the $87,000 zone closely. A stronger historical support level exists around $85,000, which could be tested if selling pressure continues. Will Bitcoin recover from this drop? While no one can predict the future with certainty, Bitcoin has historically recovered from much larger corrections. Its long-term trend has remained upward since its inception. How does this affect other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin often sets the tone for the broader crypto market. When BTC price falls sharply, most altcoins typically follow suit in the short term due to high correlation. Should I sell my Bitcoin now? This is a personal decision based on your financial goals and risk tolerance. If you invested with a long-term plan, reacting to short-term volatility may be counterproductive. Consider consulting a financial advisor. Found this analysis helpful during a volatile market moment?

The co-founder and Chief Security Officer of self-custody solution Casa, Jameson Lopp, said Bitcoin is safe from quantum computers, for now. Quantum Panic? In the latest tweet, Lopp said that quantum computers are not a near-term threat to Bitcoin, in an attempt to address the growing concerns around such risks. He noted that while researchers will continue monitoring advances in quantum computing, current technology is still far from being able to break Bitcoin’s cryptography. Despite this, preparing Bitcoin for a post-quantum future would not be quick or easy. According to Lopp, making careful protocol changes and coordinating a large-scale migration of funds across the network could take anywhere from five to ten years. “We should hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.” Grayscale also echoed a similar sentiment last week in its recent report, and said that quantum computing risks are unlikely to have a meaningful impact on crypto markets in 2026, despite recurring concerns around the technology’s long-term implications. While sufficiently powerful quantum computers could theoretically break current cryptographic systems, the asset manager estimates that such capabilities are well beyond the near term, likely after 2030. Grayscale expects research into post-quantum cryptography and network preparedness to continue and potentially accelerate, but added these developments are unlikely to influence digital asset valuations or market performance in 2026 from an investment perspective. Risks Are Being Underestimated However, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin warned that quantum computing poses a more immediate risk to blockchain cryptography than is often assumed, while assigning a 20% chance that quantum computers could break current cryptographic systems before 2030. Charles Edwards, founder of quantitative Bitcoin fund Capriole, also expressed concern that dismissing quantum computing risks could lead to severe consequences for Bitcoin. In a recent post, Edwards said a major bear market may be needed to force the community to take the threat seriously and push for network upgrades. He stated that if Bitcoin fails to deploy a quantum-resistant fix by 2028, prices could fall below $50,000 and continue declining until the issue is resolved. The founder added that urgent action is needed as early as next year, and a failure to act could trigger the largest bear market in Bitcoin’s history, which could end up eclipsing past crises such as FTX.

Coinbase’s move into prediction markets, Metaplanet’s dividend-paying Bitcoin exposure, and Ghana’s crypto legalisation are strengthening long-term adoption narratives just as BTC compresses inside a descending channel. The result is a market balancing structural demand growth against a decisive technical inflection point. Coinbase Expands Into Prediction Markets with New Acquisition Coinbase is expanding beyond spot crypto trading with plans to acquire prediction markets firm The Clearing Company, marking a clear push into event-driven financial products. Prediction markets let users trade contracts linked to real-world outcomes, from elections and economic data to sports and policy decisions. The move places Coinbase in more direct competition with platforms like Robinhood and Interactive Brokers, which already offer broader trading access.

Welcome to Coinbase, @theclearingco . pic.twitter.com/KfRZSp9w9j — Coinbase (@coinbase) December 22, 2025 The expansion is not without debate. Critics warn that prediction markets resemble online betting and could face tougher regulatory oversight. Supporters argue they often reflect real-time expectations more accurately than traditional polls, especially around political and macro events. Interest has surged since the 2024 US election. Expected to close in January, the deal is Coinbase’s ninth acquisition in 2025, strengthening revenue diversification and reinforcing long-term institutional confidence in the crypto ecosystem. Metaplanet Targets Global Institutions with Dividend-Paying Shares Metaplanet is reshaping its capital strategy to attract global institutional investors by approving dividend-paying preferred shares, reducing its reliance on equity dilution. The move allows Japan’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder to offer income-focused exposure through new Class A and Class B shares. Class A shares will pay floating monthly dividends, while Class B shares include quarterly payouts alongside investor protections such as buyback options.

Ghana Legalizes Crypto Trading Under New Law Separately, Ghana has legalized crypto trading under its new Virtual Asset Service Providers law. The Bank of Ghana now oversees licensing and regulation, with Governor Johnson Asiama confirming crypto use will no longer trigger arrests. Clear rules improve trust, encourage innovation, and underpin sustained demand for Bitcoin across emerging markets.

Clear regulation boosts trust promotes broader adoption in developing nations and sustains long-term demand for BTC. Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Tests $88K Support as Descending Channel Nears Break Bitcoin price prediction seems bearish as BTC is trading near $88,000, entering a technically sensitive phase rather than a disorderly selloff. On the 4-hour chart, price remains inside a clear descending channel that has shaped action since late November. While lower highs still define the structure, selling pressure has slowed, pointing to consolidation rather than continuation. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Bitcoin is testing a key pivot area. The 50-EMA near $88,400 has turned into resistance, while the 100-EMA around $89,000 caps rebounds. This EMA compression within a descending channel often precedes a volatility expansion. Recent candles show smaller bodies and mixed wicks, including spinning-top formations, reflecting balance rather than conviction. Support remains firm near $84,500, aligned with the lower channel boundary. Each test has produced a stronger rebound, suggesting demand is absorbing supply. RSI is hovering just below 50 and has stopped making lower lows, hinting at improving momentum beneath the surface. A break above $90,500–$91,000 would shift structure toward $94,200, then $98,000. A loss of $84,500 would reopen downside toward $80,600. Patience remains key as price compresses. PEPENODE: A Mine-to-Earn Meme Coin Nearing Presale Close PEPENODE is gaining momentum as a next-generation meme coin that blends viral culture with interactive gameplay. With over $2.37 mn raised and the presale approaching its cap, interest is building fast as the countdown enters its final stretch. What makes PEPENODE stand out is its mine-to-earn virtual ecosystem. Instead of passive holding, users can build digital server rooms using Miner Nodes and facilities, earning simulated rewards through a visual dashboard. The concept brings gamification and competition into the meme coin space, giving holders something to do before launch. The project also offers presale staking, allowing early participants to earn boosted rewards ahead of the token generation event. Leaderboards and bonus incentives are planned post-launch to keep engagement high. With 1 $PEPENODE priced at $0.0012016 and limited allocation remaining, the presale is entering its final opportunity window for early buyers.

Italy’s competition authority has imposed a fine of €98.6 million on Apple for allegedly abusing its dominant market position through its App Store practices. Regulators claim Apple created unfair competition in the App Store by imposing stricter privacy rules on third-party developers than on itself. Has Apple been fined by Italian authorities? The Italian Competition Authority, known as AGCM, recently concluded an investigation into the unfair application of Apple’s privacy policies that began in May 2023. A fine of €98.6 million ($115 million) has been imposed on the company. Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) feature was introduced in iOS 14.5 back in April 2021 in order to ensure that apps get permission before tracking user activities across other companies’ apps and websites. When users download or update apps, they see a prompt asking if they want to allow tracking. Italian regulators found that Apple requires its developers to comply with ATT, while Apple itself does not. Additionally, Apple’s consent screen does not meet privacy legislation requirements, which forces developers to ask users for permission twice. The AGCM said that its investigation was highly complex and conducted in coordination with the European Commission and other international antitrust regulators. The regulator’s 199-page ruling requires Apple to immediately cease these practices and refrain from similar conduct that would violate Italian antitrust law in the future. Will Apple appeal Italy’s decision? Apple says it will appeal the decision , but it is not known how long that process may take. The company is likely not required to pay the fine until the appeal concludes. However, Apple has 90 days to report how it will comply with the AGCM’s requirements. Apple has so far defended its strong privacy protections for users. According to the company, the ATT is a user privacy feature that gives people control over their data, not an anti-competitive tool. In July, the company appealed against a €500 million fine imposed by the European Union over alleged anti-competitive practices on its App Store. That case focused on Apple restricting app developers from informing customers about alternative offers outside the App Store. In 2021, AGCM fined Apple and Google €10 million each for aggressive data practices that did not clearly explain how personal data would be used. The authority also previously imposed a €173.3 million fine on Apple and Amazon over alleged limits on selling Apple products on Amazon’s Italian marketplace. In November, Apple confirmed that its Apple Ads and Apple Maps are in compliance with the Digital Markets Act, leading to a decision on which of the services would receive the gatekeeper label. This designation would impose strict pro-competition obligations and additional regulatory oversight. French antitrust authorities earlier this year handed Apple a €150 million fine over its app tracking privacy feature, and a similar antitrust investigation into App Tracking Transparency is currently ongoing in Poland.

Dubbed Kalshi Research , this new initiative aims to unlock the power of collective intelligence by sharing its unique market data with academics and the public. This launch signals a pivotal shift towards transparency and could fundamentally reshape how we predict future events. What is Kalshi Research and Why Does It Matter? Simply put, Kalshi Research is a dedicated team within Kalshi focused on studying prediction markets. Its core mission is to support academic research by providing access to the platform’s rich, real-time data. Think of it as opening a treasure chest of crowd-sourced wisdom that was previously locked away. This matters because prediction markets, where people trade contracts on event outcomes, have repeatedly proven to be remarkably accurate aggregators of information. The company isn’t starting from scratch. Kalshi previously made waves by claiming its markets were 40% more accurate than traditional Wall Street inflation forecasts. This statistic isn’t just a boast; it’s a powerful testament to the potential of decentralized forecasting. By establishing Kalshi Research , the platform is betting that more eyes on this data will lead to even better models and a deeper understanding of human prediction. How Will Kalshi Research Change the Game? The launch of Kalshi Research introduces several exciting possibilities for the future of forecasting. First, it democratizes access to high-quality prediction data. Previously, such granular, real-time data on public sentiment about future events was scarce for researchers. Enhanced Academic Study: Universities can now analyze how millions of dollars in trades reflect collective expectations on everything from economics to politics. Improved Market Models: Researchers can dissect what makes prediction markets tick, potentially leading to more robust and accurate forecasting tools for everyone. Greater Mainstream Legitimacy: Peer-reviewed studies stemming from this data can help validate prediction markets as a serious tool for businesses and policymakers. Therefore, this isn’t just an internal project. It’s an invitation to the global academic community to help explore the frontiers of collective intelligence. The insights generated by Kalshi Research could eventually filter into how companies manage risk or how governments gauge public expectation. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities Ahead? While the potential is enormous, the path for Kalshi Research isn’t without its hurdles. A key challenge will be ensuring data is shared in a way that protects user privacy and maintains market integrity. Furthermore, the team must translate complex market dynamics into insights that are accessible and useful beyond academic circles. However, the opportunities far outweigh these challenges. Imagine a world where economic policy is informed by real-time prediction markets, or where disaster preparedness is guided by crowd-sourced risk assessments. The work initiated by Kalshi Research could be the first step toward that future. It represents a powerful fusion of finance, technology, and social science. The Bottom Line on Kalshi’s New Venture The establishment of Kalshi Research is a visionary play. It moves Kalshi from being just a trading platform to becoming a foundational institution in the study of prediction. By betting on transparency and collaboration, Kalshi is not only enhancing its own credibility but also investing in the entire ecosystem’s growth. The data and discoveries that emerge could provide us with a clearer crystal ball, powered not by mystics, but by the wisdom of the crowd. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly does Kalshi Research do? Kalshi Research is an in-house division created to manage and share the prediction market data generated on the Kalshi platform. Its primary goal is to support academic studies on forecasting and collective intelligence. Can anyone access the data from Kalshi Research? While specific details on access are still emerging, the initiative is aimed primarily at academic researchers and institutions. The goal is to provide qualified researchers with datasets to study, not necessarily to offer a public data feed. How accurate are Kalshi’s prediction markets really? Kalshi has publicly stated that its markets have been about 40% more accurate than Wall Street’s inflation forecasts. This claim highlights the potential efficacy of prediction markets as a forecasting tool compared to some traditional methods. What kind of events do Kalshi markets predict? Kalshi markets cover a wide range of topics, including economics (like inflation and GDP), politics (election outcomes), current events, and more. The data from these diverse markets is what Kalshi Research will make available for study. Why is this important for the average person? The research fueled by this data could lead to better forecasting models used in economics, public policy, and business strategy. Ultimately, more accurate predictions about the future can lead to better decision-making in areas that affect everyone. Does this mean Kalshi is becoming an academic institution? Not exactly. Kalshi remains a for-profit prediction market platform. However, with Kalshi Research , it is actively fostering a bridge between the commercial prediction market space and academic research, aiming to advance the entire field.

The data suggests experienced traders are positioning for potential upside while the broader market remains cautious. Recent metrics from the exchange indicate that top trader accounts hold a 62.3% net long position, compared to a 37% short exposure. This configuration pushes the account-based long/short ratio to 1.65, indicating a clear directional preference among sophisticated market participants. The skew represents a meaningful departure from neutral positioning and reflects growing conviction in SHIB's near-term prospects. Position Data Points to Concentrated Bullish Exposure The positioning becomes even more apparent when examining actual open positions rather than account distribution. Top traders hold 67.9% of their positions long compared to 32.1% short. This creates a long/short ratio of 2.12 in terms of position sizing, nearly double the short exposure. The gap between account distribution and position size reveals strategic intent. Professional traders are not simply leaning long, they are allocating meaningful capital to that directional view. This distinction matters because it indicates a real risk being deployed, rather than tentative positioning that could reverse quickly. The elevated position ratio suggests desks are building exposure ahead of a potential move. They appear willing to maintain size as long as key price levels hold. However, the positioning also creates vulnerability if support fails, as concentrated long exposure could trigger rapid unwinding. Price Action At the time of writing, SHIB trades around $0.000007311, reflecting modest 0.8% gains in the last 24 hours. The token recently declined from the $0.0000078 zone into the low $0.0000070s before entering a range-bound phase. The current price behavior resembles a base formation rather than trending action.

And if you’re the type who still believes memes have market structure like in 2017 and 2021, one chart making the rounds on X says this is exactly what the pre-run “calm” has looked like before. Crypto analyst Cryptollica (@Cryptollica) posted a weekly DOGE chart marking four major structural points across the coin’s history, arguing the current stretch maps onto prior accumulation phases. “We are looking at a textbook fractal setup,” Cryptollica wrote. “The chart highlights four distinct structural points (1, 2, 3, 4). We are currently at Point 4, and the structure is rhyming perfectly with the pre-bull run accumulation phases of the past.” Will History Repeat For Dogecoin? The pitch is basically: zoom out, stop staring at intraday noise, and look at the cycle cadence. In his framing, Zones 1 and 2 were the “boredom phases,” the stretches where volatility dried up, price rounded out a base, and the market slowly rotated from weak hands to more patient holders. Zone 2, he says, was the launchpad that ultimately led into the 2021 face-melter. Related Reading: Dogecoin Holds The Floor, But Momentum Says Otherwise — A Critical Standoff Unfolds “Zones 1 & 2: These were the ‘boredom phases’ where volatility died, and smart money accumulated,” he wrote. “Zone 2 specifically was the launchpad for the massive 2021 parabolic run. Zone 4 (Current Price Action): We are seeing the exact same rounding bottom formation.” That “rounding bottom” bit matters, because it’s not the dramatic reversal traders love to screenshot. It’s the opposite. It’s price stabilizing, forming a heavy base, refusing to break down — and doing it slowly enough that most people stop paying attention. Which, again, is kind of the point. Then there’s the RSI argument, and it’s the cleaner one. Cryptollica highlighted a weekly RSI floor around the low-30s area, suggesting DOGE has repeatedly found major cycle bottoms when momentum reset to that band. “Look at the RSI indicator at the bottom. The red line (~32 level) acts as a historical floor,” he wrote. “Every single time the weekly RSI touched or hovered near this baseline (Points 1, 2, and 3), it marked a macro bottom. Now: The RSI has reset back to this critical support level.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Breakdown Ahead? Analyst Flags 2022-Style Signal That’s the “sellers are exhausted” claim — not because a candle says so today, but because the longer-term momentum gauge has already done the full trip down to where DOGE previously stopped bleeding out and started building again. And he’s not being subtle about what comes next, at least in the cleanest version of the fractal. “This isn’t just random noise; it’s a cyclical reset,” Cryptollica wrote. “The chart suggests we are in the ‘Golden Pocket’ for accumulation. If the fractal plays out like it did in 2020 (Zone 2), the current price action is simply the calm before the storm.” To be clear, fractals aren’t guarantees. DOGE isn’t trading in a vacuum, and the macro/liquidity backdrop can absolutely mess with tidy historical comparisons. But if history repeats for DOGE, the best days could be ahead. At press time, Dogecoin traded at $0.13294.

56199995,647700,1766437225,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/56199995.jpeg,Here’s Why The XRP Price Will Shine In The New Year,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-will-shine-in-the-new-year/,"XRP has spent the past few weeks on a downtrend after a bullish cycle earlier in the year, and this has left traders divided between caution and anticipation. However, as the year draws to a close, the interest in the altcoin is gradually changing from short-term volatility to what the new year could bring. Interestingly, technical insights using the Relative Strength Index suggest that the current price action may be setting the stage for the token to shine in 2026, even if the market is not quite ready to reveal its hand just yet. RSI Signals Point To A Completed Dip One of the arguments supporting a bullish outlook comes from the 3-day Relative Strength Index highlighted by Dark Defender. According to the analyst, the RSI has already dropped into a zone that is known to indicate completed price corrections for XRP. This is because similar RSI conditions in 2024 were highlighted by periods before its price action returned decisively to the upside. The chart accompanying his analysis shows XRP stabilizing near a horizontal support region, and this fits with the RSI flattening near oversold territory. According to the analyst, this type of structure suggests exhaustion on the sell side, even if price action continues to trade sideways in the next couple of days. Speaking of stabilizing near a support region , XRP is currently trading around the $1.86 to $1.90 price range, which aligns closely with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension highlighted on the chart at approximately $1.8815. This support level aligns with a projection using the Elliott Wave Theory, and this contributes to the notion that the XRP price will rebound to the upside any time soon. Building The Base For A Surge In addition to the RSI momentum indicator, XRP’s price structure on the chart analyzed by Dark Defender supports the idea that the cryptocurrency is forming a base. The visual Elliott Wave count on the 3-day timeframe shows that the recent decline fits within a corrective sequence on sub-impulse wave 5. Interestingly, this sub-wave is an extension of a fourth impulse wave that traces its origin as far back as early 2025. According to the Elliott Wave theory, this fourth impulse wave is expected to be followed by an impulsive Wave 5 that resolves to the upside. The projected impulse path on the chart shows how a confirmed breakout from this structure could push XRP into a massive rally. The price target in this case is around the 2.618 Fibonacci extension, which is marked at $5.85. Dark Defender also linked this technical setup to timing, pointing out that the period around Christmas and the New Year could coincide with improving sentiment, and XRP will shine after the holidays. He also pointed to upcoming scarcity as another factor, which might be referring to the projected longer-term implications of Spot XRP ETFs.",XRP|Dark Defender|elliott wave theory|ripple|RSI|Spot XRP ETFs|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-22 21:00:25

Investors pushed the entire sector higher for a second straight week last week, thanks to a friendlier White House, new leadership at NASA , and a long list of market signals that point to more demand ahead. The biggest gain came from Firefly Aerospace, which went public in August and closed the day 13% higher on Monday. Intuitive Machines also rallied by 7% as traders continued, and Rocket Lab extended its run with a 10% surge after rising 18% on Friday, thanks to the company’s $816 million satellite contract with the U.S. Space Development Agency, which confirmed its approval last week. Trump’s executive order drives lunar base plan President Donald Trump signed a “space superiority” order on Friday that mapped out plans for a permanent U.S. base on the moon, which the administration sees as a long-term national goal. At the same time, Cryptopolitan reported that the Senate confirmed Elon Musk’s close friend Jared Isaacman last week after more than a year of delays. Trump had pulled Isaacman’s nomination earlier this year during a public clash, then sent it back in November, reopening the process. That nomination cleared the Senate days later, removing a major unknown inside the agency. During the back-and-forth, Sean Duffy stepped in as the temporary head of NASA after Trump tapped him for the job. Meanwhile, UBS told clients that it believes the strong U.S. stock performance in 2025 still has room to extend into 2026, driven by better earnings, easier policy, and a clearer outlook. Analysts at the bank said corporate profits have kept rising and pointed out that price-to-earnings levels remain only slightly above where they were at the start of the year. UBS expects S&P 500 earnings to grow 10% in 2026, which it said could put the index near 7,700 by year-end. The bank wrote, “While some may worry investor reticence signals deeper trouble, we see multiple catalysts ahead that should help reignite equity market momentum into early 2026.” UBS also said it expects more rate cuts after the Federal Reserve delivered a third cut in December, and it warned that the Fed chair change coming in January could shape policy even further. Candidates under review include Kevin Hassett and Christopher Waller, both of whom have called for more easing. A Supreme Court ruling on Trump’s tariff authority is expected early next year. UBS said any relief from lower tariffs might be brief but still enough to settle investor worries and influence trading conditions at the start of 2026. UBS kept its “attractive” call on U.S. equities and told clients that even if the next few weeks slow down, the setup remains strong. The bank wrote, “So regardless of whether a December rally materializes, we believe investors should position for further advances in equity markets.” Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

56200225,https://cryptonews.com/?p=466823,1766437592,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/56200225.jpeg,Ghana Just Legalized Crypto Trading – Here’s the Catch,https://cryptonews.com/news/ghana-legalizes-crypto-trading-regulatory-law/,"Ghana has formally legalized cryptocurrency trading after parliament passed the Virtual Asset Service Providers Bill into law, marking a major shift for one of West Africa’s most active digital asset markets. The move ends years of legal uncertainty for users and businesses, but it also places the fast-growing sector under firm regulatory control for the first time. Bank of Ghana Governor Johnson Asiama announced the development on December 19 during the central bank’s annual Nine Lessons, Carols, and Thanksgiving Service in Accra. He said virtual asset trading is now lawful across the country and that people will no longer face arrest for engaging in crypto-related activity. However, he stressed that legalization does not amount to an open-ended green light for the industry. New Law Puts Ghana’s Crypto Market Under Watch According to Asiama, the new law establishes a formal framework that allows the central bank to license, supervise, and monitor companies operating in the digital asset space. He continued that the goal is to manage risks that previously went unchecked, including fraud, money laundering, and threats to financial stability. He said the absence of regulation in earlier years left users exposed and limited the authorities’ ability to intervene when problems arose. The law gives the Bank of Ghana direct oversight over virtual asset service providers, introducing rules on transparency, accountability, and compliance. Asiama said consumer protection is central to the framework and warned that crypto activity will now be subject to the same expectations of governance and supervision applied to other parts of the financial system. Ghana’s decision reflects the reality on the ground, as despite the lack of formal approval in the past, crypto usage has been widespread. Around three million adults, roughly 17% of the population, already use digital currencies for savings, payments, remittances, and business transactions. Data from Web3 Africa Group shows crypto transactions in the country reached about $3 billion between July 2023 and June 2024, much of it taking place outside traditional banking channels. Why Ghana Is Moving to Regulate a Rapidly Growing Crypto Market The country has also emerged as a regional player in digital asset adoption. According to Chainalysis’ 2025 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report, the country ranked among the top five in Sub-Saharan Africa by total crypto value received between July 2024 and June 2025. Source: Chainalysis Over the same period, the region recorded more than $205 billion in on-chain value, a 52% increase year over year, making it one of the fastest-growing crypto markets globally. Officials say the regulation is intended to balance innovation with stability. Macroeconomic Stress Adds Urgency to Ghana’s Crypto Reforms The regulatory push is also tied to macroeconomic pressures. Ghana’s cedi has experienced sharp swings, rising nearly 48% over the past year after falling about 25% in the previous 12 months. With interest rates at 28% and inflation at 13.7% as of mid-2025, policymakers are seeking better visibility into currency flows that affect monetary policy, especially in an import-dependent economy where crypto payments have grown outside traditional banking channels. Source: Chainalysis The move aligns Ghana with a broader trend across Africa, where South Africa has approved dozens of crypto platform licenses while Kenya has also passed its own Virtual Asset Service Providers Bill , which is awaiting presidential approval. Beyond market growth, the backdrop remains complex. Ghana continues to face deep economic challenges, with poverty projections for 2025 placing the national poverty rate above 30% under local measures. Officials argue that stronger financial oversight, alongside legal reforms to the Bank of Ghana Act passed this year, is necessary to prevent governance lapses like those seen during the 2022 debt crisis.

Earlier this month, the 10‑year Treasury peaked near 4.20% before moving within a tight range. Investors spent recent sessions weighing incoming economic readings and reviewing comments from Federal Reserve officials during each of the three rate cuts that have happened this year. Traders pile into March contracts as open interest jumps CME figures released Monday showed aggressive buying in a single March options contract tied to the 10‑year Treasury. The total premium paid on that position reached about $80 million, a size rarely seen for one structure. Open interest climbed to 171,153 contracts, reflecting a 300% jump in one week. The rise showed new positions entering the market rather than existing trades being rolled forward. The wager landed even as yields moved higher on the day. Treasury yields finished Monday around two basis points higher across most maturities, pushing the 10‑year yield to about 4.16%. That move followed a $69 billion auction of two‑year notes, which drew solid demand and cleared without disruption. The pricing confirmed continued appetite for short‑dated U.S. government debt despite the rise in yields. Another trade surfaced during the same session. Traders paid a $28 million premium for a separate March options position aimed at a 10‑year yield near 4.05%. The structure sat close to the larger bet and shared the same expiration window. Both trades are set to expire on Feb. 20, after the Federal Reserve’s January policy meeting, allowing traders to express views on changes in rate expectations tied to that decision. Yields rise into auctions as volatility stays low Meanwhile, the 10‑year US Treasury yield , the benchmark for government borrowing, rose 2 basis points to 4.171% by the closing bell on Monday. The 2‑year yield surged by more than 2 basis points to 3.511%, and the 30‑year bond moved up more than one basis point to 4.843%, according to data from CNBC. For the uninitiated, a basis point equals 0.01%, and yields move in the opposite direction of prices. The 1‑month Treasury stood at 3.632%, the 3‑month yield printed 3.62%, the 6‑month yield has settled at 3.608%, the 1‑year closed near 3.527%, while the 2‑year finished around 3.507%, and the 30‑year held close to 4.838% by the end of the session. Market volatility remained muted, with the Bank of America MOVE index dropping to its lowest level in more than four years, signaling calm conditions across the Treasury market. Meanwhile, the Treasury has scheduled a $69 billion two‑year note auction on Monday, a $70 billion five‑year note sale on Tuesday, and another $44 billion seven‑year note auction for Wednesday.

That is a notable strength, with 146% gains year over year and 27% in the last 30 days, despite a broadly red market. Governments hate it, institutions do not touch it, and that arguably makes it even more appealing. Monero (XMR) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time The XMR chart has been on a clean rise ever since it was delisted from over 73 exchanges in 2024. Its rise is being driven mainly by raw demand from investors and users who value privacy. Monero Price Prediction: Bitcoin Lost The Plot, XMR Can Fix That Remember the days when Bitcoin was supposed to be the future currency that was not controlled by anyone? Those were great days. However, that is no longer the case, with exchanges and funds now owning large chunks of the BTC supply. Monero is the only coin still pursuing that original goal, maybe alongside Zcash. Source: XMRUSD / TradingView XMR is outperforming the market, up 15% over the last 7 days. It is now just 7.5% away from finishing the year above the $500 level. A break above that zone could open the door for a much bigger rally heading into 2026, as it would put XMR back on traders’ radar in a low-volume market. A scenario where price pulls back toward $400 before bouncing is still possible if a breakout does not happen soon. However, the bullish setup remains intact, and the rising channel structure should continue. Faster Bitcoin?

It brings fast transactions, near-zero fees, and full support for DeFi, staking, payments, and on-chain apps, all while keeping Bitcoin as the base asset. At the core of the system is the Hyper Bridge. Users can move BTC onto the Hyper L2 and instantly receive a 1:1 representation with near-instant finality. No waiting, no congestion, no high fees. This lets BTC holders finally put their capital to work instead of just holding it. Yield, trading, and payments all become possible without leaving the Bitcoin ecosystem. Investor interest has been strong. Bitcoin Hyper has already raised $29.5M in early funding, and staking currently offers up to 39% APY for early participants. As the market looks for assets with real utility rather than hype, Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself as the layer that finally makes Bitcoin usable at scale.

Just recently, it disclosed that five new trading pairs are about to become available for clients. The Upcoming Addition The exchange revealed that it will open trading for ADA/USD1, ASTER/USD1, LUNA/USDC, LUNC/USDC, and ZEC/USD1 on Binance Spot on December 24. The platform will also enable Trading Bots services for the same pairs on that day. It clarified that users will enjoy discounted taker fees on all existing and new USDC spot and margin trading pairs until further notice. However, the company warned that the upcoming services won’t be available to all clients as those residing in Canada, Cuba, Iran, the Netherlands, the USA, and other countries are excluded. Support from Binance usually has a positive effect on the prices of the affected digital assets. After all, this is the biggest crypto exchange, and its backing leads to increased liquidity, boosted visibility, and a better reputation. Cardano’s ADA has pumped by 4% over the last 24 hours and currently trades at around $0.37, whereas Aster (ASTER) is up 3.5% for the day and is worth $0.72. Terra (LUNA) has outperformed all tokens involved in the listing effort, posting a daily gain of 13%, whereas Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) and Zcash (ZEC) have recorded more modest gains. LUNA Price, Source: CoinGecko It is important to note that the overall revival of the crypto market may have also played a role in the solid performance of the aforementioned assets. Bitcoin (BTC) recently surpassed $90,000, while Ethereum (ETH) reclaimed the psychological level of $3,000. The Opposite Reaction When Delisting Binance also periodically removes certain trading pairs and even all trading services with some cryptocurrencies due to factors such as low trading volume and liquidity, compromised network stability and safety, and others. In those cases, the delisted assets usually experience substantial declines. In September this year, the exchange terminated all services with BakerySwap (BAKE), Hifi Finance (HIFI), and Self Chain (SLF). The result was double-digit losses for the involved altcoins mere hours after the announcement. A similar thing occurred in October when Binance delisted Flamingo (FLM), Kadena (KDA), and Perpetual Protocol (PERP). KDA took the biggest blow, with its valuation nosediving by 30% following the disclosure.

This positive momentum comes after recent market volatility, offering a welcome boost to portfolios. But what exactly fueled this rally, and should cryptocurrency traders pay attention? Let’s break down the numbers and explore the implications. Why Did US Stocks Close Higher Today? The trading session ended with clear gains across the board. The S&P 500 climbed 0.64%, the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.52%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.47%. These gains might seem modest, but they represent significant positive sentiment returning to the market. Several factors contributed to this upward movement, including encouraging economic data and corporate earnings reports that exceeded expectations. When US stocks close higher , it often creates a ripple effect across other asset classes. Many cryptocurrency investors watch traditional markets closely, as positive sentiment in stocks can sometimes translate to increased risk appetite in digital assets. Today’s performance suggests investors are becoming more confident about economic stability. What Drove the Market Rally? Understanding why markets move helps investors make better decisions. Today’s rally wasn’t random—it was driven by specific catalysts: Strong corporate earnings from major technology companies Positive economic indicators suggesting controlled inflation Institutional buying activity in key sectors Technical breakout above important resistance levels The fact that all three major indices moved together indicates broad-based buying rather than sector-specific enthusiasm. This comprehensive strength suggests the rally has solid foundations. When US stocks close higher with this kind of unanimity, it often signals sustained momentum rather than temporary speculation. How Does This Affect Cryptocurrency Markets? Traditional and digital markets increasingly influence each other. Today’s stock market performance could impact cryptocurrency trading in several ways: First, positive sentiment in traditional finance often spills over to digital assets. Investors feeling optimistic about stocks may allocate additional funds to cryptocurrencies. Second, when US stocks close higher , it generally indicates healthy risk appetite—a crucial factor for cryptocurrency valuations. Finally, institutional investors active in both markets might increase their exposure to digital assets following successful traditional market trades. However, remember that correlation isn’t causation. Cryptocurrencies have their own unique drivers, including regulatory developments and technological advancements. While today’s stock market gains are encouraging, digital asset investors should consider multiple factors when making decisions. What Should Investors Watch Next? Today’s gains are promising, but smart investors look ahead. Here are key developments to monitor: Upcoming Federal Reserve announcements on interest rates Next week’s major earnings reports Economic data releases, particularly employment figures Geopolitical developments affecting global markets The fact that US stocks close higher today establishes positive momentum, but sustainability depends on upcoming events. Markets will be watching closely to see if this rally marks the beginning of a longer-term trend or represents a temporary rebound. Actionable Insights for Your Portfolio Market movements create opportunities for prepared investors. Consider these approaches: First, review your asset allocation. When US stocks close higher consistently, it might be time to rebalance your portfolio. Second, identify sectors showing particular strength—today’s leaders could be tomorrow’s champions. Third, maintain perspective: single-day gains are important, but long-term trends matter more for wealth building. For cryptocurrency investors, today’s traditional market performance suggests monitoring Bitcoin and major altcoins for correlated movements. However, base decisions on comprehensive analysis rather than single indicators. Conclusion: A Promising Day for Markets Today’s session delivered exactly what investors needed—broad-based gains across major indices. The fact that US stocks close higher with all three benchmarks advancing suggests genuine buying interest rather than isolated speculation. This positive momentum could support further gains if economic conditions remain favorable. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, today’s traditional market performance offers encouraging signals about overall risk appetite. While digital assets march to their own beat, positive sentiment in established markets often creates favorable conditions for alternative investments. The key takeaway? Today’s gains matter, but consistent strategy matters more. Frequently Asked Questions What does it mean when all three major indices gain? When the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow all advance together, it indicates broad market strength rather than sector-specific enthusiasm. This suggests the rally has solid foundations. How often do US stocks close higher? Markets fluctuate daily, but historical data shows stocks rise approximately 55% of trading days. Multiple consecutive positive days often signal strong bullish momentum. Should cryptocurrency investors care about stock market performance? Yes, because traditional and digital markets increasingly influence each other. Positive stock market sentiment often correlates with increased risk appetite in cryptocurrencies. What’s the difference between a rally and a bull market? A rally refers to short-term price increases, while a bull market describes sustained upward movement over months or years. Today’s gains represent a rally—whether it becomes a bull market depends on continued positive developments. Which sectors led today’s gains? Technology and financial sectors showed particular strength, but gains were distributed across multiple industries, indicating comprehensive market participation. How can I track market performance daily? Financial news websites, trading platforms, and market analysis tools provide real-time data. Many offer free resources for tracking how US stocks close each trading session. Found this analysis helpful?

Fold Holdings, a Bitcoin financial services firm, has announced that it will be included in the Russell 2000 Index despite the MSCI considering the exclusion of digital asset treasuries from its indexes. Has Fold Holdings been included in the Russell 2000 Index? Fold Holdings announced its inclusion in the Russell 2000 Index on December 22. The Russell 2000 tracks small-cap U.S. stocks, representing approximately 5-7% of the U.S. public equity market capitalization, and serves as a benchmark for mutual funds, ETFs, and other asset managers. Will Reeves, Fold’s Chairman and CEO, said the inclusion validates the company’s position as a successful public company. He expects the listing to broaden market awareness and increase visibility among institutional and retail investors. Fold operates as a Bitcoin financial services firm focused on making it easy for individuals to earn, save, and spend Bitcoin through everyday financial tools, including its Bitcoin Gift Card and upcoming Fold Bitcoin Rewards Credit Card. Will Bitcoin-holding firms be excluded from indexes? MSCI, a major index provider, proposed in October to remove companies whose digital asset holdings represent 50% or more of their total assets from its global benchmarks. The firm argue s th ese companies are more similar to investment funds rather than operational businesses, which MSCI does not include in its indexes. Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy and led by Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, saw its shares surge 3,000% after it began purchasing Bitcoin in 2020. Analysts estimate that exclusion from MSCI could trigger $2.8 billion in outflows. And that figure could rise to $8.8 billion if other indexes follow suit. JPMorgan’s analysis suggests Strategy has $2.5 billion of market value from MSCI membership and $5.5 billion from other indexes, making up a significant portion of the company’s $45 billion market value. Michael Saylor initially dismissed concerns about MSCI exclusion, but later, through a public letter co-authored by Strategy’s CEO Phong Le, the pair warned that digital asset treasury exclusion would result in $2.8 billion of stock liquidation and “chill” the industry. The executives argue d th e proposal would deprive these companies of about $15 trillion in passive investments. Why is MSCI’s decision on digital asset treasuries important? MSCI’s consultation period runs until January 15, 2025, when a final decision will be announced. According to Kaasha Saini, head of index strategy at Jefferies, the eligibility of digital asset treasury companies in equity indexes generally will be affected by this decision. She expects most equity indexes would move to follow MSCI’s lead if exclusion occurs. Saini pointed out that passive asset managers hold an estimated 30% of a large-cap company’s free float, which creates a significant problem for digital asset treasury companies, as many of them fund their token purchases by selling stock. As of September, at least 200 digital asset treasury companies had a combined market capitalization of around $150 billion, more than triple the figure from a year earlier, according to law firm DLA Piper. MSCI’s preliminary list names 38 companies at risk of exclusion, with a combined issuer market cap of $46.7 billion as of September 30.

The company now focuses on strengthening its cash position as cryptocurrency markets face continued volatility. Executive Chairman Michael Saylor confirmed that the company's cash reserves have reached $2.19 billion. Strategy maintains ownership of 671,268 Bitcoin despite pausing new purchases. The decision represents a significant shift for the corporate pioneer of Bitcoin. Stock Sale Boosts Cash Reserves Strategy sold 4.535 million shares of Class A common stock between December 15 and December 21. The at-the-market offering generated $747.8 million in net proceeds. No preferred stock changed hands during this period. The company filed regulatory documents detailing the transaction. These funds directly support Strategy's newly established dollar reserve program. The reserve serves specific financial obligations, including preferred stock dividends and interest payments on debt. Strategy announced the dollar reserve in early December with an initial balance of $1.44 billion. Management plans to maintain reserves covering at least twelve months of dividend obligations. The long-term goal targets coverage of 24 months or more. The company acquired its Bitcoin holdings at an aggregate cost of $50.33 billion. The average purchase price stands at $74,972 per Bitcoin. Strategy's most recent acquisition occurred on December 15 when it bought 10,645 Bitcoin for $980.3 million at an average price of $92,098 per coin. Market Performance Reflects Crypto Downturn Strategy's common stock declined nearly 50% over the past year. The sharp drop reflects broader challenges in the cryptocurrency market. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at around $88,391, suggesting a modest 0.14% gain in the last 24 hours. BTC price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap Other companies following Strategy's Bitcoin treasury model experienced similar difficulties. These firms repositioned themselves as digital asset holding companies throughout 2024 and 2025. Initial stock rallies gave way to substantial losses as crypto values declined. Metaplanet adopted its crypto treasury strategy in April 2024. The company now holds 30,823 Bitcoin, ranking fourth among corporate holders. Its shares fell roughly 75% over six months despite remaining 26% higher year-to-date. MARA Holdings operates as a Bitcoin mining company and is the second-largest corporate holder with 53,250 Bitcoin. The stock declined approximately 38% in 2025.

The Google parent company’s $4.75 billion purchase of Intersect Power isn’t just another corporate merger—it’s a direct response to the energy grid bottlenecks threatening to stall the AI revolution. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts watching this unfold, the implications are profound: when tech giants struggle to power their AI models, what does that mean for the energy-intensive world of blockchain and crypto mining? Why Alphabet’s Acquisition of Intersect Power Changes Everything The announcement that Alphabet will acquire Intersect Power represents more than a simple business transaction. This deal, valued at $4.75 billion in cash plus assumption of debt, positions Alphabet to bypass the very infrastructure limitations that have constrained tech giants for years. The timing couldn’t be more critical—as AI models grow exponentially in complexity, their energy demands are creating unprecedented pressure on traditional power grids. The Energy Grid Bottlenecks Threatening AI Progress Local utilities across the United States are struggling to keep pace with the explosive demand from AI companies. Training advanced AI models requires massive computational power, which translates directly to enormous electricity consumption. The situation has created energy grid bottlenecks that could potentially slow down AI development and innovation. Consider these critical points: AI data centers can consume up to 100 times more energy than traditional facilities Grid connection wait times in some regions now exceed 5 years Power constraints are forcing companies to delay or relocate projects The AI industry’s energy demand is projected to double by 2027 How Intersect Power’s Clean Energy Model Solves the Problem Intersect Power brings a revolutionary approach to energy infrastructure. Their “data parks” are strategically located adjacent to renewable energy sources—wind, solar, and battery storage facilities. This integrated design eliminates transmission losses and grid dependency, creating a self-sufficient ecosystem for power-hungry AI operations. Feature Traditional Data Centers Intersect Power Data Parks Energy Source Grid-dependent On-site renewables Transmission Loss 5-10% Near zero Grid Wait Time Years Immediate Carbon Footprint High Net zero The Strategic Timeline: From Investment to Operation Alphabet’s relationship with Intersect Power began with a strategic $800 million investment in December 2024, led by Google and TPG Rise Climate. That partnership established an ambitious $20 billion investment target by 2030. The current acquisition represents the logical next step in this carefully orchestrated strategy. Key milestones include: December 2024: Initial $800M investment establishes partnership December 2025: Acquisition announcement for $4.75B First half 2026: Expected transaction closure Late 2026: First data parks become operational 2027: Full project completion What This Means for AI Data Centers and Competition Google will serve as the primary user of Intersect Power’s facilities, but the campuses are designed as industrial parks capable of hosting other companies’ AI infrastructure. This creates an interesting dynamic where Alphabet could potentially become both a competitor and infrastructure provider to other AI companies. The acquisition excludes Intersect Power’s existing operations, which will be purchased by other investors and managed separately. This structure allows Alphabet to focus specifically on future development projects aligned with its AI expansion plans. The Clean Energy Imperative in Tech Infrastructure Beyond solving immediate energy grid bottlenecks, this acquisition underscores the growing importance of clean energy in technology infrastructure. As environmental regulations tighten and consumer expectations evolve, companies that fail to address their carbon footprint face increasing risks. Intersect Power’s model demonstrates how clean energy can become a competitive advantage rather than a compliance cost. Their integrated approach reduces both environmental impact and operational vulnerability to grid instability. Broader Implications for Cryptocurrency and Blockchain For the cryptocurrency community, Alphabet’s move offers important insights. The energy intensity of AI training parallels that of cryptocurrency mining, and the solutions being developed for AI data centers could eventually benefit blockchain operations. The development of localized, renewable-powered infrastructure represents a potential path forward for sustainable crypto mining operations facing similar grid constraints. FAQs: Understanding the Alphabet-Intersect Power Deal What is Intersect Power? Intersect Power is a developer of data centers and clean energy infrastructure, specializing in integrated facilities that combine computing power with on-site renewable energy generation. Why did Alphabet acquire Intersect Power? Alphabet ( Alphabet Inc. ) made this acquisition to secure reliable, scalable energy for its AI data centers while bypassing traditional energy grid bottlenecks that have constrained growth. How much did Alphabet pay for Intersect Power? The deal is valued at $4.75 billion in cash, plus assumption of the company’s debt. This follows Alphabet’s previous $800 million investment through Google ( Google LLC ) and TPG Rise Climate. When will Intersect Power’s data parks be operational? The first facilities are expected to become operational in late 2026, with full completion projected for 2027. Can other companies use Intersect Power’s facilities? Yes, while Google will be the primary user, the campuses are designed as industrial parks that can host other companies’ AI infrastructure alongside Google’s operations. Conclusion: A New Era of Integrated Tech Infrastructure Alphabet’s acquisition of Intersect Power represents a watershed moment in technology infrastructure development. By vertically integrating energy production with data center operations, Alphabet is not just solving its own energy grid bottlenecks—it’s establishing a new paradigm for how tech companies approach infrastructure. This move demonstrates that in the race for AI dominance, control over energy resources may prove as important as algorithmic innovation. The implications extend beyond AI to any energy-intensive computing application, including cryptocurrency mining and blockchain operations, suggesting that the future of computing may depend on who controls the power.

Internet Computer protocol price forecast for 2028 expects the token to reach a peak price of $14.03. By 2031, the price of Internet Computer might reach a maximum of $22.81. Internet Computer (ICP) is a groundbreaking blockchain network developed by the DFINITY Foundation. It aims to extend the functionality of the internet, enabling it to host backend software and transforming it into a global, decentralized computer. Internet computer blockchain incorporates advanced cryptography and innovative technology to provide scalable, efficient, and secure decentralized applications (dApps). Given its robust technology and expanding utility, the Internet Computer blockchain’s future price prospects look promising. As more developers build on the platform and adoption increases, ICP token demand will likely rise. Does Internet Computer coin have a future? How much will Internet Computer coin cost in 2025? Will ICP reach $1000? Let’s get into the current price analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $3.14 Market Cap $1.703B Trading Volume $100.37M Circulating Supply 545.87M ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.86 (Sep 2023) 24-h High $3.19 24-h Low $3.02 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 11.78% (Very High) 14-Day RSI 41.54 (Neutral) 50-Day SMA $4.49 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 25 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 10/30 (33%) 200-Day SMA $4.90 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP bounced from key demand, but trend resistance still dominates. The $3.30 resistance level is the point that determines whether the brief upside continues or rejection occurs. Momentum is improving, but not yet convincing. ICP 1-day price analysis As of November 22, ICP is trading near $3.15 after bouncing from the lower Bollinger Band around $2.75, signaling short-term seller exhaustion but not a trend reversal yet. The price remains below the descending mid-band near $3.29 and significantly under the upper band at $3.83, maintaining a bearish-neutral daily structure. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD has just flipped positive on the histogram, hinting at an early momentum recovery, while the RSI, currently around 43, shows that the bounce is still weak and vulnerable. Unless ICP reclaims $3.30 on a daily close, this move appears as a relief bounce within a broader downtrend, with $2.85–$2.95 still exposed if momentum fades. ICP 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour timeframe, ICP has pushed above the Alligator cluster and is consolidating around $3.15–$3.18, representing a constructive short-term development. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The MACD is positive but flattening, suggesting that upside momentum is slowing rather than expanding, while the OBV has improved modestly, indicating cautious accumulation. The structure supports a grind higher toward $3.25–$ 3.30 if the price holds above $3.05; however, failure to defend that level would likely send ICP back into range toward $2.95. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $3.69 SELL SMA 5 $3.42 SELL SMA 10 $3.34 SELL SMA 21 $3.47 SELL SMA 50 $4.49 SELL SMA 100 $4.19 SELL SMA 200 $4.90 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $3.58 SELL EMA 5 $3.85 SELL EMA 10 $4.16 SELL EMA 21 $4.50 SELL EMA 50 $4.87 SELL EMA 100 $5.13 SELL EMA 200 $5.73 SELL What to expect from ICP price analysis ICP is likely to consolidate between $3.05 and $3.30. A breakout above $3.30 could extend toward $3.50, while a rejection would keep downside risk active toward sub-$3 levels. Is Internet Computer a good investment? The Internet Computer (ICP) has shown significant potential and volatility since its launch, which is common for relatively new and ambitious blockchain projects.

Exchange-traded funds linked to Solana recorded more than $69 million in net inflows, signaling growing interest from large investors. Besides improving sentiment around Solana’s long-term prospects, the inflows highlight a widening gap between institutional accumulation and short-term market structure. Consequently, traders continue to watch whether this demand can translate into a sustainable price recovery. Despite the inflows, Solana’s price remains under pressure. At the time of writing, Solana traded near $124.53 , posting modest daily and weekly declines. Trading volume remained elevated near $4 billion, indicating active participation despite recent losses. With a circulating supply of roughly 560 million tokens, Solana’s market value hovered close to $70 billion. Besides price action, these metrics show Solana continues to hold relevance among large-cap digital assets. SOL Downtrend Holds Below $130 Level Ali Martinez noted that Solana remains in a downtrend unless price breaks above $130. The SuperTrend indicator continues to flash a sell signal on the four-hour chart. Significantly, SOL has failed to reclaim this level despite several rebound attempts. Recent rallies stalled between $126 and $128, showing limited bullish follow-through. Additionally, the earlier rejection near $140 reinforced strong overhead supply. Immediate support sits near $122, which has absorbed selling pressure so far. However, failure to hold this zone could expose SOL to a deeper move toward $118. Consequently, short-term momentum remains tilted to the downside until buyers regain control above resistance. Source: X Sellers Defend $127 as Dominant Resistance Umair Crypto also highlighted $127 as the most important level in the current structure. According to his analysis, buyers attempted to flip this zone during a push toward $128.6. However, sellers quickly absorbed demand and forced price back into the $126 range. Hence, the rejection confirmed strong supply at that level. Moreover, footprint data showed buying activity near $127 without continuation volume. Sellers overwhelmed those bids soon after. Additionally, SOL remains below the 50-period simple moving average, although price is attempting a reclaim. While volume has improved slightly, it has not yet supported a confirmed breakout.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-22 21:44:26

The company has sold $74.5 million in Ether to pay down debt and pivot to real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. ETHZilla shared the news on a post on X. It wrote, “The Company believes its value will be driven by revenue and cash flow growth from our RWA tokenization business.” Moreover, the company is discontinuing the mNAV dashboard on its website effective today. But it will continue to provide periodic balance sheet updates to investors. Less than six months ago, ETHZilla shifted to an Ethereum-based digital asset treasury. The Peter Thiel-backed company said it currently holds 69,802 ETH worth around $207 million. ETHZilla sells Ethereum to pay debt According to the X post, the former biotech company stated that it was selling Ethereum to pay debt. The firm wrote, “As part of redeeming our outstanding senior secured convertible notes, ETHZilla sold 24,291 ETH for approximately $74.5 million.” It continued, “We plan to use all, or a significant portion, of the proceeds to fund the redemption.” The company explained that its public dashboard does not include balance sheet cash. This cash will be used to complete early redemptions on December 24 and December 30. ETHZilla was known before as 180 Life Sciences, a Nasdaq-listed biotech firm. The company liquidated $40 million worth of Ethereum coins in October. It used the proceeds in a $250 million stock repurchase plan. In July, 180 Life Sciences raised $425 million through a PIPE deal with more than 60 investors. The funding supported the company’s move to an Ether digital asset treasury strategy. During that time, small-cap Nasdaq-listed companies followed the DAT trend. The goal was to copy Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy.

Several major DAT firms have seen their mNAV ratios fall from above 1.5 to 1.0 or below. This means their shares trade at discounts to the value of their crypto holdings. mNAV stands for multiple of net asset value. It shows how a company’s market capitalization relates to the value of its crypto holdings. The basic mNav of Nakamoto Holdings, formerly KindlyMD, fell to 0.378 based on data from BitcoinTreasuries . In November, the company faced two collateral calls in one week on its $250 million Bitcoin-backed debt. DAT executives do not rely on product or service sales. They believe holding large BTC , ETH, or SOL balances enables firms to expand their crypto positions. This expansion is achieved through leverage. The DAT strategy appears to be losing momentum. Analysts now view digital asset treasuries as the bubble of this market cycle. ETHZilla moves into RWAs full time ETHZilla intends to adopt a real-world asset approach by creating tokens for assets like car loans, mobile home loans, aerospace machinery, and property. The company has entered into multiple agreements with Zippy, Inc. to bring manufactured home loans on-chain as tokenized RWAs. Zippy operates a digital lending platform focused on institutional markets. Under the agreements , ETHZilla will acquire a 15% fully diluted stake in Zippy. The deal includes $5 million in cash and $14 million in ETHZilla common stock, subject to certain cash true-up provisions. An additional $2.1 million in common stock will be issued to select Zippy shareholders. At the time of writing, the ETHZilla stock, ETHZ, sank by 8.70% and currently trades at $6.30. On the other hand, Ethereum is in the green zone. The coin is priced at $2,989.71, and it’s up by 2.1% in the last seven days. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Bitcoin has reversed recent gains, Ethereum has reversed around crucial marks and most meme coins have lost traction. When this occurs, traders will seek to shirk congested deals and shop new arrangements with more plausible upside. That change became observable in the preceding several weeks. One of the DeFi alts that is fast gaining momentum, whereas the broader market is becoming chilled, is attracting attention rapidly. Why Traders are paying close attention to MUTM The project that attracts this attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). It is currently under construction as a lending and borrowing protocol in DeFi that aims at practical use instead of a frenzy. On a high level, protocol enables users to provide assets and receive yield on the one hand, and borrowers receive liquidity on the other hand, with rules that are clear. This generates demand-related activity rather than sentimental activity. The timing of Mutuum Finance is what has helped it stand out in uncertain finance market conditions. As per the updates, V1 will be released on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. That puts the project in a stage where much development is completed, and the execution is within the sight. It is also usually at this stage of transition that traders would be drawn through structure, rather than speculation, in crypto. Participation Surge The participation has been growing in a progressive manner and the figures demonstrate the same. Mutuum Finance has secured approximately $19.4M funds and has also increased its base of holders to more than 18,600. These numbers are significant, not as large or small, but as they were developed. The growth has been increasing without hype spikes. Market observers take this pattern to be an indication of confidence. When there are no sudden intensives in participation, this will indicate accrual rather than hype. It further reflects the reason some of the initial Solana purchasers are keeping a close eye. They have experienced such an accumulation of the past cycles. MUTM token is now selling at $0.035 and is at Phase 6 presale. The overall supply is limited to 4B tokens and 45.5% of it is given to the presale stages. That amounts to approximately 1.82B tokens that will be held back to get distributed prior to larger market exposure. All the phases have one step-by-step increase in the price of the token since the beginning of 2025. Since the initial stage through to the present one; MUTM has already increased 250%. With each step, a higher fixed price came that gradually altered behavior. The lower levels preferred forbearance. Later stages favor urgency. Just like when the next crypto level is imminent, adjustment to prices becomes more severe and sudden. Why Timing Means Everything Security and infrastructure have also been an area of concern by Mutuum Finance, which is extremely important to a lending protocol. This project has a CertiK token scan rating of 90/100. Its smart contracts have been formally audited by the Halborn Security , and a bug bounty of 50k is also open to identify the possible problems. The protocol plans also involve audits, oracle integrations (to make sure pricing is right) and stablecoin growth and Layer-2 expansion to make fees lower and more accessible. Such aspects point to the fact that it is a long term project construction, not short term spike. Phase 6 now is more than 99% allocated, which has constricted accessible provide. This change has been coupled with higher allocations as was seen in recent whale interest of up to $115k. The 24 hour leaderboard activity is on the rise and card payments have reduced the entry cost. Combined with these, it results in a small timing margin. Supply is narrowing, infrastructure is almost prepared and the focus is shifting as the bigger market stands still. As queuing Q1 2026, Mutuum Finance is setting itself at the point where the visibility frequently speeds up, particularly in relation to a new DeFi crypto which has already achieved much of the legwork.

56201831,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=868970,1766440804,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/56201831.jpeg,Ethereum Market Structure Strengthens: Binance Netflows Point to Long-Term Conviction,https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/ethereum-market-structure-strengthens-binance-netflows-point-to-long-term-conviction/,"Ethereum is attempting to reclaim the $3,000 level after showing pockets of bullish strength over the weekend. Buyers briefly managed to push the price higher, but momentum has struggled to build, and ETH remains vulnerable below a key psychological threshold. As volatility compresses, market conviction appears fragile. Many analysts are increasingly calling for lower prices, arguing that recent rebounds lack the follow-through required to shift the broader structure back into a sustained uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Lags Network Utility: A Valuation Reset Is Underway On-chain data helps explain this hesitation. According to a recent CryptoQuant report, Ethereum’s Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) indicator remains in positive territory, with the latest reading hovering around 0.22. This suggests that the average ETH holder is still sitting on unrealized gains, but those profits are relatively modest. Historically, this zone is associated with a “belief” or cautious optimism phase, rather than euphoria. In other words, the market is neither in panic nor in an overheated state. This positioning places Ethereum at an inflection point. Investors are no longer capitulating, but they are also not aggressively chasing upside. With profits still on the table and sentiment mixed, ETH’s next move will likely depend on whether buyers can regain confidence and absorb lingering sell pressure. Until then, the market remains caught between hope and hesitation. Exchange Outflows Signal Strategic Repositioning According to the Arab Chain report, combining Ethereum’s NUPL data with exchange netflow metrics on Binance provides a clearer picture of current market dynamics. Recent data shows that Ethereum exchange netflows have consistently leaned toward net outflows, with frequent negative readings indicating that more ETH is being withdrawn from Binance than deposited. This behavior is typically associated with reduced immediate selling pressure, particularly when it occurs alongside a stable, positive NUPL reading. What makes this setup notable is the absence of a sharp increase in NUPL despite these outflows. In past cycles, strong withdrawals during periods of rising unrealized profits often coincided with aggressive profit-taking and euphoric sentiment. That pattern is not present today. Instead, the data suggests that holders are choosing to retain exposure rather than exit positions. ETH appears to be moving off exchanges for purposes such as long-term storage, staking, or participation within the broader Ethereum ecosystem, rather than for imminent liquidation. This divergence between sustained exchange outflows and restrained NUPL levels points to a structurally healthier market environment. Profits exist, but they are not excessive, and selling pressure on Binance remains limited. As a result, the probability of abrupt, sell-driven corrections is reduced. The medium-term outlook becomes more dependent on structural and fundamental developments, rather than short-term speculative behavior or emotional market swings.

Ethereum Consolidates Near a Critical Inflection Zone Ethereum’s weekly chart shows price attempting to stabilize around the $3,000–$3,100 region after a volatile multi-month decline from the 2025 highs near $4,800. This area has emerged as a key technical pivot, aligning closely with the rising 200-week moving average, which historically acts as a long-term trend gauge. ETH is currently trading just above this level, suggesting that bulls are defending structural support, but without strong momentum confirmation. The 50-week and 100-week moving averages are beginning to flatten and converge near current price, reflecting a broader transition from a strong uptrend into a consolidation phase. This compression often precedes a larger directional move. Notably, Ethereum has reclaimed the 100-week average but remains capped below the 50-week average, highlighting the ongoing struggle to re-establish a sustained bullish structure.

This supports the view that the market is digesting prior gains rather than entering a new impulsive trend. From a structural perspective, holding above the $2,900–$3,000 zone keeps the long-term uptrend intact. However, failure to reclaim the $3,300–$3,500 resistance range would leave ETH vulnerable to extended consolidation. For now, price action suggests balance, not resolution.

The malware was identified in November 2025 and is delivered as what looks like harmless game add-ons or utility cracks. Systems running Windows are the main target. Attackers Hide Malware In Mods Reports have disclosed that Stealka is disguised as cheats, mods and cracks for popular titles, with fake packages posted to places users normally trust. Files have been seen on GitHub, SourceForge, Softpedia and Google Sites, which helps the downloads look legitimate. In some cases, the malware was packaged as a Roblox mod or as a cracked copy of Microsoft Visio. According to Kaspersky, the campaign uses convincing websites and may employ automated tools to create professional pages that trick people into clicking download links. Data And Wallets Targeted Once run, Stealka searches for browser data, saved passwords and crypto wallet information. Based on reports, it targets more than 115 browser extensions tied to wallets, password managers and two-factor apps. Extensions for MetaMask, Binance Wallet, Coinbase and other popular wallets are among those at risk. Private keys, seed phrases and wallet file paths can be exposed on an infected machine, and stored browser cards and autofill entries are also collected. Victims’ accounts can be taken over using the stolen credentials, and that access can then be used to push further malicious links to friends or followers. How The Threat Spreads And Where It’s Seen Kaspersky’s telemetry shows initial detections in Russia, with additional cases reported in Turkey, Brazil, Germany and India. Distribution methods vary. Sometimes a single download bundle carries Stealka; other times it is paired with cryptominer code so infected computers also mine cryptocurrency for the attackers. Files hosted on trusted developer portals make it harder for users to spot danger, and the malware’s wide reach means standard precautions can still be bypassed if users ignore basic safety steps. Recommendations For Users According to cybersecurity advisories, avoid unofficial or pirated software and only download mods from verified, trusted creators. Use a reputable antivirus product and keep it updated. Password managers are recommended over saving credentials in browsers, and two-factor authentication should be enabled for crypto accounts when available. Keep Windows and applications patched, and check that a downloaded file’s checksum or digital signature matches the developer’s published value before running installers.

Leading research firm TD Cowen has just reaffirmed its Buy rating for Strategy , maintaining a bold $500 price target. This endorsement isn’t just a routine update; it’s a powerful statement about resilience and long-term vision in the volatile cryptocurrency sector. But what exactly makes Strategy so compelling to analysts right now? What Does TD Cowen’s Buy Rating for Strategy Really Mean? When a respected firm like TD Cowen maintains a Buy rating , it sends a strong signal to the market. Their analysis goes beyond short-term price movements, focusing instead on fundamental strength. In this case, TD Cowen highlighted Strategy’s recent financial maneuvering—specifically, adding a substantial $748 million to its dividend payment reserves. This move provides what analysts call “operational bedrock” during challenging times. Think of it this way: while many companies struggle during market downturns, Strategy is building a financial moat. This reserve isn’t just sitting idle; it serves a critical purpose. According to TD Cowen’s calculations, these funds can cover interest and dividend payments for approximately 32 months. That’s nearly three years of financial runway regardless of market conditions. How Strategy’s $748 Million Reserve Creates Unshakeable Stability The cryptocurrency market experiences cycles, often called “crypto winters,” where prices decline and sentiment turns negative. During these periods, companies with weak balance sheets face existential threats. Strategy’s approach demonstrates a different philosophy entirely. By bolstering its reserves, Strategy achieves several important objectives: Investor Confidence: Regular dividend payments become predictable, rewarding long-term shareholders. Operational Freedom: The company can continue strategic investments without being forced to make panic-driven decisions. Market Leadership: It positions Strategy as a stable counterparty in an industry sometimes known for instability. This financial prudence directly supports TD Cowen’s optimistic Buy rating . The firm essentially states that Strategy isn’t just surviving the crypto winter—it’s preparing to thrive when conditions improve. Beyond the Numbers: The Strategic Advantage of Preparedness TD Cowen’s analysis reveals something crucial about modern cryptocurrency investing. The firms that succeed aren’t necessarily those with the most aggressive growth targets during bull markets. Instead, they’re often those with the most disciplined approach to risk management during downturns. Strategy’s substantial reserve creates what financial experts call “optionality.” With 32 months of coverage for essential payments, the company’s leadership can focus on: Developing new products and services Exploring strategic partnerships Acquiring assets at potentially favorable prices during market lows This forward-thinking approach explains why the Buy rating comes with a $500 price target. TD Cowen isn’t just evaluating where Strategy is today, but where it could be in two to three years with this solid foundation. What This Means for Crypto Investors Watching From the Sidelines For individual and institutional investors alike, TD Cowen’s maintained Buy rating for Strategy offers valuable lessons. First, it emphasizes that fundamental analysis matters even in the crypto space. Second, it highlights how traditional financial metrics—like cash reserves and dividend coverage—increasingly apply to blockchain-based companies. Perhaps most importantly, this analysis suggests a maturation within the cryptocurrency industry. Companies are moving beyond pure speculation and toward sustainable business models. Strategy’s approach, as endorsed by TD Cowen’s rating, represents this evolution in action. Conclusion: A Beacon of Confidence in Uncertain Times TD Cowen’s decision to maintain its Buy rating with a $500 price target for Strategy represents more than just an analyst recommendation. It’s an endorsement of financial prudence in an industry that desperately needs it. By building substantial reserves and ensuring long-term operational stability, Strategy demonstrates that cryptocurrency companies can embrace both innovation and responsibility. As the broader market navigates ongoing challenges, stories like this provide crucial insight. They show us which companies are building for tomorrow rather than simply reacting to today’s market movements. For investors seeking opportunities with solid foundations, TD Cowen’s analysis offers a compelling case study in strategic resilience.
