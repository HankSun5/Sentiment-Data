Assets traditionally viewed as slow movers have risen as the clear winners, while the cryptocurrency market has quietly slipped to the bottom of the performance rankings. As the year draws to a close, data from across commodities, equities, and digital assets shows an imbalance in returns, revealing that cryptocurrencies now sit behind every major asset class in year-to-date performance. Clear Split Between Traditional Assets And Crypto The performance data for 2025 reveals a strong divergence between traditional markets and digital assets, with the gap widening as the year progressed. According to the figures revealed on the social media platform X by ‘Bull Theory,’ silver is the top-performing asset for 2025, posting gains of about 130% year-to-date. Gold is the second-best-performing asset of 2025, with an increase of about 65%, while copper has climbed close to 35%. These numbers reflect sustained strength across the commodities sector. Equity markets are also currently trading in positive territory. The Nasdaq is up around 20% on the year, the S&P 500 has gained approximately 16%, and the Russell 2000 is higher by about 13%. The only negative numbers are from the crypto industry. In contrast, the crypto market sits at the bottom of the performance rankings. Bitcoin is currently down by about 6% from its 2025 opening price, Ethereum has declined around 12%, and the entire altcoin market (removing Ethereum) has suffered a much deeper drawdown of about 42%. Therefore, the crypto market is now officially the worst-performing asset class in 2025. Chart Image From X. Source: @BullTheoryio From Mid-Year Rally To Q4 Breakdown The current weakness of the crypto market is very different from the optimism that dominated the beginning and middle of 2025. During that period, the crypto market experienced a powerful recovery that reignited bullish sentiment across the board. Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and several large-cap tokens pushed to new all-time highs. Bitcoin’s rally peaked in October, when it set its standing record of $126,000 after months of steady accumulation and strong momentum. Ethereum, on the other hand, registered a new all-time high of $4,946 in August, while XRP’s all-time high came earlier in July. XRP’s record price of $3.65 was the most notable, as it was its first time breaking into a new all-time high since 2018. That bullish trend began to unravel as the fourth quarter got underway, starting with the crypto market flash crash on October 10. The decline has extended since then, and Bitcoin and the broader crypto market have now fallen into negative territory from their 2025 opening levels. Quarterly returns data shows that Bitcoin just recorded its worst fourth-quarter performance in seven years. The result is a year in which digital assets, despite a powerful mid-year rally, are closing out as the worst-performing major asset class. Bitcoin Quarterly Returns.

Phase 1 sold out in record time, distributing 10 million tokens and raising $500,000 almost instantly. This success continued through Phase 2, bringing the total funds raised to over $1.4 million with a community of more than 3,000 holders . We have now entered Phase 3 , and the demand shows no signs of slowing down. Investors have already snapped up 600,000 tokens in this round. Market analysts are predicting that this phase will be exceptionally short. Speculation regarding imminent listings on major exchanges is driving this rapid accumulation. Avalanche Expands Globally While GeeFi Builds Core Utility Avalanche is making significant strides in the enterprise sector. The network is expanding into the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region through its new DLT Foundation . It is also focusing on launching custom blockchains for large enterprises and revolutionizing the music industry by modernizing royalty payments. GeeFi mirrors this commitment to real-world application by building a comprehensive decentralized ecosystem. The platform centers on the GeeFi Wallet , a secure non-custodial solution that gives users total control over their private keys. The integrated Decentralized Exchange (DEX) ensures seamless trading, and the upcoming GeeFi Crypto Card will bridge the gap between digital assets and daily spending. Secure Massive ROI Before Phase 3 Ends The current presale phase represents a critical opportunity for investors. Phase 3 tokens are currently priced at $0.13 . Buying at this level secures a guaranteed 325% ROI once the token lists at the confirmed price of $0.40 . Early supporters who participated in Phase 1 have already witnessed their investment grow by an astounding 1,200% . Time is of the essence for new investors. Analysts predict that Phase 3 will conclude in just 2 weeks due to the surging momentum and swirling rumors of tier-one exchange listings. This is the final window to acquire tokens at a discounted rate before public trading begins. Generate Passive Income with Flexible Staking GeeFi empowers its community with some of the most competitive staking rewards in the industry. You can earn substantial passive income by locking your assets. The platform offers a lucrative 55% APR for users who commit to a 12-month lock-up period. Shorter durations are also available to suit different strategies, including 22% APR for 3 months and 15% APR for 1 month . There is even a flexible option offering 10% APR with no lock-up required. Furthermore, the referral program allows you to earn a 5% bonus in GEE tokens for every purchase made by someone using your unique link. The Next 100x Gem Is Here Investors are constantly searching for the next project capable of delivering exponential returns. GeeFi is widely considered a potential 100x gem due to its solid utility and explosive presale performance. This project offers a rare combination of security, usability, and financial growth potential. Fear of missing out is driving thousands to secure their allocations before the presale closes. The window of opportunity is narrowing rapidly. Once Phase 3 sells out, the chance to invest at these ground-floor prices will disappear. Take action now to position yourself at the forefront of the next major evolution in decentralized finance.

One fine art loss adjuster allegedly said they received dozens of valuation certificates for decorative paintings submitted in one claim. Each sheet looked correct at first, but the descriptions for different pieces were identical. That single detail pushed the adjuster to suspect the entire batch came from an automated system. That check opened the door to wider concerns about how often forged files are slipping into the process without anyone noticing. Exposing how fraudsters build convincing paperwork Olivia Eccleston, a fine art insurance broker at Marsh, said chatbots and large language models are now helping fraudsters forge sales invoices, valuations, provenance documents, and certificates of authenticity. Olivia said this adds a new layer to an old fraud problem in the art market. Some attempts are deliberate. Others start when someone asks an AI model to search historic databases, and it produces results that never existed. Those errors then show up in paperwork that gets sent to insurers as if it were fact. The chain of ownership, known as provenance, is central in the art world. When people corrupt that chain with invented details, the artwork’s value collapses. Angelina Giovani, co-founder of provenance research group Flynn & Giovani, said AI makes this easy because “it’s quite conniving… it has to come up with an answer, so if you give it enough information, it will guess something.” Angelina said she saw a case where an AI system appeared to create a signature on a painting to strengthen its story. Experts note that none of this is new in principle. People once copied letterheads from respected institutions or designed fake stamps. Now they lean on AI to generate the same paperwork with smoother language and fewer obvious errors. Filippo Guerrini-Maraldi, head of fine art at insurer Howden, said he has seen many forged documents over his career and that automated systems now make them look more realistic. Angelina said she has seen fake ledger numbers and forged Nazi-era stamps on provenance files. She also pointed to the case of Wolfgang Beltracchi, who created hundreds of paintings and used staged photographs to build fake ownership histories behind them. These tactics show how far people go to support artwork that cannot stand on its own. Tracking digital clues as fraud becomes harder to see Harry Smith, executive chair of art valuers Gurr Johns, said AI now makes fraud quicker because people no longer need to invent a fake expert to back their claim. The tool produces whatever support text they want. Grace Best-Devereux, a fine art loss adjuster at Sedgwick, said she checks metadata in digital documents to spot signs of AI interference. Grace said adjusters also use their own systems to decide whether a provenance document is real. But she warned that the job is getting harder because new tools are making forged text look normal. Grace said, “We’re at this precipice where it might not be possible for me to look at it and say, ‘the text looks wrong, and I need to investigate this further.’” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

Pacific Gas and Electric said the blackout started Saturday afternoon and peaked two hours later, hitting about 130,000 customers. As of press time, reportedly 21,000 homes and businesses still had no electricity, mostly in the Presidio, the Richmond District, Golden Gate Park, and parts of downtown. Pacific Gas and Electric said the cause was a fire at a substation that caused “significant and extensive” damage, and it could not give a timeline for full repairs. San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said in a 9 p.m. update on X that police, fire crews, parking control officers, and city ambassadors were sent into affected neighborhoods as transit slowly came back.“Waymo has also paused service,” he said. Elon Musk says Tesla is unaffected by the blackout Meanwhile, Elon Musk said via a post on X that:- “Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by the SF power outage.” Though, it did not take long for people to point out that Tesla does not run a driverless program in the city at all, with his comment section littered with angry users. Tesla’s local service uses “FSD (Supervised),” which is a driver-assist system that needs a human behind the wheel at all times. Regulators at the California DMV and the California Public Utilities Commission confirmed that Tesla has no permits to run driverless cars in the state without human safety workers ready to brake or steer. Tesla is trying to become a big player in robotaxis, but its rides today still rely on human supervisors, even in states where the company holds permits for driverless programs. Tesla’s Robotaxi app lets people request a car, but every trip has a human on board. Waymo, on the other hand, leads the market in the West and competes with companies like Baidu-owned Apollo Go. The outage hit as robotaxi programs become more common in other major U.S. cities. Waymo is one of the few companies offering full driverless rides to the public, even though surveys show people remain uneasy. The American Automobile Association said earlier this year that two-thirds of U.S. drivers reported fear of autonomous cars. Bryan Reimer, a research scientist at MIT and co-author of “How to Make AI Useful,” said the pause in San Francisco showed the limits of these vehicles. He said something was missed in the design or development of the systems, and he argued that power failures are expected events. “Not for eternity, but in the foreseeable future, we will need to mix human and machine intelligence, and have human backup systems in place around highly automated systems, including robotaxis,” he said. Reimer also said regulators must decide how many highly automated cars should be allowed on streets and should hold AV companies responsible for any “chaos gridlock” the cars cause during major outages. Waymo did not say when service will return or whether any collisions happened during the blackout.

Our Pi network price prediction anticipates the Pi price to reach a maximum level of $0.35 by 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $3.14. Pi Network, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan, is a social crypto and developer ecosystem built for real-world utility and mass accessibility. 2025 has been a defining stress test: Pi surged to about $2.98 in February, crashed to a new all-time low of $0.1585 on October 11, and now trades near $0.22 in early December, highlighting extreme volatility as the year closes. But basic building blocks continue to keep investor interest alive, including the Passkey security improvement to Pi Wallet, Pi DEX, and AMM on Testnet, Pi Network Ventures pushing towards decentralization and AI with OpenMind, and millions of new KYC verifications and continuing projects such as the 2025 Pi Hackathon and Sign Protocol partnership. In this Pi Network price prediction, we discuss these developments with major technical levels and the model of exponential supply of Pi that is in decline to determine whether 2025–2031 favors a sustained recovery or further downside.

The daily RSI is near 43, staying below neutral, while the MACD remains negative, confirming weak momentum and continued bearish pressure. Key support sits between $0.19 and $0.20, while resistance now stands between $0.21 and $0.22. As of December 21, 2025, Pi Network is showing continued weakness after declining back toward the $0.20 psychological level. Pi is trading near $0.205, with a market cap of approximately $1.71 billion and 24-hour volume around $11.64M, indicating cautious participation rather than aggressive dip-buying. Bulls are struggling to reclaim lost ground, and price action suggests hesitation ahead of key support. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis The 1-day chart shows a small red candle following a failed attempt to hold above $0.21. Price has ranged between roughly $0.202 and $0.212, and settled at $0.205.This keeps Pi stuck in its recent low consolidation zone. The overall structure still reflects lower highs, and no clear reversal pattern has formed yet. The RSI (14) is currently around 41, which is below the neutral 50 level. This indicates that bearish momentum is still present in the market. However, since the RSI is not yet in the oversold zone, which is below 30, there is still room for further downside before a strong rebound can be expected. The RSI line is relatively flat, suggesting weak selling pressure and a lack of strong buying interest at the moment. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView On the MACD (12, 26), both the MACD and signal lines remain below the zero line, with a slightly negative histogram. This confirms that bearish momentum is still present, even if selling pressure has slowed compared to earlier declines. Immediate support is found around $0.20, with a breakdown opening the door toward $0.19. On the upside, resistance sits at $0.21, followed by a stronger barrier near $0.22. A daily close above $0.22 would be needed to shift the short-term bias away from bearish. Pi/USD 4-Hour Price Analysis On the 4-hour timeframe, the price of Pi Network is trading around $0.205, moving sideways after a prolonged bearish move. Price action shows a series of lower highs, confirming that the broader short-term trend remains bearish. However, the recent candles are small and tightly ranged, indicating consolidation near a key support zone around $0.20, where buyers are attempting to defend the price. The RSI (14) is currently around 47, which is slightly below the neutral 50 level. This suggests that the market is still leaning bearish, but selling pressure is weak. The RSI recently moved up toward the mid-range and then pulled back, indicating a short-term recovery attempt that lacked strong momentum. Since the RSI is neither overbought nor oversold, price action is likely to remain range-bound unless a stronger push from buyers or sellers appears. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView The MACD (12, 26) on the 4-hour timeframe is very close to the zero line, showing low momentum and market indecision. Although the MACD line is slightly above the signal line, the histogram remains small, indicating that bullish momentum is weak and not yet confirmed. Overall, the MACD suggests a consolidation phase, where the price is stabilizing but has not formed a clear directional move yet.

Price is likely to move sideways or slightly downward, unless buyers push it above nearby resistance, which would signal a short-term relief bounce. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.3610 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly, neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is PI’s price down today? Pi’s price is down due to a technical breakdown below key support, combined with weak momentum and low trading volume. Ongoing open mainnet delays limit real utility, while supply overhang concerns continue to weigh on demand. In the short term, price action depends on whether the $0.20 support holds or breaks toward $0.15. Will Pi Price Reach $5? At the current pace of development and given its total PI supply circulating supply of over 8 billion PI, Pi Network’s value is unlikely to reach $5 in the near term. Multiple technical quantitative indicators and fundamental factors, such as delayed mainnet launch and maximum supply constraints, suggest that Pi’s price may fluctuate within lower ranges before any major uptrend. A $5 target would require sustained adoption, significant on-chain activity, and strong market demand that is not yet present. Will Pi Reach $10? Reaching $10 would represent a massive increase in Pi’s market cap, something that is not expected soon under current crypto market conditions. Analysts suggest that even optimistic forecasts place this milestone more than a decade away, if at all. Investors should treat such projections as speculative investment advice and conduct their own research before making investment decisions, as Pi remains a high-risk asset with uncertain long-term value.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi showed a sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72. At the start of July 2025, Pi Network faced high volatility as massive token unlocks triggered strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range. On July 19, 2025, PIUSDT declined slightly to $0.4412, reflecting short-term bearish pressure. On July 26, 2025, PIUSDT continued to hover under pressure around $0.4409, staying within a tight trading range as momentum remained subdued. for August 2, 2025. Pi traded at $0.3496, still under pressure and at its all-time low. On August 6, 2025, Pi Network is traded at around $0.3410, showing moderate consolidation with weak momentum and limited price movement. On August 9th, Pi/USDT went up from its early August low of $0.3766 and traded around $0.4103. August 17th, 2025, the Pi Network (PI) traded at $0.387 , showing slight movement between support at $0.383 and resistance at $0.390 . On August 21, Pi Network (PI) traded near $0.366, showing a modest 1.39% gain as buyers attempted a short-term recovery. On September 2, 2025, Pi network traded around $0.34, just above its past month’s August all-time low of $0.3304. On September 22, 2025, Pi crashed to a new all-time low (ATL) of $0.2234, marking a –92% drop from its February ATH and reflecting heavy sell-side pressure from token unlocks and weak demand. Pi rebounded slightly, to trade between $0.25 and $0.28 through late September, though resistance at $0.30 continued to hold firmly. At the start of October 2025, Pi trades at $0.2718, but is still struggling under bearish sentiment as buyers attempt to defend support above $0.26 while momentum indicators suggest only a weak recovery. On October 11, 2025, Pi Network hit a new all-time low of $0.1585, reflecting the peak of a prolonged market crash and severe selling pressure. On October 15, 2025, Pi Network (PI) stabilized slightly, trading around $0.1884, as short-term buyers stepped in following the sharp October 11 crash. On October 28, 2025, PI attempted a short rebound toward $0.238, but failed to hold gains, slipping back below the 20-day moving average. As of the start of November 2025, Pi Network traded at approximately $0.247, still below key resistance at $0.26, as traders remain cautious ahead of the upcoming 120 million token unlock expected in November. As of November 15, Pi network traded at $0.223. This rise for 1 day was driven by technical breakout signals, whale accumulation, and ongoing ecosystem updates. As of November 30, 2025, Pi Network traded around $0.243, consolidating above the $0.24 support zone while still below the $0.26 resistance heading into month-end. As of December 1, 2025, Pi Network had dropped to about $0.226, as sellers reacted to December’s 190M PI token unlock overhang and a broader risk-off mood in the crypto market. As of December 16, 2025, Pi Network traded around $0.196, having broken below the psychological $0.20 support as ongoing token unlocks, legal uncertainty, and sustained bearish technical momentum kept strong downside pressure on the price.",Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|TRADING|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-21 21:30:00

The CBDC project ultimately aims to enhance fiscal efficiency by curbing misuse and slashing administrative costs. However, the broader pushback against the CBDC from citizens remains, with many of them seemingly believing that it is a tool for government surveillance. Is South Korea’s CDBC ready? According to reports , the Bank of Korea (BOK) is accelerating the resumption of the CBDC experiment amid delays in discussions on the Korean won stablecoin bill . According to sources cited in local reports on December 21, the BOK already sent out an official document to major banks regarding the second round of CBDC testing. A BOK official stated, “Details, including the specific method and schedule, are currently under discussion.” Under the second phase of testing, the BoK is allegedly considering distributing a portion of government subsidies in the form of digital currency. They hope the CBDC can help limit its use and reduce the management and administrative costs linked with subsidy execution. The first phase of the CBDC experiment was conducted with seven banks and lasted three months before it was suspended. At the time, the experiment received backlash for its limited practical utility and the financial burden it placed on the participating banks, which amounted to billions of won. Revival of the testing phase was floated in late August of this year during a meeting between BoK Governor Rhee Chang-yong and Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol, in which they discussed using CBDC for subsidy payouts as a way to address the problems. The banking industry is adamant that a second round of testing is required for the time being. One banking industry official said, “With the official document, we have no choice but to restart preparations.” At the same time, it has become clear that South Korea may be looking to pursue both the stablecoin and CBDC avenues, rather than sticking with one. A BOK official stated, “Stablecoins and CBDCs have different roles and purposes, so they can coexist. We are proceeding with previously scheduled procedures and are not directly related to the delay in discussions on the won-denominated stablecoin bill.” Despite such statements pushing the efficiency narrative, the pushback from South Korean citizens against broader CBDC adoption has been massive, with online petitions making concerning claims like how it could facilitate excessive government surveillance and control over personal finances, gaining traction. South Korean agencies debate stablecoin oversight The launch of the second phase of CBDC testing is being debated as the institutionalization of the Korean won-denominated stablecoin continues to be delayed due to the inability of the Financial Services Commission and the Bank of Korea to see eye to eye over the matter of issuer and regulatory framework. The Democratic Party of Korea’s Digital Asset Task Force (TF) initially requested that the Financial Services Commission submit a government proposal by December 11, but the Financial Services Commission reportedly submitted only a rough outline of the draft bill. The draft, “Key Contents of the Framework Act on Digital Assets,” claims the Financial Services Commission (FSC) proposed a plan to designate important stablecoins based on the number of stablecoin users and issuance volume. This designation should have been made in consultation with the Bank of Korea (BOK). As such, it is interpreted as only partially reflecting the BOK’s concerns about the issuance of won-denominated stablecoins. The final draft is expected but has been delayed due to the failure to coordinate opinions on key issues, such as the requirements for issuing by bank-centered consortiums and the unanimous agreement of the policy consensus body.

They shift with a change of behavior. First, users watch. Then they participate. Finally, they hold. Price is a natural successor when this shift occurs on scale. New DeFi crypto seems to be reaching that phase. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is subject to increased allocation restraint; the token priced at $0.035 is experiencing the change in behavioral patterns. Early Signals of Behaviour at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a protocol which is being developed that is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol based on Ethereum. The project is very practical in its momentum as opposed to being focused on hype. Users supply assets. Borrowers access liquidity. Participation can be rewarded by the protocol mechanics of the system. There are a number of initial behavioral cues forming. One is holding behavior. With the approach of Phase 6 allocation, the number of tokens left is decreasing. This could promote long holding as compared to short term flipping. Another indicator is the usage of mtToken. Users receive the assets deposited on Mutuum Finance in the form of mtTokens. Such tokens make users remain on the platform as opposed to leaving within a short time. Behavior change is also manifested in terms of Leaderboard activity. The 24-hour leaderboard will give the best daily winner $500 of MUTM. This makes participating recurrent, not a single participation. Such trends tend to be better than the announcements. Participation and Habit Formation The process of lending and borrowing is more likely to accustom more people than most other crypto products. Users reposition, trade collateral or yield management. Every interaction strengthens interaction. The price increase due to short term bursts of attention is prone to decline since habits of protocols are more resilient to the recession induced post-event changes. Selling pressure may decline with time when users use the platform to stay active. Mutuum Finance is a product that revolves around this loop. Lending creates deposits. Borrowing creates demand. Both parties communicate with each other several times. This may eventually transform the token into a utility connected holding. V1 being the Behavioral Trigger Point The V1 launch that is coming is significant since it transforms the behavior of users. Up to V1, the participation is largely preparative. Following V1, the actions become operative. Due to the official updates, Mutuum Finance is set to launch its V1 on the Sepolia testnet in the Q4 of 2025. Its main characteristics are liquidity pools, mt Tokens, debt tokens and a liquidator bot. The assets initially launched will be ETH and USDT. Behavior will in many cases accelerate when platforms are changed between setup and usage. There are analysts who feel that this step can initiate the initial significant repricing. In a bullish case, it is projected that after the launch, MUTM could climb higher than $0.06 as more people join. Second Price Scenario Other than participation, long term behavior is determined by incentives. Mutuum Finance has a buy and distribute mechanism. Some of the protocol revenue is used to purchase MUTM in the market and redistribute to interested mtToken stakers. This creates a feedback loop. The more it is used, the more it gives revenue. Increased revenue causes increased purchasing pressure. This model is in contrast to the demand which is supported by attention; this model associates price support with activity. Yield rewards are also incentives to hold. Selling is less appealing when the users make money by participating in it. According to some commentators of the market, a long term demand of a sustained revenue would justify a higher price bracket in the long term, possibly between $0.10 and $0.15 should consistent progress be found in the usage. Scaling Behavior with Stablecoin and Layer-2 plans Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will serve stablecoins and consider integration with layer-2 according to the official roadmap. The assets such as Stables minimise the volatility to daily users. There are the layer-2 networks which minimize fees and enhance speed. Daily use is easy because of lower cost and stabilizing value assets. This increases the number of people who can use it other than sophisticated traders. Liquidity increases with the magnitude of behavior, and, as price movements tend to become organized. Mutuum Finance is still in development with MUTM priced at $0.035, and with V1, its beta features will become available. Nonetheless, on reaching an allocation of near 100% and a shift of user behavior toward being habitual, MUTM seems poised to potentially experience another 300% token appreciation.

Bitcoin predictions for 2026 Galaxy Digital Research has released its annual crypto market predictions for 2026, predicting that Bitcoin will reach $250,000 by the end of 2027, although they acknowledge that 2026 remains too unpredictable to call it with confidence. Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital, explained that options markets currently price equal odds of Bitcoin hitting either $70,000 or $130,000 by June 2026, and equal odds of $50,000 or $250,000 by year-end 2026. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $126,080 on October 6, 2025, driven by regulatory reforms and ETF inflows during the first ten months of the year. However, the market experienced a sharp reversal and witnessed leverage liquidations, whale distribution, and shifting investment narratives. By December, Bitcoin had fallen back to the low $90,000 range and currently trades around $88,000. The report identifies several factors responsible for the potential uncertainty for 2026, including the rate of AI capital expenditure deployment, monetary policy conditions, and the U.S. midterm elections in November. Thorn emphasized that until Bitcoin firmly re-establishes itself above the $100,000 to $105,000 level, downside risk remains in the near term. Galaxy released 26 predictions covering various aspects of the crypto ecosystem, including expectations that more than 50 spot altcoin ETFs will launch in the United States, U.S. spot crypto ETF net inflows will exceed $50 billion, and at least 15 crypto companies will IPO or uplist in the U.S. during 2026. How accurate were Galaxy’s 2025 predictions? Galaxy Digital predicted at the beginning of the year that Bitcoin would cross $150,000 in the first half and possibly reach $185,000 in the fourth quarter. By November, Thorn had lowered the year-end target to $125,000, and even that revised forecast appears unlikely to be met due to the significantly lower Bitcoin trades in December. A major leverage unwinding event on October 10, 2025, caused significant market disruption, erasing approximately $78 billion in open interest across crypto futures. More than 470,000 Bitcoins held for over five years, worth approximately $50 billion, changed hands during 2025. Galaxy facilitated one of the year’s largest single transfers, involving $9 billion worth of assets from a legacy whale. Throughout 2025, institutional investment was more toward artificial intelligence infrastructure, data centers, nuclear energy, quantum technology, and gold. Galaxy predicted that at least one major wealth management platform would announce a 2% or higher recommended Bitcoin allocation. It hit on that one as Morgan Stanley published a report announcing up to 4% allocation. They also accurately forecast that more than half of the top 20 publicly traded Bitcoin miners would become or partner with AI and high-performance computing firms. However, Bitcoin did not cross $150,000 as Galaxy initially predicted, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs did not collectively reach $250 billion in assets under management, and Bitcoin did not finish among the top performers on a risk-adjusted basis among global assets. Galaxy Digital see s bi g 2026 for stablecoin s Ga laxy Digital predicts that stablecoins will overtake the U.S. Automated Clearing House system in transaction volume due to current data showin g st ablecoin transactions already exceeding major credit card networks like Visa and processing roughly half the volume of the ACH system. Thad Pinakiewicz, vice president of research at Galaxy, said that stablecoin supply has been growing at a 30% to 40% compound annual growth rate along with transaction volumes. According to data from DefiLlama, the stablecoin market cap currently stands at approximately $309 billion, with Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC continuing to dominate the market. Galaxy expects the passage and implementation of the GENIUS Act in early 2026 to accelerate stablecoin adoption. The act was signed into law by President Trump in July 2025 and provides regulatory clarity for stablecoins. It is expected to enable both incumbent tokens to grow and new entrants to compete for market share. Jianing Wu, a research associate at Galaxy, explained that consumers and merchants are unlikely to juggle multiple digital dollars and will instead gravitate toward one or two options with the broadest acceptance. Nine major banks, including Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Bank of America, and Citigroup, are already exploring plans to launch stablecoins based on G7 currencies. In October, Western Union revealed plans for its U.S. Dollar Payment Token on the Solana blockchain. Sony Bank is developing a stablecoin for integration across its U.S. ecosystem, including PlayStation and subscription services, with a planned 2026 launch. Cryptopolitan reported earlier this month that SoFi Technologies has introduced SoFiUSD, a fully reserved dollar stablecoin issued by SoFi Bank on Ethereum. Galaxy’s expectations include that at least one of the top three global card networks will conduct more than 10% of its cross-border settlement volume through public-chain stablecoins, though most end users will never see a crypto interface. Galaxy predicts that decentralized exchanges will capture more than 25% of combined spot trading volume by the end of 2026, up from roughly 15-17% currently. The firm also expects total crypto-backed loans outstanding to exceed $90 billion and predicts that more than $500 million worth of DAO treasury assets will be governed exclusively by futarchy decision-making systems.

According to a press release sent to CryptoPotato , the country will channel 10,000 BTC, worth roughly $1 billion, to support the long-term development of GMC. GMC is a new economic hub designed for mindfulness, sustainability, and innovation. Bhutan Unveils Bitcoin Development Pledge Bhutan’s ruler, His Majesty King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, unveiled the Bitcoin Development Pledge via his National Day Address earlier this week. The commitment aligns with the king’s vision of applying modern digital technologies to serve the people of Bhutan and future generations. The country will assess several approaches that would enable the long-term use of the pledged assets. The options under consideration include collateralising the Kingdom’s bitcoin holdings, implementing yield management strategies, and preserving asset value while holding them long-term. Bhutan will guide any use of BTC in the GMC by prudence and strong governance, ensuring transparency and capital preservation. The country will prioritize preserving long-term potential while developing the economic hub in a stable and sustainable manner. Jigdrel Singay, Board Director at GMC, commented on the approach, saying: “Bhutan’s position is that its Bitcoin holdings are intended for the long term, and that commitment is reiterated clearly in the Development Pledge. The specific strategy is still being worked on, and the examples mentioned in the announcement outline the range of responsible options under consideration. There is no change to Bhutan’s long-term stewardship approach toward its Bitcoin reserves.” GMC to be Powered by Digital Infrastructure Besides being a mindfulness hub, GMC will also provide regulatory clarity, financial connectivity, and a long-term environment for collaboration. The hub is open to partnerships from both local and international digital asset entities. Bhutan has already integrated digital assets into the hub’s strategic reserves and enabled crypto-based payments across services. The Kingdom has also launched TER, a sovereign-backed token linked to physical gold. These efforts build on the country’s track record of being one of the earliest adopters of BTC and digital asset infrastructure. Since 2017, Bhutan has quietly been mining BTC using clean energy. “As your King, I must ensure that every Bhutanese is a custodian, stakeholder, and beneficiary of GMC…This commitment is for our people, our youth, and our nation,” Bhutan’s ruler stated.

This isn’t science fiction; it’s a potential reality that has top experts sounding the alarm. A critical quantum defense upgrade for Bitcoin is now a race against time, with dire warnings that failure could see BTC’s price plummet below $50,000 within the next few years. The clock is ticking on the most significant technological challenge Bitcoin has ever faced. Why Is Quantum Defense Suddenly a Crisis for Bitcoin? For years, quantum computing has been a distant theoretical threat. However, recent expert analysis suggests the timeline for danger is accelerating faster than the timeline for a solution. The core issue is simple: the cryptographic algorithms that protect Bitcoin wallets today could be broken by a sufficiently powerful quantum computer. While such a machine may not exist imminently, preparing the entire Bitcoin network for this change is a monumental task that could take a decade. Without this quantum defense , the market’s confidence—and thus, Bitcoin’s price—could collapse preemptively. What Are the Experts Saying About the BTC Price Threat? The warnings from industry leaders are stark and carry significant weight. Jameson Lopp, a respected BTC Core developer, acknowledges that while a direct attack isn’t immediate, the process of upgrading the protocol and migrating vulnerable funds will be painfully slow. The more urgent outlook comes from Charles Edwards of Capriole Investments. He presents a chilling forecast: BTC could fall below $50,000 by 2028 if it lacks quantum resistance. Edwards emphasizes that the market impact of delayed action could dwarf past catastrophes, potentially exceeding the fallout from the FTX collapse. His reasoning is grounded in a terrifying statistic: over four million BTC are currently stored in wallets that are vulnerable to a future quantum attack. This isn’t a minor flaw; it’s a systemic risk. How Does a Lack of Quantum Defense Create Market Panic? The threat isn’t just technical; it’s profoundly psychological. The cryptocurrency market is driven by trust in security and scarcity. Therefore, the mere perception of vulnerability can trigger a sell-off long before any actual attack occurs. Consider these key risk factors: Loss of Scarcity: If millions of supposedly lost or secure coins become accessible to an attacker, the total supply shock could devastate the market. Erosion of Trust: Bitcoin’s value proposition hinges on being a secure, decentralized store of value. A fundamental security flaw undermines this entire premise. Institutional Flight: Large investors and ETFs would be forced to re-evaluate their holdings if the foundational technology is seen as compromised. This perfect storm of technical risk and market sentiment is why establishing robust quantum defense is no longer optional—it’s essential for survival. Can Bitcoin Actually Implement a Quantum Defense in Time? The path to a quantum-resistant Bitcoin is fraught with challenges. Upgrading a decentralized, multi-trillion-dollar network is not like updating a phone app. It requires near-universal consensus among developers, miners, exchanges, and holders. The transition would likely involve: Developing and rigorously testing new, quantum-safe cryptographic standards. Creating a clear migration path for users to move funds from old, vulnerable addresses to new, secure ones. Ensuring backward compatibility and network stability throughout the multi-year process. The five-to-ten-year window experts cite is not for building the quantum computer itself, but for completing this incredibly complex global upgrade. The race is on. What’s the Final Verdict on Bitcoin’s Quantum Future? The message from the forefront of crypto development is clear: complacency is the real enemy. The challenge of quantum computing is unprecedented, but Bitcoin has overcome major obstacles before. The key takeaway is that proactive development and community coordination are paramount. The market will reward foresight and punish delay. The narrative for the next decade will be defined by how effectively the ecosystem builds and deploys its quantum defense . The alternative is a price prediction no investor wants to see become reality. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is a quantum attack on Bitcoin? A: A quantum attack would use a powerful quantum computer to solve the mathematical problems that currently protect Bitcoin wallets, allowing an attacker to steal funds. Q: Is my Bitcoin safe right now? A: Yes, for the immediate future. The threat is from future, more advanced quantum computers. However, coins in certain types of addresses (like legacy Pay-to-Public-Key Hash) are considered more vulnerable long-term. Q: What is being done to make Bitcoin quantum-resistant? A> Cryptographers and Bitcoin developers are actively researching “post-quantum cryptography”—new algorithms that even quantum computers couldn’t easily break. Implementing them network-wide is the next major hurdle. Q: Could a quantum computer break Bitcoin tomorrow? A> Most experts agree this is highly unlikely. The current generation of quantum computers is not powerful enough. The concern is about being prepared before the technology advances. Q: Will we need to buy new “quantum-proof” Bitcoin? A> Not exactly. The likely solution is a network upgrade where users move their BTC to new, quantum-resistant address types, similar to past upgrades like SegWit. Q: Are other cryptocurrencies at risk too? A> Yes, virtually all cryptocurrencies using similar cryptography (like Ethereum) face the same quantum threat and will need their own defense strategies.

One minute, timelines look quiet; the next minute, rockets ignite, and portfolios start sweating. While blue-chip names keep shipping updates and scaling quietly, meme-powered presales are stealing the spotlight with louder momentum and sharper upside chatter. Avalanche is pushing scalability milestones, Chainlink continues to expand real-world data integrations, and traders are scanning headlines for the next breakout narrative. For readers tracking opportunity windows with clarity, trusted resources still matter. To explore emerging trends and informed perspectives, many investors compare insights under Best Crypto to Buy Now before committing capital. That brings the spotlight to a presale shaking timelines right now. Apeing ‘s whitelist is pulling attention like gravity, and Apeing dominates as the 100x crypto across early adopter discussions. Scarcity is apparent, timing feels sharp, and anticipation is building as wallets line up for front-row access. Apeing Dominates as the 100x Crypto and Sets the Tone Early Apeing opens this story with intention. Apeing dominates as the 100x crypto not by accident, but through a launch strategy built around decisive early participation and controlled access. History favors conviction. Those who hesitate, refreshing charts and waiting for perfect signals, often watch the biggest multipliers move without them. This project flips that script by rewarding speed, clarity, and belief before public noise takes over. The upcoming Apeing presale is structured to favor early momentum. Upcoming presale stage 1 pricing is set at 0.0001, with a planned listing at 0.001. That gap defines the upside narrative without leaning on hype alone. Limited token allocation reinforces discipline, while the whitelist filters out casual watchers and lets serious participants in. This framework builds trust and creates growth pathways without diluting value. Apeing and $APEING are positioned to benefit from a clean launch, transparent mechanics, and a community primed to move together rather than chase later. Why Apeing Dominates as the 100x Crypto for Early Whitelist Access Apeing dominates as the 100x crypto for one apparent reason: timing meets structure. Joining the whitelist early means exposure at the lowest available entry before public pricing reshapes demand. Tokens allocated to presale stage 1 are capped, creating urgency without chaos. Early participants gain clarity on supply, pricing, and roadmap expectations, reducing emotional trading later. This approach encourages steady conviction and long-term thinking while still offering explosive upside potential. With projected upside discussions reaching beyond 10,000 percent based on entry versus listing pricing, Apeing and $APEING present a calculated risk profile rather than blind speculation. When momentum builds early, diamond hands tend to form naturally. Avalanche (AVAX) Price Today Signals Scalable Power Ahead Avalanche continues to earn its place among serious infrastructure-focused networks. AVAX price today reflects a blockchain designed for speed, low latency, and developer flexibility. Its consensus mechanism supports high throughput without sacrificing decentralization, making it attractive for DeFi, gaming, and enterprise-grade applications. Recent developments highlight Avalanche’s growing subnet ecosystem, allowing customized blockchains to operate efficiently within its network. This modular approach improves scalability and cost control while expanding use cases. AVAX price forecasts often hinge on adoption metrics rather than speculation alone, positioning the token as a steady performer for investors prioritizing fundamentals and network utility. Chainlink (LINK) Crypto Price Today Anchors Real Utility Chainlink remains a backbone for decentralized data infrastructure. LINK crypto price today reflects its role as the most widely adopted oracle network, connecting smart contracts with real-world data securely and reliably. This utility-driven model continues attracting partnerships across DeFi, gaming, and traditional finance bridges. Recent expansions into cross-chain interoperability reinforce Chainlink’s relevance as multi-network ecosystems grow. Secure data feeds, proof-of-reserves, and automation tools strengthen its long-term value proposition. LINK price forecasts often align with broader adoption rather than hype cycles, making it a staple for portfolios focused on reliability and depth of integration. Conclusion Avalanche, Chainlink, and Apeing each serve different investor mindsets. AVAX delivers scalable infrastructure, LINK anchors real-world data trust, and Apeing dominates as the 100x crypto by capturing early momentum through a disciplined whitelist model. Apeing’s fast start, limited allocation, and clear presale pricing create a compelling early-stage narrative. The whitelist is currently open, momentum is accelerating, and early access is shrinking by the day. For those serious about identifying high-upside opportunities before public entry points shift the game, Apeing and $APEING deserve immediate attention.

Market swings can be nerve-wracking. However, a simple strategy endorsed by CNBC and top financial experts can bring peace of mind: limiting your crypto allocation to a modest portion of your overall wealth. Let’s explore why this rule is a cornerstone of prudent investing. Why is a Small Crypto Allocation So Crucial? Cryptocurrency markets are famous for their dramatic price movements. This volatility presents opportunity, but also significant risk. Financial advisors consistently stress that your crypto allocation should act as a satellite to your core portfolio, not its foundation. By capping exposure, you harness potential growth while insulating your financial future from severe downturns. CNBC’s report, citing multiple experts, provides a clear framework. They recommend maintaining this crypto allocation between 1% and 3% of your total assets, with an absolute maximum of 5%. This disciplined approach is your first defense against market unpredictability. How Do You Build a Diversified Portfolio Around Crypto? If crypto is just a small slice, what fills the rest of the pie? The answer is classic, time-tested diversification. The experts suggest the majority of your portfolio should consist of stable assets. Value Stocks: Shares in established companies often considered undervalued. Bonds: Government or corporate debt that provides regular income. Broad Market ETFs: Funds that track entire indices like the S&P 500. This mix creates a buffer. When crypto markets dip, your other holdings can help stabilize your overall net worth. Think of your crypto allocation as the high-octane fuel in a reliable car—powerful in small amounts, but dangerous as the only component. What Are the Modern Tools for Crypto Diversification? Gone are the days when diversification meant just buying Bitcoin and Ethereum. The landscape has evolved, offering investors more sophisticated tools. The report highlights the growth of spot ETFs. Now, you can find ETFs for a wider range of cryptocurrencies. More importantly, mixed spot ETFs have emerged. These are single funds that hold a basket of different digital assets, instantly providing diversification within your crypto allocation itself. It’s a one-click solution for spreading risk across the crypto sector. Which Fund Management Strategies Protect Your Investment? Setting your allocation is just the first step. Actively managing that portion is key to long-term success. CNBC’s experts emphasized two powerful strategies: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): This involves investing a fixed, small amount at regular intervals (e.g., $100 every week). DCA removes the stress of timing the market. You buy more when prices are low and less when they are high, averaging out your purchase cost over time. Periodic Rebalancing: Market movements can skew your allocations. If your crypto surges in value, its portion of your portfolio might grow beyond your intended 5%. Rebalancing means selling some of that profit and reinvesting it into your other assets to restore your original, safe balance. Together, DCA and rebalancing turn emotional investing into a systematic, disciplined process. They ensure your carefully planned crypto allocation stays on track. Conclusion: Prudence is the Ultimate Strategy In the thrilling world of digital assets, discipline is your greatest ally. Adhering to a modest crypto allocation under 5%, diversifying with traditional assets, and using systematic strategies like DCA are not limitations—they are the frameworks for sustainable, low-stress participation in the crypto revolution. This approach lets you explore the potential of cryptocurrency without jeopardizing your core financial security. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Why 5%? Why not 10% or 20% for higher returns? A: The 5% cap is a risk management guideline. Cryptocurrency is a high-risk asset class. Limiting exposure ensures that even in a worst-case scenario where the value drops significantly, your overall financial health and long-term goals remain intact. Q: Does this 5% rule apply to experienced traders as well? A: The advice is generally for the average investor building a long-term portfolio. Professional traders with dedicated risk capital may operate differently, but the principle of not overexposing one’s total net worth to volatile assets still holds true. Q: How often should I rebalance my portfolio? A: A common practice is to review and rebalance quarterly or semi-annually. Avoid doing it too frequently, as transaction fees and short-term volatility can make excessive trading counterproductive. Q: What if I only have a small total amount to invest? Should I still follow the 5% rule? A> Yes, the principle scales. If you have $1,000 to invest, your crypto allocation should be no more than $50. This instills good habits from the start and prevents a disproportionate risk on a small portfolio. Q: Are crypto ETFs safer than buying coins directly? A> They offer different kinds of safety. ETFs traded on traditional exchanges may provide easier management and custodial security. However, they still carry the market risk of the underlying cryptocurrencies. A mixed ETF offers instant diversification, which is a form of risk mitigation. Q: Can dollar-cost averaging really work in a volatile market? A> Absolutely. Volatility is precisely why DCA is effective. It systematically navigates the ups and downs, preventing you from investing a large lump sum at a market peak and helping you build a position at an averaged cost.

This monumental figure signals robust investor confidence, yet a critical question remains: why hasn’t this tidal wave of money propelled the price of XRP to new heights? Let’s dive into the data, the leaders, and the underlying market dynamics shaping this fascinating chapter for XRP spot ETFs . What’s Driving the Massive Inflows into XRP Spot ETFs? Since their debut on November 13, U.S. spot XRP spot ETFs have become a magnet for capital. Investors are clearly seizing the opportunity to gain regulated exposure to XRP without the complexities of direct custody. This influx represents a major vote of confidence in the asset’s legitimacy and its potential within a structured financial framework. The sheer scale of investment, reported by CryptoBriefing, underscores a significant shift toward institutional adoption of digital assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Which XRP ETF Providers Are Leading the Pack? The competition among issuers is fierce, with clear frontrunners emerging in assets under management (AUM). Here’s a breakdown of the top performers: Canary : The current leader, its spot XRP ETF holds approximately $335 million in AUM. 21Shares : A strong contender with around $250 million gathered. Grayscale : A well-known name in crypto funds, holding about $220 million in its XRP offering. This distribution shows a healthy, competitive landscape where multiple trusted firms are successfully attracting investor capital. Why Is XRP Price Stuck Below $2 Despite Huge ETF Inflows? Here lies the central paradox. While billions pour into XRP spot ETFs , the token’s market price has struggled to break and hold above the $2 mark. Two primary factors are at play: First, selling pressure from large-scale investors, often called “whales,” has counteracted the buying pressure from ETFs. Second, broader cryptocurrency market volatility has created headwinds for all digital assets, including XRP. Therefore, ETF inflows alone are not a guaranteed short-term price catalyst; they exist within a complex ecosystem of competing market forces. The Critical Challenge: Does XRP Need Its Own Story? Analysts point to a deeper, more strategic hurdle. For XRP to achieve sustained, long-term growth, it must cultivate a unique investment narrative separate from Bitcoin. While Bitcoin is often viewed as “digital gold,” XRP’s value proposition is tightly linked to its utility in cross-border payments and banking solutions. The success of XRP spot ETFs provides the fuel, but a compelling, distinct story about real-world adoption and efficiency is the engine needed for a lasting rally. What’s the Future for XRP and Its Spot ETFs? The initial success of these funds is undeniable and marks a pivotal moment. However, the path forward involves navigating the disconnect between institutional investment and retail market sentiment. Continued growth for XRP spot ETFs will likely depend on: Clarity in regulatory landscapes. Tangible advancements in XRP’s core use cases for global finance. A stabilization in the broader crypto market to reduce overarching volatility. The $1.2 billion inflow is a powerful foundation, but the next chapter will be written by adoption, utility, and market maturity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What are spot XRP ETFs? A: Spot XRP ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold the actual XRP cryptocurrency. They allow investors to buy shares that track the live price of XRP without needing to buy and store the tokens themselves. Q: How much money have XRP ETFs gathered since launch? A: U.S. spot XRP ETFs have seen approximately $1.2 billion in net inflows since their launch on November 13. Q: Which XRP ETF has the most assets? A: As of the latest reports, the Canary spot XRP ETF is the largest, with around $335 million in assets under management (AUM). Q: If so much money is flowing in, why isn’t the XRP price higher? A: The price is being suppressed by selling pressure from large holders and general volatility in the wider cryptocurrency market. ETF buying is one of several factors influencing price. Q: What does XRP need for long-term price growth? A: Analysts suggest XRP needs to establish a strong, unique narrative focused on its utility in payments and banking, moving beyond simply following Bitcoin’s market trends. Q: Are XRP ETFs a good investment? A: Like any investment, XRP ETFs carry risk. They offer a regulated way to gain exposure to XRP, but their performance is tied to the volatile crypto market.

A significant 25% of these affluent investors plan to expand their cryptocurrency investments in the coming years. This indicates a strategic, rather than speculative, approach to digital assets. Why Are Chinese HNWIs Cautiously Optimistic About Crypto? The current low allocation reflects a traditionally conservative portfolio structure. Chinese asset owners typically center their wealth on pillars like: Gold as a physical store of value. Insurance products for security and legacy planning. Real estate , though its prominence has shifted. Therefore, the planned increase signals a pivotal shift. Investors are beginning to view crypto not as a fringe gamble, but as a legitimate component of a diversified, modern portfolio. This acceptance is a crucial step for broader cryptocurrency adoption within regulated financial frameworks. Is Overseas Investment the Key Driver for Crypto Interest? The report highlights an aggressive interest in overseas opportunities. Notably, 6% of wealthy Chinese individuals identified cryptocurrency as an overseas investment product they might pursue within the next year. This trend suggests two things: Cryptocurrency is perceived as a global, borderless asset class. It may serve as a channel for diversification beyond domestic markets and capital controls. Consequently, for Chinese HNWIs , crypto represents both a technological investment and a potential tool for international wealth strategy. Could AI Revive the NFT and Digital Collectibles Market? Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, the report casts an eye on the future of digital collectibles. It projects that the growing prominence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) could revive interest in NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). How? AI can drive new forms of creative content, gaming assets, and verifiable digital ownership, making NFTs more functional and integrated into the digital economy. This synergy between AI and blockchain could create the next wave of popular digital assets. What Are the Actionable Insights for the Crypto Market? This data is not just a snapshot; it’s a roadmap. The cautious but growing allocation from Chinese HNWIs points to a maturation phase. The market should note: Education is paramount: Investors seek strategic understanding, not just hype. Regulatory clarity attracts capital: Clear frameworks foster confidence. Integration with traditional finance will be key for wealth managers. The planned increase in crypto investment signifies a vote of confidence in the asset class’s long-term viability. Conclusion: A Strategic Shift in Global Wealth Portfolios The Hurun report unveils a nuanced narrative.

US Lawmakers Propose Tax Relief,https://bitcoinist.com/stablecoins-get-a-break-us-lawmakers-propose-tax-relief/,"Lawmakers in the US have put forward a discussion draft that would ease tax reporting for small stablecoin payments and let some crypto earners delay taxes on staking and mining rewards. According to reports, the plan was circulated by Representatives Max Miller (R-Ohio) and Steven Horsford (D-Nev.). The proposal aims to clear up rules that many say are confusing for everyday users and small businesses. Stablecoin Safe Harbor For Small Payments Based on reports , the draft would create a safe harbor for regulated dollar-pegged stablecoins when they are used like cash. Under the plan, capital gains on stablecoin transactions under $200 would be exempt from tax. That $200 threshold is meant to stop everyday buys — coffee, tips, small fees — from triggering tax paperwork and capital gains calculations. The exemption would only apply to stablecoins issued by a permitted issuer and that keep a stable peg to the USD. A Deferral Option For Staking And Mining Rewards Reports have disclosed another major change: taxpayers could elect to defer taxes on staking and mining rewards. Instead of being taxed the moment rewards are received, a taxpayer could choose to defer recognition for up to five years. After that period ends the rewards would be taxed as ordinary income at fair market value. The choice would be voluntary, and some taxpayers might still face tax when they sell or convert assets later. Mark-To-Market And Wash Sale Provisions Also Included The draft does more than just touch stablecoins and staking. It would apply wash sale rules to digital assets, which limits the ability to claim artificial losses by quickly repurchasing the same token. It also creates a path to elect mark-to-market accounting for certain traders, which would treat their holdings as sold at year-end for tax calculations. These moves are meant to align crypto tax practice closer to other parts of the tax code and to reduce gaps the IRS says exist. A Draft, Not Yet A Bill Lawmakers described the text as a discussion draft and have been talking with stakeholders and committees. The measure has not been formally introduced as a bill, and changes could come as it moves through the House Ways and Means Committee. If enacted, the framework is written to take effect for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Targeted for the first half of 2026, this ambitious update promises to tackle some of Ethereum’s most persistent challenges head-on. For anyone invested in the future of decentralized finance and applications, understanding the Glamsterdam upgrade is crucial, as it aims to refine the very core of how the Ethereum protocol operates. What Exactly Is the Glamsterdam Upgrade? Core developers have started the preparatory work for Glamsterdam, as reported by CoinDesk. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a planned systemic overhaul with clear objectives. The primary goals are to enhance transparency, reinforce decentralization, and improve the network’s overall efficiency. The developers plan to resume detailed discussions in January 2026 to finalize the scope, but the key pillars are already taking shape. At its heart, the Glamsterdam upgrade seeks to implement a profound change by separating the roles of block proposers and block builders. This separation is a direct move to combat centralization pressures within the network’s validator ecosystem. Furthermore, the upgrade will focus on boosting data processing speeds and introducing mechanisms to stabilize the often-volatile gas fees, which are a constant pain point for users. Why Is the Glamsterdam Upgrade a Game-Changer? The planned changes within the Glamsterdam upgrade address fundamental aspects of Ethereum’s operation. Let’s break down the key benefits this upgrade is designed to deliver: Enhanced Decentralization: By separating proposers and builders, the Glamsterdam upgrade reduces the risk of validator centralization, keeping the network true to its foundational principles. Improved User Experience: Faster data processing and more stable gas fees mean smoother and more predictable transactions for everyone using dApps or DeFi protocols. Greater Transparency: The structural changes aim to make the block production process more visible and fair, increasing trust in the network. However, executing an upgrade of this magnitude is not without its challenges. The complexity of modifying core protocol mechanics requires meticulous planning and extensive testing to ensure network security and stability remain intact. The long timeline, targeting H1 2026, reflects the careful, deliberate approach developers are taking with the Glamsterdam upgrade. What Comes After Glamsterdam? Meet Hegota Ethereum’s development roadmap is a continuous journey. Immediately following the Glamsterdam upgrade, developers have already penciled in the next phase: Hegota, slated for the second half of 2026. While Glamsterdam focuses on proposer-builder separation and fee mechanics, Hegota will tackle a different critical issue: node storage capacity. As the blockchain grows, the data storage requirements for running a full node increase, which can discourage participation and hurt decentralization. The Hegota upgrade aims to address this by implementing solutions that manage historical data more efficiently, ensuring that running a node remains accessible for the average participant. This one-two punch of Glamsterdam and Hegota shows a clear, strategic vision for Ethereum’s scalable and sustainable future. The Road Ahead for Ethereum and Its Community The announcement of the Glamsterdam upgrade marks a significant commitment to Ethereum’s long-term health. For developers building on Ethereum, these upgrades signal a more robust and efficient platform. For investors and users, they promise a better, more reliable experience. The multi-year timeline underscores that these are not reactive patches but thoughtfully planned evolutions. In conclusion, the Glamsterdam upgrade represents a pivotal step in Ethereum’s maturation. It directly confronts the trade-offs between scalability, decentralization, and user experience. While the full technical specifications will crystallize in 2026, the direction is clear: a stronger, more resilient, and truly decentralized Ethereum. The work beginning now on the Glamsterdam upgrade lays the foundation for the next era of the world’s leading smart contract platform. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: When is the Glamsterdam upgrade expected to go live? A: The Glamsterdam upgrade is currently targeted for release in the first half of 2026. Developers will reconvene in January 2026 to finalize the detailed scope. Q: What is the main goal of the Glamsterdam upgrade? A: Its primary goals are to improve decentralization by separating block proposers and builders, enhance data processing speeds, and stabilize gas fees on the Ethereum network. Q: What is ‘proposer-builder separation’ mentioned for Glamsterdam? A: It’s a design change that splits the role of choosing transaction order (building) from the role of proposing the block to the network. This aims to reduce centralization and increase fairness. Q: What upgrade is planned after Glamsterdam? A: The next planned upgrade is called Hegota, targeted for H2 2026. It will focus on solving node storage capacity issues to keep Ethereum running efficiently. Q: Will the Glamsterdam upgrade require a hard fork? A> While not all details are set, upgrades of this scale typically require a coordinated hard fork, where all node operators must update their software to the new protocol rules. Q: How will the Glamsterdam upgrade affect gas fees? A: A key objective is to introduce mechanisms that lead to more stable and predictable gas fees, though the exact technical solution is part of the ongoing development work.

56156604,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=248530,1766359511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revealing Insight: How Differing Views Shape Bitcoin Price Predictions at Fundstrat,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tom-lee-bitcoin-price-predictions/,"BitcoinWorld Revealing Insight: How Differing Views Shape Bitcoin Price Predictions at Fundstrat Have you ever wondered why expert Bitcoin price predictions can vary so wildly? A recent leaked memo from financial research firm Fundstrat, suggesting a potential drop to $60,000, caused a stir. However, Chairman Tom Lee quickly provided crucial context, revealing a fascinating truth about how major firms analyze crypto markets. This internal diversity of opinion, far from being a weakness, offers a more complete picture for investors. What Did the Leaked Fundstrat Memo Actually Say? The document, believed to be from Sean Farrell, Head of Digital Asset Strategy, presented a cautious short-term outlook. It suggested Bitcoin could test $60,000 in the first half of the coming year. Furthermore, it projected Ethereum (ETH) might fall to between $1,800 and $2,000, and Solana (SOL) could see a range of $50 to $75. These figures immediately sparked discussion across crypto media and forums. Tom Lee, a well-known Bitcoin bull, moved to clarify the situation. He emphasized that Fundstrat does not enforce a single, monolithic view. Instead, the firm encourages different analytical perspectives. This means short-term tactical views can differ from long-term strategic outlooks, even within the same organization. Why Do Bitcoin Price Predictions Diverge? The core of Lee’s explanation lies in methodology. He detailed that his own Bitcoin price predictions are primarily driven by macroeconomic analysis. He focuses on broader market cycles and global liquidity conditions—factors like interest rates and central bank policies that affect all risk assets. In contrast, Sean Farrell’s approach centers on on-chain data and fund flows. This method scrutinizes the movement of capital into and out of crypto assets, exchange reserves, and derivatives market risk. Therefore, two experts looking at different datasets can logically arrive at different conclusions for the same asset. Tom Lee’s Lens: Macro cycles, institutional adoption, long-term liquidity trends. Sean Farrell’s Lens: Short-term capital flows, exchange net positions, derivatives market risk. What Can Investors Learn from This Episode? This incident is a powerful reminder for anyone following Bitcoin price predictions . First, treat any single price target or report as one piece of a much larger puzzle. A robust investment thesis should consider multiple angles and time horizons. Second, understand the analyst’s framework. Is their prediction based on technical patterns, on-chain fundamentals, macroeconomics, or a combination? Knowing the “why” behind a price target is often more valuable than the target itself. Finally, internal debate within a research firm is a sign of intellectual rigor, not confusion. It prevents groupthink and leads to more thorough analysis. Navigating the Future of Bitcoin Price Predictions So, where does this leave us? The key takeaway is that the cryptocurrency market is complex and multi-faceted. Relying on a single voice or methodology is risky. The most informed perspectives come from synthesizing views from different analytical schools—both the macro “big picture” and the micro “fund flows” data. Tom Lee’s clarification ultimately reinforces that smart market analysis embraces nuance. By understanding that experts like Lee and Farrell are examining different parts of the same elephant, investors can make more measured decisions rather than reacting to every headline. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What was the main point of Tom Lee’s clarification? A: Lee clarified that the leaked memo represented one internal, short-term viewpoint. He stressed that Fundstrat values diverse analytical approaches, and his own long-term, macro-driven outlook on Bitcoin may differ from other strategists’ short-term, flow-based models. Q: Who is Sean Farrell? A: Sean Farrell is the Head of Digital Asset Strategy at Fundstrat. He is known for his data-intensive approach, focusing on capital flows, on-chain metrics, and risk indicators to form his market outlook. Q: Should I be worried about Bitcoin dropping to $60,000? A> A single prediction is not a guarantee. It’s a scenario based on specific data and assumptions. Investors should consider it alongside other analyses and, most importantly, their own investment horizon and risk tolerance. Q: What’s the difference between macro and fund flow analysis? A: Macro analysis looks at large-scale economic factors like interest rates and inflation that influence all markets. Fund flow analysis tracks the actual movement of money into and out of specific assets, like Bitcoin ETFs or exchange wallets. Q: Does this mean Fundstrat is bearish on Bitcoin? A> Not necessarily. It shows the firm has multiple frameworks. Tom Lee remains publicly long-term bullish based on macro trends, while other team members may have cautious short-term views based on different data.

The coin’s critical support is at $0.000038. The upside is limited unless the price reclaims $0.000042–$ 0.000045. FLOKI on the daily timeframe FLOKI is trading around $0.0000406 on December 21, holding just above the lower Bollinger Band near $0.0000382, which signals sustained downside pressure rather than a completed bottom. The coin’s price continues to trade below the mid-band at $0.0000452, maintaining the bearish trend of the daily structure. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView FLOKI’s RSI sits near 38, showing weak momentum with no clear bullish divergence yet. The MACD remains negative and flat, indicating sellers are still in control, but momentum is no longer accelerating aggressively. A daily close below $0.000038 would result in a price drop to $0.000032–0.000034 zone, while any recovery remains capped below $0.000045. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the 4-hour timeframe, FLOKI is consolidating under the Alligator averages, with resistance stacked around $0.000041–0.000042. The sharp bearish candle followed by small-bodied candles suggests selling pressure is slowing, but OBV is drifting lower, confirming the absence of strong accumulation. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Likewise, the MACD is flattening near the zero line, indicating short-term stabilization rather than a reversal. A clean reclaim of $0.000042 is needed to shift the short-term bias bullish, while a loss of $0.000039 would likely resume the downtrend.

Directional clarity will come from either a breakdown below $0.000038 or a recovery above $0.000042–0.000045. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~11x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a market cap of up to $95 to $100 billion to hit $0.01, over 95x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

This comes as Solana’s on-chain SOL-USD volumes have grown to the point of being comparable to and even surpassing major centralized exchanges, like Binance and Bybit, highlighting its growing importance for real-time trading and liquidity recycling. Where is crypto liquidity parked? Questions about Ethereum’s dominance of the stablecoin volume and activity sector vanished when it posted a historic month in October 2025, processing approximately $2.82 trillion in stablecoin transfers, the highest monthly volume ever recorded. In November, its stablecoin transaction volume reached $1.94 trillion, and so far in December, it has done $1.61 trillion, according to data from The Block. The major stablecoin is USDT, which dominates by over 52%. “Ethereum is not just another smart contract platform. It has become the settlement layer for global dollar liquidity,” Waidmann wrote on X . “When serious money moves, it still settles on Ethereum mainnet. Not because it is the fastest. Because it is the most trusted.” By sheer scale, Ethereum has a stranglehold on being the primary settlement layer for institutional dollar flows, but Solana has made its case to a growing audience too. The network’s on-chain SOL-USD volume has exceeded the combined spot trading volume on Binance and Bybit for three consecutive months, according to Kaviish Sethi , who works in data and research at Artemis. Source: Kaviish Sethi on X Solana’s appeal lies in its high throughput and low transaction costs, which make it well-suited for frequent trading, payments, and smaller-value transfers. Solana or Ethereum? While Ethereum dominates in settlement and high-value flows, Solana is establishing itself as a venue where liquidity is actively used, recycled, and traded, reinforcing its role as a market-facing layer of the ecosystem. The stablecoin dominating the Solana markets is Circle’s USDC, which leads by over 68%. The stablecoin supply on Solana has risen to record levels, sitting at over $15 billion in market capitalization, having hit over $16 billion a few months ago, although this pales in comparison to Ethereum’s total stablecoin market cap of over $167 billion. “Solana isn’t just a memecoin chain . It’s becoming the liquidity layer of crypto,” Sethi stated . “This is what real adoption looks like.” The growth of both ecosystems shows that the crypto industry is growing beyond single-chain maximalism, because there’s also Tron, which is known to be one of the leading platforms for stablecoin, mostly USDT transactions. Stablecoin adoption has also increased globally as more jurisdictions, like the United States, have put out laws that regulate its issuance, among other guidelines. “Stablecoins made blockchains useful,” Waidmann concluded. “Ethereum made stablecoins reliable,” though Solana’s trajectory of innovative performance shows that reliability now comes in multiple forms, with both blockchains positioning themselves to capture the distinct segments of on-chain dollar liquidity.

This signals that the firm is committed to its high-stakes treasury strategy even as its MSTR stock falters. This comes as MSCI plans to remove Strategy Inc. from its global indices during its February review. The index provider has flagged concerns that the firm now functions more like an investment vehicle than an operating company. Still, market analysts have pointed out that the financial implications of such a move are severe. Traders and institutions jockey as Bitcoin Tests $90K resistance zone Saylor’s signal arrives as BTC trades around the $90,000 level and the formation of liquidity clusters, providing insight into the short-term market outlook. In a brief post , the executive stated that Green Dots led Orange Dots, which was followed by a graph showing the Bitcoin acquisitions of his firm. Analysts often interpret the message as a hint that more Bitcoin buying could be forthcoming soon. The post continues a year-long pattern Saylor has used to hint at a new BTC purchase. Notably, such a weekend teaser is usually followed by a Monday morning SEC filing confirming a significant acquisition. Still, the last time Saylor hinted at more BTC buys with green dots, Strategy established a Bitcoin reserve for dividend payments in addition to buying more BTC. This means there’s a possibility of another move besides BTC purchases again this time. The Strategy executive chairman ’s past behavior adds weight to the signal. He has often used brief, symbolic posts before announcing major Bitcoin purchases. Institutional signals sometimes drive temporary sentiment about the BTC price. Traders are motivated to position themselves based on their expectations for purchases, even if they haven’t made a purchase yet. These investors can reduce their exposure in the short term or exit their positions when the price approaches resistance, or hedge by selling near the anticipated resistance zone. Tom Lee’s Fundstrat has also cautioned that Bitcoin could reach $60,000, even with longer-term optimism persisting. Bitcoin is trading near a heavy resistance zone around $90,000, where liquidity and sell orders are concentrated. Another crypto analyst, Ted Pillows, says market makers may sweep all three liquidity clusters in the next few days as Bitcoin tests the $90,000 level. Markets often move toward these zones as traders seek to fill large orders. According to on-chain data cited by Pillars, large clusters of resting liquidity are present at that level, creating a temporary barrier for price movement. A strong buyer stepping in near this zone could influence how Bitcoin reacts to that resistance. The leading crypto’s current structure makes the message especially notable. Institutional demand keeps Bitcoin supported amid volatility Liquidity data shows price magnets both above and below current levels. The largest group of upside liquidity is around $90,000, while the downside liquidity ranges from $86,000 to $84,000. This suggests that institutional interest in BTC remains, despite recent volatility. Even after incurring some substantial outflows last week, ETFs still maintain substantial Bitcoin balances. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is among the top six ETFs of this year. Additionally, corporate treasuries remain active in the market. These are part of the reasons why BTC demand is not falling even at increased prices.

Have you checked the market’s pulse today? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a crucial barometer for investor emotion, has inched up to 25. This five-point climb from yesterday offers a fragile sign of relief, but the overarching message remains clear: the cryptocurrency market is still gripped by extreme fear . Understanding this index is key to navigating the volatile crypto landscape. What Exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? Think of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as the market’s emotional heartbeat. Created by data provider Alternative.me, it quantifies the collective sentiment of cryptocurrency investors on a simple scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 screams “Extreme Fear,” while 100 shouts “Extreme Greed.” The current reading of 25, though improved, firmly sits in the “Extreme Fear” zone. But how is this number calculated? It’s not a guess; it’s a data-driven formula. How is the Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The index synthesizes data from six key market dimensions to avoid reliance on any single metric. This multi-source approach provides a more holistic view. Here’s the breakdown: Volatility (25%): Measures current price swings against historical averages. High volatility often correlates with fear. Market Volume (25%): Analyzes trading volume and momentum. Unusual volume can signal strong sentiment shifts. Social Media (15%): Tracks the volume and sentiment of crypto mentions on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Incorporates data from polls and community sentiment platforms. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Monitors Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Rising dominance can indicate a “flight to safety.” Google Trends (10%): Measures search volume for cryptocurrency-related terms. What Does a Score of 25 Mean for Your Portfolio? A Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 25 presents a classic contrarian signal. Historically, prolonged periods of extreme fear have often preceded significant market rebounds. For investors, this environment demands a balanced strategy. For the cautious investor, it’s a reminder to stick to fundamentals, avoid emotional selling, and consider dollar-cost averaging into strong projects. For the opportunistic trader, extreme fear can uncover undervalued assets. However, the key challenge is timing. Sentiment can remain depressed for extended periods, and a slight improvement does not guarantee an immediate rally. Actionable Insights in a Fearful Market Navigating a fearful market requires discipline. First, use the index as a context tool, not a timing tool. Second, review your portfolio’s risk exposure. Third, consider this a research phase to identify quality projects that may be oversold. Finally, remember that market cycles are inevitable. While the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index signals distress, it also maps a potential road to recovery for those who prepare. Conclusion: Reading Between the Emotional Lines The rise to 25 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a minor positive in a sea of negative sentiment. It highlights that while fear dominates, there are subtle shifts beneath the surface. For savvy participants, understanding this metric provides a strategic edge, separating market noise from actionable signal. The path from fear to greed is rarely a straight line, but tracking this journey is essential for long-term success in cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a good Crypto Fear & Greed Index score? There’s no universally “good” score. Extremely low scores (0-25) can signal buying opportunities for contrarians, while extremely high scores (75-100) often warn of potential market tops. Many investors watch for sustained moves out of extreme zones. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index is updated daily, typically once per day. This allows investors to track sentiment shifts on a regular basis without the noise of minute-by-minute fluctuations. Can the Fear & Greed Index predict Bitcoin price? No, it cannot predict exact price movements. It is a sentiment indicator that shows the market’s emotional temperature. It is best used alongside technical and fundamental analysis, not as a standalone prediction tool. Why does the index focus so much on Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s market dominance is a component because it often acts as a “safe haven” within crypto during turmoil. When fear rises, money may flow from altcoins into Bitcoin, increasing its dominance. Is extreme fear always a buy signal? Not always. While extreme fear has preceded major rallies, markets can remain fearful for long periods. It should be considered a potential alert for value, not an automatic trigger to invest. Where can I check the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index is publicly available on websites like Alternative.me. Many major cryptocurrency news and data platforms also display it or provide similar sentiment analysis tools.

This Monday, CME Bitcoin futures opened with a dramatic $695 gap, sending a clear signal to attentive traders. This isn’t just a random blip; it’s a direct window into the relentless 24/7 energy of the crypto spot market clashing with traditional finance hours. Let’s unpack what this CME Bitcoin futures gap really means for your strategy. What Exactly Is a CME Bitcoin Futures Gap? Simply put, a CME Bitcoin futures gap is the price difference between where the futures contract closes on Friday and where it reopens on Monday. The CME, or Chicago Mercantile Exchange, follows a traditional schedule. It closes for the weekend. Bitcoin, however, never sleeps. Its global spot market trades continuously. Therefore, when the CME reopens, its futures price must instantly adjust to catch up with all the buying and selling that happened over Saturday and Sunday. This catch-up creates the gap. The wider the gap, the more significant the weekend price movement in the underlying Bitcoin market was. Why Should You Care About This $695 Signal? This specific $695 CME Bitcoin futures gap from $87,895 to $88,570 is more than a number. It’s a market footprint. It tells us that over the weekend, bullish sentiment dominated the spot markets, pushing prices higher. Now, traders watch for a potential “gap fill.” Market theory suggests these gaps often act as magnets, with prices tending to retrace to fill the void. This creates a self-fulfilling prophecy as traders position for the move. However, it’s not a guaranteed rule. Bullish Gap: A gap up (like this $695 one) indicates strong weekend buying. A fill would mean a price drop back toward the Friday close. Bearish Gap: A gap down signals selling pressure. A fill would mean a price rally. No Fill: Sometimes, the gap remains open, acting as a new support or resistance level, confirming a strong trend. How Can Traders Use Futures Gaps for Actionable Insights? Understanding CME Bitcoin futures gaps provides a tactical edge. They offer a structured way to view market sentiment shifts that occur outside traditional hours. Here’s how savvy investors use them: Identify Sentiment Shifts: The gap direction is a clear, unfiltered read on weekend market emotion. Plan Entry/Exit Points: The gap area can serve as a potential profit target or a zone to place stop-loss orders. Gauge Institutional Activity: The CME is a hub for institutional players. Gaps can reflect their adjusted positions after a weekend of analysis. Remember, while powerful, a gap is just one piece of the puzzle. Always combine this analysis with other indicators like trading volume, overall market trends, and major news events. What Are the Risks of Trading the Gap? Relying solely on the CME Bitcoin futures gap strategy carries inherent risks. The expectation of a fill is a common tendency, not an iron law. A strong, sustained trend can easily ignore an open gap. Furthermore, other macroeconomic factors or breaking crypto news can immediately override any gap-based technical setup. The key is to use the gap as a context-setting tool, not a crystal ball. It helps you understand *where* price might feel a pull, not a definitive prediction of *where* it will go. Conclusion: The Gap as Your Weekend Translator This week’s $695 CME Bitcoin futures gap is a perfect case study. It translates two days of decentralized, global Bitcoin trading into a single, digestible signal on a regulated exchange. By mastering this concept, you gain insight into hidden momentum and potential future price magnets. In the volatile world of crypto, tools that help decode silence are invaluable. Keep watching these gaps—they tell the story of what happens when traditional finance takes a break, but the digital economy charges ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is a CME futures gap unique to Bitcoin? A: No, gaps occur in futures for any asset traded on exchanges with closed periods. However, they are especially pronounced for Bitcoin due to its 24/7 spot market. Q2: How often do CME Bitcoin futures gaps get filled? A: While many gaps are filled, it’s not a 100% certainty. The probability varies with market conditions. Some gaps fill quickly, others take time, and a few may never close. Q3: Can retail traders profit from these gaps? A: Yes, but with caution. Traders might place limit orders near the gap area, anticipating a fill. However, this requires careful risk management, as prices may not reach the gap level. Q4: Does a larger gap mean a stronger price signal? A: Generally, yes. A larger CME Bitcoin futures gap indicates more significant price movement and potentially stronger sentiment over the weekend, making the gap area a more notable technical level. Q5: What’s the difference between a CME gap and a price gap on a crypto exchange? A: A CME gap is caused by exchange hours. A price gap on a continuous crypto exchange is rarer and usually caused by extreme volatility or liquidity issues between trades. Found this breakdown of the crucial CME Bitcoin futures gap helpful?

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, Bitcoin is now trading at $89,009.66 on the Binance USDT market. This surge marks a significant milestone and has traders and investors asking: what’s fueling this impressive rally? What’s Driving the Current BTC Price Rally? The jump in the BTC price above $89,000 is not happening in a vacuum. Several key factors are contributing to this bullish momentum. First, increasing institutional adoption continues to provide a solid foundation of demand. Furthermore, macroeconomic conditions, such as concerns about inflation, often lead investors to seek assets like Bitcoin as a potential store of value. This combination creates a powerful tailwind for the leading cryptocurrency. Why Does This $89,000 Level Matter for Bitcoin? Breaking past major psychological price levels, like $89,000, is crucial for market sentiment. It often acts as a trigger for several market behaviors: FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): Retail investors may enter the market, fearing they will miss further gains. Technical Breakout: This price action can signal a breakout from previous trading ranges, attracting algorithmic and technical traders. Media Attention: Major milestones generate headlines, bringing Bitcoin back into the mainstream conversation. Therefore, sustaining this BTC price level is the next critical challenge for the bull run. What Are the Immediate Implications for Traders? For active participants in the market, a rising BTC price presents both opportunity and risk. On one hand, long-term holders see their convictions validated. On the other hand, short-term traders must navigate increased volatility. Key considerations now include: Monitoring key support and resistance levels around the new price point. Being aware of potential profit-taking that could lead to a pullback. Assessing the strength of the volume supporting the price increase. A healthy rally is typically accompanied by strong, sustained trading volume. Could the BTC Price Climb Even Higher? While past performance never guarantees future results, analyzing market structure can provide clues. The breach of $89,000 opens the door to test even higher resistance levels. Market analysts will now watch to see if Bitcoin can gather the momentum to challenge the next major thresholds. However, it’s essential to remember that the cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile, and corrections are a normal part of any major uptrend. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Bitcoin The surge of the BTC price above $89,000 is a testament to Bitcoin’s growing resilience and its evolving role in the global financial landscape. This move reinforces its position as the market leader and sets a new benchmark for the current cycle. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a curious observer, this rally underscores the dynamic and transformative potential of digital assets.

Why Are This Week’s Key Financial Events So Crucial? Economic data acts as a pulse check for global markets. When central banks and governments release figures, they provide clues about future policy. For crypto, which often reacts to shifts in liquidity and risk sentiment, these key financial events can trigger significant volatility. Understanding them helps you anticipate moves rather than just react. December 22nd: A Dual Focus on China and the U.S. The week kicks off with two major announcements. First, China announces its Loan Prime Rate (LPR). As a benchmark for lending rates, it signals the direction of monetary policy in the world’s second-largest economy. A change here can impact global commodity demand and risk appetite. Later, the U.S. releases Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data for October. The Federal Reserve watches this inflation gauge closely. A higher-than-expected reading could reinforce a “higher for longer” interest rate stance, potentially pressuring risk assets like stocks and crypto. 1:00 a.m. UTC: China Loan Prime Rate (LPR) 3:00 p.m. UTC: U.S. Core PCE Price Index (October) December 23rd: Taking the Economy’s Temperature On Tuesday, the spotlight returns to the U.S. with the preliminary release of third-quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This figure measures the total value of goods and services produced. It’s a broad indicator of economic health. Strong GDP growth might delay hopes for Fed rate cuts, while weak data could fuel them. Crypto markets frequently interpret delayed cuts as negative for liquidity, making this one of the week’s most pivotal key financial events . 1:30 p.m. UTC: U.S. GDP (Third Quarter, Preliminary) Navigating Holiday Hours and Key Data The Christmas holiday introduces a unique dynamic. While U.S. markets are closed on December 24th and 25th, important data is still released. Initial jobless claims, a weekly measure of layoffs, come out on the 24th. This can cause outsized moves in thinly traded markets, as fewer participants can lead to amplified volatility. Always check your exchange’s holiday schedule for any changes in liquidity or leverage. December 24th & 25th: U.S. Markets Closed (Christmas) 1:30 p.m. UTC (Dec 24th): U.S. Initial Jobless Claims Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders How should you approach these key financial events ? First, mark them on your calendar. Second, understand the likely narrative. Hot inflation (PCE) and strong growth (GDP) are typically seen as hawkish for the Fed, which can be a headwind for crypto. Conversely, weak data may be interpreted as bullish for potential rate cuts. However, remember that markets often “buy the rumor, sell the news.” The price reaction can be counterintuitive, so manage your risk accordingly. Conclusion: Your Week-Ahead Strategy This week’s calendar of key financial events provides a clear roadmap of potential market catalysts. From Chinese policy signals to crucial U.S. inflation and growth data, each release holds the power to influence trader sentiment across all asset classes. By preparing for these moments, you position yourself to make more informed decisions, whether you’re trading Bitcoin, Ethereum, or traditional equities. Stay vigilant, especially around the holiday-thinned trading, and let the data guide your strategy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Why do crypto markets care about traditional economic data like PCE and GDP? A: Crypto is no longer an isolated asset class. It is influenced by global macro factors like interest rates and liquidity. Data that shapes Federal Reserve policy directly impacts the cost of capital and investor risk appetite, which flows into digital asset prices. Q: How can I prepare for volatility around these events? A> Consider reducing high leverage positions ahead of major announcements, set stop-loss orders to manage risk, and ensure you have access to real-time news feeds. Also, be aware that spreads may widen on exchanges during data releases. Q: The U.S. markets are closed for Christmas. Will crypto trading be affected? A> Crypto markets operate 24/7, so trading will continue. However, liquidity can be significantly lower during major traditional market holidays, which may lead to sharper, more volatile price swings with less volume. Q: What is the single most important event for crypto this week? A> The U.S. Core PCE data is likely the most critical. As the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, it has the highest potential to alter interest rate expectations, a primary driver of market sentiment.

Future quantum attacks pose a significant challenge to the current blockchain system. This has prompted blockchain developers to engage in discussions on how to tackle this issue. Some of these discussions included considering some updates to protocols. However, Hoskinson advised developers that the biggest challenge is timing; hence, they needed to focus on this aspect instead of certain amendments required. He further warned that acting rashly could result in high costs for blockchain networks. According to him, the cryptographic tools essential to protect blockchain technology from future quantum attacks are already accessible. Hoskinson guides blockchain developers in preparation for future quantum attacks Hoskinson pointed out that the US National Institute of Standards and Technology made post-quantum standards public in 2024. Following this release, the Cardano founder highlighted that the key issue is based on the costs associated with executing new protocols before validators and miners are ready. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that while several researchers believe that cutting-edge quantum computers could ultimately break current cryptography, reports from sources reveal that there is still less consensus on when this threat might materialize. However, based on the recently announced predictions, practical quantum computing could occur anytime from a few years to more than ten years from now. Still, Hoskinson advised blockchain developers to focus on concrete developments rather than hype and corporate timelines when evaluating how soon this danger might materialize. One of the suitable ways the Cardano founder suggested was for them to shift their focus to DARPA’s Quantum Benchmarking Initiative. According to his argument, this program conducts tests on several quantum computing methods to determine whether they can produce useful outcomes. “It’s the best independent and objective standard we can use to see if quantum computers will be real, when they will arrive, and who will build them,” Hoskinson said. Notably, DARPA has decided that 2033 will be the year in which it will determine if large-scale quantum computing is feasible. Hoskinson reveals a suitable solution for a major emerging problem in the crypto industry Similar to other leading networks, such as Bitcoin , Ethereum, and Solana, reports from reliable sources have highlighted that Cardano utilizes elliptic-curve cryptography. It is worth noting that such a method is at great risk because of Shor’s algorithm, that is, in the event of the development of very powerful quantum computers. This news raised tension in the crypto ecosystem as developers ignited heated debates. To address this controversy, Hoskinson noted that the industry knows suitable ways to curb this problem. Nonetheless, he mentioned that this approach is centered on deciding between two different cryptographic methods. To further elaborate on this point, he stated that the two options to choose from include Hashes, which is utilized by Ethereum, and lattices, which is actually their preferred choice. Concerning Hoskinson’s statement, analysts weighed in on the matter. They highlighted that Hash-based cryptography relies on cryptographic hash functions to produce digital signatures effectively, which are widely recognized as the most secure approach against future quantum threats. The analysts also pointed out that these systems are straightforward, thoroughly researched, and established to be cautious. However, they are mainly used for signing data and are not preferable for general encryption purposes. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

If you’ve been waiting for the explosive growth of alternative cryptocurrencies, recent data delivers a sobering message. The Altcoin Season Index currently sits at a mere 17, a clear signal that Bitcoin is firmly in the driver’s seat. This crucial metric tells us we are deep in a ‘Bitcoin season,’ leaving many investors wondering when the tide will turn for other digital assets. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? Before we panic or celebrate, let’s understand the tool. CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index is a simple but powerful gauge. It measures the percentage of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) that have outperformed Bitcoin over a 90-day window. The calculation is straightforward: Track the performance of the top 100 coins against Bitcoin. Count how many have posted better gains. If 75% or more outperform Bitcoin, an ‘altcoin season’ is officially declared. Therefore, a score of 17 means only a small fraction of major altcoins are beating the king of crypto. This index is your reality check against market hype. Why Does a Low Altcoin Season Index Matter? A reading this low isn’t just a number; it has real implications for your strategy. It indicates strong capital rotation into Bitcoin, often driven by institutional interest through ETFs or macroeconomic factors like inflation hedging. During these phases, money flows out of riskier altcoins and into the perceived safety and liquidity of Bitcoin. For investors, this means: Portfolio Underperformance: A diversified altcoin portfolio may lag significantly behind a simple Bitcoin holding. Reduced Speculative Fever: The ‘moonshot’ mentality cools, and projects need real utility to attract attention. Consolidation Opportunities: For long-term believers, this can be a time to research and accumulate quality altcoins at lower prices. Is This the End for Altcoins? Historical Context Says No Take a deep breath. History shows these cycles are normal. The crypto market moves in distinct waves. Intense ‘Bitcoin seasons’ are typically followed by periods where altcoins catch up and even surge past BTC’s returns. The index has swung from single digits to above the 75 threshold multiple times in past cycles. The current low Altcoin Season Index reading may simply be setting the stage for the next major rotation. Patience and a long-term perspective are key. Actionable Insights in a Bitcoin-Dominant Market So, what should you do when the Altcoin Season Index is stuck at 17? Instead of fearing the data, use it to inform smarter decisions. Reassess Your Allocation: Is your portfolio balance aligned with the current market regime? It may be wise to ensure a healthy Bitcoin allocation. Focus on Fundamentals: Use this quieter period to deeply research altcoin projects. Look for strong development activity, real-world use cases, and resilient communities. Dollar-Cost Average: If you believe in specific altcoins long-term, consider systematic buying during this phase to lower your average entry cost. Watch for the Flip: Monitor the Altcoin Season Index for a sustained move above 50, which could signal the beginning of a shift in momentum. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto Seasons The Altcoin Season Index at 17 is a powerful snapshot of today’s market reality, not a permanent verdict. It confirms Bitcoin’s current strength and the challenging environment for altcoins. However, understanding this cycle is the first step to navigating it successfully. By respecting the trend, focusing on fundamentals, and preparing for the eventual shift, you can position your portfolio not just to survive the Bitcoin winter, but to thrive when the altcoin spring returns. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Where can I check the current Altcoin Season Index? A: You can find the live Altcoin Season Index on CoinMarketCap’s website under their ‘Indices’ section. Q: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? A: The index is typically updated daily, reflecting the rolling 90-day performance data. Q: Does a low index mean all altcoins are losing money? A: Not necessarily. It means they are underperforming Bitcoin. Some altcoins may still have positive price action, just not as strong as BTC’s. Q: What usually triggers a shift from Bitcoin season to altcoin season? A: Shifts can be triggered by Bitcoin price stabilization, new technological narratives (like DeFi or NFTs in past cycles), or a surge of new capital seeking higher returns in smaller-cap projects. Q: Should I sell all my altcoins when the index is low? A> A blanket sell-off is rarely a good strategy. It’s better to review each holding based on its fundamentals and your investment thesis. The index is a macro tool, not specific investment advice. Found this breakdown of the Altcoin Season Index helpful?

It usually follows it. The long-lasting projects are willing to build silently as well as sort out difficult issues initially and acquire fame subsequently. This phase is missed by a lot of investors since it is not a glamorous one on the surface. But here is where the best moves are usually made. A single emerging DeFi crypto seems to have broken through that invisible barrier of infrastructure being complete and focus beginning to catch up. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project developing a decentralized ethereum-based lending and borrowing system. Its design is based on two lending paths which deal with various users. On the one hand, the users have an opportunity to provide assets to pooled markets and obtain mtTokens. These are their deposits and earned yield in the form of these mtTokens. Borrowers on the other hand have access to liquidity as they vary depending on market conditions (Rule of Collateral). The protocol is constructed based on dynamic interest rates, collateral thresholds, and liquidation systems. These are not outward aspects. They are the fundamental engine that enable a lending platform to perform at scale in a safe manner. This infrastructure is being ready before the V1 release on the Sepolia testnet scheduled to happen in Q4 2025. Infrastructure Progress In the case of real infrastructure, participation begins to increase preceding headlines. This can normally be traced in the consistent increase instead of sudden peaks. Mutuum Finance has accumulated $19.4M already and has more than 18,600 holders. Over 820M tokens were already sold. These figures did not happen just like that. These constructions were constructed gradually, which is a more usual indication of health. The early investor feeling is that it is not a short term frenzy and hence the constant growth rate. These trends are normally observed to emerge before the attention of the wider market can be collected. Token Growth and Presale When a protocol is ready, then token structure comes into play. The total supply of the Mutuum Finance is 4B MUTM. 45% or approximately 1.82B of this amount are issued to the presale. Phase 6 is currently at the advanced stage at over 99% allocation with the token at the value of $0.035. MUTM has already increased 250% since it started its presale in early 2025 since the price of Phase 1 was $0.01. Supplies do not increase before infrastructure is created but after it. Price pressure tends to increase as the availability is reduced and the usage expectations are high. Other analysts are of the view that after V1 is launched, MUTM may rise above $0.06, indicating that early investors would be at a good position. Security as Last Infrastructure Layer The final box that serious users wait to be checked before is security. Mutuum Finance was also CertiK audited with their 90 out of 100 token scan score. Besides this, Halborn security is going through the lending and borrowing contracts of the protocol. The code is completed, and is being analysed formally. It also has a $50k bug bounty that will motivate responsible disclosure of code vulnerabilities. Such measures are important since most investors will only invest funds when they see and believe in security structures. There are a number of indicators that visibility begins to increase. The next step of the protocol is the upcoming V1 testnet launch, which approaches the actual use of the protocol. The 24-hour leaderboard will give the highest daily contributor a reward of 500 in MUTM making him/her participate over and over again. There are equal card payments which make new users have less friction. Focus is likely to follow preparation rather than pledges. Mutuum Finance seems to be passing through the stage of infrastructure becoming visible. MUTM is getting harder to disregard by those following the potential best crypto to buy stories in Q4 2025.
