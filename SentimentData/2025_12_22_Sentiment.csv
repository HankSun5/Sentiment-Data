Assets traditionally viewed as slow movers have risen as the clear winners, while the cryptocurrency market has quietly slipped to the bottom of the performance rankings. As the year draws to a close, data from across commodities, equities, and digital assets shows an imbalance in returns, revealing that cryptocurrencies now sit behind every major asset class in year-to-date performance. Clear Split Between Traditional Assets And Crypto The performance data for 2025 reveals a strong divergence between traditional markets and digital assets, with the gap widening as the year progressed. According to the figures revealed on the social media platform X by ‘Bull Theory,’ silver is the top-performing asset for 2025, posting gains of about 130% year-to-date. Gold is the second-best-performing asset of 2025, with an increase of about 65%, while copper has climbed close to 35%. These numbers reflect sustained strength across the commodities sector. Equity markets are also currently trading in positive territory. The Nasdaq is up around 20% on the year, the S&P 500 has gained approximately 16%, and the Russell 2000 is higher by about 13%. The only negative numbers are from the crypto industry. In contrast, the crypto market sits at the bottom of the performance rankings. Bitcoin is currently down by about 6% from its 2025 opening price, Ethereum has declined around 12%, and the entire altcoin market (removing Ethereum) has suffered a much deeper drawdown of about 42%. Therefore, the crypto market is now officially the worst-performing asset class in 2025. Chart Image From X. Source: @BullTheoryio From Mid-Year Rally To Q4 Breakdown The current weakness of the crypto market is very different from the optimism that dominated the beginning and middle of 2025. During that period, the crypto market experienced a powerful recovery that reignited bullish sentiment across the board. Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and several large-cap tokens pushed to new all-time highs. Bitcoin’s rally peaked in October, when it set its standing record of $126,000 after months of steady accumulation and strong momentum. Ethereum, on the other hand, registered a new all-time high of $4,946 in August, while XRP’s all-time high came earlier in July. XRP’s record price of $3.65 was the most notable, as it was its first time breaking into a new all-time high since 2018. That bullish trend began to unravel as the fourth quarter got underway, starting with the crypto market flash crash on October 10. The decline has extended since then, and Bitcoin and the broader crypto market have now fallen into negative territory from their 2025 opening levels. Quarterly returns data shows that Bitcoin just recorded its worst fourth-quarter performance in seven years. The result is a year in which digital assets, despite a powerful mid-year rally, are closing out as the worst-performing major asset class. Bitcoin Quarterly Returns.

Phase 1 sold out in record time, distributing 10 million tokens and raising $500,000 almost instantly. This success continued through Phase 2, bringing the total funds raised to over $1.4 million with a community of more than 3,000 holders . We have now entered Phase 3 , and the demand shows no signs of slowing down. Investors have already snapped up 600,000 tokens in this round. Market analysts are predicting that this phase will be exceptionally short. Speculation regarding imminent listings on major exchanges is driving this rapid accumulation. Avalanche Expands Globally While GeeFi Builds Core Utility Avalanche is making significant strides in the enterprise sector. The network is expanding into the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region through its new DLT Foundation . It is also focusing on launching custom blockchains for large enterprises and revolutionizing the music industry by modernizing royalty payments. GeeFi mirrors this commitment to real-world application by building a comprehensive decentralized ecosystem. The platform centers on the GeeFi Wallet , a secure non-custodial solution that gives users total control over their private keys. The integrated Decentralized Exchange (DEX) ensures seamless trading, and the upcoming GeeFi Crypto Card will bridge the gap between digital assets and daily spending. Secure Massive ROI Before Phase 3 Ends The current presale phase represents a critical opportunity for investors. Phase 3 tokens are currently priced at $0.13 . Buying at this level secures a guaranteed 325% ROI once the token lists at the confirmed price of $0.40 . Early supporters who participated in Phase 1 have already witnessed their investment grow by an astounding 1,200% . Time is of the essence for new investors. Analysts predict that Phase 3 will conclude in just 2 weeks due to the surging momentum and swirling rumors of tier-one exchange listings. This is the final window to acquire tokens at a discounted rate before public trading begins. Generate Passive Income with Flexible Staking GeeFi empowers its community with some of the most competitive staking rewards in the industry. You can earn substantial passive income by locking your assets. The platform offers a lucrative 55% APR for users who commit to a 12-month lock-up period. Shorter durations are also available to suit different strategies, including 22% APR for 3 months and 15% APR for 1 month . There is even a flexible option offering 10% APR with no lock-up required. Furthermore, the referral program allows you to earn a 5% bonus in GEE tokens for every purchase made by someone using your unique link. The Next 100x Gem Is Here Investors are constantly searching for the next project capable of delivering exponential returns. GeeFi is widely considered a potential 100x gem due to its solid utility and explosive presale performance. This project offers a rare combination of security, usability, and financial growth potential. Fear of missing out is driving thousands to secure their allocations before the presale closes. The window of opportunity is narrowing rapidly. Once Phase 3 sells out, the chance to invest at these ground-floor prices will disappear. Take action now to position yourself at the forefront of the next major evolution in decentralized finance.

One fine art loss adjuster allegedly said they received dozens of valuation certificates for decorative paintings submitted in one claim. Each sheet looked correct at first, but the descriptions for different pieces were identical. That single detail pushed the adjuster to suspect the entire batch came from an automated system. That check opened the door to wider concerns about how often forged files are slipping into the process without anyone noticing. Exposing how fraudsters build convincing paperwork Olivia Eccleston, a fine art insurance broker at Marsh, said chatbots and large language models are now helping fraudsters forge sales invoices, valuations, provenance documents, and certificates of authenticity. Olivia said this adds a new layer to an old fraud problem in the art market. Some attempts are deliberate. Others start when someone asks an AI model to search historic databases, and it produces results that never existed. Those errors then show up in paperwork that gets sent to insurers as if it were fact. The chain of ownership, known as provenance, is central in the art world. When people corrupt that chain with invented details, the artwork’s value collapses. Angelina Giovani, co-founder of provenance research group Flynn & Giovani, said AI makes this easy because “it’s quite conniving… it has to come up with an answer, so if you give it enough information, it will guess something.” Angelina said she saw a case where an AI system appeared to create a signature on a painting to strengthen its story. Experts note that none of this is new in principle. People once copied letterheads from respected institutions or designed fake stamps. Now they lean on AI to generate the same paperwork with smoother language and fewer obvious errors. Filippo Guerrini-Maraldi, head of fine art at insurer Howden, said he has seen many forged documents over his career and that automated systems now make them look more realistic. Angelina said she has seen fake ledger numbers and forged Nazi-era stamps on provenance files. She also pointed to the case of Wolfgang Beltracchi, who created hundreds of paintings and used staged photographs to build fake ownership histories behind them. These tactics show how far people go to support artwork that cannot stand on its own. Tracking digital clues as fraud becomes harder to see Harry Smith, executive chair of art valuers Gurr Johns, said AI now makes fraud quicker because people no longer need to invent a fake expert to back their claim. The tool produces whatever support text they want. Grace Best-Devereux, a fine art loss adjuster at Sedgwick, said she checks metadata in digital documents to spot signs of AI interference. Grace said adjusters also use their own systems to decide whether a provenance document is real. But she warned that the job is getting harder because new tools are making forged text look normal. Grace said, “We’re at this precipice where it might not be possible for me to look at it and say, ‘the text looks wrong, and I need to investigate this further.’” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

Pacific Gas and Electric said the blackout started Saturday afternoon and peaked two hours later, hitting about 130,000 customers. As of press time, reportedly 21,000 homes and businesses still had no electricity, mostly in the Presidio, the Richmond District, Golden Gate Park, and parts of downtown. Pacific Gas and Electric said the cause was a fire at a substation that caused “significant and extensive” damage, and it could not give a timeline for full repairs. San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said in a 9 p.m. update on X that police, fire crews, parking control officers, and city ambassadors were sent into affected neighborhoods as transit slowly came back.“Waymo has also paused service,” he said. Elon Musk says Tesla is unaffected by the blackout Meanwhile, Elon Musk said via a post on X that:- “Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by the SF power outage.” Though, it did not take long for people to point out that Tesla does not run a driverless program in the city at all, with his comment section littered with angry users. Tesla’s local service uses “FSD (Supervised),” which is a driver-assist system that needs a human behind the wheel at all times. Regulators at the California DMV and the California Public Utilities Commission confirmed that Tesla has no permits to run driverless cars in the state without human safety workers ready to brake or steer. Tesla is trying to become a big player in robotaxis, but its rides today still rely on human supervisors, even in states where the company holds permits for driverless programs. Tesla’s Robotaxi app lets people request a car, but every trip has a human on board. Waymo, on the other hand, leads the market in the West and competes with companies like Baidu-owned Apollo Go. The outage hit as robotaxi programs become more common in other major U.S. cities. Waymo is one of the few companies offering full driverless rides to the public, even though surveys show people remain uneasy. The American Automobile Association said earlier this year that two-thirds of U.S. drivers reported fear of autonomous cars. Bryan Reimer, a research scientist at MIT and co-author of “How to Make AI Useful,” said the pause in San Francisco showed the limits of these vehicles. He said something was missed in the design or development of the systems, and he argued that power failures are expected events. “Not for eternity, but in the foreseeable future, we will need to mix human and machine intelligence, and have human backup systems in place around highly automated systems, including robotaxis,” he said. Reimer also said regulators must decide how many highly automated cars should be allowed on streets and should hold AV companies responsible for any “chaos gridlock” the cars cause during major outages. Waymo did not say when service will return or whether any collisions happened during the blackout.

Our Pi network price prediction anticipates the Pi price to reach a maximum level of $0.35 by 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $3.14. Pi Network, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan, is a social crypto and developer ecosystem built for real-world utility and mass accessibility. 2025 has been a defining stress test: Pi surged to about $2.98 in February, crashed to a new all-time low of $0.1585 on October 11, and now trades near $0.22 in early December, highlighting extreme volatility as the year closes. But basic building blocks continue to keep investor interest alive, including the Passkey security improvement to Pi Wallet, Pi DEX, and AMM on Testnet, Pi Network Ventures pushing towards decentralization and AI with OpenMind, and millions of new KYC verifications and continuing projects such as the 2025 Pi Hackathon and Sign Protocol partnership. In this Pi Network price prediction, we discuss these developments with major technical levels and the model of exponential supply of Pi that is in decline to determine whether 2025–2031 favors a sustained recovery or further downside.

The daily RSI is near 43, staying below neutral, while the MACD remains negative, confirming weak momentum and continued bearish pressure. Key support sits between $0.19 and $0.20, while resistance now stands between $0.21 and $0.22. As of December 21, 2025, Pi Network is showing continued weakness after declining back toward the $0.20 psychological level. Pi is trading near $0.205, with a market cap of approximately $1.71 billion and 24-hour volume around $11.64M, indicating cautious participation rather than aggressive dip-buying. Bulls are struggling to reclaim lost ground, and price action suggests hesitation ahead of key support. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis The 1-day chart shows a small red candle following a failed attempt to hold above $0.21. Price has ranged between roughly $0.202 and $0.212, and settled at $0.205.This keeps Pi stuck in its recent low consolidation zone. The overall structure still reflects lower highs, and no clear reversal pattern has formed yet. The RSI (14) is currently around 41, which is below the neutral 50 level. This indicates that bearish momentum is still present in the market. However, since the RSI is not yet in the oversold zone, which is below 30, there is still room for further downside before a strong rebound can be expected. The RSI line is relatively flat, suggesting weak selling pressure and a lack of strong buying interest at the moment. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView On the MACD (12, 26), both the MACD and signal lines remain below the zero line, with a slightly negative histogram. This confirms that bearish momentum is still present, even if selling pressure has slowed compared to earlier declines. Immediate support is found around $0.20, with a breakdown opening the door toward $0.19. On the upside, resistance sits at $0.21, followed by a stronger barrier near $0.22. A daily close above $0.22 would be needed to shift the short-term bias away from bearish. Pi/USD 4-Hour Price Analysis On the 4-hour timeframe, the price of Pi Network is trading around $0.205, moving sideways after a prolonged bearish move. Price action shows a series of lower highs, confirming that the broader short-term trend remains bearish. However, the recent candles are small and tightly ranged, indicating consolidation near a key support zone around $0.20, where buyers are attempting to defend the price. The RSI (14) is currently around 47, which is slightly below the neutral 50 level. This suggests that the market is still leaning bearish, but selling pressure is weak. The RSI recently moved up toward the mid-range and then pulled back, indicating a short-term recovery attempt that lacked strong momentum. Since the RSI is neither overbought nor oversold, price action is likely to remain range-bound unless a stronger push from buyers or sellers appears. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView The MACD (12, 26) on the 4-hour timeframe is very close to the zero line, showing low momentum and market indecision. Although the MACD line is slightly above the signal line, the histogram remains small, indicating that bullish momentum is weak and not yet confirmed. Overall, the MACD suggests a consolidation phase, where the price is stabilizing but has not formed a clear directional move yet.

Price is likely to move sideways or slightly downward, unless buyers push it above nearby resistance, which would signal a short-term relief bounce. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.3610 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly, neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is PI’s price down today? Pi’s price is down due to a technical breakdown below key support, combined with weak momentum and low trading volume. Ongoing open mainnet delays limit real utility, while supply overhang concerns continue to weigh on demand. In the short term, price action depends on whether the $0.20 support holds or breaks toward $0.15. Will Pi Price Reach $5? At the current pace of development and given its total PI supply circulating supply of over 8 billion PI, Pi Network’s value is unlikely to reach $5 in the near term. Multiple technical quantitative indicators and fundamental factors, such as delayed mainnet launch and maximum supply constraints, suggest that Pi’s price may fluctuate within lower ranges before any major uptrend. A $5 target would require sustained adoption, significant on-chain activity, and strong market demand that is not yet present. Will Pi Reach $10? Reaching $10 would represent a massive increase in Pi’s market cap, something that is not expected soon under current crypto market conditions. Analysts suggest that even optimistic forecasts place this milestone more than a decade away, if at all. Investors should treat such projections as speculative investment advice and conduct their own research before making investment decisions, as Pi remains a high-risk asset with uncertain long-term value.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi showed a sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72. At the start of July 2025, Pi Network faced high volatility as massive token unlocks triggered strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range. On July 19, 2025, PIUSDT declined slightly to $0.4412, reflecting short-term bearish pressure. On July 26, 2025, PIUSDT continued to hover under pressure around $0.4409, staying within a tight trading range as momentum remained subdued. for August 2, 2025. Pi traded at $0.3496, still under pressure and at its all-time low. On August 6, 2025, Pi Network is traded at around $0.3410, showing moderate consolidation with weak momentum and limited price movement. On August 9th, Pi/USDT went up from its early August low of $0.3766 and traded around $0.4103. August 17th, 2025, the Pi Network (PI) traded at $0.387 , showing slight movement between support at $0.383 and resistance at $0.390 . On August 21, Pi Network (PI) traded near $0.366, showing a modest 1.39% gain as buyers attempted a short-term recovery. On September 2, 2025, Pi network traded around $0.34, just above its past month’s August all-time low of $0.3304. On September 22, 2025, Pi crashed to a new all-time low (ATL) of $0.2234, marking a –92% drop from its February ATH and reflecting heavy sell-side pressure from token unlocks and weak demand. Pi rebounded slightly, to trade between $0.25 and $0.28 through late September, though resistance at $0.30 continued to hold firmly. At the start of October 2025, Pi trades at $0.2718, but is still struggling under bearish sentiment as buyers attempt to defend support above $0.26 while momentum indicators suggest only a weak recovery. On October 11, 2025, Pi Network hit a new all-time low of $0.1585, reflecting the peak of a prolonged market crash and severe selling pressure. On October 15, 2025, Pi Network (PI) stabilized slightly, trading around $0.1884, as short-term buyers stepped in following the sharp October 11 crash. On October 28, 2025, PI attempted a short rebound toward $0.238, but failed to hold gains, slipping back below the 20-day moving average. As of the start of November 2025, Pi Network traded at approximately $0.247, still below key resistance at $0.26, as traders remain cautious ahead of the upcoming 120 million token unlock expected in November. As of November 15, Pi network traded at $0.223. This rise for 1 day was driven by technical breakout signals, whale accumulation, and ongoing ecosystem updates. As of November 30, 2025, Pi Network traded around $0.243, consolidating above the $0.24 support zone while still below the $0.26 resistance heading into month-end. As of December 1, 2025, Pi Network had dropped to about $0.226, as sellers reacted to December’s 190M PI token unlock overhang and a broader risk-off mood in the crypto market. As of December 16, 2025, Pi Network traded around $0.196, having broken below the psychological $0.20 support as ongoing token unlocks, legal uncertainty, and sustained bearish technical momentum kept strong downside pressure on the price.",Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|TRADING|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-21 21:30:00

The CBDC project ultimately aims to enhance fiscal efficiency by curbing misuse and slashing administrative costs. However, the broader pushback against the CBDC from citizens remains, with many of them seemingly believing that it is a tool for government surveillance. Is South Korea’s CDBC ready? According to reports , the Bank of Korea (BOK) is accelerating the resumption of the CBDC experiment amid delays in discussions on the Korean won stablecoin bill . According to sources cited in local reports on December 21, the BOK already sent out an official document to major banks regarding the second round of CBDC testing. A BOK official stated, “Details, including the specific method and schedule, are currently under discussion.” Under the second phase of testing, the BoK is allegedly considering distributing a portion of government subsidies in the form of digital currency. They hope the CBDC can help limit its use and reduce the management and administrative costs linked with subsidy execution. The first phase of the CBDC experiment was conducted with seven banks and lasted three months before it was suspended. At the time, the experiment received backlash for its limited practical utility and the financial burden it placed on the participating banks, which amounted to billions of won. Revival of the testing phase was floated in late August of this year during a meeting between BoK Governor Rhee Chang-yong and Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol, in which they discussed using CBDC for subsidy payouts as a way to address the problems. The banking industry is adamant that a second round of testing is required for the time being. One banking industry official said, “With the official document, we have no choice but to restart preparations.” At the same time, it has become clear that South Korea may be looking to pursue both the stablecoin and CBDC avenues, rather than sticking with one. A BOK official stated, “Stablecoins and CBDCs have different roles and purposes, so they can coexist. We are proceeding with previously scheduled procedures and are not directly related to the delay in discussions on the won-denominated stablecoin bill.” Despite such statements pushing the efficiency narrative, the pushback from South Korean citizens against broader CBDC adoption has been massive, with online petitions making concerning claims like how it could facilitate excessive government surveillance and control over personal finances, gaining traction. South Korean agencies debate stablecoin oversight The launch of the second phase of CBDC testing is being debated as the institutionalization of the Korean won-denominated stablecoin continues to be delayed due to the inability of the Financial Services Commission and the Bank of Korea to see eye to eye over the matter of issuer and regulatory framework. The Democratic Party of Korea’s Digital Asset Task Force (TF) initially requested that the Financial Services Commission submit a government proposal by December 11, but the Financial Services Commission reportedly submitted only a rough outline of the draft bill. The draft, “Key Contents of the Framework Act on Digital Assets,” claims the Financial Services Commission (FSC) proposed a plan to designate important stablecoins based on the number of stablecoin users and issuance volume. This designation should have been made in consultation with the Bank of Korea (BOK). As such, it is interpreted as only partially reflecting the BOK’s concerns about the issuance of won-denominated stablecoins. The final draft is expected but has been delayed due to the failure to coordinate opinions on key issues, such as the requirements for issuing by bank-centered consortiums and the unanimous agreement of the policy consensus body.

They shift with a change of behavior. First, users watch. Then they participate. Finally, they hold. Price is a natural successor when this shift occurs on scale. New DeFi crypto seems to be reaching that phase. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is subject to increased allocation restraint; the token priced at $0.035 is experiencing the change in behavioral patterns. Early Signals of Behaviour at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a protocol which is being developed that is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol based on Ethereum. The project is very practical in its momentum as opposed to being focused on hype. Users supply assets. Borrowers access liquidity. Participation can be rewarded by the protocol mechanics of the system. There are a number of initial behavioral cues forming. One is holding behavior. With the approach of Phase 6 allocation, the number of tokens left is decreasing. This could promote long holding as compared to short term flipping. Another indicator is the usage of mtToken. Users receive the assets deposited on Mutuum Finance in the form of mtTokens. Such tokens make users remain on the platform as opposed to leaving within a short time. Behavior change is also manifested in terms of Leaderboard activity. The 24-hour leaderboard will give the best daily winner $500 of MUTM. This makes participating recurrent, not a single participation. Such trends tend to be better than the announcements. Participation and Habit Formation The process of lending and borrowing is more likely to accustom more people than most other crypto products. Users reposition, trade collateral or yield management. Every interaction strengthens interaction. The price increase due to short term bursts of attention is prone to decline since habits of protocols are more resilient to the recession induced post-event changes. Selling pressure may decline with time when users use the platform to stay active. Mutuum Finance is a product that revolves around this loop. Lending creates deposits. Borrowing creates demand. Both parties communicate with each other several times. This may eventually transform the token into a utility connected holding. V1 being the Behavioral Trigger Point The V1 launch that is coming is significant since it transforms the behavior of users. Up to V1, the participation is largely preparative. Following V1, the actions become operative. Due to the official updates, Mutuum Finance is set to launch its V1 on the Sepolia testnet in the Q4 of 2025. Its main characteristics are liquidity pools, mt Tokens, debt tokens and a liquidator bot. The assets initially launched will be ETH and USDT. Behavior will in many cases accelerate when platforms are changed between setup and usage. There are analysts who feel that this step can initiate the initial significant repricing. In a bullish case, it is projected that after the launch, MUTM could climb higher than $0.06 as more people join. Second Price Scenario Other than participation, long term behavior is determined by incentives. Mutuum Finance has a buy and distribute mechanism. Some of the protocol revenue is used to purchase MUTM in the market and redistribute to interested mtToken stakers. This creates a feedback loop. The more it is used, the more it gives revenue. Increased revenue causes increased purchasing pressure. This model is in contrast to the demand which is supported by attention; this model associates price support with activity. Yield rewards are also incentives to hold. Selling is less appealing when the users make money by participating in it. According to some commentators of the market, a long term demand of a sustained revenue would justify a higher price bracket in the long term, possibly between $0.10 and $0.15 should consistent progress be found in the usage. Scaling Behavior with Stablecoin and Layer-2 plans Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will serve stablecoins and consider integration with layer-2 according to the official roadmap. The assets such as Stables minimise the volatility to daily users. There are the layer-2 networks which minimize fees and enhance speed. Daily use is easy because of lower cost and stabilizing value assets. This increases the number of people who can use it other than sophisticated traders. Liquidity increases with the magnitude of behavior, and, as price movements tend to become organized. Mutuum Finance is still in development with MUTM priced at $0.035, and with V1, its beta features will become available. Nonetheless, on reaching an allocation of near 100% and a shift of user behavior toward being habitual, MUTM seems poised to potentially experience another 300% token appreciation.

Bitcoin predictions for 2026 Galaxy Digital Research has released its annual crypto market predictions for 2026, predicting that Bitcoin will reach $250,000 by the end of 2027, although they acknowledge that 2026 remains too unpredictable to call it with confidence. Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital, explained that options markets currently price equal odds of Bitcoin hitting either $70,000 or $130,000 by June 2026, and equal odds of $50,000 or $250,000 by year-end 2026. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $126,080 on October 6, 2025, driven by regulatory reforms and ETF inflows during the first ten months of the year. However, the market experienced a sharp reversal and witnessed leverage liquidations, whale distribution, and shifting investment narratives. By December, Bitcoin had fallen back to the low $90,000 range and currently trades around $88,000. The report identifies several factors responsible for the potential uncertainty for 2026, including the rate of AI capital expenditure deployment, monetary policy conditions, and the U.S. midterm elections in November. Thorn emphasized that until Bitcoin firmly re-establishes itself above the $100,000 to $105,000 level, downside risk remains in the near term. Galaxy released 26 predictions covering various aspects of the crypto ecosystem, including expectations that more than 50 spot altcoin ETFs will launch in the United States, U.S. spot crypto ETF net inflows will exceed $50 billion, and at least 15 crypto companies will IPO or uplist in the U.S. during 2026. How accurate were Galaxy’s 2025 predictions? Galaxy Digital predicted at the beginning of the year that Bitcoin would cross $150,000 in the first half and possibly reach $185,000 in the fourth quarter. By November, Thorn had lowered the year-end target to $125,000, and even that revised forecast appears unlikely to be met due to the significantly lower Bitcoin trades in December. A major leverage unwinding event on October 10, 2025, caused significant market disruption, erasing approximately $78 billion in open interest across crypto futures. More than 470,000 Bitcoins held for over five years, worth approximately $50 billion, changed hands during 2025. Galaxy facilitated one of the year’s largest single transfers, involving $9 billion worth of assets from a legacy whale. Throughout 2025, institutional investment was more toward artificial intelligence infrastructure, data centers, nuclear energy, quantum technology, and gold. Galaxy predicted that at least one major wealth management platform would announce a 2% or higher recommended Bitcoin allocation. It hit on that one as Morgan Stanley published a report announcing up to 4% allocation. They also accurately forecast that more than half of the top 20 publicly traded Bitcoin miners would become or partner with AI and high-performance computing firms. However, Bitcoin did not cross $150,000 as Galaxy initially predicted, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs did not collectively reach $250 billion in assets under management, and Bitcoin did not finish among the top performers on a risk-adjusted basis among global assets. Galaxy Digital see s bi g 2026 for stablecoin s Ga laxy Digital predicts that stablecoins will overtake the U.S. Automated Clearing House system in transaction volume due to current data showin g st ablecoin transactions already exceeding major credit card networks like Visa and processing roughly half the volume of the ACH system. Thad Pinakiewicz, vice president of research at Galaxy, said that stablecoin supply has been growing at a 30% to 40% compound annual growth rate along with transaction volumes. According to data from DefiLlama, the stablecoin market cap currently stands at approximately $309 billion, with Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC continuing to dominate the market. Galaxy expects the passage and implementation of the GENIUS Act in early 2026 to accelerate stablecoin adoption. The act was signed into law by President Trump in July 2025 and provides regulatory clarity for stablecoins. It is expected to enable both incumbent tokens to grow and new entrants to compete for market share. Jianing Wu, a research associate at Galaxy, explained that consumers and merchants are unlikely to juggle multiple digital dollars and will instead gravitate toward one or two options with the broadest acceptance. Nine major banks, including Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Bank of America, and Citigroup, are already exploring plans to launch stablecoins based on G7 currencies. In October, Western Union revealed plans for its U.S. Dollar Payment Token on the Solana blockchain. Sony Bank is developing a stablecoin for integration across its U.S. ecosystem, including PlayStation and subscription services, with a planned 2026 launch. Cryptopolitan reported earlier this month that SoFi Technologies has introduced SoFiUSD, a fully reserved dollar stablecoin issued by SoFi Bank on Ethereum. Galaxy’s expectations include that at least one of the top three global card networks will conduct more than 10% of its cross-border settlement volume through public-chain stablecoins, though most end users will never see a crypto interface. Galaxy predicts that decentralized exchanges will capture more than 25% of combined spot trading volume by the end of 2026, up from roughly 15-17% currently.

According to a press release sent to CryptoPotato , the country will channel 10,000 BTC, worth roughly $1 billion, to support the long-term development of GMC. GMC is a new economic hub designed for mindfulness, sustainability, and innovation. Bhutan Unveils Bitcoin Development Pledge Bhutan’s ruler, His Majesty King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, unveiled the Bitcoin Development Pledge via his National Day Address earlier this week. The commitment aligns with the king’s vision of applying modern digital technologies to serve the people of Bhutan and future generations. The country will assess several approaches that would enable the long-term use of the pledged assets. The options under consideration include collateralising the Kingdom’s bitcoin holdings, implementing yield management strategies, and preserving asset value while holding them long-term. Bhutan will guide any use of BTC in the GMC by prudence and strong governance, ensuring transparency and capital preservation. The country will prioritize preserving long-term potential while developing the economic hub in a stable and sustainable manner. Jigdrel Singay, Board Director at GMC, commented on the approach, saying: “Bhutan’s position is that its Bitcoin holdings are intended for the long term, and that commitment is reiterated clearly in the Development Pledge. The specific strategy is still being worked on, and the examples mentioned in the announcement outline the range of responsible options under consideration. There is no change to Bhutan’s long-term stewardship approach toward its Bitcoin reserves.” GMC to be Powered by Digital Infrastructure Besides being a mindfulness hub, GMC will also provide regulatory clarity, financial connectivity, and a long-term environment for collaboration. The hub is open to partnerships from both local and international digital asset entities. Bhutan has already integrated digital assets into the hub’s strategic reserves and enabled crypto-based payments across services. The Kingdom has also launched TER, a sovereign-backed token linked to physical gold. These efforts build on the country’s track record of being one of the earliest adopters of BTC and digital asset infrastructure. Since 2017, Bhutan has quietly been mining BTC using clean energy. “As your King, I must ensure that every Bhutanese is a custodian, stakeholder, and beneficiary of GMC…This commitment is for our people, our youth, and our nation,” Bhutan’s ruler stated.

This isn’t science fiction; it’s a potential reality that has top experts sounding the alarm. A critical quantum defense upgrade for Bitcoin is now a race against time, with dire warnings that failure could see BTC’s price plummet below $50,000 within the next few years. The clock is ticking on the most significant technological challenge Bitcoin has ever faced. Why Is Quantum Defense Suddenly a Crisis for Bitcoin? For years, quantum computing has been a distant theoretical threat. However, recent expert analysis suggests the timeline for danger is accelerating faster than the timeline for a solution. The core issue is simple: the cryptographic algorithms that protect Bitcoin wallets today could be broken by a sufficiently powerful quantum computer. While such a machine may not exist imminently, preparing the entire Bitcoin network for this change is a monumental task that could take a decade. Without this quantum defense , the market’s confidence—and thus, Bitcoin’s price—could collapse preemptively. What Are the Experts Saying About the BTC Price Threat? The warnings from industry leaders are stark and carry significant weight. Jameson Lopp, a respected BTC Core developer, acknowledges that while a direct attack isn’t immediate, the process of upgrading the protocol and migrating vulnerable funds will be painfully slow. The more urgent outlook comes from Charles Edwards of Capriole Investments. He presents a chilling forecast: BTC could fall below $50,000 by 2028 if it lacks quantum resistance. Edwards emphasizes that the market impact of delayed action could dwarf past catastrophes, potentially exceeding the fallout from the FTX collapse. His reasoning is grounded in a terrifying statistic: over four million BTC are currently stored in wallets that are vulnerable to a future quantum attack. This isn’t a minor flaw; it’s a systemic risk. How Does a Lack of Quantum Defense Create Market Panic? The threat isn’t just technical; it’s profoundly psychological. The cryptocurrency market is driven by trust in security and scarcity. Therefore, the mere perception of vulnerability can trigger a sell-off long before any actual attack occurs. Consider these key risk factors: Loss of Scarcity: If millions of supposedly lost or secure coins become accessible to an attacker, the total supply shock could devastate the market. Erosion of Trust: Bitcoin’s value proposition hinges on being a secure, decentralized store of value. A fundamental security flaw undermines this entire premise. Institutional Flight: Large investors and ETFs would be forced to re-evaluate their holdings if the foundational technology is seen as compromised. This perfect storm of technical risk and market sentiment is why establishing robust quantum defense is no longer optional—it’s essential for survival. Can Bitcoin Actually Implement a Quantum Defense in Time? The path to a quantum-resistant Bitcoin is fraught with challenges. Upgrading a decentralized, multi-trillion-dollar network is not like updating a phone app. It requires near-universal consensus among developers, miners, exchanges, and holders. The transition would likely involve: Developing and rigorously testing new, quantum-safe cryptographic standards. Creating a clear migration path for users to move funds from old, vulnerable addresses to new, secure ones. Ensuring backward compatibility and network stability throughout the multi-year process. The five-to-ten-year window experts cite is not for building the quantum computer itself, but for completing this incredibly complex global upgrade. The race is on. What’s the Final Verdict on Bitcoin’s Quantum Future? The message from the forefront of crypto development is clear: complacency is the real enemy. The challenge of quantum computing is unprecedented, but Bitcoin has overcome major obstacles before. The key takeaway is that proactive development and community coordination are paramount. The market will reward foresight and punish delay. The narrative for the next decade will be defined by how effectively the ecosystem builds and deploys its quantum defense . The alternative is a price prediction no investor wants to see become reality. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is a quantum attack on Bitcoin? A: A quantum attack would use a powerful quantum computer to solve the mathematical problems that currently protect Bitcoin wallets, allowing an attacker to steal funds. Q: Is my Bitcoin safe right now? A: Yes, for the immediate future. The threat is from future, more advanced quantum computers. However, coins in certain types of addresses (like legacy Pay-to-Public-Key Hash) are considered more vulnerable long-term. Q: What is being done to make Bitcoin quantum-resistant? A> Cryptographers and Bitcoin developers are actively researching “post-quantum cryptography”—new algorithms that even quantum computers couldn’t easily break. Implementing them network-wide is the next major hurdle. Q: Could a quantum computer break Bitcoin tomorrow? A> Most experts agree this is highly unlikely. The current generation of quantum computers is not powerful enough. The concern is about being prepared before the technology advances. Q: Will we need to buy new “quantum-proof” Bitcoin? A> Not exactly. The likely solution is a network upgrade where users move their BTC to new, quantum-resistant address types, similar to past upgrades like SegWit. Q: Are other cryptocurrencies at risk too? A> Yes, virtually all cryptocurrencies using similar cryptography (like Ethereum) face the same quantum threat and will need their own defense strategies.

One minute, timelines look quiet; the next minute, rockets ignite, and portfolios start sweating. While blue-chip names keep shipping updates and scaling quietly, meme-powered presales are stealing the spotlight with louder momentum and sharper upside chatter. Avalanche is pushing scalability milestones, Chainlink continues to expand real-world data integrations, and traders are scanning headlines for the next breakout narrative. For readers tracking opportunity windows with clarity, trusted resources still matter. To explore emerging trends and informed perspectives, many investors compare insights under Best Crypto to Buy Now before committing capital. That brings the spotlight to a presale shaking timelines right now. Apeing ‘s whitelist is pulling attention like gravity, and Apeing dominates as the 100x crypto across early adopter discussions. Scarcity is apparent, timing feels sharp, and anticipation is building as wallets line up for front-row access. Apeing Dominates as the 100x Crypto and Sets the Tone Early Apeing opens this story with intention. Apeing dominates as the 100x crypto not by accident, but through a launch strategy built around decisive early participation and controlled access. History favors conviction. Those who hesitate, refreshing charts and waiting for perfect signals, often watch the biggest multipliers move without them. This project flips that script by rewarding speed, clarity, and belief before public noise takes over. The upcoming Apeing presale is structured to favor early momentum. Upcoming presale stage 1 pricing is set at 0.0001, with a planned listing at 0.001. That gap defines the upside narrative without leaning on hype alone. Limited token allocation reinforces discipline, while the whitelist filters out casual watchers and lets serious participants in. This framework builds trust and creates growth pathways without diluting value. Apeing and $APEING are positioned to benefit from a clean launch, transparent mechanics, and a community primed to move together rather than chase later. Why Apeing Dominates as the 100x Crypto for Early Whitelist Access Apeing dominates as the 100x crypto for one apparent reason: timing meets structure. Joining the whitelist early means exposure at the lowest available entry before public pricing reshapes demand. Tokens allocated to presale stage 1 are capped, creating urgency without chaos. Early participants gain clarity on supply, pricing, and roadmap expectations, reducing emotional trading later. This approach encourages steady conviction and long-term thinking while still offering explosive upside potential. With projected upside discussions reaching beyond 10,000 percent based on entry versus listing pricing, Apeing and $APEING present a calculated risk profile rather than blind speculation. When momentum builds early, diamond hands tend to form naturally. Avalanche (AVAX) Price Today Signals Scalable Power Ahead Avalanche continues to earn its place among serious infrastructure-focused networks. AVAX price today reflects a blockchain designed for speed, low latency, and developer flexibility. Its consensus mechanism supports high throughput without sacrificing decentralization, making it attractive for DeFi, gaming, and enterprise-grade applications. Recent developments highlight Avalanche’s growing subnet ecosystem, allowing customized blockchains to operate efficiently within its network. This modular approach improves scalability and cost control while expanding use cases. AVAX price forecasts often hinge on adoption metrics rather than speculation alone, positioning the token as a steady performer for investors prioritizing fundamentals and network utility. Chainlink (LINK) Crypto Price Today Anchors Real Utility Chainlink remains a backbone for decentralized data infrastructure. LINK crypto price today reflects its role as the most widely adopted oracle network, connecting smart contracts with real-world data securely and reliably. This utility-driven model continues attracting partnerships across DeFi, gaming, and traditional finance bridges. Recent expansions into cross-chain interoperability reinforce Chainlink’s relevance as multi-network ecosystems grow. Secure data feeds, proof-of-reserves, and automation tools strengthen its long-term value proposition. LINK price forecasts often align with broader adoption rather than hype cycles, making it a staple for portfolios focused on reliability and depth of integration. Conclusion Avalanche, Chainlink, and Apeing each serve different investor mindsets. AVAX delivers scalable infrastructure, LINK anchors real-world data trust, and Apeing dominates as the 100x crypto by capturing early momentum through a disciplined whitelist model. Apeing’s fast start, limited allocation, and clear presale pricing create a compelling early-stage narrative. The whitelist is currently open, momentum is accelerating, and early access is shrinking by the day. For those serious about identifying high-upside opportunities before public entry points shift the game, Apeing and $APEING deserve immediate attention.

Market swings can be nerve-wracking. However, a simple strategy endorsed by CNBC and top financial experts can bring peace of mind: limiting your crypto allocation to a modest portion of your overall wealth. Let’s explore why this rule is a cornerstone of prudent investing. Why is a Small Crypto Allocation So Crucial? Cryptocurrency markets are famous for their dramatic price movements. This volatility presents opportunity, but also significant risk. Financial advisors consistently stress that your crypto allocation should act as a satellite to your core portfolio, not its foundation. By capping exposure, you harness potential growth while insulating your financial future from severe downturns. CNBC’s report, citing multiple experts, provides a clear framework. They recommend maintaining this crypto allocation between 1% and 3% of your total assets, with an absolute maximum of 5%. This disciplined approach is your first defense against market unpredictability. How Do You Build a Diversified Portfolio Around Crypto? If crypto is just a small slice, what fills the rest of the pie? The answer is classic, time-tested diversification. The experts suggest the majority of your portfolio should consist of stable assets. Value Stocks: Shares in established companies often considered undervalued. Bonds: Government or corporate debt that provides regular income. Broad Market ETFs: Funds that track entire indices like the S&P 500. This mix creates a buffer. When crypto markets dip, your other holdings can help stabilize your overall net worth. Think of your crypto allocation as the high-octane fuel in a reliable car—powerful in small amounts, but dangerous as the only component. What Are the Modern Tools for Crypto Diversification? Gone are the days when diversification meant just buying Bitcoin and Ethereum. The landscape has evolved, offering investors more sophisticated tools. The report highlights the growth of spot ETFs. Now, you can find ETFs for a wider range of cryptocurrencies. More importantly, mixed spot ETFs have emerged. These are single funds that hold a basket of different digital assets, instantly providing diversification within your crypto allocation itself. It’s a one-click solution for spreading risk across the crypto sector. Which Fund Management Strategies Protect Your Investment? Setting your allocation is just the first step. Actively managing that portion is key to long-term success. CNBC’s experts emphasized two powerful strategies: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): This involves investing a fixed, small amount at regular intervals (e.g., $100 every week). DCA removes the stress of timing the market. You buy more when prices are low and less when they are high, averaging out your purchase cost over time. Periodic Rebalancing: Market movements can skew your allocations. If your crypto surges in value, its portion of your portfolio might grow beyond your intended 5%. Rebalancing means selling some of that profit and reinvesting it into your other assets to restore your original, safe balance. Together, DCA and rebalancing turn emotional investing into a systematic, disciplined process. They ensure your carefully planned crypto allocation stays on track. Conclusion: Prudence is the Ultimate Strategy In the thrilling world of digital assets, discipline is your greatest ally. Adhering to a modest crypto allocation under 5%, diversifying with traditional assets, and using systematic strategies like DCA are not limitations—they are the frameworks for sustainable, low-stress participation in the crypto revolution. This approach lets you explore the potential of cryptocurrency without jeopardizing your core financial security. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Why 5%? Why not 10% or 20% for higher returns? A: The 5% cap is a risk management guideline. Cryptocurrency is a high-risk asset class. Limiting exposure ensures that even in a worst-case scenario where the value drops significantly, your overall financial health and long-term goals remain intact. Q: Does this 5% rule apply to experienced traders as well? A: The advice is generally for the average investor building a long-term portfolio. Professional traders with dedicated risk capital may operate differently, but the principle of not overexposing one’s total net worth to volatile assets still holds true. Q: How often should I rebalance my portfolio? A: A common practice is to review and rebalance quarterly or semi-annually. Avoid doing it too frequently, as transaction fees and short-term volatility can make excessive trading counterproductive. Q: What if I only have a small total amount to invest? Should I still follow the 5% rule? A> Yes, the principle scales. If you have $1,000 to invest, your crypto allocation should be no more than $50. This instills good habits from the start and prevents a disproportionate risk on a small portfolio. Q: Are crypto ETFs safer than buying coins directly? A> They offer different kinds of safety. ETFs traded on traditional exchanges may provide easier management and custodial security. However, they still carry the market risk of the underlying cryptocurrencies. A mixed ETF offers instant diversification, which is a form of risk mitigation. Q: Can dollar-cost averaging really work in a volatile market? A> Absolutely. Volatility is precisely why DCA is effective. It systematically navigates the ups and downs, preventing you from investing a large lump sum at a market peak and helping you build a position at an averaged cost.

This monumental figure signals robust investor confidence, yet a critical question remains: why hasn’t this tidal wave of money propelled the price of XRP to new heights? Let’s dive into the data, the leaders, and the underlying market dynamics shaping this fascinating chapter for XRP spot ETFs . What’s Driving the Massive Inflows into XRP Spot ETFs? Since their debut on November 13, U.S. spot XRP spot ETFs have become a magnet for capital. Investors are clearly seizing the opportunity to gain regulated exposure to XRP without the complexities of direct custody. This influx represents a major vote of confidence in the asset’s legitimacy and its potential within a structured financial framework. The sheer scale of investment, reported by CryptoBriefing, underscores a significant shift toward institutional adoption of digital assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Which XRP ETF Providers Are Leading the Pack? The competition among issuers is fierce, with clear frontrunners emerging in assets under management (AUM). Here’s a breakdown of the top performers: Canary : The current leader, its spot XRP ETF holds approximately $335 million in AUM. 21Shares : A strong contender with around $250 million gathered. Grayscale : A well-known name in crypto funds, holding about $220 million in its XRP offering. This distribution shows a healthy, competitive landscape where multiple trusted firms are successfully attracting investor capital. Why Is XRP Price Stuck Below $2 Despite Huge ETF Inflows? Here lies the central paradox. While billions pour into XRP spot ETFs , the token’s market price has struggled to break and hold above the $2 mark. Two primary factors are at play: First, selling pressure from large-scale investors, often called “whales,” has counteracted the buying pressure from ETFs. Second, broader cryptocurrency market volatility has created headwinds for all digital assets, including XRP. Therefore, ETF inflows alone are not a guaranteed short-term price catalyst; they exist within a complex ecosystem of competing market forces. The Critical Challenge: Does XRP Need Its Own Story? Analysts point to a deeper, more strategic hurdle. For XRP to achieve sustained, long-term growth, it must cultivate a unique investment narrative separate from Bitcoin. While Bitcoin is often viewed as “digital gold,” XRP’s value proposition is tightly linked to its utility in cross-border payments and banking solutions. The success of XRP spot ETFs provides the fuel, but a compelling, distinct story about real-world adoption and efficiency is the engine needed for a lasting rally. What’s the Future for XRP and Its Spot ETFs? The initial success of these funds is undeniable and marks a pivotal moment. However, the path forward involves navigating the disconnect between institutional investment and retail market sentiment. Continued growth for XRP spot ETFs will likely depend on: Clarity in regulatory landscapes. Tangible advancements in XRP’s core use cases for global finance. A stabilization in the broader crypto market to reduce overarching volatility. The $1.2 billion inflow is a powerful foundation, but the next chapter will be written by adoption, utility, and market maturity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What are spot XRP ETFs? A: Spot XRP ETFs are exchange-traded funds that hold the actual XRP cryptocurrency. They allow investors to buy shares that track the live price of XRP without needing to buy and store the tokens themselves. Q: How much money have XRP ETFs gathered since launch? A: U.S. spot XRP ETFs have seen approximately $1.2 billion in net inflows since their launch on November 13. Q: Which XRP ETF has the most assets? A: As of the latest reports, the Canary spot XRP ETF is the largest, with around $335 million in assets under management (AUM). Q: If so much money is flowing in, why isn’t the XRP price higher? A: The price is being suppressed by selling pressure from large holders and general volatility in the wider cryptocurrency market. ETF buying is one of several factors influencing price. Q: What does XRP need for long-term price growth? A: Analysts suggest XRP needs to establish a strong, unique narrative focused on its utility in payments and banking, moving beyond simply following Bitcoin’s market trends. Q: Are XRP ETFs a good investment? A: Like any investment, XRP ETFs carry risk. They offer a regulated way to gain exposure to XRP, but their performance is tied to the volatile crypto market.

A significant 25% of these affluent investors plan to expand their cryptocurrency investments in the coming years. This indicates a strategic, rather than speculative, approach to digital assets. Why Are Chinese HNWIs Cautiously Optimistic About Crypto? The current low allocation reflects a traditionally conservative portfolio structure. Chinese asset owners typically center their wealth on pillars like: Gold as a physical store of value. Insurance products for security and legacy planning. Real estate , though its prominence has shifted. Therefore, the planned increase signals a pivotal shift. Investors are beginning to view crypto not as a fringe gamble, but as a legitimate component of a diversified, modern portfolio. This acceptance is a crucial step for broader cryptocurrency adoption within regulated financial frameworks. Is Overseas Investment the Key Driver for Crypto Interest? The report highlights an aggressive interest in overseas opportunities. Notably, 6% of wealthy Chinese individuals identified cryptocurrency as an overseas investment product they might pursue within the next year. This trend suggests two things: Cryptocurrency is perceived as a global, borderless asset class. It may serve as a channel for diversification beyond domestic markets and capital controls. Consequently, for Chinese HNWIs , crypto represents both a technological investment and a potential tool for international wealth strategy. Could AI Revive the NFT and Digital Collectibles Market? Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, the report casts an eye on the future of digital collectibles. It projects that the growing prominence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) could revive interest in NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). How? AI can drive new forms of creative content, gaming assets, and verifiable digital ownership, making NFTs more functional and integrated into the digital economy. This synergy between AI and blockchain could create the next wave of popular digital assets. What Are the Actionable Insights for the Crypto Market? This data is not just a snapshot; it’s a roadmap. The cautious but growing allocation from Chinese HNWIs points to a maturation phase. The market should note: Education is paramount: Investors seek strategic understanding, not just hype. Regulatory clarity attracts capital: Clear frameworks foster confidence. Integration with traditional finance will be key for wealth managers. The planned increase in crypto investment signifies a vote of confidence in the asset class’s long-term viability. Conclusion: A Strategic Shift in Global Wealth Portfolios The Hurun report unveils a nuanced narrative.

US Lawmakers Propose Tax Relief,https://bitcoinist.com/stablecoins-get-a-break-us-lawmakers-propose-tax-relief/,"Lawmakers in the US have put forward a discussion draft that would ease tax reporting for small stablecoin payments and let some crypto earners delay taxes on staking and mining rewards. According to reports, the plan was circulated by Representatives Max Miller (R-Ohio) and Steven Horsford (D-Nev.). The proposal aims to clear up rules that many say are confusing for everyday users and small businesses. Stablecoin Safe Harbor For Small Payments Based on reports , the draft would create a safe harbor for regulated dollar-pegged stablecoins when they are used like cash. Under the plan, capital gains on stablecoin transactions under $200 would be exempt from tax. That $200 threshold is meant to stop everyday buys — coffee, tips, small fees — from triggering tax paperwork and capital gains calculations. The exemption would only apply to stablecoins issued by a permitted issuer and that keep a stable peg to the USD. A Deferral Option For Staking And Mining Rewards Reports have disclosed another major change: taxpayers could elect to defer taxes on staking and mining rewards. Instead of being taxed the moment rewards are received, a taxpayer could choose to defer recognition for up to five years. After that period ends the rewards would be taxed as ordinary income at fair market value. The choice would be voluntary, and some taxpayers might still face tax when they sell or convert assets later. Mark-To-Market And Wash Sale Provisions Also Included The draft does more than just touch stablecoins and staking. It would apply wash sale rules to digital assets, which limits the ability to claim artificial losses by quickly repurchasing the same token. It also creates a path to elect mark-to-market accounting for certain traders, which would treat their holdings as sold at year-end for tax calculations. These moves are meant to align crypto tax practice closer to other parts of the tax code and to reduce gaps the IRS says exist. A Draft, Not Yet A Bill Lawmakers described the text as a discussion draft and have been talking with stakeholders and committees. The measure has not been formally introduced as a bill, and changes could come as it moves through the House Ways and Means Committee. If enacted, the framework is written to take effect for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Targeted for the first half of 2026, this ambitious update promises to tackle some of Ethereum’s most persistent challenges head-on. For anyone invested in the future of decentralized finance and applications, understanding the Glamsterdam upgrade is crucial, as it aims to refine the very core of how the Ethereum protocol operates. What Exactly Is the Glamsterdam Upgrade? Core developers have started the preparatory work for Glamsterdam, as reported by CoinDesk. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a planned systemic overhaul with clear objectives. The primary goals are to enhance transparency, reinforce decentralization, and improve the network’s overall efficiency. The developers plan to resume detailed discussions in January 2026 to finalize the scope, but the key pillars are already taking shape. At its heart, the Glamsterdam upgrade seeks to implement a profound change by separating the roles of block proposers and block builders. This separation is a direct move to combat centralization pressures within the network’s validator ecosystem. Furthermore, the upgrade will focus on boosting data processing speeds and introducing mechanisms to stabilize the often-volatile gas fees, which are a constant pain point for users. Why Is the Glamsterdam Upgrade a Game-Changer? The planned changes within the Glamsterdam upgrade address fundamental aspects of Ethereum’s operation. Let’s break down the key benefits this upgrade is designed to deliver: Enhanced Decentralization: By separating proposers and builders, the Glamsterdam upgrade reduces the risk of validator centralization, keeping the network true to its foundational principles. Improved User Experience: Faster data processing and more stable gas fees mean smoother and more predictable transactions for everyone using dApps or DeFi protocols. Greater Transparency: The structural changes aim to make the block production process more visible and fair, increasing trust in the network. However, executing an upgrade of this magnitude is not without its challenges. The complexity of modifying core protocol mechanics requires meticulous planning and extensive testing to ensure network security and stability remain intact. The long timeline, targeting H1 2026, reflects the careful, deliberate approach developers are taking with the Glamsterdam upgrade. What Comes After Glamsterdam? Meet Hegota Ethereum’s development roadmap is a continuous journey. Immediately following the Glamsterdam upgrade, developers have already penciled in the next phase: Hegota, slated for the second half of 2026. While Glamsterdam focuses on proposer-builder separation and fee mechanics, Hegota will tackle a different critical issue: node storage capacity. As the blockchain grows, the data storage requirements for running a full node increase, which can discourage participation and hurt decentralization. The Hegota upgrade aims to address this by implementing solutions that manage historical data more efficiently, ensuring that running a node remains accessible for the average participant. This one-two punch of Glamsterdam and Hegota shows a clear, strategic vision for Ethereum’s scalable and sustainable future. The Road Ahead for Ethereum and Its Community The announcement of the Glamsterdam upgrade marks a significant commitment to Ethereum’s long-term health. For developers building on Ethereum, these upgrades signal a more robust and efficient platform. For investors and users, they promise a better, more reliable experience. The multi-year timeline underscores that these are not reactive patches but thoughtfully planned evolutions. In conclusion, the Glamsterdam upgrade represents a pivotal step in Ethereum’s maturation. It directly confronts the trade-offs between scalability, decentralization, and user experience. While the full technical specifications will crystallize in 2026, the direction is clear: a stronger, more resilient, and truly decentralized Ethereum. The work beginning now on the Glamsterdam upgrade lays the foundation for the next era of the world’s leading smart contract platform. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: When is the Glamsterdam upgrade expected to go live? A: The Glamsterdam upgrade is currently targeted for release in the first half of 2026. Developers will reconvene in January 2026 to finalize the detailed scope. Q: What is the main goal of the Glamsterdam upgrade? A: Its primary goals are to improve decentralization by separating block proposers and builders, enhance data processing speeds, and stabilize gas fees on the Ethereum network. Q: What is ‘proposer-builder separation’ mentioned for Glamsterdam? A: It’s a design change that splits the role of choosing transaction order (building) from the role of proposing the block to the network. This aims to reduce centralization and increase fairness. Q: What upgrade is planned after Glamsterdam? A: The next planned upgrade is called Hegota, targeted for H2 2026. It will focus on solving node storage capacity issues to keep Ethereum running efficiently. Q: Will the Glamsterdam upgrade require a hard fork? A> While not all details are set, upgrades of this scale typically require a coordinated hard fork, where all node operators must update their software to the new protocol rules. Q: How will the Glamsterdam upgrade affect gas fees? A: A key objective is to introduce mechanisms that lead to more stable and predictable gas fees, though the exact technical solution is part of the ongoing development work.

56156604,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=248530,1766359511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revealing Insight: How Differing Views Shape Bitcoin Price Predictions at Fundstrat,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tom-lee-bitcoin-price-predictions/,"BitcoinWorld Revealing Insight: How Differing Views Shape Bitcoin Price Predictions at Fundstrat Have you ever wondered why expert Bitcoin price predictions can vary so wildly? A recent leaked memo from financial research firm Fundstrat, suggesting a potential drop to $60,000, caused a stir. However, Chairman Tom Lee quickly provided crucial context, revealing a fascinating truth about how major firms analyze crypto markets. This internal diversity of opinion, far from being a weakness, offers a more complete picture for investors. What Did the Leaked Fundstrat Memo Actually Say? The document, believed to be from Sean Farrell, Head of Digital Asset Strategy, presented a cautious short-term outlook. It suggested Bitcoin could test $60,000 in the first half of the coming year. Furthermore, it projected Ethereum (ETH) might fall to between $1,800 and $2,000, and Solana (SOL) could see a range of $50 to $75. These figures immediately sparked discussion across crypto media and forums. Tom Lee, a well-known Bitcoin bull, moved to clarify the situation. He emphasized that Fundstrat does not enforce a single, monolithic view. Instead, the firm encourages different analytical perspectives. This means short-term tactical views can differ from long-term strategic outlooks, even within the same organization. Why Do Bitcoin Price Predictions Diverge? The core of Lee’s explanation lies in methodology. He detailed that his own Bitcoin price predictions are primarily driven by macroeconomic analysis. He focuses on broader market cycles and global liquidity conditions—factors like interest rates and central bank policies that affect all risk assets. In contrast, Sean Farrell’s approach centers on on-chain data and fund flows. This method scrutinizes the movement of capital into and out of crypto assets, exchange reserves, and derivatives market risk. Therefore, two experts looking at different datasets can logically arrive at different conclusions for the same asset. Tom Lee’s Lens: Macro cycles, institutional adoption, long-term liquidity trends. Sean Farrell’s Lens: Short-term capital flows, exchange net positions, derivatives market risk. What Can Investors Learn from This Episode? This incident is a powerful reminder for anyone following Bitcoin price predictions . First, treat any single price target or report as one piece of a much larger puzzle. A robust investment thesis should consider multiple angles and time horizons. Second, understand the analyst’s framework. Is their prediction based on technical patterns, on-chain fundamentals, macroeconomics, or a combination? Knowing the “why” behind a price target is often more valuable than the target itself. Finally, internal debate within a research firm is a sign of intellectual rigor, not confusion. It prevents groupthink and leads to more thorough analysis. Navigating the Future of Bitcoin Price Predictions So, where does this leave us? The key takeaway is that the cryptocurrency market is complex and multi-faceted. Relying on a single voice or methodology is risky. The most informed perspectives come from synthesizing views from different analytical schools—both the macro “big picture” and the micro “fund flows” data. Tom Lee’s clarification ultimately reinforces that smart market analysis embraces nuance. By understanding that experts like Lee and Farrell are examining different parts of the same elephant, investors can make more measured decisions rather than reacting to every headline. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What was the main point of Tom Lee’s clarification? A: Lee clarified that the leaked memo represented one internal, short-term viewpoint. He stressed that Fundstrat values diverse analytical approaches, and his own long-term, macro-driven outlook on Bitcoin may differ from other strategists’ short-term, flow-based models. Q: Who is Sean Farrell? A: Sean Farrell is the Head of Digital Asset Strategy at Fundstrat. He is known for his data-intensive approach, focusing on capital flows, on-chain metrics, and risk indicators to form his market outlook. Q: Should I be worried about Bitcoin dropping to $60,000? A> A single prediction is not a guarantee. It’s a scenario based on specific data and assumptions. Investors should consider it alongside other analyses and, most importantly, their own investment horizon and risk tolerance. Q: What’s the difference between macro and fund flow analysis? A: Macro analysis looks at large-scale economic factors like interest rates and inflation that influence all markets. Fund flow analysis tracks the actual movement of money into and out of specific assets, like Bitcoin ETFs or exchange wallets. Q: Does this mean Fundstrat is bearish on Bitcoin? A> Not necessarily. It shows the firm has multiple frameworks. Tom Lee remains publicly long-term bullish based on macro trends, while other team members may have cautious short-term views based on different data.

The coin’s critical support is at $0.000038. The upside is limited unless the price reclaims $0.000042–$ 0.000045. FLOKI on the daily timeframe FLOKI is trading around $0.0000406 on December 21, holding just above the lower Bollinger Band near $0.0000382, which signals sustained downside pressure rather than a completed bottom. The coin’s price continues to trade below the mid-band at $0.0000452, maintaining the bearish trend of the daily structure. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView FLOKI’s RSI sits near 38, showing weak momentum with no clear bullish divergence yet. The MACD remains negative and flat, indicating sellers are still in control, but momentum is no longer accelerating aggressively. A daily close below $0.000038 would result in a price drop to $0.000032–0.000034 zone, while any recovery remains capped below $0.000045. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe On the 4-hour timeframe, FLOKI is consolidating under the Alligator averages, with resistance stacked around $0.000041–0.000042. The sharp bearish candle followed by small-bodied candles suggests selling pressure is slowing, but OBV is drifting lower, confirming the absence of strong accumulation. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Likewise, the MACD is flattening near the zero line, indicating short-term stabilization rather than a reversal. A clean reclaim of $0.000042 is needed to shift the short-term bias bullish, while a loss of $0.000039 would likely resume the downtrend.

Directional clarity will come from either a breakdown below $0.000038 or a recovery above $0.000042–0.000045. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~11x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a market cap of up to $95 to $100 billion to hit $0.01, over 95x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

This comes as Solana’s on-chain SOL-USD volumes have grown to the point of being comparable to and even surpassing major centralized exchanges, like Binance and Bybit, highlighting its growing importance for real-time trading and liquidity recycling. Where is crypto liquidity parked? Questions about Ethereum’s dominance of the stablecoin volume and activity sector vanished when it posted a historic month in October 2025, processing approximately $2.82 trillion in stablecoin transfers, the highest monthly volume ever recorded. In November, its stablecoin transaction volume reached $1.94 trillion, and so far in December, it has done $1.61 trillion, according to data from The Block. The major stablecoin is USDT, which dominates by over 52%. “Ethereum is not just another smart contract platform. It has become the settlement layer for global dollar liquidity,” Waidmann wrote on X . “When serious money moves, it still settles on Ethereum mainnet. Not because it is the fastest. Because it is the most trusted.” By sheer scale, Ethereum has a stranglehold on being the primary settlement layer for institutional dollar flows, but Solana has made its case to a growing audience too. The network’s on-chain SOL-USD volume has exceeded the combined spot trading volume on Binance and Bybit for three consecutive months, according to Kaviish Sethi , who works in data and research at Artemis. Source: Kaviish Sethi on X Solana’s appeal lies in its high throughput and low transaction costs, which make it well-suited for frequent trading, payments, and smaller-value transfers. Solana or Ethereum? While Ethereum dominates in settlement and high-value flows, Solana is establishing itself as a venue where liquidity is actively used, recycled, and traded, reinforcing its role as a market-facing layer of the ecosystem. The stablecoin dominating the Solana markets is Circle’s USDC, which leads by over 68%. The stablecoin supply on Solana has risen to record levels, sitting at over $15 billion in market capitalization, having hit over $16 billion a few months ago, although this pales in comparison to Ethereum’s total stablecoin market cap of over $167 billion. “Solana isn’t just a memecoin chain . It’s becoming the liquidity layer of crypto,” Sethi stated . “This is what real adoption looks like.” The growth of both ecosystems shows that the crypto industry is growing beyond single-chain maximalism, because there’s also Tron, which is known to be one of the leading platforms for stablecoin, mostly USDT transactions. Stablecoin adoption has also increased globally as more jurisdictions, like the United States, have put out laws that regulate its issuance, among other guidelines. “Stablecoins made blockchains useful,” Waidmann concluded. “Ethereum made stablecoins reliable,” though Solana’s trajectory of innovative performance shows that reliability now comes in multiple forms, with both blockchains positioning themselves to capture the distinct segments of on-chain dollar liquidity.

This signals that the firm is committed to its high-stakes treasury strategy even as its MSTR stock falters. This comes as MSCI plans to remove Strategy Inc. from its global indices during its February review. The index provider has flagged concerns that the firm now functions more like an investment vehicle than an operating company. Still, market analysts have pointed out that the financial implications of such a move are severe. Traders and institutions jockey as Bitcoin Tests $90K resistance zone Saylor’s signal arrives as BTC trades around the $90,000 level and the formation of liquidity clusters, providing insight into the short-term market outlook. In a brief post , the executive stated that Green Dots led Orange Dots, which was followed by a graph showing the Bitcoin acquisitions of his firm. Analysts often interpret the message as a hint that more Bitcoin buying could be forthcoming soon. The post continues a year-long pattern Saylor has used to hint at a new BTC purchase. Notably, such a weekend teaser is usually followed by a Monday morning SEC filing confirming a significant acquisition. Still, the last time Saylor hinted at more BTC buys with green dots, Strategy established a Bitcoin reserve for dividend payments in addition to buying more BTC. This means there’s a possibility of another move besides BTC purchases again this time. The Strategy executive chairman ’s past behavior adds weight to the signal. He has often used brief, symbolic posts before announcing major Bitcoin purchases. Institutional signals sometimes drive temporary sentiment about the BTC price. Traders are motivated to position themselves based on their expectations for purchases, even if they haven’t made a purchase yet. These investors can reduce their exposure in the short term or exit their positions when the price approaches resistance, or hedge by selling near the anticipated resistance zone. Tom Lee’s Fundstrat has also cautioned that Bitcoin could reach $60,000, even with longer-term optimism persisting. Bitcoin is trading near a heavy resistance zone around $90,000, where liquidity and sell orders are concentrated. Another crypto analyst, Ted Pillows, says market makers may sweep all three liquidity clusters in the next few days as Bitcoin tests the $90,000 level. Markets often move toward these zones as traders seek to fill large orders. According to on-chain data cited by Pillars, large clusters of resting liquidity are present at that level, creating a temporary barrier for price movement. A strong buyer stepping in near this zone could influence how Bitcoin reacts to that resistance. The leading crypto’s current structure makes the message especially notable. Institutional demand keeps Bitcoin supported amid volatility Liquidity data shows price magnets both above and below current levels. The largest group of upside liquidity is around $90,000, while the downside liquidity ranges from $86,000 to $84,000. This suggests that institutional interest in BTC remains, despite recent volatility. Even after incurring some substantial outflows last week, ETFs still maintain substantial Bitcoin balances. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is among the top six ETFs of this year. Additionally, corporate treasuries remain active in the market. These are part of the reasons why BTC demand is not falling even at increased prices.

Have you checked the market’s pulse today? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a crucial barometer for investor emotion, has inched up to 25. This five-point climb from yesterday offers a fragile sign of relief, but the overarching message remains clear: the cryptocurrency market is still gripped by extreme fear . Understanding this index is key to navigating the volatile crypto landscape. What Exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? Think of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as the market’s emotional heartbeat. Created by data provider Alternative.me, it quantifies the collective sentiment of cryptocurrency investors on a simple scale from 0 to 100. A score of 0 screams “Extreme Fear,” while 100 shouts “Extreme Greed.” The current reading of 25, though improved, firmly sits in the “Extreme Fear” zone. But how is this number calculated? It’s not a guess; it’s a data-driven formula. How is the Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The index synthesizes data from six key market dimensions to avoid reliance on any single metric. This multi-source approach provides a more holistic view. Here’s the breakdown: Volatility (25%): Measures current price swings against historical averages. High volatility often correlates with fear. Market Volume (25%): Analyzes trading volume and momentum. Unusual volume can signal strong sentiment shifts. Social Media (15%): Tracks the volume and sentiment of crypto mentions on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Incorporates data from polls and community sentiment platforms. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Monitors Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Rising dominance can indicate a “flight to safety.” Google Trends (10%): Measures search volume for cryptocurrency-related terms. What Does a Score of 25 Mean for Your Portfolio? A Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 25 presents a classic contrarian signal. Historically, prolonged periods of extreme fear have often preceded significant market rebounds. For investors, this environment demands a balanced strategy. For the cautious investor, it’s a reminder to stick to fundamentals, avoid emotional selling, and consider dollar-cost averaging into strong projects. For the opportunistic trader, extreme fear can uncover undervalued assets. However, the key challenge is timing. Sentiment can remain depressed for extended periods, and a slight improvement does not guarantee an immediate rally. Actionable Insights in a Fearful Market Navigating a fearful market requires discipline. First, use the index as a context tool, not a timing tool. Second, review your portfolio’s risk exposure. Third, consider this a research phase to identify quality projects that may be oversold. Finally, remember that market cycles are inevitable. While the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index signals distress, it also maps a potential road to recovery for those who prepare. Conclusion: Reading Between the Emotional Lines The rise to 25 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a minor positive in a sea of negative sentiment. It highlights that while fear dominates, there are subtle shifts beneath the surface. For savvy participants, understanding this metric provides a strategic edge, separating market noise from actionable signal. The path from fear to greed is rarely a straight line, but tracking this journey is essential for long-term success in cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a good Crypto Fear & Greed Index score? There’s no universally “good” score. Extremely low scores (0-25) can signal buying opportunities for contrarians, while extremely high scores (75-100) often warn of potential market tops. Many investors watch for sustained moves out of extreme zones. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index is updated daily, typically once per day. This allows investors to track sentiment shifts on a regular basis without the noise of minute-by-minute fluctuations. Can the Fear & Greed Index predict Bitcoin price? No, it cannot predict exact price movements. It is a sentiment indicator that shows the market’s emotional temperature. It is best used alongside technical and fundamental analysis, not as a standalone prediction tool. Why does the index focus so much on Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s market dominance is a component because it often acts as a “safe haven” within crypto during turmoil. When fear rises, money may flow from altcoins into Bitcoin, increasing its dominance. Is extreme fear always a buy signal? Not always. While extreme fear has preceded major rallies, markets can remain fearful for long periods. It should be considered a potential alert for value, not an automatic trigger to invest. Where can I check the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index is publicly available on websites like Alternative.me. Many major cryptocurrency news and data platforms also display it or provide similar sentiment analysis tools.

This Monday, CME Bitcoin futures opened with a dramatic $695 gap, sending a clear signal to attentive traders. This isn’t just a random blip; it’s a direct window into the relentless 24/7 energy of the crypto spot market clashing with traditional finance hours. Let’s unpack what this CME Bitcoin futures gap really means for your strategy. What Exactly Is a CME Bitcoin Futures Gap? Simply put, a CME Bitcoin futures gap is the price difference between where the futures contract closes on Friday and where it reopens on Monday. The CME, or Chicago Mercantile Exchange, follows a traditional schedule. It closes for the weekend. Bitcoin, however, never sleeps. Its global spot market trades continuously. Therefore, when the CME reopens, its futures price must instantly adjust to catch up with all the buying and selling that happened over Saturday and Sunday. This catch-up creates the gap. The wider the gap, the more significant the weekend price movement in the underlying Bitcoin market was. Why Should You Care About This $695 Signal? This specific $695 CME Bitcoin futures gap from $87,895 to $88,570 is more than a number. It’s a market footprint. It tells us that over the weekend, bullish sentiment dominated the spot markets, pushing prices higher. Now, traders watch for a potential “gap fill.” Market theory suggests these gaps often act as magnets, with prices tending to retrace to fill the void. This creates a self-fulfilling prophecy as traders position for the move. However, it’s not a guaranteed rule. Bullish Gap: A gap up (like this $695 one) indicates strong weekend buying. A fill would mean a price drop back toward the Friday close. Bearish Gap: A gap down signals selling pressure. A fill would mean a price rally. No Fill: Sometimes, the gap remains open, acting as a new support or resistance level, confirming a strong trend. How Can Traders Use Futures Gaps for Actionable Insights? Understanding CME Bitcoin futures gaps provides a tactical edge. They offer a structured way to view market sentiment shifts that occur outside traditional hours. Here’s how savvy investors use them: Identify Sentiment Shifts: The gap direction is a clear, unfiltered read on weekend market emotion. Plan Entry/Exit Points: The gap area can serve as a potential profit target or a zone to place stop-loss orders. Gauge Institutional Activity: The CME is a hub for institutional players. Gaps can reflect their adjusted positions after a weekend of analysis. Remember, while powerful, a gap is just one piece of the puzzle. Always combine this analysis with other indicators like trading volume, overall market trends, and major news events. What Are the Risks of Trading the Gap? Relying solely on the CME Bitcoin futures gap strategy carries inherent risks. The expectation of a fill is a common tendency, not an iron law. A strong, sustained trend can easily ignore an open gap. Furthermore, other macroeconomic factors or breaking crypto news can immediately override any gap-based technical setup. The key is to use the gap as a context-setting tool, not a crystal ball. It helps you understand *where* price might feel a pull, not a definitive prediction of *where* it will go. Conclusion: The Gap as Your Weekend Translator This week’s $695 CME Bitcoin futures gap is a perfect case study. It translates two days of decentralized, global Bitcoin trading into a single, digestible signal on a regulated exchange. By mastering this concept, you gain insight into hidden momentum and potential future price magnets. In the volatile world of crypto, tools that help decode silence are invaluable. Keep watching these gaps—they tell the story of what happens when traditional finance takes a break, but the digital economy charges ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is a CME futures gap unique to Bitcoin? A: No, gaps occur in futures for any asset traded on exchanges with closed periods. However, they are especially pronounced for Bitcoin due to its 24/7 spot market. Q2: How often do CME Bitcoin futures gaps get filled? A: While many gaps are filled, it’s not a 100% certainty. The probability varies with market conditions. Some gaps fill quickly, others take time, and a few may never close. Q3: Can retail traders profit from these gaps? A: Yes, but with caution. Traders might place limit orders near the gap area, anticipating a fill. However, this requires careful risk management, as prices may not reach the gap level. Q4: Does a larger gap mean a stronger price signal? A: Generally, yes. A larger CME Bitcoin futures gap indicates more significant price movement and potentially stronger sentiment over the weekend, making the gap area a more notable technical level. Q5: What’s the difference between a CME gap and a price gap on a crypto exchange? A: A CME gap is caused by exchange hours. A price gap on a continuous crypto exchange is rarer and usually caused by extreme volatility or liquidity issues between trades. Found this breakdown of the crucial CME Bitcoin futures gap helpful?

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, Bitcoin is now trading at $89,009.66 on the Binance USDT market. This surge marks a significant milestone and has traders and investors asking: what’s fueling this impressive rally? What’s Driving the Current BTC Price Rally? The jump in the BTC price above $89,000 is not happening in a vacuum. Several key factors are contributing to this bullish momentum. First, increasing institutional adoption continues to provide a solid foundation of demand. Furthermore, macroeconomic conditions, such as concerns about inflation, often lead investors to seek assets like Bitcoin as a potential store of value. This combination creates a powerful tailwind for the leading cryptocurrency. Why Does This $89,000 Level Matter for Bitcoin? Breaking past major psychological price levels, like $89,000, is crucial for market sentiment. It often acts as a trigger for several market behaviors: FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): Retail investors may enter the market, fearing they will miss further gains. Technical Breakout: This price action can signal a breakout from previous trading ranges, attracting algorithmic and technical traders. Media Attention: Major milestones generate headlines, bringing Bitcoin back into the mainstream conversation. Therefore, sustaining this BTC price level is the next critical challenge for the bull run. What Are the Immediate Implications for Traders? For active participants in the market, a rising BTC price presents both opportunity and risk. On one hand, long-term holders see their convictions validated. On the other hand, short-term traders must navigate increased volatility. Key considerations now include: Monitoring key support and resistance levels around the new price point. Being aware of potential profit-taking that could lead to a pullback. Assessing the strength of the volume supporting the price increase. A healthy rally is typically accompanied by strong, sustained trading volume. Could the BTC Price Climb Even Higher? While past performance never guarantees future results, analyzing market structure can provide clues. The breach of $89,000 opens the door to test even higher resistance levels. Market analysts will now watch to see if Bitcoin can gather the momentum to challenge the next major thresholds. However, it’s essential to remember that the cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile, and corrections are a normal part of any major uptrend. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Bitcoin The surge of the BTC price above $89,000 is a testament to Bitcoin’s growing resilience and its evolving role in the global financial landscape. This move reinforces its position as the market leader and sets a new benchmark for the current cycle. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a curious observer, this rally underscores the dynamic and transformative potential of digital assets.

Why Are This Week’s Key Financial Events So Crucial? Economic data acts as a pulse check for global markets. When central banks and governments release figures, they provide clues about future policy. For crypto, which often reacts to shifts in liquidity and risk sentiment, these key financial events can trigger significant volatility. Understanding them helps you anticipate moves rather than just react. December 22nd: A Dual Focus on China and the U.S. The week kicks off with two major announcements. First, China announces its Loan Prime Rate (LPR). As a benchmark for lending rates, it signals the direction of monetary policy in the world’s second-largest economy. A change here can impact global commodity demand and risk appetite. Later, the U.S. releases Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data for October. The Federal Reserve watches this inflation gauge closely. A higher-than-expected reading could reinforce a “higher for longer” interest rate stance, potentially pressuring risk assets like stocks and crypto. 1:00 a.m. UTC: China Loan Prime Rate (LPR) 3:00 p.m. UTC: U.S. Core PCE Price Index (October) December 23rd: Taking the Economy’s Temperature On Tuesday, the spotlight returns to the U.S. with the preliminary release of third-quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This figure measures the total value of goods and services produced. It’s a broad indicator of economic health. Strong GDP growth might delay hopes for Fed rate cuts, while weak data could fuel them. Crypto markets frequently interpret delayed cuts as negative for liquidity, making this one of the week’s most pivotal key financial events . 1:30 p.m. UTC: U.S. GDP (Third Quarter, Preliminary) Navigating Holiday Hours and Key Data The Christmas holiday introduces a unique dynamic. While U.S. markets are closed on December 24th and 25th, important data is still released. Initial jobless claims, a weekly measure of layoffs, come out on the 24th. This can cause outsized moves in thinly traded markets, as fewer participants can lead to amplified volatility. Always check your exchange’s holiday schedule for any changes in liquidity or leverage. December 24th & 25th: U.S. Markets Closed (Christmas) 1:30 p.m. UTC (Dec 24th): U.S. Initial Jobless Claims Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders How should you approach these key financial events ? First, mark them on your calendar. Second, understand the likely narrative. Hot inflation (PCE) and strong growth (GDP) are typically seen as hawkish for the Fed, which can be a headwind for crypto. Conversely, weak data may be interpreted as bullish for potential rate cuts. However, remember that markets often “buy the rumor, sell the news.” The price reaction can be counterintuitive, so manage your risk accordingly. Conclusion: Your Week-Ahead Strategy This week’s calendar of key financial events provides a clear roadmap of potential market catalysts. From Chinese policy signals to crucial U.S. inflation and growth data, each release holds the power to influence trader sentiment across all asset classes. By preparing for these moments, you position yourself to make more informed decisions, whether you’re trading Bitcoin, Ethereum, or traditional equities. Stay vigilant, especially around the holiday-thinned trading, and let the data guide your strategy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Why do crypto markets care about traditional economic data like PCE and GDP? A: Crypto is no longer an isolated asset class. It is influenced by global macro factors like interest rates and liquidity. Data that shapes Federal Reserve policy directly impacts the cost of capital and investor risk appetite, which flows into digital asset prices. Q: How can I prepare for volatility around these events? A> Consider reducing high leverage positions ahead of major announcements, set stop-loss orders to manage risk, and ensure you have access to real-time news feeds. Also, be aware that spreads may widen on exchanges during data releases. Q: The U.S. markets are closed for Christmas. Will crypto trading be affected? A> Crypto markets operate 24/7, so trading will continue. However, liquidity can be significantly lower during major traditional market holidays, which may lead to sharper, more volatile price swings with less volume. Q: What is the single most important event for crypto this week? A> The U.S. Core PCE data is likely the most critical. As the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, it has the highest potential to alter interest rate expectations, a primary driver of market sentiment.

Future quantum attacks pose a significant challenge to the current blockchain system. This has prompted blockchain developers to engage in discussions on how to tackle this issue. Some of these discussions included considering some updates to protocols. However, Hoskinson advised developers that the biggest challenge is timing; hence, they needed to focus on this aspect instead of certain amendments required. He further warned that acting rashly could result in high costs for blockchain networks. According to him, the cryptographic tools essential to protect blockchain technology from future quantum attacks are already accessible. Hoskinson guides blockchain developers in preparation for future quantum attacks Hoskinson pointed out that the US National Institute of Standards and Technology made post-quantum standards public in 2024. Following this release, the Cardano founder highlighted that the key issue is based on the costs associated with executing new protocols before validators and miners are ready. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that while several researchers believe that cutting-edge quantum computers could ultimately break current cryptography, reports from sources reveal that there is still less consensus on when this threat might materialize. However, based on the recently announced predictions, practical quantum computing could occur anytime from a few years to more than ten years from now. Still, Hoskinson advised blockchain developers to focus on concrete developments rather than hype and corporate timelines when evaluating how soon this danger might materialize. One of the suitable ways the Cardano founder suggested was for them to shift their focus to DARPA’s Quantum Benchmarking Initiative. According to his argument, this program conducts tests on several quantum computing methods to determine whether they can produce useful outcomes. “It’s the best independent and objective standard we can use to see if quantum computers will be real, when they will arrive, and who will build them,” Hoskinson said. Notably, DARPA has decided that 2033 will be the year in which it will determine if large-scale quantum computing is feasible. Hoskinson reveals a suitable solution for a major emerging problem in the crypto industry Similar to other leading networks, such as Bitcoin , Ethereum, and Solana, reports from reliable sources have highlighted that Cardano utilizes elliptic-curve cryptography. It is worth noting that such a method is at great risk because of Shor’s algorithm, that is, in the event of the development of very powerful quantum computers. This news raised tension in the crypto ecosystem as developers ignited heated debates. To address this controversy, Hoskinson noted that the industry knows suitable ways to curb this problem. Nonetheless, he mentioned that this approach is centered on deciding between two different cryptographic methods. To further elaborate on this point, he stated that the two options to choose from include Hashes, which is utilized by Ethereum, and lattices, which is actually their preferred choice. Concerning Hoskinson’s statement, analysts weighed in on the matter. They highlighted that Hash-based cryptography relies on cryptographic hash functions to produce digital signatures effectively, which are widely recognized as the most secure approach against future quantum threats. The analysts also pointed out that these systems are straightforward, thoroughly researched, and established to be cautious. However, they are mainly used for signing data and are not preferable for general encryption purposes.

If you’ve been waiting for the explosive growth of alternative cryptocurrencies, recent data delivers a sobering message. The Altcoin Season Index currently sits at a mere 17, a clear signal that Bitcoin is firmly in the driver’s seat. This crucial metric tells us we are deep in a ‘Bitcoin season,’ leaving many investors wondering when the tide will turn for other digital assets. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? Before we panic or celebrate, let’s understand the tool. CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index is a simple but powerful gauge. It measures the percentage of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) that have outperformed Bitcoin over a 90-day window. The calculation is straightforward: Track the performance of the top 100 coins against Bitcoin. Count how many have posted better gains. If 75% or more outperform Bitcoin, an ‘altcoin season’ is officially declared. Therefore, a score of 17 means only a small fraction of major altcoins are beating the king of crypto. This index is your reality check against market hype. Why Does a Low Altcoin Season Index Matter? A reading this low isn’t just a number; it has real implications for your strategy. It indicates strong capital rotation into Bitcoin, often driven by institutional interest through ETFs or macroeconomic factors like inflation hedging. During these phases, money flows out of riskier altcoins and into the perceived safety and liquidity of Bitcoin. For investors, this means: Portfolio Underperformance: A diversified altcoin portfolio may lag significantly behind a simple Bitcoin holding. Reduced Speculative Fever: The ‘moonshot’ mentality cools, and projects need real utility to attract attention. Consolidation Opportunities: For long-term believers, this can be a time to research and accumulate quality altcoins at lower prices. Is This the End for Altcoins? Historical Context Says No Take a deep breath. History shows these cycles are normal. The crypto market moves in distinct waves. Intense ‘Bitcoin seasons’ are typically followed by periods where altcoins catch up and even surge past BTC’s returns. The index has swung from single digits to above the 75 threshold multiple times in past cycles. The current low Altcoin Season Index reading may simply be setting the stage for the next major rotation. Patience and a long-term perspective are key. Actionable Insights in a Bitcoin-Dominant Market So, what should you do when the Altcoin Season Index is stuck at 17? Instead of fearing the data, use it to inform smarter decisions. Reassess Your Allocation: Is your portfolio balance aligned with the current market regime? It may be wise to ensure a healthy Bitcoin allocation. Focus on Fundamentals: Use this quieter period to deeply research altcoin projects. Look for strong development activity, real-world use cases, and resilient communities. Dollar-Cost Average: If you believe in specific altcoins long-term, consider systematic buying during this phase to lower your average entry cost. Watch for the Flip: Monitor the Altcoin Season Index for a sustained move above 50, which could signal the beginning of a shift in momentum. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto Seasons The Altcoin Season Index at 17 is a powerful snapshot of today’s market reality, not a permanent verdict. It confirms Bitcoin’s current strength and the challenging environment for altcoins. However, understanding this cycle is the first step to navigating it successfully. By respecting the trend, focusing on fundamentals, and preparing for the eventual shift, you can position your portfolio not just to survive the Bitcoin winter, but to thrive when the altcoin spring returns. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Where can I check the current Altcoin Season Index? A: You can find the live Altcoin Season Index on CoinMarketCap’s website under their ‘Indices’ section. Q: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? A: The index is typically updated daily, reflecting the rolling 90-day performance data. Q: Does a low index mean all altcoins are losing money? A: Not necessarily. It means they are underperforming Bitcoin. Some altcoins may still have positive price action, just not as strong as BTC’s. Q: What usually triggers a shift from Bitcoin season to altcoin season? A: Shifts can be triggered by Bitcoin price stabilization, new technological narratives (like DeFi or NFTs in past cycles), or a surge of new capital seeking higher returns in smaller-cap projects. Q: Should I sell all my altcoins when the index is low? A> A blanket sell-off is rarely a good strategy. It’s better to review each holding based on its fundamentals and your investment thesis. The index is a macro tool, not specific investment advice. Found this breakdown of the Altcoin Season Index helpful?

It usually follows it. The long-lasting projects are willing to build silently as well as sort out difficult issues initially and acquire fame subsequently. This phase is missed by a lot of investors since it is not a glamorous one on the surface. But here is where the best moves are usually made. A single emerging DeFi crypto seems to have broken through that invisible barrier of infrastructure being complete and focus beginning to catch up. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project developing a decentralized ethereum-based lending and borrowing system. Its design is based on two lending paths which deal with various users. On the one hand, the users have an opportunity to provide assets to pooled markets and obtain mtTokens. These are their deposits and earned yield in the form of these mtTokens. Borrowers on the other hand have access to liquidity as they vary depending on market conditions (Rule of Collateral). The protocol is constructed based on dynamic interest rates, collateral thresholds, and liquidation systems. These are not outward aspects. They are the fundamental engine that enable a lending platform to perform at scale in a safe manner. This infrastructure is being ready before the V1 release on the Sepolia testnet scheduled to happen in Q4 2025. Infrastructure Progress In the case of real infrastructure, participation begins to increase preceding headlines. This can normally be traced in the consistent increase instead of sudden peaks. Mutuum Finance has accumulated $19.4M already and has more than 18,600 holders. Over 820M tokens were already sold. These figures did not happen just like that. These constructions were constructed gradually, which is a more usual indication of health. The early investor feeling is that it is not a short term frenzy and hence the constant growth rate. These trends are normally observed to emerge before the attention of the wider market can be collected. Token Growth and Presale When a protocol is ready, then token structure comes into play. The total supply of the Mutuum Finance is 4B MUTM. 45% or approximately 1.82B of this amount are issued to the presale. Phase 6 is currently at the advanced stage at over 99% allocation with the token at the value of $0.035. MUTM has already increased 250% since it started its presale in early 2025 since the price of Phase 1 was $0.01. Supplies do not increase before infrastructure is created but after it. Price pressure tends to increase as the availability is reduced and the usage expectations are high. Other analysts are of the view that after V1 is launched, MUTM may rise above $0.06, indicating that early investors would be at a good position. Security as Last Infrastructure Layer The final box that serious users wait to be checked before is security. Mutuum Finance was also CertiK audited with their 90 out of 100 token scan score. Besides this, Halborn security is going through the lending and borrowing contracts of the protocol. The code is completed, and is being analysed formally. It also has a $50k bug bounty that will motivate responsible disclosure of code vulnerabilities. Such measures are important since most investors will only invest funds when they see and believe in security structures. There are a number of indicators that visibility begins to increase. The next step of the protocol is the upcoming V1 testnet launch, which approaches the actual use of the protocol. The 24-hour leaderboard will give the highest daily contributor a reward of 500 in MUTM making him/her participate over and over again. There are equal card payments which make new users have less friction. Focus is likely to follow preparation rather than pledges. Mutuum Finance seems to be passing through the stage of infrastructure becoming visible. MUTM is getting harder to disregard by those following the potential best crypto to buy stories in Q4 2025.

An anonymous whale executed transactions worth $37.6 million, sending shockwaves through the DeFi community and raising questions about market stability. This event highlights the powerful influence large holders can have on asset valuations. What Caused the Sudden AAVE Price Drops? According to on-chain data from Onchain Lens, the catalyst was clear. Over a three-hour period, a wallet address starting with 0xa923 sold 230,350 AAVE tokens. The whale didn’t simply cash out for stablecoins; instead, they swapped their AAVE for two major assets: 5,869.46 stETH (worth $17.52 million) and 227.8 WBTC (worth $20.07 million). This strategic move away from AAVE and into other blue-chip crypto assets immediately pressured the market. Consequently, the AAVE price drops reflected this sudden increase in selling pressure. Breaking Down the Whale’s $37.6 Million Move Let’s examine the mechanics of this substantial transaction. The whale’s actions provide a case study in large-scale portfolio management. Asset Sold: 230,350 AAVE tokens. Total Value: $37.59 million at the time of the swaps. Assets Acquired: The whale diversified into staked Ethereum (stETH) and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). Market Impact: The sale contributed directly to the reported 9.57% decline in AAVE’s value over 24 hours. This wasn’t a panic sell into fiat but a calculated reallocation within the crypto ecosystem. However, the sheer size of the trade was enough to trigger the notable AAVE price drops observed across exchanges. How Do Whale Transactions Affect Crypto Markets? Whale movements are a critical factor for any crypto investor to monitor. These large holders, whether individuals or institutions, possess the power to move markets single-handedly. Their transactions often signal changing sentiments or strategic shifts. In this case, the whale’s decision to exit a large AAVE position likely prompted other traders to reassess their holdings, creating a cascade of selling. Therefore, understanding whale behavior is key to anticipating potential AAVE price drops or surges. What’s the Current State of AAVE? Following the sell-off, data from CoinMarketCap shows AAVE trading at approximately $161.70. The 24-hour chart clearly shows the dip correlating with the whale’s activity. While a 10% correction can be unsettling for holders, it’s essential to view it within the broader context of crypto market volatility. Such events test the resilience of the project’s underlying fundamentals and its community’s conviction. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Events like this offer valuable lessons. First, they underscore the importance of on-chain analysis. Monitoring whale wallets can provide early warning signs. Second, diversification remains a cornerstone of risk management. Finally, investors should distinguish between technical price movements driven by large trades and fundamental changes to a project’s long-term prospects. While today’s news focuses on the AAVE price drops , the future will depend on the protocol’s adoption and innovation. In summary, the recent whale transaction serves as a potent reminder of the crypto market’s sensitivity to large-scale moves. The direct link between the $37.6 million sell-off and the subsequent AAVE price drops is a textbook example of on-chain activity driving exchange prices. For savvy investors, these events are not just headlines but opportunities to learn, adapt, and refine their strategies in the dynamic world of decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly is a “whale” in cryptocurrency? A: A “whale” is a term for an individual or entity that holds a large enough amount of a specific cryptocurrency that their buying or selling activity can significantly influence its market price. Q: Why did the whale swap AAVE for stETH and WBTC instead of USDT? A> This suggests the whale is not exiting the crypto market entirely but is rebalancing their portfolio. They may view stETH (yield-bearing Ethereum) and WBTC (Bitcoin on Ethereum) as having different risk/reward profiles or better short-term prospects than AAVE. Q: Should I sell my AAVE because of this whale sell-off? A> Investment decisions should be based on your own research, risk tolerance, and long-term thesis for the AAVE protocol. A whale’s trade reflects their strategy, which may not align with yours. Consider the project’s fundamentals alongside market movements. Q: How can I track whale movements myself? A> You can use on-chain analytics platforms like Etherscan, Nansen, or Arkham Intelligence. These tools allow you to track large transactions and monitor the wallets of major holders. Q: Is a 10% drop considered a major crash for a cryptocurrency like AAVE? A> In the highly volatile crypto market, 10% daily moves are not uncommon. While significant, it is not typically classified as a “crash.” It is, however, a substantial correction worthy of attention. Q: Could this price drop present a buying opportunity? A> Some traders view significant dips caused by single events (like a whale sell-off) as potential buying opportunities if they believe the project’s long-term value remains strong. This is known as “buying the dip,” but it carries inherent risk. Found this analysis of the AAVE price drops insightful? The crypto market moves fast, and knowledge is power.

This week brings significant token unlocks that could create notable market movements. Between December 22 and 28, several major projects will release substantial amounts of tokens into circulation. Understanding these events is crucial for making informed investment decisions and navigating potential volatility. What Are Token Unlocks and Why Do They Matter? Token unlocks represent scheduled releases of previously locked cryptocurrency tokens into the circulating supply. Projects typically lock tokens for team members, advisors, investors, or ecosystem development. When these token unlocks occur, they increase selling pressure as recipients may choose to sell their newly accessible holdings. However, they also represent important milestones in a project’s development timeline. This week’s schedule includes six significant releases worth monitoring closely. The timing coincides with the holiday period, which could amplify market reactions due to typically lower trading volumes. Let’s examine the specific token unlocks scheduled for this crucial week. Detailed Breakdown of This Week’s Token Unlocks According to data from Tokenomist, here are the major token unlocks scheduled from December 22-28: MBG : 15.84 million tokens ($8.06M) unlocking December 22 at 12:00 PM UTC UDS : 2.15 million tokens ($5.16M) unlocking December 23 at 12:00 AM UTC SOON : 21.88 million tokens ($8.82M) unlocking December 23 at 8:30 AM UTC H : 105 million tokens ($15.28M) unlocking December 25 at 12:00 AM UTC XPL : 88.89 million tokens ($11.5M) unlocking December 25 at 12:00 PM UTC JUP : 53.47 million tokens ($10.34M) unlocking December 28 at 2:00 PM UTC Each of these token unlocks represents a different percentage of circulating supply, with MBG leading at 8.42% and JUP being the most conservative at 1.73%. The Christmas Day releases for H and XPL tokens are particularly noteworthy given the holiday timing. How Should Investors Approach These Token Unlocks? Navigating token unlocks requires strategic thinking. First, consider the percentage of circulating supply being released. Higher percentages typically mean greater potential impact. Second, examine historical patterns for how each project’s tokens have behaved during previous unlock events. Some projects experience minimal price movement while others see significant volatility. Third, research the recipients of the unlocked tokens. Are they long-term supporters or short-term investors? Team and advisor tokens might have different selling patterns than venture capital holdings. Finally, consider overall market conditions. During bullish markets, token unlocks might be absorbed more easily, while bearish conditions could amplify selling pressure. Key Projects to Watch: H, XPL, and JUP Analysis Among this week’s token unlocks , three projects deserve special attention. The H token unlock represents $15.28 million entering circulation on Christmas Day. With 4.79% of circulating supply being released, this could create interesting trading opportunities. Similarly, XPL’s $11.5 million unlock later on December 25 adds another layer to the holiday trading dynamics. The JUP unlock on December 28 concludes the week with a more modest 1.73% of supply entering circulation. Each of these token unlocks tells a different story about project development and investor confidence. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders Successful navigation of token unlocks involves several practical strategies. Monitor trading volumes before and after unlock events for unusual activity. Set appropriate stop-loss orders if you hold affected tokens. Consider dollar-cost averaging if you believe in a project’s long-term fundamentals despite short-term unlock pressure. Additionally, watch for official project communications around unlock events. Some teams provide guidance about lock-up extensions or selling restrictions that could mitigate market impact. Remember that not all token unlocks lead to price declines—some represent maturation milestones that attract new investors. Conclusion: Navigating Token Unlock Volatility This week’s token unlocks present both challenges and opportunities for cryptocurrency market participants. By understanding the mechanics, timing, and potential impacts of these events, investors can make more informed decisions. The December 22-28 period serves as an excellent case study in how scheduled token releases interact with market dynamics, especially during holiday periods with potentially reduced liquidity. Successful crypto investing requires anticipating and responding to fundamental events like token unlocks . While they create short-term uncertainty, they also represent normal project development milestones. The key is balancing awareness of immediate market impacts with conviction about long-term project fundamentals. Frequently Asked Questions About Token Unlocks What exactly happens during a token unlock? During a token unlock, previously restricted tokens become available for trading. These tokens were typically locked for team members, early investors, or ecosystem development and become accessible according to a predetermined schedule. Do token unlocks always cause price drops? Not necessarily. While token unlocks often create selling pressure, the actual price impact depends on multiple factors including market conditions, the percentage of supply being unlocked, and recipient selling behavior. Some unlocks have minimal price effect. How can I find information about upcoming token unlocks? You can use cryptocurrency data platforms like Tokenomist, CoinMarketCap, or specialized token unlock calendars. Most projects also disclose unlock schedules in their official documentation and announcements. Should I sell my tokens before an unlock event? This depends on your investment strategy and research. Some investors sell before unlocks to avoid potential volatility, while others see them as buying opportunities if they believe the selling pressure is temporary and the project fundamentals remain strong. What’s the difference between token unlocks and token burns? Token unlocks increase circulating supply by releasing restricted tokens, while token burns permanently remove tokens from circulation, decreasing total supply. These are opposite mechanisms affecting token economics differently. How long do price effects from token unlocks typically last? Price effects vary widely. Some tokens recover within days, while others experience longer-term pressure. The duration depends on the unlock size, market conditions, and subsequent project developments.

Grossman’s remarks, in part within the context of a larger industry conversation, underscore the increasing confidence among blockchain proponents that real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, the act of representing traditional financial instruments on public blockchains, is already reshaping the global financial landscape. “While many feared digitization would destroy media, what it actually did was force its evolution,” Grossman said , adding that real-world asset tokenization, the process of representing traditional assets onchain, will force traditional institutions to adapt. He added: “This is no longer hypothetical. BlackRock is offering tokenized funds. Franklin Templeton is running tokenized money market funds on public blockchains. Major global banks are piloting onchain settlement, tokenized deposits and real-time asset movement.” The RWA industry, minus stablecoins, has a market capitalization of almost $19 billion, according to RWA.XYZ. Financial giants such as Citi , Bank of America, and JPMorgan Chase continue to exist. Still, they will do so in a different medium, much as media companies shifted to digital media in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Grossman emphasized that those who will succeed in tokenized finance will adapt, not resist, as the world transitions into a blockchain-powered global financial system. Tokenization cuts costs and accelerates settlements Tokenization for real assets offers several advantages , including 24/7 access to markets beyond local borders, a wide-ranging scale of exchange, lower transaction costs resulting from disintermediation, and settlement times of minutes instead of days. Tokenized assets enable the markets not only to remain agnostic and continue ongoing operations, but they also reduce the number of intermediaries and the complexity of those intermediaries necessary, thereby lowering transaction costs and settlement times from days to mere minutes. For institutional investors, this effectively decreases counterparty risk and improves capital efficiency. In September, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) released a joint statement providing support for a regulatory regime of 24/7 capital markets. Tokenization transforms markets amid regulatory challenges While regulatory support is growing, tokenized finance must navigate complex legal frameworks to ensure its success. Firms will need robust cybersecurity measures to protect assets and ensure compliance with global securities laws. The majority of the tokenized RWA value is currently floating on Ethereum, according to RWA.XYZ. The move to 24/7 trading is a stark contrast to conventional markets, which close on nights, weekends, and holidays. The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which processed approximately $3.7 quadrillion in settlements in 2024, received SEC approval to begin offering tokenized financial instruments in December. It’s also expected that in the second half of 2026, DTCC will begin trading tokenized assets such as US Treasuries and stock indexes. Ultimately, tokenization could create a more efficient, inclusive, and transparent financial system. Institutions that embrace these changes early may gain a competitive advantage, while those resistant to blockchain innovation risk falling behind.

According to him, it is essential to encourage the responsible development and use of this technology, rather than allowing the country to fall behind other nations in the adoption of AI. During “The Sunday Briefing,” Hansen pointed out that it is best if they are encouraged to make significant investments and develop AI responsibly, as this technology offers numerous benefits when used effectively, such as in energy production, healthcare, and scientific research. Hansen describes AI as a game-changer Hansen’s strong support for AI technology prompted reporters to request an interview. In the interview, they asked him to comment on cybersecurity. Respondingly, the Google executive acknowledged that it is essential for them to exercise caution and consider people’s safety while effectively teaching them how to utilize this technology properly. Afterwards, Hansen hinted at energy as a major sector for AI advancement. He also discussed the “Genesis Mission,” an ongoing collaboration among tech firms, the Department of Energy, and the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). It is worth noting that this initiative is part of a recent executive order signed by US President Donald Trump. It aims to accelerate the adoption of AI, particularly in scientific research. Regarding this executive order, Hansen commented that such a move is a perfect example of how energy and AI can work effectively together. Regarding scientific research, he noted that federal agencies employ some of the most skilled scientists globally in their national laboratories. In the meantime, reports from reliable sources reveal that energy issues have been a major problem in the tech ecosystem. Hansen decided to weigh in on the matter. He declared that the most suitable way to tackle this issue is by integrating AI and emerging technologies such as quantum computing. Based on his argument, this move could establish a positive cycle where the tech industry can improve science, enhance energy solutions, and showcase American innovation. Another key problem in the tech industry, according to an analysis by Hansen, is cybercrime. The Google executive mentioned that tech companies have developed an effective method to utilize AI for defense against such attacks. To illustrate this point, he noted that while criminals are increasingly utilizing this technology to conduct their illicit activities, tech firms are purposefully establishing AI-driven tools to protect their systems on a large scale. Sundar Pichai warns of the presence of irrationality in the recent AI boom Last month, Sundar Pichai, the chief executive officer of Alphabet Inc. , the multinational conglomerate that owns Google, told reporters that if the AI bubble were to burst, almost every business would experience the consequences. Following this argument, Pichai noted that while the recent AI investments have significantly increased, the current AI hype demonstrates the presence of some “irrationality.” He made this statement as there are increased concerns in Silicon Valley and other areas regarding a potential bubble. This ongoing trend stems from the escalating value of AI tech firms and the increased spending by businesses seeking to expand in this field. Reports asked the CEO whether Google would be safe from the impact of an AI bubble pop. Responding to this question, Pichai still gave a warning, even though he asserted that the tech giant can handle such a situation. “I believe no company will be immune, including us,” he said. Meanwhile, sources highlighted that Pichai also addressed issues related to energy requirements, the delay in achieving climate goals, investments in the UK, the accuracy of his AI models, and the potential impact of the AI revolution on jobs during a broad, exclusive interview at Google’s headquarters in California.

56161662,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=248557,1766371212,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Stunning Surge: Gold Hits New All-Time High of $4.4K, What’s Next?",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/gold-all-time-high-surge/,"BitcoinWorld Stunning Surge: Gold Hits New All-Time High of $4.4K, What’s Next? In a stunning move that has captured the attention of investors worldwide, gold has shattered records by hitting a new all-time high of $4,384.90 per ounce. This milestone, reached on the spot market, marks the precious metal’s highest price point since October 20th and signals a powerful shift in market sentiment. For those watching both traditional and digital assets, this surge raises critical questions about safety, value, and the future of store-of-value investments. What Drove Gold to This New All-Time High? Several converging factors have propelled gold to this historic peak. Primarily, ongoing global economic uncertainty acts as a major catalyst. Investors traditionally flock to gold during times of instability, seeking a reliable hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Furthermore, shifting expectations around central bank policies, particularly interest rate cuts, have reduced the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold. This perfect storm of demand has created relentless upward pressure on its price. According to live data from TradingView, gold is currently trading at $4,380.74, showing a solid gain of 0.97% from the previous day’s close. This consistent upward trajectory is not a fleeting spike but part of a sustained bullish trend. The breach of the previous all-time high resistance level is a technically significant event that often invites further buying from momentum traders and institutional funds. Gold vs. Bitcoin: A New Chapter in the Store-of-Value Race? This record-breaking price inevitably invites comparison with digital gold: Bitcoin. For years, a narrative has existed pitting the ancient precious metal against the modern cryptographic asset. Gold’s recent all-time high achievement arrives during a period of consolidation for major cryptocurrencies, prompting a fresh look at this dynamic. Safe-Haven Status: Gold’s surge reinforces its centuries-old role as a premier safe-haven asset during geopolitical or economic stress. Institutional Adoption: Both assets are seeing increased investment from ETFs and large-scale funds, validating their roles in diversified portfolios. Market Maturity: Gold’s market is deep and established, while Bitcoin’s is younger, more volatile, but growing in acceptance. Therefore, rather than a simple competition, many analysts now view them as complementary assets within a broader macro strategy for preserving wealth against different types of risk. What Does This Mean for Your Investment Strategy? For the average investor, watching gold hit a new all-time high can trigger both excitement and anxiety. The key is to avoid emotional decisions. Historically, breaking a major resistance level can lead to further price discovery, but it can also precede periods of profit-taking and correction. Consider your portfolio’s goals and risk tolerance. Actionable insights include: reviewing your asset allocation to ensure it aligns with your long-term strategy, considering dollar-cost averaging if adding exposure to avoid timing the peak, and understanding that gold often performs well in environments where growth assets may struggle. This milestone is a powerful reminder of the importance of having uncorrelated assets in your portfolio. The Road Ahead: Can the Rally Continue? The fundamental drivers behind gold’s strength show few immediate signs of abating. Persistent inflation concerns, a complex geopolitical landscape, and a global trend toward de-dollarization by some central banks continue to support demand. However, a sharp reversal in central bank policy or a sudden surge in risk appetite across equity markets could apply temporary downward pressure. The breakthrough to a new all-time high has fundamentally changed the technical picture, opening the door for gold to target even higher price zones. Market participants will now watch key support levels around the previous highs for signs of sustained strength. In conclusion, gold’s ascent to a $4.4K all-time high is more than just a number—it’s a statement on the current state of the global economy. It highlights a deep-seated search for stability and tangible value in an uncertain world. Whether you are a traditionalist favoring precious metals or a modernist exploring digital assets, this event underscores the timeless need for strategic, diversified wealth preservation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Why did gold’s price hit a new all-time high? A: The surge is driven by a combination of global economic uncertainty, expectations of interest rate cuts, strong central bank buying, and its role as a hedge against inflation. Q: Is it too late to invest in gold after this record high? A> While timing the market is difficult, many analysts view gold as a long-term holding for portfolio diversification. Strategies like dollar-cost averaging can mitigate the risk of buying at a peak. Q: How does gold’s performance affect Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies? A> It renews the debate on “store of value” assets. They often react to similar macro forces (like loose monetary policy), but can also diverge. Some investors hold both for a balanced approach. Q: What is the difference between spot gold price and futures price? A> The spot price is for immediate purchase and delivery. The futures price is for contracts to buy/sell gold at a set price on a future date. The article references the spot price, which is the standard benchmark. Q: Should I sell my gold holdings now that it’s at a high? A> This depends entirely on your personal financial goals, investment horizon, and why you bought gold initially. Consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is recommended. Q: Where can I reliably track the live price of gold? A> Reputable financial data platforms like TradingView, Bloomberg, or Kitco provide real-time and historical price data for gold and other commodities.

A broad Asia Pacific share gauge rose about 0.5%, led by tech, after last week’s dip revived talk of a final push higher into 2026. Crypto did not lead the move, although Bitcoin edged up about 1% in early trading, echoing the steadier tone in risk assets.

This wave of crypto liquidations wasn’t random—it was decisively led by traders betting against the two largest digital assets. Let’s break down what happened and why it matters for your portfolio. What Triggered This Wave of Crypto Liquidations? A sudden and sharp price movement is often the match that lights the crypto liquidations fuse. When the market moves violently against leveraged positions, exchanges automatically sell a trader’s assets to cover their debt, leading to a forced closure or ‘liquidation’. The past day saw this mechanism fire on all cylinders, creating a cascade of selling and buying pressure that amplified the original price move. Bitcoin and Ethereum: The Short-Squeeze Story The data reveals a clear narrative. For Bitcoin (BTC), $49.14 million was liquidated. Crucially, short positions —bets that the price would fall—made up 62.66% of that total. Ethereum (ETH) told a similar, more intense story with $47.23 million liquidated and a staggering 67.34% being shorts. This pattern suggests a potential short squeeze . Here’s a simple breakdown: Short Sellers Borrow: Traders borrow an asset (like BTC) and sell it, hoping to buy it back later at a lower price. Price Rises Unexpectedly: If the price climbs instead, those short sellers face mounting losses. The Squeeze: To limit losses, they are forced to buy back the asset, which pushes the price up even further, triggering more crypto liquidations in a vicious cycle. Is This Just a BTC and ETH Phenomenon? Not entirely. While the giants dominated, other assets showed different behaviors. For instance, the token LIGHT saw $16.31 million in liquidations, but here, long positions (bets on a price increase) were the majority at 51.43%. This highlights a critical point: crypto liquidations are not a monolithic event. Market sentiment and price action can vary drastically between assets, punishing both bulls and bears depending on the coin. How Can Traders Navigate Liquidation Risks? Surviving these volatile storms requires discipline. First, manage your leverage . High leverage magnifies both gains and losses, making you a prime target for liquidation. Second, always use a stop-loss order . This tool automatically exits your position at a predetermined price, helping you avoid the forced closure of a liquidation. Finally, stay informed. Monitoring funding rates and overall market leverage can provide early warning signs of potential volatility. The Ripple Effect of Major Crypto Liquidations A $112 million liquidation event doesn’t happen in a vacuum. It creates ripple effects across the market. The forced buying from short squeezes can artificially inflate prices, while the forced selling from long liquidations can deepen a crash. This activity increases market volatility in the short term, creating both danger and opportunity for alert traders. Understanding these mechanics is key to interpreting sudden price swings. In summary, the recent crypto liquidations serve as a powerful reminder of the market’s inherent risks. The data paints a clear picture of a short squeeze impacting Bitcoin and Ethereum, while other assets faced their own unique pressures. For traders, the lesson is timeless: respect leverage, employ risk management tools, and never underestimate the market’s power to humble overconfident positions. Staying educated and cautious is your best defense against the next liquidation storm. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are crypto liquidations? Crypto liquidations occur when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s leveraged position because they have lost the collateral needed to keep it open. This happens to prevent the trader from owing more money than they have. Why were mostly short positions liquidated for BTC and ETH? The data suggests a short squeeze. If the price of BTC or ETH rose quickly, traders who had borrowed and sold (shorted) the asset were forced to buy it back at a higher price to limit losses, triggering a cascade of liquidations. What is the difference between long and short liquidations? Long liquidations happen when prices fall sharply, wiping out traders who bet on a price increase. Short liquidations happen when prices rise sharply, hurting traders who bet on a price decrease. How can I avoid getting liquidated? Use lower leverage, set prudent stop-loss orders, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Continuously monitor your positions and the overall market conditions. Do large liquidations affect the overall market price? Yes, they can. A large wave of liquidations creates forced buying or selling, which adds volatility and can amplify price movements in the short term. Where can I track crypto liquidation data? Several websites like Coinglass and Bybit provide real-time liquidation data across multiple exchanges, showing totals for different cryptocurrencies and position types.

This wasn’t a scene from a dystopian film—it was the startling reality that unfolded last weekend when a city-wide blackout brought Alphabet’s autonomous vehicle service to a grinding halt. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts who understand the importance of resilient, decentralized systems, this incident raises crucial questions about the infrastructure supporting our future transportation networks. Waymo Robotaxi Gridlock During San Francisco Blackout On Saturday evening, a fire at a Pacific Gas & Electric substation plunged much of San Francisco into darkness, affecting approximately 120,000 customers. While human drivers struggled with non-functioning traffic signals and transit disruptions, Waymo’s autonomous vehicles faced a more fundamental challenge: how to navigate a city without power. Social media quickly filled with images and videos showing Waymo robotaxis frozen at intersections, creating bottlenecks as human drivers either waited patiently or attempted to maneuver around the stationary vehicles. The scale of the disruption was significant. According to leaked documents from Tiger Global Management, Waymo now provides approximately 450,000 robotaxi rides per week—nearly double what the company reported in spring 2025. This massive fleet, when immobilized, created what one Twitter user described as “a MASSIVE jam” in neighborhoods like North Beach. Autonomous Vehicles Meet Real-World Chaos Waymo’s self-driving systems are designed with specific protocols for handling traffic signal failures. Under normal circumstances, their vehicles treat non-functioning traffic lights as four-way stops. However, Saturday’s event presented an unprecedented scenario where multiple intersections simultaneously lost power, creating complex decision-making challenges for the autonomous systems. The company explained in their statement: “While the failure of the utility infrastructure was significant, we are committed to ensuring our technology adjusts to traffic flow during such events.” This incident highlights a critical vulnerability in current autonomous vehicle technology—their dependence on predictable environmental conditions and infrastructure. Impact Area Details Duration Waymo Service Suspension Full suspension in San Francisco Approximately 24 hours PG&E Customers Affected 120,000 initially, 35,000 still without power Sunday morning Multiple days for some customers Traffic Signal Failure Widespread across affected areas Until power restoration Muni Transit Disruption Significant service interruptions Throughout outage period San Francisco Blackout Reveals Infrastructure Dependencies Mayor Daniel Lurie’s warning to residents to stay off the roads unless absolutely necessary underscored the severity of the situation. The blackout didn’t just affect Waymo’s operations—it disrupted the entire city’s transportation ecosystem. This incident serves as a stark reminder that even the most advanced AI systems remain vulnerable to basic infrastructure failures. For those following cryptocurrency and blockchain developments, this event draws interesting parallels. Just as decentralized networks aim to eliminate single points of failure in financial systems, autonomous vehicle networks must develop similar resilience against centralized infrastructure vulnerabilities. The question becomes: Can autonomous systems be designed to function independently when traditional infrastructure fails? Power Outage Response and Recovery Timeline Waymo’s response followed a clear timeline: Saturday Evening: Service suspended after blackout begins Saturday Night: Social media fills with images of stalled vehicles Sunday Afternoon: Company announces service resumption Ongoing: Analysis and system improvements based on lessons learned The company emphasized that “the majority of active trips were completed successfully” before the suspension, suggesting their systems handled the initial phase of the outage reasonably well. However, the decision to suspend service entirely indicates recognition of limitations in handling prolonged, widespread infrastructure failure. Traffic Disruption Lessons for Future Autonomous Systems This incident provides valuable insights for the entire autonomous vehicle industry: Redundancy Requirements: Systems need backup protocols for extended infrastructure failures Communication Protocols: Clear guidelines for how autonomous vehicles should communicate their status during emergencies Public Education: Better public understanding of autonomous vehicle behavior during unusual conditions Infrastructure Coordination: Closer collaboration between autonomous vehicle companies and municipal infrastructure providers Waymo’s spokesperson stated they are “focused on rapidly integrating the lessons learned from this event,” suggesting this incident will directly inform future system improvements. The company’s commitment to “earning and maintaining the trust of the communities we serve” will be tested by how effectively they address these challenges. FAQs: Understanding the Waymo Blackout Incident What caused the Waymo robotaxis to stop during the blackout? Waymo’s autonomous systems are designed to treat non-functioning traffic lights as four-way stops. However, the scale of Saturday’s blackout—affecting multiple intersections simultaneously—caused vehicles to remain stationary longer than normal as they tried to assess complex traffic situations. How long was Waymo service suspended? Service was suspended from Saturday evening until late Sunday afternoon—approximately 24 hours. The company resumed operations once they determined their systems could safely navigate the recovering infrastructure. What company operates Waymo? Waymo is operated by Waymo LLC , which is owned by Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google. You can learn more about Alphabet on their Wikipedia page . Who is San Francisco’s mayor? Daniel Lurie serves as Mayor of San Francisco. Information about the mayor’s office and initiatives can be found on the official San Francisco government website . What utility company experienced the substation fire? Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) experienced a fire at a San Francisco substation. More information about the company is available on their official website or Wikipedia page . Where can I see the social media posts about the incident? Posts from Vincent Woo ( @fulligin on Twitter/X ) and Iago Maciel ( @_iagomaciel on Twitter/X ) documented the gridlock caused by stalled Waymo vehicles. Conclusion: Resilience as the Next Frontier for Autonomous Vehicles The San Francisco blackout incident serves as a crucial stress test for autonomous vehicle technology. While Waymo successfully resumed service within 24 hours, the event exposed significant vulnerabilities in how these systems handle widespread infrastructure failure. For the cryptocurrency community, which champions decentralized, resilient systems, this incident offers important lessons about the limitations of centralized infrastructure dependencies. As autonomous vehicles become more integrated into our transportation networks, their ability to handle exceptional circumstances will determine public trust and regulatory acceptance. The true test of this technology isn’t how it performs under ideal conditions, but how it adapts when everything goes wrong. Waymo’s response to this crisis—and their implementation of lessons learned—will shape the future of urban mobility.

An Ethereum OG stakes a staggering 3,598 ETH, worth approximately $10.8 million, on the liquid staking platform Ether.fi. This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a monumental vote of confidence from an address that held its assets silently for nine long years. Why Is This Ethereum OG Staking ETH Such a Big Deal? When an early adopter, often called an ‘OG,’ makes a move, the market pays attention. This particular address, starting with ‘0xccc,’ had remained dormant since the early days of the Ethereum network. The decision to finally deploy this capital into liquid staking speaks volumes. It signals a strategic shift from passive holding to active participation in securing the network while seeking yield. This action validates the maturity and perceived safety of modern staking protocols for even the most cautious, long-term investors. What Does Liquid Staking on Ether.fi Offer? The choice of Ether.fi is crucial. Unlike traditional staking, which locks up assets, liquid staking provides flexibility. Here’s what likely attracted this Ethereum OG: Liquidity: Stakers receive eETH tokens representing their staked ETH, which can be used across DeFi for additional yield. Non-Custodial Security: Users retain control of their keys, a paramount concern for OGs. Earned Rewards: The staked ETH earns staking rewards, growing the holder’s position over time. Therefore, this move isn’t just about earning interest; it’s about maintaining liquidity in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. The Ethereum OG stakes ETH not for passive gain but for strategic, flexible growth. What Does This Mean for the Broader Ethereum Ecosystem? This massive stake is a bullish signal for Ethereum’s proof-of-stake consensus. When influential, long-term holders participate in staking, it increases network security and decentralization. Moreover, it demonstrates institutional-grade confidence in the staking infrastructure. This event may encourage other large holders to consider similar strategies, potentially increasing the total value locked in DeFi and strengthening Ethereum’s economic foundation. Key Takeaways from the $10.8M Ethereum Stake The story of this Ethereum OG provides clear insights for every crypto observer: Long-Term Belief: Holding for nine years shows profound conviction in Ethereum’s core value. Strategic Evolution: The move from simple holding to sophisticated yield generation marks a new phase for smart capital. Market Sentiment: Such actions often precede or reflect growing institutional and whale confidence in crypto financial products. Ultimately, watching an Ethereum OG stakes ETH on this scale is a masterclass in patient, strategic crypto investment. Conclusion: A Legacy Holder’s Powerful Endorsement The decision by this Ethereum OG to stake $10.8 million is more than a headline. It is a powerful endorsement of Ethereum’s current trajectory and the innovative tools built around it. It blends the wisdom of long-term holding with the dynamism of modern DeFi. This move underscores a critical trend: the maturation of cryptocurrency from speculative asset to a cornerstone of a new, participatory financial system. The silent giants are awakening, and their actions chart the course for the future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Who is considered an Ethereum OG? An Ethereum OG (Original Gangster) typically refers to an early investor or developer who acquired ETH or participated in the network during its initial years, often before 2017. What is liquid staking? Liquid staking allows users to stake their crypto assets (like ETH) to secure a network and earn rewards, while receiving a liquid token (like eETH) that represents their staked position. This token can be used elsewhere in DeFi. Why is staking important for Ethereum? Staking is the process that secures the Ethereum blockchain under its proof-of-stake consensus. Participants lock up ETH to validate transactions and create new blocks, earning rewards for their service. What is Ether.fi? Ether.fi is a non-custodial, decentralized liquid staking protocol. It allows users to stake ETH and receive a liquid token, eETH, while maintaining control of their private keys. Could this large stake influence ETH’s price? While a single stake doesn’t directly dictate price, it can influence market sentiment. A large, long-term holder staking (not selling) is generally viewed as a confident, long-term bullish signal. Is my ETH safe if I stake it? Staking involves smart contract and protocol risks. Using well-audited, non-custodial platforms like Ether.fi can mitigate some risk, but it’s crucial to conduct your own research before staking any assets.

That future is now on the legislative table in Hong Kong. In a groundbreaking proposal, the Hong Kong Insurance Authority (HKIA) has taken a decisive step to allow insurance companies to invest their capital in cryptocurrencies. This move could unlock billions in institutional capital for the crypto market, fundamentally reshaping its landscape and solidifying Hong Kong’s ambitious plan to become a global digital finance hub. What Does the Hong Kong Crypto Insurance Investment Proposal Entail? The HKIA’s draft legislation, first reported by Bloomberg, is a detailed framework for integrating digital assets into the conservative world of insurance finance. The core of the plan is to permit licensed insurers to allocate a portion of their investment portfolios to cryptocurrencies and the underlying infrastructure that supports them, like custody solutions and trading platforms. However, this isn’t a free-for-all. The authority has introduced a critical risk management measure: a 100% risk weighting for volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. This means insurers must hold capital equal to the full value of their crypto investments as a buffer against potential losses. For stablecoins, the risk weighting would be more nuanced, tied directly to the safety and liquidity of the assets they are pegged to, such as the US dollar. Why is Hong Kong Pushing for Crypto in Insurance? This initiative is not an isolated event. It’s a strategic piece of a much larger puzzle. Hong Kong has been actively and methodically building a comprehensive regulatory environment for digital assets. The goal is clear: to attract global businesses, talent, and capital. By allowing Hong Kong crypto insurance investment , the city achieves several objectives: Diversification: It provides insurers with a new, non-correlated asset class to potentially enhance portfolio returns. Market Maturity: It signals deep institutional confidence, which can reduce volatility and increase mainstream adoption. Competitive Edge: It positions Hong Kong ahead of other financial centers that are still grappling with crypto regulation. What Are the Risks and Challenges for Insurers? While the opportunity is significant, the path forward is lined with challenges. The primary concern is the inherent volatility of the crypto market. A 100% risk weighting is a direct acknowledgment of this. Insurers will need sophisticated risk management frameworks to navigate price swings. Furthermore, operational risks like cybersecurity, custody of private keys, and regulatory compliance across jurisdictions remain daunting. The success of this Hong Kong crypto insurance investment framework will depend heavily on the industry’s ability to develop and adopt robust security protocols and clear internal governance policies. What’s the Timeline for This Crypto Investment Law? Patience is key. The HKIA has outlined a deliberate and consultative process. The proposal is scheduled for a formal public and industry consultation period running from February to April 2026. This extended timeline allows all stakeholders—insurers, tech firms, and the public—to provide feedback and shape the final rules. Only after this consultation will the refined legislation be submitted to Hong Kong’s Legislative Council for debate and approval. Therefore, while the direction is set, the actual implementation of Hong Kong crypto insurance investment is still a few years away, allowing ample time for preparation. The Bottom Line: A Watershed Moment for Crypto Hong Kong’s proposal is a watershed moment. It represents one of the first concerted efforts by a major financial regulator to formally bridge the world of traditional, risk-averse insurance with the innovative but volatile crypto ecosystem. If successful, it could create a powerful blueprint for other global financial centers, driving unprecedented levels of institutional capital into digital assets and accelerating the maturation of the entire sector. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can Hong Kong insurers invest in crypto right now? A: No. This is currently a legislative proposal. Insurers must wait for the law to pass after the consultation and legislative process, which is targeted for after 2026. Q2: What does a 100% risk weighting mean? A: It means an insurance company must hold capital in reserve equal to 100% of the value of its cryptocurrency investments. This is a conservative safeguard against the asset’s potential to lose value. Q3: Will this make insurance policies riskier? A: Not necessarily. The strict risk-weighting and capital requirements are designed to protect policyholders. Insurers are expected to invest only a small, managed portion of their vast portfolios in crypto. Q4: How does this help Hong Kong? A: It attracts crypto businesses and financial institutions to set up operations in Hong Kong, boosting its economy and fulfilling its goal of becoming a leading digital finance hub. Q5: Are stablecoins treated the same as Bitcoin? A: No. The proposal treats them differently. Stablecoins would receive a risk weighting based on the quality and liquidity of their reserve assets (like US Treasuries), which will likely be lower than 100%.

A new Bitcoin price prediction from a prominent on-chain analyst suggests the flagship cryptocurrency could see a staggering rally to $150,000, but not before navigating a crucial shakeout period. This forecast hinges on complex market data and holder behavior, offering a roadmap for the volatile years ahead. Let’s break down the key insights and what they mean for your portfolio. What is the Core Bitcoin Price Prediction? On-chain analyst Murphy presents a compelling timeline. He anticipates Bitcoin will find its ultimate cycle bottom in 2026. Following this low, the stage is set for a powerful bull market capable of propelling the price to a target of $150,000. This Bitcoin price prediction isn’t just a random guess; it’s built on analyzing where coins are held and the psychology of different investor groups. Why is the $80K-$90K Zone So Critical? The analysis identifies a massive support wall between $80,000 and $90,000. This zone represents a key battleground between fear and conviction. Here’s the data that makes this area so significant: Strong Support: Approximately 7.46 million BTC are held profitably below $80,000, creating a base of investors less likely to sell in panic. Overhead Supply: Conversely, about 6.17 million BTC are held at a loss above $90,000. If the price rises, these coins could become sell-side pressure as holders break even. The Absorption Test: The bullish case depends on new buying demand absorbing the 1.87 million BTC in this critical range without triggering massive sell-offs. Who is Selling and What Does it Mean? A major liquidation event in October cleared out many weak hands. The current selling pressure now comes primarily from Long-Term Holders (LTHs)—investors who have held Bitcoin for over 155 days. These profitable players are distributing their coins, likely influenced by the classic four-year cycle theory and broader economic uncertainty. However, there’s a silver lining. The analyst notes that panic selling above $110,000 has largely subsided. More importantly, despite this sustained selling from LTHs, Bitcoin has avoided the catastrophic 50% crashes seen in previous cycles. This resilience points to exceptionally strong underlying demand, a bullish signal often overlooked in short-term price action. How Does This Lead to a $150K Bitcoin Price Prediction? The path to $150,000 is a process of elimination and accumulation. The market is currently in what Murphy calls a “strong shakeout period.” This phase is designed to transfer coins from impatient or uncertain hands to steadfast believers. Once this distribution concludes and the selling pressure from LTHs is exhausted, the foundation for the next leg up will be solid. The projected inflection point in 2026 is when this cycle resets. With weaker sellers flushed out and a new wave of accumulation complete, the reduced available supply, met with increasing demand, could create the explosive conditions needed to fulfill the ambitious Bitcoin price prediction of $150,000. Conclusion: Patience is the Ultimate Strategy This analysis paints a picture of a market in transition. The road to new all-time highs requires navigating significant volatility and a final capitulation phase. For investors, the key takeaway is the importance of a long-term perspective. The data suggests that while 2025 may be turbulent, strategic accumulation during weakness could position portfolios exceptionally well for the potential bull run that follows the 2026 low. This Bitcoin price prediction underscores that in cryptocurrency, timing and patience are often more valuable than timing the market perfectly. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the main reason for predicting a bottom in 2026? A1: The prediction is based on the four-year Bitcoin cycle theory and on-chain data showing Long-Term Holders are still distributing their coins. The analyst believes this selling pressure needs more time to be fully absorbed by the market. Q2: Why hasn’t Bitcoin crashed 50% like in past cycles despite the selling? A2: The analyst points to exceptionally strong underlying demand from new buyers. This consistent demand is absorbing the sell-side pressure from LTHs, preventing the deep, panic-driven crashes seen historically. Q3: What happens if Bitcoin breaks below the $80,000 support zone? A3: A sustained break below $80,000 could invalidate the current support thesis and potentially lead to a deeper and faster search for a bottom, as it would trigger stop-losses and fear selling from the profitable cohort holding below that level. Q4: Is the $150,000 target guaranteed if we bottom in 2026? A4: No price target is guaranteed. The $150,000 figure is a projection based on historical cycle patterns and supply/demand dynamics. It requires favorable macroeconomic conditions and continued adoption to materialize. Q5: What should an investor do based on this analysis? A5: The analysis suggests a strategy of patience and potential dollar-cost averaging during periods of weakness, with a focus on the long-term horizon beyond 2026, rather than attempting to trade short-term volatility.

It was also negative for almost all of November. The Coinbase premium is the price difference between Bitcoin or other crypto assets trading on the US-based exchange compared to other major alternatives, particularly those popular in Asia, like Binance. “That usually signals US spot demand is lagging the rest of the market,” observed analyst ‘Kyledoops’ on Sunday. “Less aggressive institutional buying, softer risk appetite, and capital staying cautious. Not panic, but a clear sign US flows haven’t stepped back in yet.” America Selling, Asia Buying The Coinbase premium acts as a sentiment indicator for institutional and retail demand in different regions. When it is positive, it signals strong buying pressure from US investors, often indicating institutional interest since Coinbase is heavily used by American institutions. The Coinbase $BTC premium has stayed negative for 7 straight days, now around -0.04% per Coinglass. That usually signals U.S. spot demand is lagging the rest of the market. Less aggressive institutional buying, softer risk appetite, and capital staying cautious. Not panic, but… pic.twitter.com/HtjNSorO1I — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) December 21, 2025 A negative Coinbase premium typically indicates weakening US demand as American investors are selling or showing less buying interest compared to other regions. It can also signal institutional hesitation since the exchange is a proxy for institutional activity, meaning institutions may be reducing exposure or staying on the sidelines, which is bearish overall. Year-end dynamics are also at play as institutions are rebalancing portfolios, taking profits, and engaging in tax-loss harvesting as the fiscal year closes. This is actually fairly typical for December, though the magnitude this year is more pronounced. The opposite appears to be happening in Asia, which is seeing more buying pressure. “The US and the EU are selling Bitcoin like there’s no tomorrow… but Asia is buying,” observed analyst ‘No Limit.’ They shared a chart showing that Asian traders are aggressively buying during their sessions, treating price dips as buying opportunities, while the opposite is happening in the US. Historical Patterns Repeating However, this isn’t new, as the same dynamic appeared in 2019, in March 2020, and in late 2022, the analyst noted. In previous cycles, Western selling was followed by Asian accumulation, and the price eventually followed Asia’s lead upward. Additionally, over the past couple of weeks, frequent liquidation events have caused crypto market dumps in late trading in the US on Sunday, and accumulation followed in Asia during the Monday morning trading session. “Same story every time.

Overall, the optimism behind prediction markets is rising, but Santos cautioned that incorporating them into mainstream platforms like Robinhood may carry potential long-term risks. He commented, “The problem with casino-like products isn’t that users lose money. It’s that casinos accelerate churn. The longer you exist inside a casino, the higher the probability of liquidation. And liquidation means you’re out of the game entirely. A churned user is worth zero.” Santos says mainstream platforms should focus on growing with users Robinhood and other platforms began incorporating prediction markets in 2025 by partnering with prediction companies. In August, Robinhood partnered with Kalshi to enter the sports betting market. The company’s Prediction Markets Hub now enables users to wager on popular pro and college football games. In addition, Coinbase is also preparing to launch its own prediction market, in collaboration with Kalshi, as it seeks to expand the range of asset class offerings on its website amid declining demand for digital assets. Gemini was also granted CFTC authorization to be a Designated Contract Market, offering regulated prediction markets for customers in the United States. However, Santos believes that trying to put such services on mainstream platforms would be more of a departure from their key mission of providing a stable and reliable service to retail users. He argued that, for Robinhood and similar platforms, what matters is the simplicity of their platform design and accessibility; the trick is to achieve long-term growth with users, rather than maximizing short-term payouts. He added, “If durability matters, you optimize for staying power.” In his X post , he also explained , “Casinos serve just enough alcohol to increase the house edge, but not enough to make players leave the table. Financial superapps are attempting the same optimization. The failure mode is over-extraction → churn.” Critics argue that weak regulation makes prediction markets vulnerable The Inversion Capital Founder said prediction markets can potentially create a spike in numbers, but at the cost of long-term risks that may threaten user stability on financial apps. Products like credit cards, insurance, and savings accounts are not as flashy, he said, but they tend to foster long-lasting relationships with users because they’re integrated with everyday financial management. Critics have attributed the growth of betting markets and the muddied distinction between trading and gambling to the Trump administration’s relaxed regulatory approach. They said this lack of scrutiny also leaves the markets vulnerable to insider influence and abuse. Prediction markets, notably Polymarket and Kalshi, surged during the 2024 US presidential race, generating billions in betting and consistently tilting the odds in Trump’s favor, contrary to polling data. By the time the elections were drawn to a close, the markets appeared to be more accurate, reinforcing the view that betting markets would outperform traditional forecasting. So far, Polymarket and Kalshi have partnered with top news organizations, including CNBC, Yahoo Finance, and CNN, to incorporate prediction market odds into their reporting. In early 2025, Intercontinental Exchange also revealed plans to invest up to $2 billion in Polymarket, part of demand prompted by a surge in customer interest in market predictive data for trading. However, regulators in multiple states, including Nevada, New York, and Massachusetts, have attempted to halt the operations of prediction markets, particularly those of Kalshi. They’ve contended that the platform’s contracts are classified as gambling wagers, so the company is now embroiled in lawsuits questioning regulators’ power to pursue the platform.

That’s exactly what’s happening with Metaplanet, a Japanese firm making waves with its latest strategic pivot. The company has just approved the issuance of dividend-paying preferred stock, specifically tailored for foreign institutions. This move isn’t just a financial reshuffle; it’s a clever bridge between the volatile world of cryptocurrency and the steady demands of global capital. What Are Metaplanet Dividend Shares and Why Do They Matter? Metaplanet’s board has given the green light to create and issue preferred stock that pays dividends. This represents a significant shift. The company is moving from a pure growth model, common in tech and crypto, toward a more traditional capital strategy that includes income-generating securities. Following this approval, Metaplanet can now reclassify its capital reserves. These funds can be used specifically to finance preferred stock dividends and share buybacks. Furthermore, the issuance limit for its Class A and B preferred shares has been doubled. The Class B shares have received special approval for issuance exclusively to overseas institutional investors. This structure is seen as a masterstroke. It offers a new type of Bitcoin exposure to global funds, pension managers, and asset allocators who might be hesitant for two key reasons: Reluctance to hold BTC directly due to custody, regulatory, or volatility concerns. Hesitation to invest in volatile common stock of a crypto-focused company. How Does This Strategy Attract Global Capital? Metaplanet isn’t just changing its capital structure; it’s actively building bridges to international markets. The company recently began trading on the U.S. Over-The-Counter (OTC) market, increasing its visibility to American investors. Moreover, it has established a strategic subsidiary in Miami, Florida. This location is no accident. Miami has positioned itself as a crypto-friendly hub in the United States. This two-pronged approach allows Metaplanet to localize what it calls a “U.S.-style Bitcoin strategy” within Japan’s unique regulatory environment. Essentially, the company is creating a hybrid model. It leverages Japan’s corporate framework while adopting aggressive Bitcoin treasury strategies pioneered by American firms like MicroStrategy. The goal is clear: attract global capital by offering a familiar, income-producing security that is indirectly backed by Bitcoin’s potential. What Are the Benefits and Potential Challenges? This innovative move by Metaplanet presents several compelling benefits for different stakeholders. For foreign institutions, it provides a regulated, dividend-yielding avenue to gain Bitcoin exposure without the operational headaches of direct ownership. For Metaplanet, it unlocks a new pool of sophisticated, long-term capital that values income and stability. For the broader crypto market, it demonstrates a mature financial engineering approach that could be replicated by other firms. However, challenges remain. The success of these Metaplanet dividend shares hinges on investor confidence in the company’s ability to manage its Bitcoin treasury profitably to fund dividends. Furthermore, regulatory scrutiny on both sides of the Pacific will be intense. The company must navigate the complex web of Japanese financial law and the expectations of international investors. Conclusion: A Blueprint for Crypto-Corporate Integration Metaplanet’s approval of dividend-paying shares for foreign institutions is more than a corporate announcement. It’s a potential blueprint for how publicly listed companies can integrate Bitcoin into traditional finance frameworks. By creating a security that offers both yield and crypto exposure, Metaplanet is solving a major pain point for institutional adoption. This strategy could pave the way for a new asset class: dividend-paying equities backed by digital asset strategies. As the line between traditional finance and cryptocurrency continues to blur, innovative structures like these will likely lead the charge. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are Metaplanet dividend shares? A1: They are a new class of preferred stock approved by Metaplanet that will pay regular dividends to shareholders. The Class B shares are specifically designated for issuance to overseas institutional investors. Q2: How are these shares related to Bitcoin? A2: Metaplanet holds Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset. The company’s value and its ability to generate capital for dividends are indirectly tied to the performance and management of its Bitcoin holdings. Q3: Why would an institution buy these instead of just buying Bitcoin? A3: Institutions face hurdles like custody, regulatory compliance, and volatility. These shares offer regulated, dividend-paying exposure to Bitcoin’s potential without the need to hold the asset directly, acting as a simplified gateway. Q4: What is Metaplanet’s connection to Miami? A4: Metaplanet established a subsidiary in Miami to help attract global capital and localize a U.S.-style, aggressive Bitcoin treasury strategy within the bounds of Japanese regulation. Q5: Are these shares available to retail investors? A5: The initial focus and specific approval for Class B shares are for overseas institutional investors. Retail access would depend on future issuance and public offering details. Q6: What does this mean for the future of corporate Bitcoin adoption? A6: It signals a maturation phase. Companies are moving beyond simply buying Bitcoin to creating sophisticated financial products around it, making crypto assets more palatable for the traditional financial world.

FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.172 Market Cap $280.42M Trading Volume $7.16M Circulating Supply 1.629B FLOW All-time High $46.16 (April 05, 2021) All-time Low $0.157 (Oct 10, 2025) 24-hour High $0.1763 24-hour Low $0.1699 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 10.11% (Very High) 50-Day SMA $0.2344 14-Day RSI 24.96 (Oversold) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 25 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 9/30 (30%) 200-Day SMA $0.3482 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown FLOW is currently bearish on the longer timeframe, trading near $0.172. The oversold RSI suggests a potential bounce, but the trend remains unchanged. Bulls need to reclaim $0.176–$0.18 to shift short-term bias. Flow coin 1-day price analysis As of December 22, FLOW is trading around $0.172, pressing close to the lower Bollinger Band near $0.159, which confirms sustained downside pressure rather than a completed bottom. The coin’s price remains well below the mid-band at $0.199, maintaining a decisively bearish daily structure. FLOWUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The RSI is deeply oversold at around 26, signaling exhaustion risk. However, a reversal has not yet occurred. Similarly, MACD remains negative and flat, showing bearish momentum is slowing but not reversing. If FLOW closes below $0.170, we could see a drop to $0.159. Currently, any recovery to the upside is capped unless FLOW reclaims $0.185–$0.20. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour timeframe, FLOW remains below all Alligator averages, with resistance stacked at $0.174–$0.176. The sharp sell-off, followed by small-bodied candles, shows short-term stabilization, but OBV remains weak, confirming limited accumulation. FLOWUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView A slightly positive CMF suggests mild dip-buying, although not strong enough to alter the trend bias. A reclaim of $0.176 would allow a relief push toward $0.182, while a loss of $0.170 likely resumes the downtrend. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.2573 SELL SMA 5 $0.2216 SELL SMA 10 $0.2050 SELL SMA 21 $0.2112 SELL SMA 50 $0.2344 SELL SMA 100 $0.2819 SELL SMA 200 $0.3482 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.2105 SELL EMA 5 $0.2304 SELL EMA 10 $0.2703 SELL EMA 21 $0.3158 SELL EMA 50 $0.3507 SELL EMA 100 $0.3695 SELL EMA 200 $0.4140 SELL What to expect from Flow? FLOW is oversold but still bearish, with risk skewed toward further downside unless buyers defend $0.17 decisively. Any bounce without reclaiming $0.18 and above remains corrective. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming months. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance.

In a significant move for institutional adoption, Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution Taiko has announced a strategic partnership with Bitcoin-native platform Avalon Labs. Their mission? To construct a robust, compliant, and high-performance foundation specifically for institutional RWA infrastructure . This collaboration aims to dismantle the final barriers preventing large-scale capital from flowing onto decentralized networks. Why is This Partnership a Game-Changer for RWA Infrastructure? Real-world asset tokenization is often hailed as blockchain’s next multi-trillion-dollar frontier. However, institutions have remained cautious, citing concerns over regulatory compliance, technological risk, and settlement speed. The Taiko and Avalon Labs partnership directly addresses these pain points. By merging Taiko’s Ethereum-equivalent Layer 2 architecture with Avalon’s Bitcoin-centric financial expertise, they are creating a specialized institutional RWA infrastructure designed for trust and efficiency. Taiko brings critical technological assurances to the table, which are non-negotiable for institutional players. Its design eliminates centralized sequencer risk—a single point of failure common in other rollups—and guarantees transaction finality in under two seconds. This combination of decentralization and speed is rare. Moreover, operating as a Type 1 zkEVM means it’s fully compatible with Ethereum, allowing institutions to leverage existing tools and smart contracts within a more scalable and secure environment. What Will This New Institutional RWA Infrastructure Actually Do? Avalon Labs plans to deploy a suite of core financial primitives directly on the Taiko network. This isn’t just about creating simple tokenized assets; it’s about building the entire financial ecosystem around them. The planned features include: Institutional-Grade Lending Contracts: Secure, programmable debt markets for tokenized RWAs. Verified Oracle Data Feeds: Reliable, tamper-proof external data for accurate asset pricing and contract execution. Regulatory-Compliant Stablecoin Issuance: Foundations for minting stable digital currencies tied to real-world collateral. This toolkit will allow asset managers, banks, and funds to not only tokenize assets like treasury bonds or real estate but also to engage in complex financial activities like borrowing against them or earning yield—all on-chain. The focus is on creating an institutional RWA infrastructure that meets strict regulatory standards without sacrificing the core benefits of blockchain, such as transparency and auditability. How Does This Address the Core Needs of Institutions? For traditional finance to embrace DeFi protocols, two pillars are essential: reliability and decentralization. Taiko’s architecture provides both. The removal of centralized sequencer risk mitigates a major operational and reputational danger for institutions. Furthermore, sub-two-second finality means settlements are near-instantaneous, resolving a key inefficiency in traditional systems. Avalon Labs’ role is to ensure this powerful technical base is equipped with the right financial plumbing. Their experience in Bitcoin on-chain services brings a deep understanding of secure, value-based systems. Together, they are not just building another platform; they are engineering a regulated gateway. This institutional RWA infrastructure acts as a bridge, allowing traditional capital to flow into the digital asset space with confidence, knowing the framework is built for both performance and compliance. The Future of Finance Built on Shared Strengths The collaboration between an Ethereum Layer 2 leader and a Bitcoin financial services pioneer is symbolic. It highlights that the future of institutional RWA infrastructure may not belong to a single blockchain but to strategic integrations that leverage the unique strengths of multiple ecosystems. Taiko offers a secure, scalable, and familiar Ethereum environment, while Avalon provides the financial service layer needed to manage real-world value. This partnership is a clear signal that the industry is maturing beyond speculation and moving toward utility. The construction of dedicated, institution-first infrastructure marks a pivotal shift. It paves the way for a new era where global liquidity can seamlessly interact with blockchain’s innovation, unlocking unprecedented efficiency and accessibility in finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is RWA infrastructure in crypto? A1: RWA infrastructure refers to the underlying technology, protocols, and services built on blockchain that enable real-world assets like bonds, real estate, or commodities to be represented, traded, and managed as digital tokens. Q2: Why is the Taiko and Avalon partnership important? A2: It combines Taiko’s high-speed, decentralized Ethereum scaling with Avalon’s Bitcoin-native financial expertise to create a secure, compliant platform specifically designed for institutional use, addressing key adoption barriers. Q3: What does ‘eliminating sequencer risk’ mean? A3: Many Layer 2 networks rely on a single central operator (sequencer) to order transactions, creating a failure point. Taiko’s decentralized design removes this risk, enhancing security and censorship resistance for institutions. Q4: What kind of assets could use this new infrastructure? A4: The infrastructure is designed for institutional-grade assets, including government treasuries, commercial debt, real estate funds, and private equity, enabling them to be tokenized and used in on-chain finance. Q5: How fast are transactions on Taiko? A5: Taiko offers transaction finality in under two seconds, which is crucial for institutional financial activities that require rapid and certain settlement. Q6: Is this infrastructure live now? A6: The partnership has been announced, and Avalon Labs is in the planning/development phase to build its suite of services (lending, oracles, stablecoins) on the Taiko network.

The view comes as large banks and asset managers begin product tokenization, a move that once seemed extreme but is now being treated as a practical step by major institutions. Regulatory Signals Push Institutions Forward Based on reports cited by Grossman, progress has accelerated because rules are becoming clearer. Legislative efforts, regulatory guidance, bank involvement and accounting standards are starting to line up. That combination reduces uncertainty, which is often what slows large pools of capital. BlackRock has already launched tokenized funds, while Franklin Templeton is running tokenized money market funds on public blockchains. Those actions suggest that tokenization is no longer confined to pilot labs or internal trials. It is being used with real assets and real clients. Bank of America recently said that banks are heading toward a multi-year, onchain future. A few years ago, that would have sounded radical. Today, it sounds inevitable. 20+ years ago, I began my career in media and saw firsthand what happens when an analog industry collides with… — Keith A. Grossman (@KeithGrossman) December 21, 2025 Tokenization: Big Players Making Their Presence Felt Banks are also taking part. Citi, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase have all been linked to onchain settlement tests, tokenized deposits and near real-time asset transfers. These projects focus on reducing friction in back-end processes that have existed for decades. Settlement that once took days could be shortened to minutes if shared ledgers are used. That change alone alters how risk, liquidity and cost are managed across markets. Grossman framed the moment as similar to earlier shifts in other industries. He pointed to how legacy media struggled when distribution moved online more than 20 years ago. At the time, many firms tried to protect old revenue streams instead of adapting. Some survived by changing early. Others lost influence as new platforms took control. Tokenization: Old Revenue Lines Face Pressure In finance, the pressure point sits in areas such as reconciliation, clearing, settlement and custody. These roles have long supported steady margins, partly because they depend on complex and slow systems. Reports have disclosed that software and shared protocols can now handle much of that work. As a result, some services may become cheaper and less profitable over time. That does not mean banks disappear. According to Grossman’s view, they remain central players, much like they did after ATMs reduced teller roles or when voice-over-internet systems cut long-distance call costs for telecom firms. The institutions stayed, but their shape changed. The same pattern is expected here. Banks may rely more on software, fewer manual steps and new forms of infrastructure control. Tokenization is moving faster than expected, according to MoonPay president Keith Grossman. Banks and asset managers are testing tokenized funds and onchain settlement, signaling that what was once experimental is now becoming practical. The lenders and other big players are among the firms pushing the shift, showing the trend is already under way.

Related Reading: Banks Could Favor A Higher XRP Price, Finance Expert Says According to Jurrien Timmer, a notable pullback is possible next year with key support seen in a range of $65,000 to $75,000. That view sits alongside data points and trader commentary that recall past big drops after sharp peaks. Cycle Warning From Fidelity Timmer said Bitcoin’s price history follows a roughly four-year rhythm tied to halvings. Past peaks have been followed by steep corrections of about 70 to 85%. For example, after a high of $1,137 in 2013 the price slipped to roughly $230, and the 2017 peak near $14,050 later traded down toward $3,415. Prices surged again after 2021, and that pattern of parabolic advance then sharp retreat has been repeated. Some traders say those falls are tests of patience rather than a sign the story is broken. Fidelity Warns: #Bitcoin Cycle Peak May Already Be In Fidelity’s Jurrien Timmer believes the $126K October high was the top for this cycle. Based on $BTC 4-year halving pattern, He expects 2026 to be a down year, with support around $65K–$75K.

Market action often looks like a rapid climb to a peak, a quick drop, and a long period where prices move sideways and gains feel slow. Those sideways stretches are where many long-term holders are rewarded, though it can take years. BTC will hit $250k by year-end 2027. 2026 is too chaotic to predict, though Bitcoin making new all-time highs in 2026 is still possible. Options markets are currently pricing about equal odds of $70k or $130k for month-end June 2026, and equal odds of $50k or $250k by year-end… — Alex Thorn (@intangiblecoins) December 21, 2025 Galaxy Research has flagged overlapping macro and market risks that make forecasting harder for 2026, and options and volatility trends suggest Bitcoin is behaving more like a macro asset than a pure growth gamble. Galaxy Research is still bullish on a multi-year view and projects a path toward $250,000 by the end of 2027. First Quarter Patterns May Matter Related Reading: Before You Sell Bitcoin For Gold, Hear This Warning Based on reports from traders, the first quarter has in past cycles been a period that often supports price stability, although recent years have shown less regularity. Large inflows and treasury buys that could arrive in 2025 might be offset by early-cycle selling from big holders. The balance between institutional demand and whale supply will likely show itself in the first half of 2026, making that stretch important for whether historical four-year rhythms hold firm.

These accounts (some linked to terrorist networks, others showing impossible login behavior or blatant KYC failures) remained active, with one Venezuelan in particular reportedly pushing $93 million through his Binance account, some of which were traced to Iran and Hezbollah. The Binance accounts came from Venezuela, Brazil, Syria, Niger, and China, with users allegedly logging in from Caracas and Osaka within hours, or changing banking details 647 times in just 14 months. “A common automated process at financial institutions is to screen for irregular “pass-through” behaviour, such as when funds deposited into an account are transferred out again within 24 hours in a manner that is potentially suspicious,” said FT. Binance accounts showed alleged suspicious activity The Financial Times claims it investigated 13 different Binance accounts and allegedly found suspicious flows of $1.7 billion in crypto, including $144 million after November 2023, the same day Binance agreed to clean house. One Venezuelan woman, who registered on Binance in 2022, received over $177 million in crypto in under two years, allegedly using 496 different bank accounts to off-ramp funds across the Americas. The 13 accounts received at least $29 million in Tether from wallets later frozen by Israel under anti-terrorism laws. Most of that came from four wallets tied to Tawfiq Al-Law, who was accused of funneling money for Hezbollah, the Houthis, and a Syrian firm connected to the Assad regime. These wallets were seized in May 2023 and sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury in March 2024. In one bizarre case, a man from Brazil registered with a damaged ID card from 20 years ago, where even his date of birth was unreadable. The email on file belonged to a completely different woman. He was later charged for helping a group that smuggled illegal gold. When stopped at the Venezuelan border with $50,000 in cash, he told guards it was to “buy sausages from a Chinese acquaintance.” His Binance account showed he received $16 million, with at least $5 million tied to the Al-Law wallets. Binance documents showed the man’s net worth at $400,000, but he withdrew $4 million in hard currency before going inactive in late 2022. The account, however, stayed open into 2025. Carter-Ruck, Binance’s legal team, said : “Any suggestion that our client has knowingly facilitated bad actors in criminal conduct is also baseless.” They also claimed none of the wallets were marked for terror financing at the time and insisted no alerts were triggered by major blockchain tracking tools. Former CEO Changpeng Zhao , better known as CZ, was pardoned by President Trump in October after being charged with “willfully violating anti-money-laundering laws.” The White House defended the pardon, saying Trump was correcting overreach by the Biden administration in its “war on cryptocurrency.” CZ remains barred from executive roles at Binance, but his longtime business partner He Yi, who shares three children with him, was just named co-CEO this month. The Treasury Department had earlier blasted Binance for failing to report over 100,000 suspicious transactions, tied to crimes including child exploitation, ransomware, drug trafficking, and terrorism. And now, in November, 306 families of October 7 2023 attack victims filed a lawsuit accusing Binance of enabling Hamas and Hezbollah to launder millions through its platform.

56173093,https://cryptonews.com/?p=466586,1766395361,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/56173093.jpeg,Russia’s Central Bank Says Bitcoin Mining Is Strengthening the Ruble,https://cryptonews.com/news/russias-central-bank-says-bitcoin-mining-is-strengthening-the-ruble/,"Russia’s Central Bank has acknowledged that crypto mining contributes to the ruble’s strength, though quantifying its exact impact remains difficult as much of the industry operates in gray areas. Governor Elvira Nabiullina made the statement while responding to questions about the sector’s influence on foreign exchange markets, according to a local report . The acknowledgment comes as senior Kremlin officials push to formally classify mining as an export activity in Russia’s trade accounts, which further shows the sector’s growing importance to the national economy despite regulatory uncertainties. Governor Elvira Nabiullina. | Source: GFMAG Mining Emerges as Informal Export Driver Deputy Chief of Staff Maxim Oreshkin argued at the VTB “Russia Calling!” forum that crypto mining should be treated as an export activity because mined digital assets effectively flow abroad even without crossing physical borders. He described the sector as “ a new export item ” that Russia “ doesn’t value very well ,” citing the underestimation of mining-related financial flows as the reason for incorrect ruble exchange rate forecasts. Industry figures estimate Russia produces tens of thousands of Bitcoins annually, with daily mining revenue reaching approximately 1 billion rubles. The Industrial Mining Association reports Russia ranks second globally for mining, accounting for over 16% of the world’s hashrate in the summer months, though network halving reduced output from roughly 55,000 BTC in 2023 to around 35,000 BTC in 2024. Nabiullina acknowledged mining’s currency market impact but emphasized context, stating that for mining, “ it’s probably difficult to quantify its impact right now, because a significant portion of it is still in the gray zone. But in any case, this mining didn’t emerge this year, meaning the exchange rate appreciation can’t be attributed to the fact that it has risen sharply. “ Gray Market Operations Cost Billions Despite Legalization Russia legalized crypto mining on November 1, 2024 , requiring legal entities and entrepreneurs to register with the Federal Tax Service, while exempting individual miners who consume less than 6,000 kWh per month. Corporate mining is taxed at 25%, while individuals pay progressive rates of 13-22%, with non-residents paying 30%. Despite legalization efforts, illegal and quasi-legal mining continues costing Russia millions annually through stolen electricity and unpaid taxes. Broadcaster Ren TV reported that fear of high taxes and electricity costs is driving many miners underground , with annual budget losses reaching billions of rubles as operators resort to meter manipulation, bribery, and secret agreements with utility workers. Illegal crypto miners in a Russian facility. | Source: Ren TV/Izvestia/Screenshot Recent investigations uncovered widespread theft, including a St. Petersburg operator who bypassed meters since 2018, costing the grid half a billion rubles, and a Dagestan farm hidden in coolant tanks. A power supply employee described the scale of the illegal operation, saying: “ The illegal crypto mining farm was using more power than an entire five-story building. ” Police arrested an employee of Omsk Thermal Power Plant who accepted 500,000 rubles in bribes to facilitate grid theft. Banks Enter Digital Assets While Payments Remain Banned Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender, is testing decentralized finance tools and offering regulated crypto-linked investments totaling 1.5 billion rubles in structured bonds and digital financial assets tied to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and broader crypto portfolios. Deputy Chairman Anatoly Popov confirmed active dialogue with the Bank of Russia and Rosfinmonitoring on integrating crypto services within regulated frameworks while building proprietary blockchain infrastructure. Despite the growth across verticals, State Duma Committee Chairman Anatoly Aksakov recently reaffirmed the country’s strict payment bans , declaring at a TASS press conference: “ We must understand that cryptocurrencies will never become money within our country. ” Russian lawmaker Anatoly Aksakov said that payments in Russia must only be conducted in rubles, dismissing crypto becoming legal tender. #RussiaCrypto #CryptoPayments #CryptoRegulation https://t.co/BLk0c4qHcQ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 17, 2025 “ They can only be used as an investment instrument. If payment is required, it will only be in rubles ,” he added. Central Bank Governor Nabiullina has repeatedly called for bans on crypto exchanges and token trading , despite Russia recording $376.3 billion in incoming transactions between July 2024 and June 2025. First Deputy Chairman Vladimir Chistyukhin emphasized the urgency of regulatory action, stating that laws governing cryptocurrency transactions “ must be passed as quickly as possible. “ However, the bank also supports tokenization solutions to grant foreign buyers access to Russian company shares as a potential sanctions workaround.

While money is moving towards undervalued projects that continue to build strong communities and possession of obvious utility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of those cryptos that is drawing new attention for demonstrating those same early signs of momentum prior to public and widespread understanding. Currently up for grabs with the low cost of only $0.035, MUTM has already been touted as the best cheap cryptocurrency to buy and for obvious reasons – presenting early investors with considerable entry without necessarily waiting for the onset of more qualitative characteristics and attributes that are absolutely novel and innovative within the market. As the presale of Mutuum Finance continues to move with great momentum, already breaking through the 98% in phase 6 with almost $20 million and more than 18,550 individual account holders on board, it’s quickly proving that it aims to be among the top cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin Price Analysis Dogecoin is currently testing the crucial levels of resistance after the recent bounce at the low of $0.11993, now at $0.13182, close to the crucial level of $0.131 to $0.138. As far as chart analysis is concerned, it could very well be the point where the price stagnates, with a possible rejection leading to a dip to lower levels, whereas a clean breakout at $0.13837 will be an indication to turn the tables and look ahead to a possible positive move. Even as traders are keen on analyzing this crucial level, their attention is slowly shifting to those still in the development phase with an active level of functionality and positive adoption rates, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly making a name for itself as one of the top cryptos. The price of tokens in Phase 6 of the presale stands at $0.035, marking the last chance for those who wish to invest at a cost-friendly price before the next phase, Phase 7, begins at $0.04. In a move to promote easy access to investment, Mutuum Finance is allowing credit/debit card purchases. Its two-tier lending platform has received widespread acclaim for being highly scalable and efficient. With its ability to connect lenders to borrowers through optimized liquidity pools, the MUTM platform makes it possible for users to generate highly attractive returns while also optimizing capital use. With more than 18,550 users contributing over $19.5 million, the presale shows robust market adoption. Secure and Scalable Platform Major milestones in the current development phase include: Finalizing Smart Contracts for seamless functioning of the protocol. Performing extensive testing and quality assurance to ensure system reliability. Building front-end and back-end portions of its decentralized application (DApp). Incorporating the latest risk management solutions in order to ensure the stability and security of the platform. The next phase will see the beta launch on the Sepolia Testnet . All this sets the stage for the deployment on the Mainnet. It is quite clear that MUTM is focused on the creation of a secure and efficient DeFi platform that has the ability to accommodate growth. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is over 98% sold out in Phase 6, priced at $0.035, and has 18,550+ individual holders who have cumulatively raised close to $19.5M. Phase 7 will see the pricing moved up to $0.04, marking one of the last chances for early bird investment. The sale of Mutuum Finance offers a great blend of real DeFi usage and potential gains due to its two-tier lending system, interest-bearing tokens, and the upcoming V1 Sepolia Testnet, making it the best cheap cryptocurrency to buy for investors seeking tangible growth in 2026.

The 1-year rate sets the tone for new loans, while the 5-year anchors mortgage pricing. This comes as China’s economy shows more bruises, especially across retail, housing, and industry. November’s data came in weaker than markets expected, as retail sales rose just 1.3% year-on-year, falling well short of the 2.8% growth economists had called. That’s also a drop from October’s 2.9%, which already wasn’t strong. Industrial production climbed 4.8%, missing the 5.0% projection. That’s the lowest growth since August 2024. China’s housing crash deepens as property prices fall Real estate is still a mess. Fixed asset investment, which includes infrastructure and property, dropped 2.6% between January and November compared to last year. That’s a sharper fall than the 2.3% economists expected. The pain’s widespread. New home prices in Beijing , Guangzhou, and Shenzhen slipped 1.2% in November. Meanwhile, resale home prices plunged 5.8% from the year before. No part of the housing market is holding up. At Cornell University, professor Eswar Prasad said that “some stimulus will help,” but warned that “monetary policy probably won’t get that much traction” with the private sector still fragile. He added, “With growth momentum weakening, they’re going to have to turn on the stimulus taps, some monetary stimulus, perhaps, and ideally a little more fiscal stimulus, but that really needs to be packaged with some broader reforms.” China’s finance ministry isn’t ignoring that. Earlier in December, they said they plan to issue ultra-long-term special government bonds in 2025 to support key infrastructure projects. Officials also promised to push forward actions to lift consumer spending, trying to stop deflation from setting in deeper. But even with that, investors aren’t getting excited. Yuan stays soft despite temporary trade relief with Washington The recent trade arrangement with Washington is giving China a short breather. Tariffs on Chinese exports have been suspended, which could support export growth in 2025. The country still hopes to hit its “around 5%” growth goal, but nothing is guaranteed. Domestic demand is still weak. On the currency front, the yuan isn’t showing much strength. The onshore rate stayed flat at 7.04 per dollar on Monday. The offshore yuan weakened. Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics, said the yuan might push below 7.00 briefly over the next six months, but he doubts it’ll stay there. “I’d be surprised if it was below seven for a sustained period. That would be viewed probably as a challenge and risk in China.” He now sees the yuan ending 2026 around 7.03, slightly firmer than his earlier 7.05 call from November. Schenker’s not buying into the bullish outlook some banks are pushing. Goldman Sachs, for example, thinks the yuan could go as high as 6.85 in twelve months. But that view clashes with recent calls from inside China, where some former central bank officials and economists are arguing for a stronger yuan. Their pitch? It could help rebalance the economy and reduce trade pressure.

In this context, crypto commentator Pumpius responded to circulating claims that he had disposed of a significant XRP position shortly before the launch of XRP-related ETFs . The claims suggested that more than six million units had been sold, raising questions about confidence and timing. Pumpius rejected the framing of these rumors and instead outlined a different explanation centered on long-term planning rather than liquidation. According to Pumpius, the core issue was not whether XRP had been abandoned, but how a substantial holding was reorganized. He emphasized that his main XRP position still exists and that the changes made were structural rather than transactional. By avoiding direct engagement with speculation, he positioned his response as a clarification of intent rather than a rebuttal of every allegation. DID I REALLY DUMP OVER 6,000,000 XRP RIGHT BEFORE THE ETF LAUNCH?! There are rumors flying that I dumped my main XRP bag of over 6.2 million XRP right before the ETFs went live. I am not going to dive into the noise. I will only say this. My primary XRP position has been… — Pumpius (@pumpius) December 20, 2025 Focus on Structural Reorganization Rather Than Sales Pumpius explained that his primary XRP holdings were restructured to meet several objectives associated with asset protection and longevity. He pointed to considerations such as tax efficiency, enhanced security against hacks and scams, and estate planning measures that ensure beneficiaries are automatically covered if unforeseen circumstances arise. While he acknowledged that such restructuring could involve a range of legal or custodial mechanisms, he deliberately avoided confirming specific methods. He made clear that no disclosure would be offered regarding whether the XRP was converted into ETF units, placed under an LLC or trust, transferred between wallets, or subjected to alternative custody arrangements. The emphasis remained on the principle that ownership had not been abandoned. In his words, XRP was not sold in the conventional sense implied by the rumors, but prepared in anticipation of a changing market environment. Ongoing Exposure and Strategic Flexibility Beyond the primary holding, Pumpius noted that he continues to maintain additional XRP positions designed for flexibility. These smaller allocations are intended for deployment into projects built on the XRP Ledger, early-stage opportunities, and other high-upside strategies as they appear. This distinction between long-term structured holdings and active capital reflects an approach he associates with experienced participants rather than passive holders. He framed this behavior as a natural evolution as markets mature and institutional participation increases. In his view, sophisticated capital begins to prioritize legal, tax, and custody structures over simple wallet-based storage when regulatory clarity and financial products expand.

The comment emphasized the importance of disciplined asset management, arguing that early positioning carries responsibility to manage holdings in a way that maximizes long-term outcomes rather than reacting impulsively to market noise. Overall, Pumpius presented his actions as deliberate preparation rather than exit, underscoring continued confidence in XRP while signaling an approach aligned with institutional-style asset management.

56174443,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=882478,1766397006,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/56174443.jpeg,Baidu partners with Uber and Lyft to roll out robotaxis in Britain by 2026,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/baidu-teams-uber-lyft-robotaxi-britains/,"Baidu is bringing driverless taxis to London starting next year. The company will work with Lyft and Uber to put its Apollo Go self-driving cars on the capital’s streets. The companies made the announcements on social media. Lyft plans to start testing several dozen autonomous vehicles in 2026, pending government approval. David Risher, Lyft’s chief executive, posted on X this Monday that they want to “scale to hundreds from there.” Uber said its first trial should start in the first half of 2026. The company said it’s excited about helping Britain lead in transportation and giving Londoners another safe travel option next year. Baidu now operates in 22 cities and handles more than 250,000 trips weekly, according to the company. It’s racing against Chinese competitors like WeRide and Western giants including Alphabet’s Waymo. Britain has become attractive to driverless car companies after the government decided in June to speed up approval for autonomous vehicles on public roads. Officials want to allow robotaxi pilot programs starting spring 2026. Baidu looks to be among the first operators. London has a “Vision Zero” goal to wipe out all serious injuries and deaths in its transportation system by 2041. Self-driving technology is expected to play a big part. Waymo also eyes London market As reported by Cryptopolitan previously, Waymo is also preparing to test in London , aiming for full service in 2026. The company currently operates or plans to launch in 26 markets, including Tokyo and New York City. Baidu has been pushing hard into international markets, with testing underway in the United Arab Emirates and Switzerland. Ten years ago, robotaxis seemed like science fiction. This year they became a regular transportation choice in big U.S. cities and parts of Asia. Waymo kept expanding and dominates the American robotaxi market. Tesla and Amazon’s Zoox both launched their first services in 2025. Baidu’s Apollo Go leads in China. Some parents now send teens to school in Waymos. Women often mention they like the privacy compared to rides with strangers who drive for traditional taxi and ride-hailing services. Waymo has done well enough that Tesla CEO Elon Musk acknowledged his rival’s success after criticizing the Google-affiliated company before. At Tesla’s shareholder meeting on November 6, Musk thanked Waymo for “paving the path here” on regulatory approvals that let robotaxis operate across much of the U.S. Public fear persists despite safety record Driverless transportation has a long way to go before going mainstream. According to an early 2025 American Automobile Association survey , 66% of U.S. drivers said they fear autonomous vehicles and 25% were uncertain. The skepticism hasn’t changed much from what AAA found in 2024. There have been lots of complaints about noise, congestion and sometimes erratic driving from robotaxis. Transportation workers worry about economic impacts. Still, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says documented harmful collisions caused by autonomous vehicles have been relatively few so far. Robotaxi fares currently run higher than alternatives, according to Obi, which tracks ride-hail pricing and compared Waymo to human-driven Uber and Lyft rides. Both safety records and costs could change as fleets grow from hundreds to thousands of vehicles. With 2026 just around the corner, the robotaxi market stands at an important point.

Dubbed “Stealka,” the new infostealer can “hijack accounts, steal cryptocurrency, and install a crypto miner on their victims’ devices,” Kaspersky warned in a recent blog post . “Most frequently, this infostealer disguises itself as game cracks, cheats and mods,” it added. For those unaware, infostealers are a category of malware that allows bad actors to extract confidential information from a victim’s device and send it to a remote server. In the past, crypto users have been consistently targeted using this attack vector, often through a variety of disguised applications, websites, and installer packages. How does Stealka target crypto users? According to the cybersecurity firm, cybercriminals are distributing Stealka across legitimate platforms like GitHub, SourceForge, and Google Sites, where they are uploaded as cracked software and mods for popular games and applications. Since these platforms have a reputation for trustworthiness and host a large open-source and gaming community, it give the attackers a convenient way to reach a broad number of unsuspecting users. The malware activates once a user downloads the malicious file and runs it on their system. Kaspersky estimates that the campaign has been active since at least November 2025, and instances of the malware have been found imitating various popular apps and games. See below. A pirated version of Microsoft Visio containing the stealer is hosted on GitHub. Source: Kaspersky. “Sometimes, however, attackers go a step further (and possibly use AI tools) to create entire fake websites that look quite professional. Without the help of a robust antivirus, the average user is unlikely to realize anything is amiss,” Kaspersky added. However, it noted that some of these fake sites may have subtle signs, such as mismatched product names or odd descriptions in the form of exaggerated claims that don’t match the actual software being offered. In some instances, these malicious websites also pretend to scan files using logos of antivirus vendors to assure users that the downloads are safe, but in reality, it’s just a cheap tactic to trick them into lowering their guard. A false antivirus scanning interface employed by bad actors. Source: Kaspersky. “Of course, no such scanning actually takes place; the attackers are merely trying to create an illusion of trustworthiness,” Kaspersky said. Once installed, Stealka targets data from browsers developed on Chromium and Gecko engines, two of the most widely used platforms that form the foundation for many popular browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Yandex Browser, Edge, Brave, among others. From there on, it can steal autofill data such as sign-in credentials, saved addresses, and payment card details. Kaspersky also found that the malware can target the settings and databases of 115 browser extensions for crypto wallets, including Binance, Coinbase, Crypto.com, SafePal, Trust Wallet, MetaMask, and others, alongside two-factor authentication services like Authy and Google Authenticator. Notably, at least 80 wallet applications may be at risk, as wallet configuration data contains sensitive details like private keys, seed-phrase data, wallet file paths, and encryption parameters, Kaspersky said. How to keep your crypto assets safe To prevent Stealka and similar malware from compromising user data, Kaspersky advises using reliable antivirus software and urges users to avoid pirated software and unofficial game mods. As an added safety measure, Kaspersky urges users to avoid storing sensitive information in browsers. The attack vectors used by infostealers to target crypto users are constantly evolving , which makes threats like these especially concerning. For instance, last month, cybersecurity research team SpiderLabs uncovered a major campaign that promoted the Eternidade Stealer using complex social engineering tactics to deploy malware across WhatsApp. Back in September, ModStealer, another stealthy infostealer, was found to be targeting cryptocurrency wallets across Windows, Linux, and macOS while evading major antivirus engines.

56174595,https://timestabloid.com/?p=92959,1766397646,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Dogecoin (DOGE) Loses Momentum as Seasoned Investors Flock Into This Top Crypto,https://timestabloid.com/dogecoin-doge-loses-momentum-as-seasoned-investors-flock/,"Dogecoin’s recent rally is showing clear signs of fatigue as market data points to weakening investor confidence and growing bearish pressure. The meme coin has slipped back toward the $0.12 level after a fresh wave of selling, even as the broader crypto market remains highly sensitive to macroeconomic signals. On-chain and derivatives indicators suggest that large holders are reducing exposure, prompting seasoned investors to reassess what crypto to buy now. As momentum fades for DOGE, attention is increasingly shifting toward a fast-growing defi crypto in presale, with Mutuum Finance emerging as a top crypto narrative for 2025 as its Phase 6 allocation nears full capacity. Dogecoin Weakens As Bearish Signals Multiply Dogecoin is currently trading at a loss after falling nearly 3% over the past 24 hours, underperforming amid anticipation of US CPI data and broader risk-off sentiment. On-chain data shows that wallets holding between 100 million and 1 billion DOGE have reduced their combined holdings from 36.14 billion to 34.77 billion since early December, confirming distribution by large investors. At the same time, the percentage of DOGE supply in profit has declined from 53.95% to 50.70%, signaling softening demand. Derivatives markets further reinforce the bearish outlook. Short positions now account for more than 54% of DOGE futures activity, indicating that traders are positioning for downside continuation. Technically, DOGE remains trapped in a falling channel, trading well below its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages, a structure that confirms a longer-term bearish trend. Analysts warn that if current levels fail to hold, Dogecoin could revisit the $0.074 support zone, where over 28 billion tokens last changed hands. This loss of momentum is driving experienced investors to explore alternative opportunities when evaluating the best crypto to buy now. Presale Momentum Draws Capital Toward Mutuum Finance As confidence wanes around Dogecoin, Mutuum Finance is capturing attention as a new crypto coin still priced at $0.035. The project is currently in Presale Phase 6, which is now 99% filled, underscoring rapidly accelerating demand. Since the presale began, Mutuum Finance has raised $19,500,000 and attracted 18550 holders, highlighting broad participation at this stage. The current price in phase 6 stands at $0.035, representing a 250% increase from the $0.01 phase one entry. Phase 6 is selling out fast, meaning the opportunity to secure MUTM at this price is quickly disappearing. Once Phase 7 opens, the token price will rise nearly 20% to $0.04, while the confirmed launch price is set at $0.06. Based on current positioning, early buyers are targeting a projected 450% upside after launch, making MUTM a compelling answer to what crypto to invest in as capital rotates toward presale scarcity. For investors focused on identifying the best crypto to buy now, this narrowing entry window is becoming a decisive factor. V1 Protocol Roadmap Strengthens Long-Term Conviction Beyond presale dynamics, Mutuum Finance is differentiating itself through a clearly defined development roadmap. The team has confirmed that the V1 protocol will debut on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025 , marking the project’s first operational milestone. The initial release will include a Liquidity Pool, mtToken, Debt Token, and an automated Liquidator Bot, with ETH and USDT serving as the first supported assets for lending, borrowing, and collateral functions. This structured rollout is designed to validate the protocol’s mechanics before broader expansion, reinforcing MUTM’s positioning as a defi crypto built for sustainable usage rather than short-term speculation. For seasoned investors stepping away from momentum-driven assets like DOGE, this focus on execution is a key reason Mutuum Finance is increasingly viewed as a top crypto for longer-term exposure. Leaderboard Incentives Fuel Active Participation Adding to engagement, Mutuum Finance recently launched a live dashboard featuring a leaderboard of the top 50 holders. A notable feature is the 24-Hour Leaderboard, which resets daily at 00:00 UTC and rewards the number one ranked user with a $500 MUTM bonus, provided at least one transaction is completed within the 24-hour window. This incentive structure encourages consistent on-platform activity and strengthens community participation during the presale phase. With Dogecoin’s rally losing momentum and technical risks pointing toward deeper downside, seasoned investors are increasingly reallocating toward early-stage opportunities with clearer growth catalysts. As Presale Phase 6 of Mutuum Finance nears a complete sellout, the chance to enter at $0.035 is rapidly closing, positioning MUTM as the best crypto to buy now for those looking ahead to 2025.

The market structure shows no indication of a bullish shift. SHIB trades below all major moving averages, signaling ongoing weakness in price action. SHIB is trading at around $0.000007260 at press time, indicating a 2.37% decline in the last 24 hours. SHIB price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap The 200-day moving average sits far above current levels. This key technical indicator serves as a distant ceiling rather than an achievable target. Multiple attempts to break higher have failed over recent months. The latest upward movement appears no different from previous rejected rallies. Price action reveals sellers maintain firm control. SHIB cannot overcome even short-term resistance levels. Each bounce meets fresh selling pressure. The pattern of lower highs and lower lows remains intact. This technical structure confirms the bearish trend continues without interruption. Weak Volume Signals Absence of Genuine Demand The recent green candle lacks substance. Buyers did not step in aggressively to push prices higher. Instead, sellers temporarily stepped aside. This created a temporary vacuum that allowed prices to drift upward without meaningful support. Source: TradingView Trading volume tells the real story. Activity levels did not increase significantly during the bounce. No surge in demand appeared. Accumulation patterns remain absent from the charts. The price movement represents low-liquidity drift rather than genuine buying interest. This distinction matters significantly for traders and investors. True reversals occur when demand overwhelms available supply. Current conditions show supply merely pausing. Sellers return as soon as prices approach resistance zones. The lack of sustained buying pressure prevents any meaningful recovery. Technical Indicators Confirm Bearish Momentum The Relative Strength Index remains weak and flat. RSI cannot generate sustained upward momentum. This indicator reflects market indecision and a lack of bullish conviction. No structural pressure exists that might force short sellers to cover positions. The technical setup lacks all components necessary for a bull market. Genuine bull runs require higher highs and restored support levels. Rising volume must accompany upward price movement. SHIB exhibits none of these characteristics. The asset remains stuck in a gradual decline that erodes previous gains. Years of narrative-driven optimism face erosion. The meme coin phenomenon that drove earlier rallies appears exhausted. Without fundamental changes to market dynamics, the most probable scenario is further downside.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-22 10:05:30

My preference for IBIT among Bitcoin ETFs is driven by its status as the ""gold standard"" for spot cryptocurrency funds, offering superior liquidity and institutional-grade management. This analysis provides a technical breakdown of Bitcoin to identify the specific ""zone of interest"" for future accumulation. Current risk factors necessitate a patient approach, as I await additional confirmation signals before upgrading my recommendation back to a ""Buy."" Investment Thesis The purpose of this article is to evaluate the prospects for investing in iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), considering the current situation in the cryptocurrency market and the emergence of technical factors signaling the potential formation of a global downward trend for Bitcoin. I was wrong to buy early because the price broke through some key support levels, like the lower limit of the global uptrend channel. As a result, now we're seeing a consolidation phase and a potential bearish trend forming. Nevertheless, my overall view on Bitcoin and the ETF that tracks it remains bullish. Given the uncertainty surrounding both the fundamentals and the technical picture for cryptocurrencies at the end of 2025, my recommendation for IBIT has been temporarily downgraded from «Buy» to «Hold.» That said, what I find interesting is buying Bitcoin from the key support zone ($74,400–$78,200). As soon as the price consolidates in this area, you can be sure that I will open a buy position on IBIT. Until that happens, however, I recommend holding. Another situation that could trigger a change in rating to «Buy» is if prices recover above $98,240. Once they stabilize above this level, this will demonstrate to us a potential reversal of the downtrend to an uptrend in the medium term. My previous thesis and main arguments My previous article's main thesis was that Bitcoin prices would recover after the downward correction phase ended. Among the additional factors contributing to the resumption of cryptocurrency growth should be the inflow of funds from institutional investors as a result of improvements in the regulatory framework for the industry, as well as the reduction in the Fed's interest rate, increasing investor appetite for risky assets. The technical picture of Bitcoin charts, though, hasn't shown any signs of an uptrend coming back since prices broke through the key support level of $98,240, staying below it and signaling that the market is still feeling bearish. Overview of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF and catalysts for its growth IBIT is the «gold standard» in the world of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds. This is the largest ETF managed by BlackRock. With $68.35 billion in assets under management, this is the most liquid Bitcoin fund and a clear leader in its field. Given its low commission of 0.25%, this is a profitable way to invest in spot Bitcoin. This is the same commission as its direct competitor, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF ( FBTC ), and lower than another competitor, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) (1.5%). IBIT works by owning physical Bitcoin, meaning that each ETF share is backed by a certain number of tokens stored in a custodial wallet. The main operator for this is Coinbase Custody, where cold storage technology is used to protect assets. An advantage of investing in IBIT for investors is that they can buy essentially the same Bitcoin without having to go through a laborious procedure (starting with registering a crypto wallet or cryptocurrency account on an exchange, ending with storing private keys and withdrawing funds after selling cryptocurrency through operators or exchanges). IBIT's main growth driver, specifically its AUM, has been the inflow of capital from institutional investors, whose numbers among holders of this asset are growing. This can be explained by improvements in the regulatory framework governing the crypto industry and the digital currency market. Over the past 12 months, the IBIT has received investments from 1,511 institutional investors . Meanwhile, it has been removed from the portfolios of 368 institutional investors. The net inflow of large clients was 1,143 institutional investors. This amounted to an inflow of $11.1 billion in monetary terms. Most of the capital inflow occurred in Q4 2024, with institutional investors investing $5.75 billion. For Q3 2025, the inflow amounted to $1.5 billion, and the outflow amounted to $514 million. IBIT Institutional Buying and Selling by Quarter But if we look at the flow of money in and out for all types of investors (both institutional and individuals), it's been negative over the last three months. For example, in the last month, total client outflows amounted to $1.16 billion . On December 17, the figure was $210.68 million. Starting from the last week of October, outflows have been frequent, negatively affecting AUM. Given the decline in the value of Bitcoin and the outflow of investors since my last article on IBIT, it has fallen from $80.28 billion to $68.35 billion (-14.86%). The only five-day period when investment inflows exceeded outflows was in the second week of December. I believe this trend is due to two factors. Firstly, the fall in the price of Bitcoin has increased investor fear, reducing their willingness to invest in cryptocurrencies. Secondly, it is due to the outflow of technology sector stocks, as a result of which many investors are fixing other positions, for example, in Bitcoin ETFs, to maintain the margin requirements of their accounts. IBIT Fund Flows Charts Technical analysis of Bitcoin and its impact on IBIT Due to the fact that IBIT is an ETF with Bitcoin as its underlying asset and its portfolio consists of 100% of this asset, there is a full correlation between IBIT price and the BTC-USD pair. Therefore, to assess the investment attractiveness of the fund under review, attention must be paid to the technical picture of the Bitcoin chart. For this purpose, let us first determine the global trend by analyzing the 1W time frame, then look at the 1D time frame, allowing us to assess the medium-term outlook for IBIT. Bitcoin Technical Analysis on the 1W Timeframe. Source: TradingView The weekly chart shows an upward trend channel that formed earlier. It's been a bullish trend since November 2022, though it's losing steam now that the price has broken through its lower boundary. An additional support was provided by the horizontal line at $98,240, but it could not hold under pressure from sellers. The breakdown not only indicates a strengthening of bearish sentiment in the market but it also signals the potential formation of a global downtrend. The longer the price remains below the support level, the less relevant the previous upward trend channel becomes. But for a bearish trend to fully form in the long term, it's necessary for the price to break through the key support zone ($74,400–$78,200). Until this price zone remains relevant and unbroken, a further decline in Bitcoin will be difficult. Bitcoin Technical Analysis on the 1D Timeframe. Source: TradingView The daily chart shows Bitcoin in a medium-term downtrend, and this remains relevant as the price is still within the trend channel. The trend began at the historical high. Following a breakout of the $98,240 support level, the price is moving towards the previously indicated support zone ($74,400–$78,200). Since November 21, 2025, the price has been trading within a short-term sideways range. Due to this, an additional support zone has formed ($80,500–$83,800). In conclusion, to continue the downward trend, the sellers need to overcome two different support zones at once: one on the daily chart and the other on the weekly chart. Given this, I believe that the price support zone ($74,400–$78,200) is somewhat protected. That means if the price falls to this level, it is less likely to break below it. Consequently, I consider this support level to be a potential area of interest for opening positions on Bitcoin and IBIT. When it is reached, I will change my rating from «Hold» to «Buy». Risks of the investment thesis In assessing the risks of an investment idea, it is important to consider the factors that will keep the price of Bitcoin under pressure from sellers. When analyzing technical factors, I believe that the key risk is a potential breakout of the support zone ($74,400–$78,200). If this happens, a global bearish trend is likely to form, in which case the only recommendation would be to «Sell.» In addition, we should continue to monitor developments surrounding Strategy Inc. ( MSTR ). The company's activities were one of the reasons for Bitcoin's rise to historic highs. But the financial policy of placing convertible bonds to buy cryptocurrency is becoming a powder keg, and an explosion could lead to a record price crash. As of March 2025, its debt is $8.22 billion . Strategy (MicroStrategy) - Total debt on balance sheet (from 1998 to 2025) This scenario is risky for IBIT because if Bitcoin's price drops a lot, MSTR's shares will stay under pressure. Also, its net asset value will go down proportionally, so paying off its debts could lead to financial losses. In order to compensate for this, the same MSTR will need to sell its Bitcoin reserves. And this, again, will provoke an additional wave of cryptocurrency sell-offs. The mere mention of possible sales of Bitcoin from MicroStrategy's reserves leads to increased market volatility. If this turns out to be more than just rumors and speculation but actual practice, the potential impact of this negative event cannot be underestimated. Then the price of Bitcoin could fall even further, resulting in IBIT's profitability proportionally falling into the loss zone. Conclusion Based on the results of my fundamental and technical analysis, my recommendation is to hold IBIT shares and spot Bitcoin assets. This recommendation is based solely on the fact that the risks of a decline in cryptocurrency prices remain, with the potential zone of interest for opening purchases located below. Therefore, my recommendation to «Hold» is, in a way, an expression of a deferred position (Buy Limit) on IBIT as soon as the spot price of Bitcoin reaches the support price zone ($74,400–$78,200).",MSTR|BTC-USD|IBIT|IBIT:CA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-22 10:06:20

This acquisition directly targets the growing demand for comprehensive digital asset services among registered investment advisors (RIAs). The deal signals a major consolidation aimed at bridging the gap between secure custody and accessible investment platforms. Why is This Merger a Game-Changer for Digital Asset Services? The core of this acquisition lies in integration. Anchorage Digital brings its battle-tested, institutional-grade custody infrastructure to the table. Securitize for Advisors contributes a specialized platform that RIAs already use to navigate tokenized securities and digital assets. By combining these forces, the new entity aims to create a seamless, one-stop suite of digital asset services . This eliminates the friction advisors often face when trying to offer crypto exposure to clients through fragmented providers. What Does This Mean for Registered Investment Advisors?

The two-day event brought together policymakers, asset managers and technology leaders to discuss global investment trends, digital assets, artificial intelligence and the future architecture of financial markets. Wang spoke as a panelist during the Grand Forum Day session titled “The Future Stack of Digital Finance: Investments, Transactions, Custody, and the New Market Architecture,” which examined how institutional-grade infrastructure is influencing the evolution of digital finance. Moderated by David Gevorkian, managing director of TWO23 Group, the panel featured senior executives from major digital asset platforms, including Kevin Lee, chief business officer at Gate; Yana Minaylova, head of institutional sales and business development for MENA at Binance; and Jessica Wu, head of APAC at Bitpanda Technology Solutions. Custody, Risk and Capital Efficiency During the discussion, Wang emphasized that institutional conversations around custody are fundamentally driven by risk management and operational considerations. “When institutions talk about custody, the discussion usually starts with security – transparency, control of assets and risk reduction,” Wang said.”But custody is not the objective in itself. The underlying question is how clients can trade more efficiently while managing risk.” She noted that as custodian and off-exchange settlement models become more common, market participants are increasingly focused on capital usage. “As custody structures are introduced, whether through multi-party arrangements or off-exchange solutions, the immediate challenge for the industry is capital efficiency,” Wang said. “The priority is to improve capital efficiency, on top of enhanced security and reduced counterparty risk to exchanges.” Regulatory Clarity in the UAE Wang also highlighted the role of regulatory clarity in enabling institutional participation, pointing to the United Arab Emirates as a key example. “Bybit established its headquarters in the UAE some time ago, and we’ve seen regulations in the region become progressively clearer,” she said. “That clarity and certainty are critical for technology innovation and for building confidence among global institutions.” She added that clearer frameworks have helped foster constructive dialogue between regulators, market participants and technology providers, supporting long-term market development. Tokenized Real-World Assets Addressing the growing interest in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), Wang noted that Bybit has supported access to regulated RWA products through collaborations with established financial institutions. “We’ve launched tokenized products in collaboration with Qatar National Bank and UBS that provide exposure to underlying money-market instruments,” Wang said. “These structures allow clients to access traditional returns within a digital asset framework, while benefiting from liquidity and trading functionality.” She cautioned, however, that the broader RWA landscape remains uneven. “The market today includes a wide range of structures and standards,” Wang said. “Our focus is on products that are well-structured, subject to appropriate oversight and designed to be tradable, so they can support liquidity in secondary markets.” Institutional Engagement Beyond Asset Exposure Wang concluded by encouraging institutions to take a broader view of how they engage with digital assets. “We’d like institutions to look beyond digital assets solely as an asset class and consider them as part of a broader blockchain infrastructure,” she said. “Participation can take many forms — from liquidity provision to agency trading or technology collaboration — depending on an institution’s business model and risk framework.” #Bybit / #TheCryptoArk / #IMakeIt About Bybit Bybit is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serving a global community of over 80 million users.

The South Korean crypto exchange giant has just announced a planned, temporary suspension of all SEI deposits and withdrawals. This proactive move is to ensure a smooth and secure transition for the Sei Network’s upcoming upgrade. If you use Bithumb for your SEI transactions, here is everything you need to know to navigate this brief pause confidently. Why Are SEI Deposits and Withdrawals Being Suspended? Bithumb is temporarily halting SEI deposits and withdrawals to provide direct support for the Sei Network’s mainnet transition. This is a standard and responsible practice among major exchanges when a blockchain undergoes a significant upgrade or hard fork. The suspension acts as a safety measure, preventing any potential loss of funds or transaction errors that could occur if the network was active during the changeover. The suspension window is precise. It begins at 3:00 a.m. UTC on December 23rd. During this time, you will be unable to move SEI tokens into or out of your Bithumb wallet. However, it’s crucial to understand what you can still do. What Can and Can’t You Do During the Suspension? Clarity is key during any service change. Let’s break down the exact impact of this temporary halt on your SEI holdings. Paused: All inbound and outbound transfers of SEI tokens. You cannot deposit SEI from an external wallet, nor can you withdraw SEI to one. Unaffected: Trading of SEI against other cryptocurrencies (like KRW, BTC, or ETH) on Bithumb’s spot trading platform. You can still buy, sell, and hold SEI within your exchange account. Unaffected: The security of your existing SEI balance stored on Bithumb. Your assets remain safe. Therefore, if you planned to trade SEI on the exchange itself, your activities are uninterrupted. This suspension only affects the movement of tokens across the blockchain network itself. How Should SEI Holders Prepare for This Change? A little preparation goes a long way in the crypto world. To ensure you face no inconvenience, consider these simple, actionable steps. Complete Planned Transfers Early: If you need to move SEI to or from Bithumb, complete those transactions well before the 3:00 a.m. UTC deadline on December 23rd. Monitor Official Channels: Follow Bithumb’s official announcements for the exact time when SEI deposits and withdrawals will be reinstated. The exchange will notify users once the network upgrade is stable and secure. Understand the Purpose: Recognize that this is a routine operational procedure for network support, not a reaction to any problem. Such suspensions are common and reflect the exchange’s commitment to asset safety. By taking these steps, you transform a potential hassle into a non-event, allowing the technical teams to work without causing user-side issues. What Does This Mean for the Future of SEI? This temporary pause is ultimately a sign of growth, not stagnation. Network upgrades typically aim to enhance scalability, security, or functionality. A successful transition supported by a major exchange like Bithumb can lead to a more robust and efficient Sei Network. This, in turn, can positively influence the ecosystem’s long-term development and potentially its adoption. While short-term service halts can cause minor friction, they are often the necessary groundwork for improved performance and future innovation. Conclusion: A Brief Pause for Long-Term Gain Bithumb’s decision to temporarily suspend SEI deposits and withdrawals is a standard, safety-first protocol for a significant network event. While it creates a short window where external token movement is paused, all internal trading functions remain active. For users, the path forward is simple: plan any necessary transfers ahead of time and watch for the official resumption notice. This coordinated effort between the exchange and the network developers is a cornerstone of a secure and evolving blockchain ecosystem, ensuring your SEI assets are managed responsibly through periods of upgrade and change. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still trade SEI on Bithumb during the suspension? A1: Yes. The suspension only affects depositing to and withdrawing from the exchange. Buying and selling SEI on Bithumb’s trading platform will continue as normal. Q2: How long will the SEI deposits and withdrawals be suspended? A2: Bithumb has not announced a specific end time. The suspension begins at 3:00 a.m. UTC on Dec. 23 and will last until the Sei Network upgrade is deemed stable. Users must monitor Bithumb’s official announcements for the reopening time. Q3: Is my SEI safe on Bithumb during this time? A3: Yes. The suspension is a network safety measure, not a security issue. Your SEI balance on the exchange remains secure and unaffected. Q4: What happens if I try to send SEI to Bithumb during the suspension? A4: Any attempt to deposit SEI from an external wallet during the suspension period will likely fail or be significantly delayed. It is strongly advised to wait until Bithumb confirms services have fully resumed. Q5: Will other exchanges also suspend SEI services? A5: It is common but not automatic. Each exchange manages its own response to network upgrades. Users of other platforms should check announcements from their respective exchanges regarding SEI deposits and withdrawals. Q6: Why doesn’t Bithumb just support the upgrade without suspending services? A6: Suspending services prevents transactions from being sent on a transitioning blockchain, which could lead to permanent loss of funds. It is the safest method to ensure no user assets are put at risk during the technical process. Found this guide on the SEI deposits and withdrawals suspension helpful? Navigating exchange announcements can be tricky. Share this clear explanation with your network on X (Twitter) or Telegram to help other SEI community members stay informed and prepared!

The planned native lending feature would allow institutions to borrow XRP directly on-chain, mirroring traditional money market functionality. This isn’t another experimental DeFi layer or third-party lending app. Ripple’s proposal embeds lending directly into the XRP Ledger core, allowing XRP to be lent, locked, deployed, and repaid entirely on-ledger. For institutions that demand regulated, predictable infrastructure, this distinction is decisive. Protocol-level rules replace counterparty exposure and smart-contract uncertainty with built-in transparency and enforcement. Each loan is fully isolated, meaning a default is contained to that single position, eliminating systemic, cascading risk. This modular, ring-fenced design mirrors traditional financial risk management and delivers a major trust upgrade for banks, payment firms, and large institutions assessing blockchain adoption. A standout feature is fixed-term locking: borrowed XRP is secured for predefined periods, mirroring traditional credit agreements. While in use, it’s removed from circulation, creating a dual effect, enabling productive deployment while tightening liquid supply, a dynamic often overlooked, as Diana highlights. In market terms, this shift is significant. When demand rises while available supply is constrained, upward price pressure naturally builds. Native lending strengthens this dynamic by anchoring XRP’s value to real financial utility, credit creation, liquidity provisioning, and institutional settlement, rather than speculative holding. More importantly, native lending fundamentally repositions XRP in global finance. It elevates XRP from a payment bridge to collateral-grade financial infrastructure. Institutions would not simply transact with XRP; they could deploy it across balance-sheet operations, treasury strategies, and liquidity management frameworks. For banks and payment firms, this is a decisive upgrade. Native lending introduces familiar credit mechanics, stronger risk controls, and clearer regulatory alignment, without sacrificing blockchain efficiency. As Diana notes, this is how digital assets become real money: not through hype, but through structure, trust, and measurable utility. If executed as planned, Ripple’s native lending could be a pivotal inflection point, elevating XRP from a simple transaction bridge to a collateral-grade financial asset embedded within institutional credit markets. Conclusion Ripple’s decision to integrate native lending directly into the XRP Ledger is more than a technical enhancement, it marks a strategic shift toward institutional-grade financial infrastructure. By enabling isolated, fixed-term XRP loans at the protocol level, Ripple brings blockchain functionality in line with the risk controls, predictability, and transparency that traditional financial institutions demand. This approach strengthens trust while turning XRP into a productive, collateral-ready asset that can be borrowed, deployed, and repaid within a regulated framework. As active loans temporarily lock supply and demand is driven by real financial use, XRP’s role evolves from speculative utility to structural relevance. If widely adopted, native lending could elevate XRP into a core asset within institutional credit markets, bridging blockchain innovation with real-world finance.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-22 11:16:24

Aave price falls 10% as whale offloads 230,350 AAVE While overall weakness remains a key factor, the primary catalyst for the latest downturn for AAVE appears to be a significant sell-off by a large holder. On-chain analytics platform Lookonchain tracked a wallet address that offloaded 230,350 AAVE tokens, valued at roughly $37.6 million. Notably, the whale did not convert the holdings directly into fiat or stablecoins but instead swapped them for 5,869.46 staked Ether (stETH) worth about $17.5 million, and 227.8 wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) worth around $20.1 million.

While the whale realised losses on the sale, overall sentiment amid the selling has AAVE under pressure. From a technical perspective, AAVE’s price action has entered a critical juncture following the whale-induced sell-off. The token is currently testing a key support zone around $158 that previously helped bulls in November. At the time, the area provided buying interest as the price moved to $188, then to $207.

While declining exchange balances and likely whale accumulation might infuse fresh optimism, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator has a bearish crossover. The short-term outlook is therefore largely precarious amid elevated volatility and broader market uncertainty. Bulls can stabilise if the price climbs above $170, with the key resistance at the 50-day exponential moving average currently around $193. Meanwhile, bears might fancy lows of $129.

Closer Than Expected?,https://timestabloid.com/this-ripple-ceos-suggestion-puts-xrp-price-near-100-closer-than-expected/,"Crypto proponent John Squire has drawn attention to earlier remarks from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse that outline a long-term valuation scenario for XRP tied to the expansion of institutional digital asset infrastructure. Squire’s commentary centers on the idea that XRP could ultimately reach a trillion-dollar market capitalization, which would place its unit price near the $100 range under current supply assumptions. Rather than framing the outlook as a short-term price forecast, the focus is placed on structural developments within global finance that could support such a valuation over time. According to Squire, the significance of Garlinghouse’s position lies in how XRP is positioned within a rapidly evolving financial environment, particularly as large institutions prepare for wider adoption of digital assets. The emphasis is not only on speculation, but on utility, scale, and integration with existing financial systems. XRP’S MASSIVE POTENTIAL Brad Garlinghouse has PREVIOUSLY suggested $XRP could reach a TRILLION-DOLLAR valuation, putting it near $100. That would spark one of the BIGGEST BREAKOUTS in crypto. The future might be closer than expected. pic.twitter.com/PUyyQT2hxN — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) December 20, 2025 Institutional Custody and the Scale of the Opportunity In a video referenced by Squire, Garlinghouse outlined expectations for the digital asset custody market, projecting it to approach $10 trillion by 2030. This estimate reflects the anticipated volume of digital assets that institutions will need to store, secure, and manage as tokenization, blockchain-based settlement, and regulated digital products expand. Garlinghouse explained that custody is only one component of a broader ecosystem. Institutions will also require reliable transfer mechanisms, compliant on- and off-ramps, and infrastructure capable of supporting tokenized assets. Within this framework, XRP is presented as part of a wider set of tools designed to facilitate efficient value movement across networks and jurisdictions. Existing Relationships and Product Synergy Squire’s analysis highlights Garlinghouse’s reference to early discussions with major global banks, including institutions already engaged with Ripple’s technology. In those conversations, banks explored whether Ripple could support custody services, even before the company could do so. Garlinghouse suggested that this demand existed well ahead of recent acquisitions and product expansions. The current strategy, as described, involves revisiting those relationships with a more complete offering. By combining custody solutions with payment, settlement, and tokenization capabilities, Ripple aims to deliver an integrated infrastructure to institutions that are already part of its network. Squire views this continuity as a key factor in understanding the long-term valuation case being made for XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Connecting Utility to Long-Term Valuation Squire’s central point is that Garlinghouse’s trillion-dollar valuation reference should be understood in the context of market size and functional demand, not isolated price targets. As institutional participation in digital assets increases, assets that are embedded in core financial workflows may benefit disproportionately. From this perspective, the future valuation of XRP is linked to how effectively it supports large-scale financial activity in custody, transfers, and tokenized markets. Squire concludes that if these components continue to align, the timeline for such outcomes may be closer than many expect, driven more by infrastructure adoption than by market sentiment alone.

At the same time, Presale Phase 6 has reached 99% sold out, making it evident that MUTM is going along the right lines instead of being stuck at the idea stage. With a current value of $0.035, it can be concluded that investors interested in sound, simple, and authentic DeFi crypto platforms are waiting for Mutuum Finance . The features of the project, ranging from the operations of DeFi lending and borrowing, interest tokens, to the strategies for maximum yields, have managed to impress more than 18,550 investors with more than $20 million in funds acquired so far, evident indications that MUTM is a serious business in the overall DeFi crypto space and serious business within the overall marketplace itself. MUTM Presale Phase 6 Almost at Full Allocation Mutuum Finance is currently in the Presale Stage 6, where the price of its tokens is valued at $0.035. However, the coming presale stage will showcase an increase in the token value, which will be valued at $0.04, showing a remarkable increase of 20%. Therefore, it is evident that this is among the last moments when investors will be able to invest in the token while it is still undervalued. Since Mutuum Finance has over 18,550 investors participating in its presale, raising over $19.5 million, it is clear that the presale is a reflection of the support it is getting among the investors. Since it is offering two lending options on its platform, along with the soon-to-be-announced V1 Sepolia Testnet, it is the best investment option for investors. Mutuum Finance is an implementation of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models, which will allow users to gain interest while still having control over their assets. With its provision of a complete, safe, and versatile DeFi crypto platform, MUTM is strategically positioned as the next big crypto. Halborn Security Audit The security of the platform is and will always remain a priority at Mutuum Finance. The lending and borrowing smart contracts of the platform are presently going through a thorough audit test conducted by Halborn Security, which has emerged as the preeminent firm in blockchain auditing. The entire process aims to check if the smart contracts are functioning correctly and if the funds deposited by the users are safe. Completion of the process will be followed by the announcement of the Sepolia Testnet. As part of the initiative to promote community engagement, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 token giveaway, where ten users will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The platform has also registered a high level of security and reliability, with a 95.0/100 trust level from CertiK. This, combined with its new lending system, makes MUTM poised to offer progressive and secure DeFi crypto experiences and thus qualifies it as the next big cryptocurrency to watch. Hands-On Learning: Sepolia Testnet Lending & Borrowing Mutuum Finance is scheduled to launch the Version 1 of the lending/borrowing protocol on the Sepolia Testnet by the end of 2025. Early adopters will be provided an opportunity to engage with prime assets like ETH and USDT, leveraging the liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, as well as the automated liquidator bot. The Sepolia Testnet gives early adopters an opportunity to practically learn by engaging with the platform functionality, solidifying that MUTM is a promising crypto investment opportunity within the realm of DeFi crypto. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) boasts 99% sold out in Phase 6 at a price of 0.035 USD, with more than 18,550+ holders collectively raising almost 19.5M USD. In Phase 7, the price will be raised to 0.04 USD. This will be one of the final opportunities to invest while the project is still growing. With a two-layer DeFi crypto lending platform, Halborn audit-secure smart contracts, the upcoming V1 Sepolia Testnet, and the community hosting a $100K giveaway event, MUTM offers real-world usage value together with immense growth potential as the next big crypto.

Solana; Here’s ChatGPT’s best pick for 2026,https://finbold.com/ethereum-v-solana-heres-chatgpts-best-pick-for-2026/,"Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ) have emerged as the two most prominent competing smart contract networks in the cryptocurrency space , often framed as rivals representing different design philosophies and growth paths. Now, as the market looks ahead to 2026, ChatGPT has weighed that competition and identified its best pick for next year between the two decentralized finance (DeFi) assets. The model’s selection was based on projected value capture, institutional alignment, and evolving network economics rather than headline transaction activity. The case for Ethereum According to ChatGPT, Ethereum is likely to emerge on top in the coming year. In this view, the case for Ethereum centers on how its economic model is positioned to strengthen after a deliberately weak revenue year in 2025. Notably, Ethereum reduced base-layer fee generation as it scaled through rollups following the Dencun upgrade, temporarily dampening its fee-burn narrative. That dynamic is expected to reverse in 2026 as rollups mature and demand for blob space accelerates. Ethereum outlook for 2026. Source: ChatGPT Fees paid by rollups are becoming more recurring and predictable, positioning ETH as the settlement and data-availability rent asset for the broader rollup ecosystem. By contrast, Solana’s 2025 revenue growth was driven mainly by retail activity such as memecoins and speculative DeFi, which ChatGPT views as cyclical. Institutional impact ChatGPT also sees a widening institutional gap, with tokenized Treasuries, real-world assets, funds, and settlement pilots concentrated on Ethereum and its layer-2 networks. These users favor legal finality and mature tooling, reinforcing Ethereum’s role as core financial infrastructure, while Solana has yet to show comparable settlement-driven adoption. Ethereum outlook for 2026. Source: ChatGPT Layer-2 growth is another advantage identified by ChatGPT. In 2025, many argued rollups diluted Ethereum’s value capture, but ChatGPT sees the opposite taking shape. Higher layer-2 activity increases blob usage, lifting demand for ETH, which uniquely secures settlement, data availability, and finality across major rollups. Solana’s single execution layer lacks a comparable mechanism that feeds ecosystem growth back into sustained token demand. Supply dynamics favor Ethereum, with constrained post-merge issuance and the potential for renewed fee burn to push ETH back toward net deflation. Solana, by contrast, has a higher inflation profile and weaker links between activity and token scarcity. Market positioning Market positioning further shaped ChatGPT’s 2026 outlook. After Solana’s strong narrative momentum and Ethereum’s underperformance, ChatGPT expects a rotation toward assets with cash-flow-like traits and stronger institutional credibility, a profile that Ethereum fits more closely. Notably, year-to-date, ETH has plunged almost 9%, trading at $3,040 as of press time. Over the same period, SOL has plunged 33%, trading at $126 ETH and SOL YTD price chart. Source: Finbold However, the AI model noted that this view would shift if Solana shows sustained institutional settlement or if Ethereum fails to translate layer-2 growth into higher blob fees and ETH burn. Absent that, ChatGPT sees Ethereum entering 2026 with a stronger position. Featured image via Shutterstock The post Ethereum v.

This landmark legislation fully legalizes the trading and use of digital assets within the country, positioning Ghana as a pioneer in the continent’s blockchain revolution. The move signals a major shift toward embracing innovative financial technologies while addressing regulatory concerns. What Does Ghana’s Cryptocurrency Legalization Bill Actually Mean? The newly passed cryptocurrency legalization bill represents a comprehensive framework for digital asset regulation. Unlike previous ambiguous stances taken by many African governments, Ghana’s legislation provides clear guidelines for cryptocurrency operations. The bill establishes legal recognition for crypto transactions, creates consumer protection measures, and sets up taxation protocols. This clarity is crucial for both local users and international investors who have been hesitant about Africa’s crypto market potential. According to reports from Unfolded, the legislation covers multiple aspects of cryptocurrency operations. The government will now recognize digital assets as legitimate financial instruments. This recognition comes with specific regulatory requirements that exchanges and traders must follow. The framework aims to prevent fraud while encouraging innovation in the financial technology sector. Why Did Ghana Choose to Legalize Cryptocurrency Now? Several factors likely influenced Ghana’s decision to pass the cryptocurrency legalization bill at this particular moment. First, the country has been experiencing significant growth in digital asset adoption despite previous regulatory uncertainty. Many Ghanaians have turned to cryptocurrencies as alternatives to traditional banking systems. Second, neighboring countries have been exploring similar regulatory approaches, creating regional momentum for clearer crypto policies. The government recognizes several potential benefits from this legislation: Economic innovation: Attracting blockchain startups and tech investments Financial inclusion: Providing banking alternatives for unbanked populations Youth employment: Creating opportunities in the growing tech sector Remittance efficiency: Reducing costs for international money transfers Moreover, Ghana aims to position itself as a regional hub for financial technology. By establishing clear regulations early, the country hopes to attract both African and international crypto businesses looking for stable regulatory environments. How Will the Cryptocurrency Legalization Bill Impact Everyday Ghanaians? The practical implications of the cryptocurrency legalization bill will touch various aspects of daily life. For ordinary citizens, the legislation means they can now engage in crypto transactions without legal uncertainty. Small business owners can accept cryptocurrency payments with confidence. Young entrepreneurs can develop blockchain-based solutions knowing they operate within a recognized legal framework. However, the legislation also introduces new responsibilities. Cryptocurrency users must now comply with tax reporting requirements. Exchanges operating in Ghana need to implement know-your-customer (KYC) procedures. These measures aim to prevent illegal activities while maintaining the innovative potential of digital assets. The government has indicated that educational initiatives will accompany the legislation. These programs will help citizens understand both the opportunities and risks associated with cryptocurrency investments. Financial literacy regarding digital assets becomes increasingly important as more people gain access to these markets. What Challenges Might Ghana Face After Passing This Legislation? Despite the positive aspects of the cryptocurrency legalization bill , Ghana will likely encounter several challenges during implementation. Regulatory enforcement presents the first major hurdle. Monitoring cryptocurrency transactions requires technical expertise and resources that may strain existing regulatory bodies. Additionally, balancing innovation with consumer protection remains an ongoing challenge for governments worldwide. Other potential challenges include: Technological infrastructure: Ensuring reliable internet access nationwide Cross-border coordination: Aligning regulations with neighboring countries Market volatility: Protecting consumers from extreme price fluctuations International standards: Meeting global anti-money laundering requirements Nevertheless, Ghana’s proactive approach positions the country to address these challenges systematically. The legislation includes provisions for regular review and adjustment, allowing the regulatory framework to evolve alongside technological developments. Could Ghana’s Decision Influence Other African Nations? Ghana’s passage of the cryptocurrency legalization bill could create a domino effect across Africa. Several countries have been observing Ghana’s regulatory experiments with digital assets. Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa have all grappled with cryptocurrency regulation in recent years. Ghana’s comprehensive approach provides a potential model for balancing innovation with consumer protection. The success or failure of Ghana’s implementation will likely influence regional policy decisions. If the legislation stimulates economic growth without significant negative consequences, other African governments may follow suit. Conversely, challenges in implementation might cause neighboring countries to adopt more cautious approaches. Regional economic communities like ECOWAS might eventually develop harmonized cryptocurrency regulations. Such coordination would facilitate cross-border crypto transactions while maintaining consistent consumer protections across West Africa. What Does This Mean for Global Cryptocurrency Adoption? Ghana’s cryptocurrency legalization bill contributes to growing global momentum for digital asset regulation. As more countries establish clear legal frameworks, international cryptocurrency markets gain legitimacy and stability. Developing nations like Ghana demonstrate that emerging economies can actively shape rather than merely react to financial technology trends. The legislation also highlights Africa’s increasing importance in global cryptocurrency adoption. With young, tech-savvy populations and innovative approaches to financial challenges, African nations may drive the next phase of blockchain development. Ghana’s decision reflects this potential while addressing legitimate regulatory concerns. In conclusion, Ghana’s passage of the cryptocurrency legalization bill represents a transformative moment for both the country and the continent. By embracing digital assets within a regulated framework, Ghana positions itself at the forefront of financial innovation while protecting its citizens. The world will watch closely as this African nation implements what could become a model for balanced cryptocurrency regulation worldwide. Frequently Asked Questions When did Ghana pass the cryptocurrency legalization bill? The Ghanaian government recently passed the legislation, though the exact date of implementation may vary as regulatory details are finalized. The bill has completed parliamentary approval and awaits presidential assent and implementation guidelines. What cryptocurrencies are legal under Ghana’s new bill? The legislation provides a framework for all legitimate digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other established cryptocurrencies. However, specific guidelines regarding which assets meet regulatory standards will be detailed in accompanying implementation documents. Can foreigners invest in cryptocurrency in Ghana after this legislation? Yes, the legislation creates a framework for both domestic and international cryptocurrency investment. However, foreign investors will need to comply with the same regulatory requirements as Ghanaian citizens, including proper registration and tax obligations. How will Ghana’s government tax cryptocurrency transactions? Specific taxation details are still being developed, but the legislation establishes cryptocurrency as taxable assets. Capital gains taxes likely apply to investment profits, while business transactions involving cryptocurrency may be subject to standard business taxes. What protections does the bill offer cryptocurrency investors? The legislation includes consumer protection measures such as mandatory disclosures from exchanges, anti-fraud provisions, and dispute resolution mechanisms. However, investors should remember that cryptocurrency markets remain volatile, and the government cannot guarantee against market losses. Will traditional banks in Ghana now offer cryptocurrency services? The legislation opens possibilities for traditional financial institutions to integrate cryptocurrency services. However, individual banks will make their own decisions based on risk assessments and regulatory compliance requirements. Found this analysis of Ghana’s cryptocurrency legalization bill insightful?

As retail gave up on the coin, large-scale holders kept accumulating. ETH wallets with a balance of 10K to 100K ETH are the leading holders toward the end of 2025. ETH whales kept accumulating, especially in the second half of 2025. ETH is going through a significant shift in holding structure, with tokens flowing out of exchanges and into new self-custodial wallets. In 2025, retail sentiment continued to sink, while whales used the available DeFi tools on Ethereum. The holdings of smaller wallets, carrying 100-1K ETH, have continued their decline since 2024. The inflows into the wallets of large-scale whales expanded at a much more rapid pace, holding over 22M tokens. ETH balances in whale wallets with 10K to 100K ETH expanded rapidly in 2025, with buying during periods of market weakness. | Source: Cryptoquant The largest wallets, possibly belonging to exchanges or treasuries, carry around 4.47M ETH, and may not be as influential. The recent cohort of whales kept buying close to their realized price, even without significant profits. The whale moves are seen as an indicator of an expected breakout, not a bear market for ETH. Large-scale whales buy the dip on ETH The collection of large-scale wallets also has a pattern of buying in 2025, avoiding market peaks. Whale accumulation happens at levels where ETH is considered undervalued. The whale level of holdings also offers support for ETH at around $2,800. Whales become active on ETH at prices under $3,000, with notable buyers like the Seven Siblings wallets getting active in November. The active pace of buying also signals whales may be more confident in the potential of ETH. The current whale buying did not occur during a hype cycle; instead, whales entered the market during periods of market panic and price weakness. The whale buying happened as ETH retail sentiment was near all-time lows. At the same time, derivative traders also became more cautious. ETH sentiment shifted between neutral and fearful trading for the past months. ETH whales extend silent accumulation with long-term confidence Whales also accumulated ETH while ETF buyers were shedding their holdings. The storage of ETH in new whale wallets also signals long-term confidence from crypto insiders, staging one of the biggest events of building up a reserve. ETH remains potentially important for DeFi activity and even mainstream finance. The ETH accumulation continued, despite the lack of an altcoin market. ETH may be key to the creation and usage of stablecoins, one of the fastest-growing sectors in 2025. Ethereum remains a key network for some DeFi protocols, currently holding 95% of the liquidity on protocols like Sky (formerly MakerDAO ). ETH is also key for liquid staking, which is much more rewarding for whales. An ETH reserve can also be used to generate new crypto-backed stablecoins or as collateral in lending protocols . However, the usage of DeFi is also becoming the arena of whales and more experienced traders, leading to the creation of a new cohort of whale wallets. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

The market began the year with a bang, with Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies racing to new all-time highs. However, the market has been shaky, thanks to various macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, trade wars, and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Bitcoin looks poised to end 2025 trading below $100k. However, the major question remains whether 2025 was a bullish year for Bitcoin. Bitcoin hits $124k in October The biggest highlight for Bitcoin in 2025 was hitting the $124k level for the first time in its history. The leading cryptocurrency by market cap began 2025 trading above $93k per coin. By October 7th, Bitcoin’s price hit an all-time high of $124k, taking its total market cap to nearly $2 trillion. However, the market has been on a downward trend since then, hitting a low of $84k on November 22nd. At press time, Bitcoin is trading below $90k per coin. While Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $124k in 2025, if the leading cryptocurrency ends the year trading below the $93k level it began in January, then the year wasn’t a bullish one. Despite that, analysts are optimistic that Bitcoin’s price will record better gains in 2026. According to analysts at 21Shares, Bitcoin’s four-year cycle is fading, and the market is now controlled by Structural inflows, macro realignment, and regulatory clarity. “Even though market outcomes can differ materially from expectations, we believe Bitcoin could be positioned to reach new all-time highs in 2026, with broader markets potentially benefiting from improving liquidity and rising institutional participation. Each cycle now delivers less exponential returns, but also far milder corrections, reflecting Bitcoin’s evolution. The halving may remain symbolic, but it is no longer the engine,” the analysts added. Alexis Sirkia, Chairman of Yellow Network, also told Invezz in an email that institutional demand played a key role in Bitcoin’s performance this year. Sirkia added that, “Spot Bitcoin ETFs are a structural shift, not a short-term trend, solidifying BTC’s role as a global store of value. The scarcity model underwrites this institutional demand. However, Bitcoin is a settlement layer, not an application layer; it is not built for high-frequency transactions. Its stability is now underwritten by institutional capital, but the next wave of innovation will come from layers built on top of Satoshi’s vision.” Bitcoin’s bullish factors in 2025 Bitcoin’s volatility in 2025 resulted in the cryptocurrency hitting an all-time high of $124. Here are some factors that contributed to its bullish price action this year. President Trump’s pro-crypto stance One of the primary drivers of Bitcoin’s bullish price action in 2025 was Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential elections in November 2024. With Trump’s assumption of office, the changes in the US SEC leadership were a big boost to the crypto market, as former chair Gary Gensler took an unfavorable stance on digital asset policies. According to CryptoQuant, the monthly percentage growth of Bitcoin holdings among large investors accelerated from -0.25% on January 14 to +2% on January 17, marking the highest monthly rate since mid-December 2024. The rise in Bitcoin holders pushed the price to a then record-high of $109,588 on Trump’s inauguration day, Trump’s campaign promises were translated into personal stakes in digital assets. The Trump family launched World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi project built on the Ethereum blockchain and endorsed by his sons (Donald Jr., Eric, and Barron) in September 2024. Investors viewed this move as a strong indication of crypto adoption, with favorable policies expected during Trump’s tenure. According to Arkham Intelligence , WLFI currently holds $6.93 billion in tokens, comprising Ethereum (ETH), Aave (AAVE), Chainlink (LINK), and others. The DeFi project has also launched its own stablecoin, USD1, which is 1:1 backed by the US Dollar (USD). SEC’s crypto task force focuses on regulating the crypto market In January, the US SEC acting Chairman, Mark Uyeda, launched a crypto task force led by Commissioner Hester Peirce to provide a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. Shortly after that, President Trump signed an executive order to support crypto and promote US leadership in digital assets. The bill also seeks to launch a strategic national digital asset stockpile for the US. 2025 also saw the first-ever White House Crypto Summit, where regulation and innovation in the cryptocurrency sector were discussed. Finally, the GENIUS Act was enacted into law in mid-July. This law established a clear federal regulatory framework for stablecoins and their issuers in the United States, resulting in the stablecoin ecosystem hitting a market cap of over $300 billion this year. States rush to launch Bitcoin reserves In addition to the Federal Government’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, many US states joined the race to establish their own Bitcoin reserves. New Hampshire and Arizona led the way, with Texas also joining the movement. Similar bills are pending in other state legislatures, including Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, and Ohio. Crypto is now part of the 401(K) Another major win for Bitcoin was the executive order signed by Trump in August, allowing 401(k) investments in cryptocurrency, private equity, and real estate. Institutional demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs remains strong Another major factor behind Bitcoin’s bullish runs this year was the growing demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs by institutional investors. Data obtained from SoSoValue reveals that US-listed spot ETFs have recorded $22.65 billion in net inflows for the 2025 year-to-date, as of mid-December. However, last month, the ETFs recorded heavy outflows of $3.48 billion, resulting in Bitcoin retesting the $84k level just a few weeks after hitting an all-time high of $124k. Bitcoin ETF Total Assets Under Management (AUM) currently stands at $123 billion, down from the $165.15 billion recorded on October 8. On the corporate side, an increasing number of companies are adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Strategy (MSTR) increased its holdings from 446,000 BTC at the start of 2025 to 671,000 BTC (3.19% of the total supply of 21 million BTC) at the time of writing. Mining companies now account for 12% of public company BTC holdings. Marathon Digital (MARA) holds 53,250 BTC. Bitcoin’s bearish factors in 2025 While Bitcoin reached a new all-time high in 2025, a couple of macroeconomic factors affected its price. Some of these events include; Trade war and tariffs Trump’s first year in office came with tariff policies, sparking trade conflicts with countries such as China, Canada, Mexico, and others. These tariffs triggered a risk-off mood for riskier assets, including Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. The tariffs resulted in Bitcoin’s price reaching a yearly low of $74,508 on April 7. Geopolitical conflicts The tension in the Middle East also affected Bitcoin’s price in 2025. Earlier this year, the Russia-Ukraine escalations and early Asian tensions between India and Pakistan added volatility in BTC. Furthermore, the renewed conflict in Yemen (Houthi strikes on shipping) disrupted trade routes, and a decline in BTC below $100,000 amid spikes in Oil prices. The Israel-Iran conflict hit its peak in the second quarter of the year as Israel struck Iranian airports and nuclear sites. Iran retaliated with drones and missiles on Israeli and US targets (i.e, Qatar base). All these events contributed to Bitcoin’s volatility in 2025. Bitcoin hit the $124k all-time high in October. However, unless the leading cryptocurrency ends the year trading above $93, 2025 would not be categorized as a bullish year.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, Bitcoin is currently trading at $90,000.34 on the Binance USDT market. This surge represents more than just a number; it signals a wave of renewed confidence and a potential new phase for the world’s premier cryptocurrency. Let’s unpack what’s driving this rally and what it could mean for your portfolio. What’s Fueling the Historic BTC Price Rally? The jump in the BTC price to this unprecedented level isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several powerful forces are converging to create this bullish momentum. First, institutional adoption continues to accelerate, with major financial firms increasing their Bitcoin holdings and offering new crypto-based products to clients. Second, the recent Bitcoin halving event has reduced the new supply entering the market, a classic catalyst for price appreciation based on simple economics of scarcity. Finally, macroeconomic factors, such as concerns about inflation and currency devaluation in certain regions, are pushing investors towards hard assets like Bitcoin as a potential store of value. Key Takeaways from the $90,000 Breakthrough This milestone is a powerful signal for both seasoned traders and newcomers. Here are the core insights: Market Sentiment Shift: Breaking through such a major round-number resistance level often triggers a shift in market psychology from caution to optimism. Technical Strength: The move demonstrates significant buying pressure and suggests the bullish trend has substantial momentum. Media and Mainstream Attention: Headlines about Bitcoin hitting $90,000 will draw fresh eyes and potentially new capital into the crypto ecosystem. What Challenges Could Lie Ahead for the BTC Price? While the celebration is warranted, prudent investors always consider both sides of the coin. The road ahead for the BTC price may not be entirely smooth. Potential volatility is a constant companion in crypto markets, and sharp corrections can follow rapid ascents. Moreover, regulatory developments in key economies like the United States and the European Union remain a wild card that could impact market sentiment. Therefore, it’s crucial to view this achievement not as a final destination, but as a significant milestone in a longer journey. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should you do in light of this news? First, avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on price hype. If you are investing, consider proven strategies like dollar-cost averaging to mitigate timing risk. Second, use this moment as an opportunity to review and rebalance your portfolio to ensure your asset allocation still matches your risk tolerance. Finally, stay informed. Understanding the fundamental drivers behind the BTC price movement is more valuable than simply watching the ticker. In conclusion, Bitcoin’s breach of the $90,000 mark is a historic event that underscores its growing maturity and adoption. It reflects a complex interplay of scarcity, institutional demand, and macroeconomic trends. While challenges like volatility and regulation persist, this milestone solidifies Bitcoin’s position at the forefront of the financial revolution. The journey of the BTC price continues to be a captivating narrative of innovation, speculation, and the redefinition of value itself. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly does it mean that BTC is above $90,000? A1: It means that on major exchanges like Binance, the market price for one Bitcoin has exceeded ninety thousand US dollars, a new all-time high that represents a significant valuation milestone for the cryptocurrency. Q2: Should I buy Bitcoin now that the price is so high? A2: Investment decisions should be based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and research, not solely on current price levels. Many investors use strategies like dollar-cost averaging to invest consistently over time, regardless of price fluctuations. Q3: Could the price drop back below $90,000 just as quickly? A3: Yes, cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility. While breaking $90,000 is a strong bullish signal, prices can and do experience sharp pullbacks. It’s important to be prepared for potential volatility. Q4: What has been the main driver for this price increase? A4> Analysts point to a combination of factors: increased institutional investment, the recent Bitcoin halving reducing new supply, and broader macroeconomic uncertainty driving interest in alternative assets. Q5: Where can I reliably check the current BTC price? A5: Reputable cryptocurrency data aggregators like CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, and Bitcoin World provide real-time price tracking across multiple exchanges. Q6: Does this price surge affect other cryptocurrencies? A6> Often, yes. A strong rally in Bitcoin (often called ‘King Crypto’) can have a spillover effect, boosting sentiment and prices across the broader cryptocurrency market, a phenomenon known as ‘altcoin season’.

With M2 equilibrium reached and limited QE prospects, I expect BTC to deprecate, targeting a $30,000 bottom. Chairman Powell's comments at the last FOMC meeting weren't an indication of QE. In fact, with 350 basis points of rate-cuts room left, QE won't be initiated anytime soon. With a historical standard deviation of ~149% and limited near-term upside, investors will rotate out of BTC —something dominance charts already indicate is underway. A primary risk to my thesis is one-off events that provide tailwinds for BTC; however, I argue that those events are themselves influenced by M2. My thesis applies not only to IBIT but to all other Bitcoin ETFs as well, including ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). “Bitcoin is a bubble, a speculative asset!” Words usually spoken by those jaded because of persistent headlines on Bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) dramatic price movements. BTC’s a risky asset, yes, but it’s also swiftly gaining acceptance as a traditional asset. One of the primary reasons for my assertion is the numerous numbers in this report , the most eye-catching of which is that an estimated ~40% of the American population now owns BTC. Furthermore, another article indicates that the U.S. government is among the top 10 holders of BTC and that U.S. Spot ETFs, collectively, now hold more BTC than the coin’s founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. One could argue that just because everyone is jumping on the bandwagon doesn’t imply it’s a great investment. Surely, if the crowd is always right, then investing is akin to an election, and trending assets would have the best risk-return profile. A reasonable argument, definitely. Through this article, however, I’ll demonstrate that BTC’s prices are, now more than ever, driven by macroeconomic factors, rather than “feelings and opinions” of the crowd. In other words, if investors use the right data, their ability to identify BTC’s peaks and bottoms will improve manifold. One such macroeconomic metric, and the core of this thesis, is the U.S. Economy’s Money Supply (M2). What Is IBIT? But before that, a quick introduction to the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) for those not well-acquainted with the ETF. According to the fund’s fact sheet : The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF seeks to reflect the performance of the price of bitcoin. The Trust offers exposure to bitcoin through an exchange-traded product, simplifying the operational and custody complexities of holding bitcoin directly. According to data on Morningstar, the fund’s total returns since inception are 42.57%, attained with a standard deviation of 88.62 and a Sharpe ratio of 0.67. Interestingly, IBIT came into existence on January 5, 2024, and has since managed to attract ‪$66.02B in assets, a feat placing it among the Top 100 ETFs based on AUM. And only 9 places lower than arguably the most popular ETF on Seeking Alpha, the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF ( SCHD ), which has $72.80B in AUM. Once again, supporting my argument that BTC is quickly attaining the ranks of a traditional asset class. BTC and M2 Changes Below is a chart that maps BTC against changes in M2. A high-level analysis reveals a strong correlation between changes in M2 (M2C) and BTC prices, especially since 2020. BTC-USD vs M2 YoY % Change (Weekly, Sep 2014 – Nov 2025) (Author's Work (Date from Yahoo! and FRED)) Specifically, the M2C curve experienced a strong pivot in March 2020, due to the Fed’s response to the COVID crisis when it executed the most aggressive quantitative easing program since its inception. Six months later, BTC prices started rallying to reach an all-time high (at that time) of roughly $65,000. But at the start of 2021, M2C stated sinking. A numerically foreseeable event because of the inevitability of base effects coming into play, following M2C’s huge surge in 2020. Those effects, however, started fading by June 2021, manifesting as a flat M2C curve for the last two quarters of 2021. M2C’s stabilization/flattening was short-lived because the effects of the Fed’s QE tapering program began to kick in at the start of 2022, and introduced renewed pressures on M2C, leading to another downward leg. A trajectory that attained further momentum when the Fed transitioned to quantitative tightening in June 2022 . By the end of October 2022, M2C turned negative. BTC prices began to tank at the end of 2021, affirming the strong correlation between BTC prices and M2C. Readers, at this juncture, should ask: was the cause of that price depreciation due to the first pivot in early February 2021 or the second pivot at the start of 2022? In my view, it’s the first because markets function on expectations rather than events. In early 2021, expectations of further QE had pretty much extinguished because the Fed had front-loaded money injections, and continuing with such aggressive QE actions was not sustainable. Then, only three years after the pandemic, in March 2023, the Silicon Valley Bank Collapsed, which, as some readers may recall, prompted the Fed to introduce the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) to stabilize not just the SVB but the entire U.S. banking industry. The BTFP was a liquidity injection that led to a directional change in M2C even though QT was still active. An indication of the fact that the Fed aimed for a slow-burn approach with its balance sheet runoff, as opposed to aggressive QT. An assertion that gains further support when we consider the fact that the Fed’s balance sheet expanded approximately $4.8T between March 2020 and May 2022, whereas the reduction due to QT totaled only about $2.3T. As for BTC, it started appreciating again in October 2023, six months after the initiation of the BTFP. That rally received more tailwinds when the Fed further slowed its balance-sheet runoff in May 2024, probably causing market participants to conclude that overhang from the aggressive QE program will persist longer than previously anticipated. It is, therefore, reasonable to conclude that there’s a strong relation between not just M2C and BTC prices, but also expectations of M2C and BTC, which naturally leads one to ask the next most important question: what will M2 look like in 2026 and beyond? Note: I’ve intentionally left out discussion on BTC’s rally in 2017 – more on that in the Thesis Risks section. What’s Next for M2? I believe that we are finally starting to witness the end of pandemic-induced M2 overhang – a belief supported by the fact that the Fed recently ended its QT program. Put differently, the Fed’s end of QT is an indication that excess liquidity has been drained from the system. A system that is in M2 equilibrium, thus, implies that tailwinds for BTC have faded, but could it also mean that the Fed is now ready for another round of QE? Not really because even after all the rate cuts that we’ve witnessed in 2025, the Fed still has room to cut rates by another 350 bps. I bring rates into the picture because QE’s primary objective is to stimulate the economy. And if the Fed already has one tool available to get that job done, there’s no need to pull out another tool. The above two points, taken together, lead one to conclude that there won’t be any significant changes in M2C in the coming years, at least until Fed Fund rates reach zero. Indeed, it be said that markets have already started pricing this in - one of the reasons for BTC’s price decline since early October this year. Lastly, I want to mention that Chairman Powell’s most recent announcement on buying short-term treasuries to increase bank reserves is not QE because increases in banking reserves do not lead to an increase in usable cash among households. To acquire further clarity, please read my article titled Powell Didn't Imply Quantitative Easing, Most Have Misunderstood , please also read the comments section where one user asked some great questions. BTC at $30K Investors, in this economic environment, have two options: continue holding BTC as a store of value, or rotate into other assets. BTC, with a standard deviation of roughly 149% , is a highly risky asset, implying that it’s not an ideal store of wealth. Furthermore, investors can rotate into equities that have historically returned 10% per year, instead of stating invested in BTC that won't likely rally anytime soon. Indeed, money is already moving out of cryptos as a whole, as demonstrated in my recent article on MSTY . In summary, my analysis of dominance charts indicated that investors are parking their money in stablecoins, implying that they don’t expect cryptos to appreciate. Due to this possible rotation out of BTC, I expect its price to experience dramatic drawdowns, as has been the case historically, in 2026 and beyond. Numerically speaking, I expect BTC to deprecate until it reaches $30,000 – a price target derived from the coin’s previous peak-and-trough patterns. Precisely, BTC reached a high of ~$19,000 in December 2017 and bottomed out at $3,200 in December 2018, a ratio of ~5.9 to 1. Another all-time high of $64,000 was attained in November 2021, followed by a bottom of ~$16,500 in December 2022 – ratio of ~3.9 to 1 Thus, if we assume that $122,000 in October 2025 was the coin’s most recent high, the new bottom will be in the range of $30,000 to $20,000. That’s at least a 66% drawdown from the trading price of ~$90,000 as of December 20, 2025. Thesis Risks As mentioned earlier, I intentionally left out discussions pertaining to BTC’s 2017 rally. I did so because that rally was not fueled by M2 injections, but rather propelled by the initial coin offerings frenzy ubiquitous at that time. If such an external event can cause a rally in BTC at that time, without any M2 increases, can’t it do so now as well? In fact, many would refute all that I’ve discussed by mentioning that BTC’s rallies post 2020 were driven by events such as the introduction of BTC future, the launch of crypto ETFs, adoption by company like Tesla and PayPal, large-scale purchases by MSTR, and increasing regulatory clarity in the U.S. They’d be right in their assertion, but my counterargument to that claim is that none of that would have happened if it weren’t for abundant liquidity in the economy – a strong motivator for institutions to lobby for and move money into risky assets. In fact, now that there are many institutional players in the BTC arena, it can be said that BTC will be driven by macro variables, such as money supply, more than ever, because those variables are exactly what smart money uses to make high-level capital allocation decisions. Final Thoughts Needless to say, my thesis applies not only to IBIT but also to all other BTC ETFs, such as the ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ), the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF ( FBTC ), and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ). Does the possibility of BTC depreciation present a short-selling opportunity? Yes, but I don’t recommend shorting BTC, or any other asset, for inexperienced traders. If you want, use this opportunity to paper trade, attain experience, and then trade on future opportunities – financial markets aren’t going anywhere. Last but not least, negligible expectations of elevated M2C in the coming years is just one factor indicating the fall of BTC in 2026, and possibly beyond.",BTC-USD|BITO|FBTC|GBTC|IBIT|IBIT:CA,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-22 11:57:08

Investors approved five initiatives to bolster the firm’s preferred-share issuance authority, create new dividend arrangements, and permit participation from overseas institutions, according to Dylan LeClair, the company’s Bitcoin strategy director. The approved actions include reallocating capital reserves to facilitate dividend payments and buybacks on preferred shares, as well as increasing the authorized number of Class A and B preferred shares from 277.5 million shares to 555 million shares for each class. The firm’s investors also agreed to amend the dividend structures to allow for floating and periodic payouts, mainly to maintain price stability. Additionally, the company was authorized to sell Class B preferred shares to overseas institutional investors and amend them to a quarterly dividend structure. Metaplanet will introduce the Metaplanet Adjustable Rate Security structure With the new approvals , Metaplanet is shifting its focus from pure dilution-based growth to a conventional market framework that integrates income-producing securities with a Bitcoin-oriented balance sheet. Its preferred equity will now allow institutions to gain exposure to Bitcoin holdings similar to how institutions operate. The Class A preferred shares amendment, meanwhile, creates a monthly floating-rate dividend structure — the “Metaplanet Adjustable Rate Security” — which ensures steady income designed to meet institutional needs. Moreover, Class B preferred shares will now carry quarterly dividends, a 10-year call at 130% of face value, and an investor put option if the company fails to go public within 12 months. That means the firm will repurchase shares at a premium after 10 years, while investors have the right to exit if no IPO takes place within a year. Such provisions are common in private credit and structured equity markets, protecting long-term capital. The proposal also allows for the issuance of Class B preferred shares to foreign investors. By catering to international institutional investors, the company will enable access to Bitcoin exposure without the need to hold spot BTC or volatile equity. Metaplanet is expanding to the US market, following the establishment of its Miami subsidiary Metaplanet ranks as one of the most closely followed Bitcoin-focused public companies in Asia and is frequently compared with U.S. corporate Bitcoin treasury approaches, even under Japan’s regulations. Primarily, the firm’s model highlights how non-U.S. businesses adjust Bitcoin strategies to fit local regulations while attracting global investors. The company even stated on Friday that it will start trading in the U.S. over-the-counter market using American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), following the creation of its Miami subsidiary earlier this year. Managed by Simon Gerovich, Dylan LeClair, and Darren Winia, the unit specializes in Bitcoin income and derivatives trading, structurally separating revenue-generating activities from the company’s primary BTC assets. The firm had budgeted about $15 million for its initial development. Around the same time, the company also established a unit in Japan, Bitcoin Japan Inc., to boost its domestic Bitcoin operations. The site manages media, including Bitcoin Magazine, events, and the recently acquired Bitcoin.jp domain. Currently, the firm’s Bitcoin stash stands at 30,823 BTC, worth approximately $2.75 billion, making it Asia’s largest corporate holder and the fourth-largest worldwide, according to Bitcoin Treasuries.

ETH’s price may be gradually regaining upside momentum, but other aspects are still experiencing downward pressure, such as the Open Interest (OI). Sharp Drop In Ethereum Open Interest In the current volatile state of the cryptocurrency landscape, the Ethereum derivatives market is signaling a key indicator. This crucial signal is coming from the ETH Open interest, which has witnessed a significant pullback in the past few months. According to the research from the advanced investment and on-chain data analytics platform Alphractal, the metric has dropped by half or 50% since August this year. A significant drop in this metric is a clear indication that trader positioning and risk appetite have shifted notably. Following a period of high leverage and aggressive speculation, the sharp collapse indicates that positions are being unwound, exposure is being decreased, and momentum is cooling across futures markets. Alphractal highlighted that the Ethereum open interest is valued at roughly half of what it was in August 2025, suggesting a drastic decline in market risk. Such a move points to institutions and large whale holders who have closed leveraged ETH positions. The exiting of positions by big investors shows that they are reducing exposure and speculative pressure. ETH’s open interest has also fallen sharply on cryptocurrency exchanges. After examining the Ethereum Open Interest distribution by exchange, Alphractal unveiled a 31% decline to $7.64 billion on the world’s largest exchange, Binance . On Gateio, open interest is at $3.72 billion, indicating a 15% decrease, while HTX (formerly known as House) has fallen by 12.65% to $3.12 million. Furthermore, Bybit has $2.53 billion with a 10.25% drop, HyperLiquid has $2.51 billion with a 10.18%, and Bitget has $1.79 billion with a 7.25% decline. With exchanges’ open interest dropping, this tells a compelling story of the current market structure. This outlines robust deleveraging across the Ethereum market and a lower probability of explosive moves in the short term. Typically, an atmosphere that is more cautious and protective implies stages of consolidation or preparation for the next trend leg. However, deep declines in open interest have historically frequently preceded significant structural changes, either a healthier reversal or a downward continuation with less leverage. ETH Withdrawals From Crypto Exchanges Have Spiked Ethereum’s open interest drop comes at a time of a massive drop in ETH supply on crypto exchanges. Currently, ETH withdrawals have reached their lowest levels since 2016, reflecting growing trader caution and dampened short-term sell pressure. As more ETH is taken out of exchanges and placed in long-term holding locations, the liquid supply keeps decreasing. While the supply decrease bolsters ETH’s volatility, it also encourages price pressure to rise.",Ethereum|binance|Bitget|Bybit|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|Ethereum open interest|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|HTX|Hyperliquid,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-22 12:00:03

As 2025 draws to a close, those expectations are facing reevaluations. Despite intermittent rallies during the year and strong conviction among long-term holders, XRP is currently trading far from triple-digit territory. This gap between optimism and market reality has pushed some voices within the XRP community to reassess timelines to reach such a valuation. Zach Rector Pushes The $100 XRP Perspective To 2030 One of the most notable revisions comes from Zach Rector, a longtime XRP supporter who has openly adjusted his outlook. In a recent post on the social media platform X, Rector stated plainly that his expectation for XRP to reach $100 now sits around the year 2030. This position is a clear review of chatter from many XRP enthusiasts that envisions a $100 XRP as an imminent outcome within the current cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Just Entered Extreme Oversold Levels And Analysts Predict New ATH Targets Rector had already begun tempering expectations as far back as early November, when he acknowledged that XRP was unlikely to reach $100 before the end of the year. At the time, he noted that meaningful price appreciation was still possible, even if the most extreme targets are out of reach. At the time, he noted that saying XRP isn’t going to $100 this year feels like telling a kid Santa isn’t real. Why $100 In 2025 Has Become Increasingly Unlikely The idea of XRP reaching $100 within a single market cycle faces mathematical and liquidity constraints. At current supply levels of 60 billion XRP, such a price would imply a market capitalization deep into the multi-trillion-dollar range, putting XRP among the most valuable assets in the global financial system. As the year winds down, there is little evidence of the scale of capital inflows required to support that kind of valuation in the near term. Although bullish sentiment is strong in parts of the XRP community, market conditions have not aligned with the aggressive assumptions. Therefore, a 2025 timeline for $100 XRP has moved from ambitious to implausible, even for optimistic analysts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Just Entered Extreme Oversold Levels And Analysts Predict New ATH Targets Rector has previously attempted to ground the $100 discussion in simple market principles. In a post shared earlier this year, he outlined the scale of inflows required to drive XRP to major price milestones using conservative market cap multipliers. According to his estimates, reaching $100 would require between $11 billion and $58 billion in net inflows, assuming a 100x market cap multiplier. Higher targets, such as $1,000, would demand inflows between $118 billion and $589 billion. Therefore, the $100 target is achievable towards the end of the decade, though not without sustained institutional participation and inflows into Spot XRP ETFs.

Meanwhile, the token’s price action favors a bullish Audiera price prediction as positive momentum is quite strong. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that BEAT has gone up by 52% in the past 24 hours alone, pushing the price to $4.50 per token. Meanwhile, trading volumes have jumped by 69% during this period. Volumes currently account for nearly a quarter of the token’s circulating market cap. Audiera has some strong stats to show for. Its official website indicates that over 168,000 wallets are active every weeks. Players can earn rewards through the game that can be cashed out for real money. The project revived a popular dance game that captured the interest of more than 560 million players years ago. By leveraging the power of decentralization and blockchain technology, it aims to turn it into a viral sensation once again by introducing a compensation mechanism. Audiera Price Prediction: BEAT Hits Key Trend Line Resistance as RSI Flashes Overbought Looking at the 4-hour chart, an ascending price channel has formed as a result of BEAT’s latest price action. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) just hit 80 in this lower time frame. This increases the odds of a pullback in the next few days as Audiera has closed with gains in 5 of the last 6 sessions. If the price pulls back after hitting the upper bound of this price channel, Audiera could retreat to around $3 and then resume its upward climb. Although an overbought RSI tends to be bearish in the short term, it is also a clear indication that buying pressure is quite strong. This favors a bullish long-term outlook for the asset. As games like Audiera gain significant popularity, new crypto presales in this space will benefit from this trend. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) could benefit from this trend as this mine-to-earn (M2E) game has rapidly captured investors’ attention. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Makes Mining Fun, Easy, and Hardware-Free Mining cryptocurrencies has always been viewed as a complex activity that requires thousands of dollars invested in expensive equipment. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) is here to change that by introducing a fun M2E that allows players to set up virtual servers and fire up as many mining rigs as they want by simply buying this token. You can upgrade your mining setups to increase output and expand your operation by launching more rigs. Top miners compete for airdrops of tokens like Bonk ($BONK) and Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) as they climb the leaderboard. Up to 70% of the tokens invested in upgrades will be permanently burned, introducing a deflationary twist that will benefit token holders in the long term.

Peter Schiff Sparks Market Debate,https://cryptopotato.com/gold-5k-or-bitcoin-50k-crash-peter-schiff-sparks-market-debate/,"On December 22, long-time Bitcoin (BTC) critic Peter Schiff celebrated gold reaching a new record price above $4,400 and posed a provocative question to his followers. In a poll, he asked which milestone would arrive first: gold hitting $5,000 or Bitcoin’s price collapsing to $50,000, reigniting the long-standing feud between advocates for the precious metal and supporters of digital currency. Gold’s Record Run Reignites the Bitcoin Debate In a post on X, Schiff called gold’s move above $4,400 a clear break from recent sideways trading and asked followers which milestone would arrive first: gold at $5,000, silver at $100, or Bitcoin at $50,000. More than 6,600 people had voted at the time of this writing, with 43.4% backing gold, 37.4% choosing silver, and only 19.2% predicting that Bitcoin would fall to $50,000. Schiff reinforced his stance earlier in the day, saying gold was already more than $40 higher overnight, with silver touching a record $68.50. He further stated that participation was still thin and that many investors had failed to grasp what these price levels mean for trust in traditional stores of value. His comments are consistent with a recent warning he gave that Bitcoin could lose ground to physical metals during a dollar crisis. However, not everyone accepted his latest criticism of the flagship cryptocurrency. On-chain analyst Erik Huisman argued that Bitcoin returning to $50,000 is unrealistic, saying he would only have voted if a $100,000 BTC option were included. Several commentators also weighed in on the math behind the debate. Ounces, an analytics-focused account, noted that gold needs about a 14% rise to hit $5,000, while silver would need to jump 45% to reach $100, making the latter a far steeper climb. User Hassan Al-Shama echoed that view, writing that gold has the shortest path, while Bitcoin would need a drawdown of more than 40% to revisit $50,000. Bitcoin Price Holds as Optimists Push Back Currently, Bitcoin is trading around $90,000, up nearly 1% on the day but slightly lower over the past week. The asset has gained about 7% in the last 30 days, even though it remains around 29% below its all-time high set in October when it flew past $126,000. Short-term movement has been tight, with BTC holding between roughly $88,000 and $90,000 over the past 24 hours, pointing to hesitation rather than panic. While Schiff sees metals winning the trust race, others remain confident BTC will follow gold’s lead. Trader Ash Crypto claimed that Bitcoin has historically moved higher after gold sets new records, while Daniel Tschinkel said liquidity conditions and institutional flows will shape how fast any next leg develops. The clash mirrors the high-profile debate between Schiff and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao in Dubai earlier this month, where online sentiment leaned toward Bitcoin despite Schiff’s criticism.

From commodities to digital assets, long-suppressed instruments are beginning to show signs of structural awakening. Silver, long overshadowed by gold and equities, has re-entered strategic discussions among macro-focused analysts, not as a short-term trade but as a bellwether for bigger cyclical change. Its evolving price structure is now being watched closely, not only for what it signals about commodities, but for what it may foreshadow across other markets still trapped in prolonged consolidation. That broader interpretation was recently emphasized by respected crypto market analyst Dark Defender, who linked silver’s emerging breakout structure to XRP’s long-term price behavior. His analysis positions both assets within the same macro narrative: extended suppression, technical compression, and an eventual volatility expansion phase that historically produces outsized moves once key levels are reclaimed. You now started seeing Silver everywhere. Please take a look at our analysis and thoughts for 2024 and 2025. Please check the levels. Templars and Knights are steps ahead of anyone. #xag is at $67. So what is the upcoming point? My targets for Silver are $80, $140 and beyond.… https://t.co/wlwUxUshi1 pic.twitter.com/9mqlv0PSpb — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) December 21, 2025 Silver’s Multi-Year Compression Nears Resolution Silver’s chart structure over the past decade reveals a market locked in wide consolidation, repeatedly failing to sustain momentum above major resistance zones. However, long-term technical models now suggest that this compression is approaching exhaustion. According to Dark Defender’s framework, silver trading near the $67 region represents more than a nominal price milestone. It marks a structural threshold where historical resistance converges with long-cycle trend dynamics. In previous silver bull phases, acceptance above comparable zones has preceded rapid price discovery, often unfolding faster than market participants anticipate. Dark Defender’s upside projections toward $80, $140, and higher are derived from historical extensions and cyclical fractals rather than short-term speculation, reinforcing the view that silver may be entering a macro expansion phase rather than a fleeting rally. Why the $67 Level Matters From a technical perspective, the $67 area functions as a gateway between consolidation and acceleration. Markets that break above such zones with sustained volume typically encounter limited overhead resistance, allowing price to move aggressively as sidelined capital re-enters. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This behavior has been observed repeatedly in silver’s historical cycles, particularly during periods of monetary stress and shifting liquidity conditions. Dark Defender’s analysis suggests that once silver confirms strength above this level, the probability of continuation toward higher macro targets increases significantly, provided broader market conditions remain supportive. XRP and Silver: A Structural Comparison The parallel drawn between silver and XRP is not rooted in narrative hype but in chart symmetry and market psychology. XRP, like silver, has endured years of constrained price action, shaped by external pressures and prolonged uncertainty. Technically, both assets exhibit long-term accumulation patterns, suppressed volatility, and similar wave structures when viewed on higher time frames. Dark Defender argues that XRP is positioned to experience a repricing event similar in nature, though not in magnitude, to silver’s potential breakout. The core thesis is behavioral: markets that remain undervalued for extended periods tend to overcorrect once structural resistance is removed. A 2024–2025 Macro Outlook Crucially, this outlook is framed within a multi-year horizon. Dark Defender isn’t saying these targets will happen soon, but they’re possible outcomes if things go right in 2024–2025. Invalidations remain part of the framework, underscoring that technical analysis is probabilistic, not predictive. As silver edges closer to long-watched thresholds, its performance may offer valuable insight into how suppressed markets transition into expansion phases. For XRP observers, the implication is clear: history suggests that patience during compression is often the price paid for participation in the next major move.

As the currency pair flirts with the psychologically critical 150 level, traders are bracing for potential Japanese yen intervention that could send shockwaves through global forex market s. This looming currency intervention threat represents one of the most significant near-term risks for currency traders and cryptocurrency investors alike, as traditional finance tremors often ripple into digital asset markets. Why Is Bank of America Sounding the Alarm on USD/JPY? Bank of America ‘s currency strategists have identified January as a particularly vulnerable period for the yen, with several converging factors increasing the likelihood of official action. The bank’s analysis suggests that Japanese authorities are growing increasingly uncomfortable with the yen’s persistent weakness, which threatens to undermine their economic objectives and fuel imported inflation. The timing is crucial—January often sees reduced liquidity in currency markets, which can amplify the impact of any intervention and create volatile trading conditions. The Mechanics of Japanese Yen Intervention: What Traders Must Know Japanese currency intervention isn’t a simple policy announcement—it’s a carefully orchestrated market operation with specific characteristics: Direct Market Operations: The Ministry of Finance instructs the Bank of Japan to sell U.S. dollars and buy yen directly in the open market Surprise Element: Interventions typically occur during Asian trading hours when Tokyo has maximum market influence Verbal Warnings First: Japanese officials usually escalate from verbal warnings to actual intervention Coordinated Action: Sometimes conducted in coordination with other G7 nations for greater impact Previous Intervention Levels USD/JPY Rate Market Impact September 2022 145.90 Yen strengthened 5% immediately October 2022 151.95 Largest intervention since 1998 Potential January 2024 149-151 range Expected significant volatility How Forex Market Dynamics Increase January Intervention Risk The global forex market exhibits particular vulnerabilities in January that could prompt Japanese authorities to act. Seasonal factors including year-end position unwinding, reduced liquidity during holiday periods, and the resumption of normal trading volumes create conditions where intervention can have maximum impact. Bank of America analysts note that Japanese policymakers prefer to intervene when they can achieve “bang for their buck”—making January’s typically thinner markets an attractive window for action if they want to defend the yen. Actionable Insights for Traders Facing Currency Intervention Uncertainty For traders monitoring the USD/JPY pair, several strategic considerations emerge: Monitor Official Rhetoric: Pay close attention to statements from Japanese Finance Ministry officials Watch Technical Levels: The 149-151 range represents a critical danger zone for potential action Consider Volatility Strategies: Options strategies that benefit from increased volatility may be appropriate Prepare for Quick Reversals: Intervention can cause rapid, multi-percentage point moves within hours The Ripple Effects: How Yen Intervention Impacts Global Markets When Japan intervenes in USD/JPY markets, the consequences extend far beyond the currency pair itself. Significant yen strengthening typically causes: Reduced attractiveness of Japanese exports, potentially impacting global supply chains Repricing of carry trades that use yen as funding currency Increased volatility in other Asian currencies that often move in sympathy Potential impact on U.S. Treasury markets as Japan adjusts its foreign reserve management Bank of America’s Track Record: Why This Warning Matters Bank of America has established credibility in forecasting currency market developments, making their intervention warning particularly noteworthy. The bank’s global research team combines macroeconomic analysis with market microstructure insights, giving them a comprehensive view of potential policy actions. Their previous accurate calls on central bank policies and currency movements lend weight to their current assessment of rising Japanese yen intervention risks. Frequently Asked Questions About Potential Yen Intervention What specific conditions would trigger Japanese intervention? Japanese authorities typically consider intervention when they perceive disorderly market conditions, excessive speculation, or moves that don’t reflect economic fundamentals. Rapid, one-way movements in USD/JPY that threaten economic stability are the primary triggers. How effective is currency intervention in the long term? While intervention can produce dramatic short-term effects, its long-term effectiveness depends on alignment with broader monetary policy and fundamental economic factors. Without supportive fundamentals, intervention effects often fade within weeks or months. Which officials are responsible for intervention decisions? The decision rests with Japan’s Ministry of Finance, specifically the Vice Minister of Finance for International Affairs. The Bank of Japan executes the transactions as the ministry’s agent. How much firepower does Japan have for intervention? Japan holds approximately $1.1 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, giving them substantial capacity for intervention. However, they typically use these reserves judiciously to maximize psychological impact. Could cryptocurrency markets be affected by yen intervention? Yes, significant forex market volatility often spills over into cryptocurrency markets, particularly affecting trading pairs involving Japanese yen and potentially increasing volatility across all digital assets during periods of traditional market stress. Conclusion: Navigating the January Intervention Minefield The warning from Bank of America about potential Japanese yen intervention in January serves as a crucial alert for all market participants. As the USD/JPY pair approaches levels that have triggered official action in the past, traders must prepare for potentially explosive moves in the global forex market . While the exact timing and scale of any currency intervention remain uncertain, the elevated risk environment demands heightened vigilance, appropriate risk management, and strategic positioning to navigate what could be a turbulent start to the new trading year.

Complex rules are keeping most overseas individuals from buying shares in these hot offerings. MetaX Integrated Circuits, a chipmaker, saw its stock price shoot up almost 700% when it started trading in Shanghai last week. Moore Threads did even better earlier this month, with shares jumping over 400% o n da y one. There’s plenty of interest from global markets, but foreign retail investors hit a wall trying to access these mainland Chinese initial public offerings. Chris Zhang puts it simply. He’s executive director at China Fortune Securities Company, a Chinese financial services firm. “It’s not even possible. Unless they open up an account with a Chinese broker,” he told CNBC. The problems start right away with basic account requirements. Opening a brokerage account with a Chinese securities company means you need a Chinese bank account first. Getting that bank account usually requires proof that you live in China or a Ch inese visa that hasn’t expired yet. There’s more though. Foreigners also need to already own shares in mainland-listed companies before they can enter the lottery for new stock offerings. Most foreign banks don’t have the right arrangements with Chinese brokerages to help their customers open these accounts, Zhang said. That makes the whole thing impossible for just about everyone living overseas. Only s elect foreigners qualify for d irect A-share trading Shanghai city government guidelines lay out who can directly open brokerage accounts for A-shares—that’s what stocks listed on mainland Chinese exchanges are called. Only certain foreigners qualify. People with permanent resident status can do it. So can foreigner s wo rking in China, or those working abroad who get equity compensation at A-share listed companies. A lot of global investors use Stock Connect instead. It’s a program that links Hong Kong and mainland Chinese exchanges so they can access each other’s stocks. The system lets overseas investors buy A-shares through Hong Kong brokers. No onshore account needed, no special licenses required. But it doesn’t help much with initial public offerings or newly listed companies. Plus Hong Kong brokers have their own rules about who can participate, like minimum account balances and risk disclosure forms. Theodore Shou i s ch ief investment officer at Skybound Capital. “Stock Connect does not work because newly listed stocks are not included in Stock Connect as yet. Usually, it takes a few weeks t o mo nths should the stock s qu alify,” he said. Newly listed stocks face months-long wait for stock connect inclusion Companies have to meet certain standards to get into the Stock Connect program. Things like enough trading activity and market value. That usually means they need some time to build u p tr ading history and data before qualifying. Northbound trading is what they call it when overseas and Hong Kong investors buy mainland China stocks through Stock Connect and other programs. Shou said it won’t be available until “typically several months after any listing.” And even then, Moore Threads and MetaX might not get included. Overseas retail investors do have one option, though it’s limited. They can use offshore funds that invest in A-shares. Foreign retail investors interested in STAR Market IPOs like Moore Threads and MetaX can put money into funds based outside China that buy A-shares, Shou explained. These funds usually participate in IPOs. China’s STAR Market is Shanghai’s tech board, kind of like the Nasdaq. It focuses on strategic sectors—semiconductors, artificial intelligence , bi otech. The board has looser profitability requirements but stricter rules for foreign retail investors. But Shou added a warning. “However, such participation will be indirect, very limited, and mostly non-meaningful.” The IPO allocations are often tiny compared to what the fund holds overall. The performance numbers show what foreign investors are missing out on. The CSI 300 Information Technology Index tracks information technology companies within China’s CSI 300 . It’s up 32% year to date. Compare that with the benchmark CSI 300, which has risen 17%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Tech Index has gained 24% so far this year.

Speaking to David Lin on December 19, Gareth Soloway, Chief Market Strategist at Verified Investing, said Bitcoin’s decline should be viewed through the lens of historical market cycles rather than isolated crypto volatility. “My guess is Bitcoin doesn’t have its normal 75% drawdown like last cycles,” Soloway said . “Instead, look for somewhere in the 40 to 50% drawdown and then look for a base with institutional money accumulating.” Soloway noted that Bitcoin may already be well into that corrective phase. “You have to think it is,” he said when asked whether the drawdown has already begun. “If we look at the chart, peak to trough, we’ve already dropped 36%.” Previous Bitcoin cycle highs back in focus According to Soloway, Bitcoin’s technical structure points to a potential return to the highs of the previous cycle, which now act as a key support zone. “If we look at the chart on Bitcoin, we’re likely headed back to the high of the previous cycle at $69,000,” he said. “That becomes my zone of $69,000 to $74,000. If we do a drawdown from the highs into that range, we’re right in the midst of that 40, about 45% drawdown into that support.” However, Soloway cautioned that a more severe outcome remains possible if broader markets unravel. “If the stock market really collapses and we get a major, major collapse, you know, like a crash-type scenario, then Bitcoin likely would go lower because again, it would just freak out people and they would just dump everything.” Stocks versus Bitcoin in 2026 Soloway’s outlook is closely tied to his bearish view on equities. He argued that Bitcoin’s weakness could be an early warning signal, as historically crypto and stocks tend to move in tandem during major market stress. Assuming a more typical pullback in equities of around 10% to 15% in 2026, Soloway believes Bitcoin could begin to stabilize even as stocks struggle. “I still think Bitcoin will continue to see investors flocking to it away from risk assets,” he said. “For the most part, it’s a risk asset still, but I still think big money is looking at it more as a form of digital gold, and therefore that’ll cushion the downside somewhat.” He also highlighted a growing divergence between traditional markets and Bitcoin. While stocks are up double digits year to date depending on the session, Bitcoin remains down over the same period. When asked whether Bitcoin looks attractive relative to equities at current levels, Soloway was clear. “If I had to right now, yes, I would be accumulating Bitcoin and slowly accumulating on the way down here. Absolutely.” Defensive positioning ahead Soloway warned that excessive leverage and speculative enthusiasm, particularly around artificial intelligence, have left equity markets vulnerable. “We’ve gotten so much money and so much leverage into the stock market at this point,” he said, adding that while AI will transform the economy, margin compression is already emerging beneath the surface. “You’ve got to look for the defensive names now in the stock market in 2026,” Soloway concluded, “and also these ancillary plays like Bitcoin, especially if it comes down to around $70,000.” Watch the full interview with Gareth Soloway below: The post Bitcoin could crash to $69,000 in 2026, warns market strategist appeared first on Finbold .",Cryptocurrency news|Stocks news|Bitcoin|BTC|cryptocurrency|Gareth Soloway|Stocks,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Finbold', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",finbold,2025-12-22 12:11:22

Despite the recent decline that cryptos have experienced, BNB is the top-performing token in the top 5 with year-to-date (YTD) gains of 23%.

Trader Crypto King believes that BNB is at a critical juncture as it just hit a long-dated trend line support. As a result, the token could either bounce strongly off it or drop sharply. Based on his analysis, a decisive bounce could propel BNB back to the $950 level. This means an upside potential of around 10%. Meanwhile, if the price breaks below this key line, it could decline to $700 in the next few weeks. BNB Price Prediction: This Is What BNB Needs to Do to Reverse Its Downtrend The 4-hour chart shows that the price has formed a symmetrical triangle. This indicates an ongoing consolidation and confirms Crypto King’s analysis. The 200-period EMA, along with the upper bound of the triangle, are the key resistance areas to watch. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has sent an early buy signal after rising above the 14-period moving average. This favors a bullish short-term outlook as well. A decisive breakout above $900 could set in motion the next leg up, potentially pushing the price to $1,000 in the near term. This move would invalidate BNB’s bearish structure and should mark the end of the bear market.

The growing adoption rate of the XRP Ledger Protocol could push XRP to an average price of $9.79, with a possible maximum trading value of $10.45 in 2028. In 2031, the target price for XRP is between $15.67 and $16.97, with an average price of $16.32. XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future. Whether it will reach new highs or continue to grow steadily remains to be seen, and despite its history of legal battles with the Securities and Exchange Commission, this digital asset will undoubtedly play an important role in global financial institutions. So, how high can XRP realistically go? Will XRP reach 5 dollars? Let’s answer these questions in our XRP price prediction.

The token gained 0.52% in value. XRP has support at $1.80. On December 22, 2025, XRP shows a mild recovery, but the trend remains largely undecided. The coin is trading near $1.92 after a 0.52% increase in the past 24 hours. The buyers still lack momentum, keeping conditions cautious for bullish traders, as the coin can enter a correction again by the next trading session. XRP price analysis on the daily timeframe The one-day price chart of XRP confirmed an upward market trend for the cryptocurrency. XRP/USD value increased to a $1.92 high in the past 24 hours. A green candlestick on the price chart signifies returning buying momentum. XRP/USD 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is wide as volatility is high. Moreover, the upper band of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, is at $2.17. The lower Bollinger band, indicating support, is at $1.80. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is in the neutral area. The indicator is currently at 42 and moving upward, which marks a slow bullish trend. The buying activities have led to an increase. This ascent is reflected by a slightly upward curve on the RSI graph. If the bullish momentum continues to rise, the market can enter a period of stability. XRP price analysis on the 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis of XRP confirmed a bearish market trend for the cryptocurrency. Its value decreased to $1.92 in the past four hours. The decreasing volatility signals fewer signs of reversal in the coming hours. The Bollinger bands are converging as volatility decreases. This decrease in volatility signals a higher market predictability. Moreover, the upper Bollinger band has shifted to $1.95, indicating the resistance threshold. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band is at a low of $1.87, securing the support. XRP/USD 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is in the neutral zone as it moves downwards. Its value has decreased to index 53 in the past few hours. The curve on the RSI graph confirms a negative trend as the indicator’s score decreases.

As a result, the coin value has recovered to $1.92 because of the increasing momentum today. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple, along with the rising adoption, might boost the XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisitions and CBDC developments make XRP a good long-term investment option. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. It is advised to proceed with caution. Why is XRP up? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has increased as buying momentum picked up, driving the coin’s price to $1.92. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $2.26 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? If demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent, the coin could approach $5 by 2026. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.65, achieved on July 18, 2025. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a chance of reaching near $20 by 2031. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Still, the token provides a good buying opportunity to investors looking for long-term goals. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is expected to reach a maximum price of $16 by 2031, making it a valuable asset, particularly with the continued efforts of Ripple Labs. However, some regulatory uncertainties still exist for XRP. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research.

XRP historic price sentiment XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted to as low as $0.31, significantly decreasing XRP market cap. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. By the middle of May, XRP touched $2.57, and in July, it marked a new all-time high of $3.65. Near the start of August 2025, XRP was trending above $3, showing significant growth as the market sentiment was tilting toward the positive side; however, it lost $3 by the end of the month. In October through November, XRP traded around $1.83 to $3.10. At the start of December, XRP is trading around $1.99 to $2.18.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|XRP|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-22 12:21:36

The transfer of 1,200 BTC, valued at a staggering $108 million, alongside 10,000 ETH, marks a watershed moment for institutional cryptocurrency adoption. This isn’t just a large transaction; it’s a powerful signal about the future of digital assets. Let’s dive into what this means for Bitcoin, the market, and you. What Does This Massive BlackRock Bitcoin Deposit Actually Mean? When a firm managing over $10 trillion in assets moves over $100 million into Bitcoin, you pay attention. This BlackRock Bitcoin deposit to Coinbase Prime is far more significant than a simple trade. Coinbase Prime is a specialized platform built for heavyweight institutional players, offering top-tier security, deep liquidity, and comprehensive custody services. Therefore, BlackRock’s use of this platform indicates a strategic, long-term operational move into crypto, not a speculative dabble. This action builds directly on BlackRock’s established crypto trajectory. The firm launched a spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), which has become one of the most successful ETF launches in history. This deposit could be related to supporting that ETF’s liquidity or part of a broader treasury strategy. Either way, it demonstrates a deepening commitment to integrating Bitcoin into traditional finance frameworks. Why Is Institutional Adoption Like This So Crucial for Bitcoin? Think of Bitcoin’s journey in two phases: the pioneering retail phase and the institutional adoption phase. We are now firmly in the latter. Moves like the BlackRock Bitcoin deposit provide three key benefits for the entire ecosystem: Enhanced Legitimacy: It acts as a stamp of approval, encouraging other large, cautious institutions to follow suit. Market Stability: Institutional capital tends to be more long-term focused, which can reduce extreme volatility driven by retail sentiment. Infrastructure Development: Demand from giants like BlackRock forces the creation of more robust, secure, and regulated financial products and services around crypto. However, this shift is not without its challenges. Increased institutional involvement leads to greater regulatory scrutiny. Furthermore, some purists argue it moves Bitcoin away from its decentralized roots. Despite these concerns, the net effect of bringing trillions of dollars of traditional capital into the space is overwhelmingly viewed as positive for growth and stability. What Can We Learn from BlackRock’s Strategic Move? BlackRock doesn’t make $108 million moves on a whim. Their strategy offers actionable insights for all market observers. First, it highlights the importance of using regulated, institutional-grade platforms for serious capital. For other corporations or large investors, the path is now clearly paved. Second, it reinforces Bitcoin’s primary narrative as a digital store of value, often called ‘digital gold.’ Institutions are treating it as a strategic asset on their balance sheet. Finally, pairing the Bitcoin deposit with a substantial Ethereum transfer shows that smart, diversified exposure to the crypto asset class is becoming standard practice at the highest levels. The Future After a Landmark BlackRock Bitcoin Deposit This event is likely a precursor, not an endpoint. We can expect other asset managers and corporate treasuries to accelerate their own digital asset strategies. The flow of institutional capital into Bitcoin and Ethereum is poised to become a steady stream, fundamentally altering market dynamics. Price discovery will increasingly be driven by large-scale, long-term allocation decisions alongside retail trading. In conclusion, BlackRock’s $108 million BlackRock Bitcoin deposit is a monumental vote of confidence. It transcends a single transaction, representing a pivotal moment where the world’s largest traditional finance player is actively building its future with Bitcoin. This move solidifies crypto’s position in the mainstream financial landscape and sets the stage for the next chapter of unprecedented growth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Coinbase Prime? A1: Coinbase Prime is a specialized brokerage and custody platform designed for institutional investors like hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations. It offers services tailored for large-scale trading and secure asset storage. Q2: Why did BlackRock deposit Bitcoin to Coinbase Prime and not just hold it themselves? A2: Managing private keys for hundreds of millions in crypto requires immense security expertise and infrastructure. Using a qualified custodian like Coinbase Prime is the standard, secure practice for institutions, mitigating risk and ensuring regulatory compliance. Q3: Does this deposit mean BlackRock is bullish on Bitcoin’s price? A3: While not a direct price prediction, a strategic deposit of this size indicates a strong, long-term belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition as an asset class. It suggests they see it as a viable component of a modern investment portfolio. Q4: How does this affect the average Bitcoin investor? A4: It generally provides positive long-term momentum. Institutional adoption increases legitimacy, can reduce volatility, and drives development of better investment products (like ETFs), making it easier and safer for everyone to gain exposure. Q5: What was the value of the Ethereum deposited alongside the Bitcoin? A5: BlackRock deposited 10,000 ETH, which was worth approximately $30.5 million at the time of the transaction, showing a significant diversified investment into the crypto ecosystem. Q6: Is this related to BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT)?

However, a stark warning from on-chain analysts suggests this year’s festivities might bring more coal than cheer. Recent data reveals a concerning trend: the Bitcoin Santa rally has been losing its magic, with increasing selling pressure threatening short-term gains. Let’s unpack what this means for your portfolio. Is the Bitcoin Santa Rally Losing Its Power? For years, the end-of-year period has been associated with positive momentum for Bitcoin. However, analysis of the past five years paints a different picture. According to on-chain analyst Ardi, the Bitcoin Santa rally has shown a clear trend of diminishing returns. While 2020 saw an impressive 34.5% surge, subsequent year-end performances have progressively weakened when excluding that outlier. This pattern indicates that the seasonal boost may be becoming less reliable, prompting investors to question its future potency. Why Are Bitcoin Whales Creating Selling Pressure? The current market dynamic reveals a crucial shift in behavior among large holders. Since early December, Bitcoin whales—entities holding large amounts of BTC—have been incrementally selling their holdings. Their strategy appears to capitalize on buying enthusiasm from retail investors during the holiday period. This creates a direct selling pressure that can suppress prices. Key observations include: Whales are distributing coins to realize profits. Retail buying is being met with institutional selling. The net effect is a potential ceiling on short-term price appreciation. This activity suggests a tactical move by sophisticated players, turning the anticipated rally into a potential trap for the unwary. How Does the Current Phase Compare to 2021? Context is critical in cryptocurrency markets. Ardi notes that Bitcoin is currently in a similar post-halving phase to 2021. That year, the digital asset recorded a 7.9% decline during the same holiday period. This historical parallel is significant because halving events are major supply shocks that typically precede bull markets. However, the interim period can be volatile. The comparison to 2021 suggests we might be in a consolidation or distribution phase before the next major upward leg, rather than a straightforward seasonal rally. What Should Investors Do Amid This Warning? Facing a potential weakening Bitcoin Santa rally and heightened selling pressure , a cautious approach is prudent. The analyst’s warning is not necessarily a call to exit the market but a reminder to manage risk. Consider these actionable insights: Avoid FOMO Buying: Chasing prices during a suspected distribution phase can lead to buying at local tops. Monitor On-Chain Data: Keep an eye on whale wallet movements and exchange flows for real-time signals. Focus on the Long-Term: Short-term holiday trends should not override a sound long-term investment thesis based on fundamentals. The key is to separate seasonal noise from the underlying cycle driven by adoption, regulation, and macroeconomic factors. The Bottom Line on Bitcoin’s Seasonal Trend The data presents a compelling narrative: the famed Bitcoin Santa rally is facing strong headwinds. A combination of weakening historical returns and active distribution by whales creates a challenging environment for short-term bulls. While the holiday spirit is about optimism, smart investing requires a clear-eyed view of the evidence. The current setup advises vigilance over exuberance, suggesting that the most significant gifts for crypto investors may come after the season ends, once the selling pressure subsides and the market finds a firmer footing. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin Santa Rally? The Bitcoin Santa rally refers to a perceived seasonal trend where the price of Bitcoin tends to rise in the final weeks of December and into the new year, akin to a stock market “Santa Claus rally.” Why is the Santa rally weakening for Bitcoin? Analysis shows diminishing year-end returns over recent years, potentially due to increased market efficiency, larger institutional presence changing seasonal patterns, or profit-taking by large holders (whales) capping gains. What does ‘selling pressure’ mean in this context? It refers to a measurable increase in the selling of Bitcoin by large holders (whales), which offsets buying demand and can prevent prices from rising or even push them lower in the short term. Should I sell my Bitcoin because of this analysis? Not necessarily. This analysis highlights a short-term risk. Investment decisions should align with your long-term strategy, risk tolerance, and broader market fundamentals, not just one seasonal indicator. How can I track whale selling pressure? You can monitor on-chain metrics via various analytics platforms that track large wallet movements, exchange inflows (which can signal intent to sell), and the balance of coins held by different wallet size cohorts. Is the post-halving phase still bullish for Bitcoin? Historically, yes. Post-halving periods have preceded major bull markets. However, the journey is not linear, and phases of consolidation or correction are common before parabolic moves. Found this analysis of the Bitcoin Santa rally and selling pressure insightful?
