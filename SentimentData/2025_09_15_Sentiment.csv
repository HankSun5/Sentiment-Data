This ratio measures Ethereum’s value relative to Bitcoin, offering insights into which of these crypto giants is currently outperforming the other. Recently, however, this crucial indicator has faced significant headwinds. Despite a wave of institutional interest in Ethereum and ETH itself reaching impressive new all-time highs, the ETH/BTC ratio has notably failed to reclaim the critical 0.05 level. This persistent struggle raises important questions for investors and market watchers alike. What exactly is holding Ethereum back from truly breaking free of Bitcoin’s gravitational pull? Understanding the ETH/BTC Ratio: A Key Metric for Investors The ETH/BTC ratio is more than just a number; it’s a barometer for market sentiment and capital flow between the two largest cryptocurrencies. When the ratio rises, it suggests that capital is flowing from Bitcoin into Ethereum, indicating stronger confidence or higher growth expectations for ETH. Conversely, a falling ratio often points to Bitcoin’s relative strength or a broader market shift towards the perceived safety of BTC. Understanding this dynamic is vital for anyone navigating the crypto space. It helps investors gauge potential shifts in market leadership and adjust their portfolios accordingly. Historical Performance: Why Has the ETH/BTC Ratio Faced Resistance? Looking back at history provides crucial context for the current performance of the ETH/BTC ratio . On-chain analyst James Check highlighted that Ethereum has only outperformed Bitcoin during roughly 15% of its existence. Its most significant bull runs, where ETH truly shone, occurred between 2015 and 2017. This period was characterized by groundbreaking innovations like the introduction of smart contracts and the explosive ICO boom, which were unique to Ethereum at the time. However, since 2020, Bitcoin has largely maintained a relative advantage. This suggests that while Ethereum brings innovation, Bitcoin often retains its position as the market’s primary store of value and first mover. The recent struggle below 0.05 continues this trend, even as Ethereum’s ecosystem expands. The Paradox of Institutional Interest: What’s Holding ETH Back? It seems counterintuitive, doesn’t it? Ethereum is attracting substantial institutional interest, with new investment products and corporate adoption on the rise. Yet, the ETH/BTC ratio remains stubbornly below 0.05. This paradox can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, institutional capital often prioritizes established assets with clear regulatory pathways, and Bitcoin, as the pioneer, still holds an edge in this regard. Secondly, while institutional demand for ETH is growing, it might not yet be strong enough to consistently outpace Bitcoin’s broader market dominance or absorb profit-taking pressure. Moreover, the sheer size and liquidity of Bitcoin’s market mean it can often absorb large inflows without significant price impact on the ratio, while Ethereum’s movements are more reactive. Expert Outlook: What’s Next for the ETH/BTC Ratio? So, what does the future hold for the ETH/BTC ratio ? Analysts offer mixed perspectives. Jake Kennish from Nansen, a crypto data analytics firm, predicted that Ethereum might be due for a short-term correction. As ETH hovers near its previous all-time highs, some consolidation is natural before a potential new peak. He suggested it could take several weeks or even months for Ethereum to establish a truly new price ceiling and, consequently, influence the ratio more significantly. Investors should watch for catalysts such as major Ethereum network upgrades (like the upcoming Dencun or future Pectra upgrades), which could inject new life and utility into the ecosystem, potentially boosting the ETH/BTC ratio . Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Investors For investors, understanding the current state of the ETH/BTC ratio offers valuable insights. Diversify Wisely: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. While Ethereum has immense potential, Bitcoin’s stability often provides a foundational layer for crypto portfolios. Monitor Key Events: Keep an eye on Ethereum’s development roadmap, especially major upgrades. These can be significant catalysts for price action and ratio shifts. Analyze Market Sentiment: Understand whether the broader market is in a “risk-on” phase (favoring altcoins like ETH) or a “risk-off” phase (favoring Bitcoin). Long-Term Vision: Both assets have strong fundamentals. Short-term fluctuations in the ETH/BTC ratio should be viewed within a broader, long-term investment strategy. Remember, market analysis is crucial, and staying informed about both Bitcoin and Ethereum’s individual trajectories is key. Summary: The Enduring Battle for Crypto Dominance The ongoing struggle of the ETH/BTC ratio below 0.05 highlights the complex dynamics at play within the cryptocurrency market. Despite Ethereum’s innovative strength and growing institutional appeal, Bitcoin’s historical dominance and market depth continue to exert significant influence. While experts predict potential short-term corrections for ETH, the long-term outlook remains tied to Ethereum’s ability to deliver on its technological promises and attract sustained, deep institutional capital. For now, the battle for crypto dominance continues, making the ETH/BTC ratio a fascinating indicator to watch. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does the ETH/BTC ratio signify? A1: The ETH/BTC ratio indicates Ethereum’s value relative to Bitcoin. A rising ratio suggests Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin, while a falling ratio means Bitcoin is showing stronger relative performance. It helps investors understand capital flow between the two assets. Q2: Why is the ETH/BTC ratio struggling to reclaim 0.05? A2: The ETH/BTC ratio is struggling due to several factors, including Bitcoin’s historical dominance since 2020, its perceived status as a safer institutional asset, and the market’s absorption of new ETH supply or profit-taking. Despite institutional interest in ETH, it hasn’t yet translated into sustained outperformance against BTC. Q3: Has Ethereum ever significantly outperformed Bitcoin? A3: Yes, Ethereum significantly outperformed Bitcoin during its early years, particularly between 2015 and 2017. This period was driven by the introduction of smart contracts and the ICO boom, which were revolutionary developments unique to Ethereum. Q4: What role does institutional interest play in the ETH/BTC ratio? A4: While institutional interest in Ethereum is growing, it’s not always enough to consistently boost the ETH/BTC ratio above key resistance levels. Institutional capital often flows into Bitcoin first due to its established nature and regulatory clarity. However, sustained institutional adoption of Ethereum could become a long-term catalyst. Q5: What factors could help improve the ETH/BTC ratio in the future? A5: Future Ethereum network upgrades (like Dencun or Pectra), increased utility and adoption of decentralized applications (dApps), and a broader market shift towards “risk-on” assets could potentially help improve the ETH/BTC ratio . Continued, deep institutional investment into Ethereum-specific products would also be a significant driver. Did this analysis of the ETH/BTC ratio help you understand the market better?

While XRP continues to attract institutional focus, many investors are widening their scope and looking at new altcoin projects with a mix of low pricing and strong adoption signals. One such project that is generating a lot of attention from investors and analysts right now is Remittix (RTX), an Ethereum-based PayFi solution showing strong performance. XRP News Shows Strong Ripple Price Performance Ripple remains in a rising trend channel in the medium term. This steady upward structure signals that investor demand for XRP is intact. The Ripple price recently broke through a short-term resistance level, leaving analysts to speculate if that upwards momentum could eventually lead to the XRP price hitting the $3.35 resistance level as well. However, investors remain cautious because if the Ripple price fails to hold above the $3.10 level, it could invite sellers, which will, in turn, lead to the price being dragged back toward $2.77. While bullish interest remains, investors are also looking to lock in positions on lower-priced opportunities in upcoming crypto projects that offer significant upside. Why Investors Are Watching Remittix Closely Amid the XRP news, Remittix has positioned itself as a new altcoin to watch. Built as a PayFiproject solving real-world problems, it enables cross-border transfers across 30+ countries. This utility-driven approach sets it apart from speculative tokens. Remittix’s utility is a key feature of why investors are paying attention to the cross-border payment solution. But the numbers also tell an interesting story. The numbers tell their own story. Remittix has already raised over $25.5 million, sold more than 660 million tokens, and remains priced at just $0.1080, firmly placing it among the top crypto under $1. Exchange milestones are also coming fast, with listings on Tier-1 CEXs like BitMartand LBANK confirmed already. Adding to the momentum, the Remittix Beta Wallet is launching on September 15, further streamlining crypto-powered global payments. Other key attention drivers pulling investors into Remittix include: ● $250,000 community giveaway to boost adoption efforts● Strong presale performance with over $25.5 million raised and more than 660 million tokens sold.● Global design with support for 30 fiat currencies and over 50 cryptocurrencies● Remittix also has a referral program paying 15% in USDT live, which has become a talking point among investors. The latest XRP news shows Ripple price action holding key support, but the upside remains dependent on breaking resistance at $3.35. As such, investors are looking more at Remittix to deliver better momentum and performance.

It announced the launch of the USDH HIP-1 and ERC-20, following its acquisition of the USDH ticker. Native Markets has officially been awarded the USDH ticker on Hyperliquid, after a community governance process involving HYPE stakers and network validators, who reviewed competing proposals for the native stablecoin of the Hyperliquid perpetual futures DEX. Native Markets has secured the USDH ticker The competition for the USDH ticker on Hyperliquid saw participation from some of the biggest names in the stablecoin and DeFi space, with Paxos, Frax Finance, Sky and Agora all submitting proposals. Other contenders, including Ethena, OpenEden, Curve, BitGo, and Bastion, submitted or considered proposals, though some either withdrew or failed to generate the same momentum as Native Market. While announcing this milestone, Native Markets expressed appreciation to the Hyperliquid community. “Thank you to all HYPE stakers and network validators for their time and effort in reviewing the proposals put forward,” Native Markets stated in its announcement. They also noted “deep respect” for the other projects that submitted competing proposals, emphasizing their excitement about seeing different teams execute on their visions for the Hyperliquid ecosystem.

Recent market movements suggest exciting times ahead for holders and traders alike. A detailed XRP price analysis reveals that the digital asset has made a significant move, breaking out of a long-term falling wedge pattern. This development is catching the attention of analysts and could signal a renewed potential for a sustained rally. What Does This Crucial Breakout Mean for XRP Price Analysis? For weeks, XRP has been consolidating, forming what technical analysts call a ‘falling wedge’ pattern. This pattern is generally considered bullish, often preceding an upward price reversal. The recent breakout from this multi-month formation on the daily chart is a strong indicator of changing market sentiment. According to reports from CryptoPotato, XRP successfully halted its previous decline precisely at the 100-day simple moving average (SMA). This key technical level often acts as a dynamic support or resistance, and holding above it is a positive sign for future price action. Furthermore, the asset decisively breached the upper resistance line of the falling wedge pattern, confirming the breakout. Examining the Bullish Momentum: A Deeper Look at XRP Price Analysis The bullish signals don’t stop there. CryptoPotato also highlighted that a similar breakout from a multi-month falling wedge pattern was observed on the four-hour chart. This dual confirmation across different timeframes often indicates robust and classic bullish momentum, giving traders and investors more confidence in the move. Key takeaways from the breakout: Daily Chart Confirmation: A long-term falling wedge pattern has been successfully broken. 100-Day SMA Support: XRP found strong support at this crucial moving average, preventing further downside. Four-Hour Chart Alignment: A similar pattern breakout on a shorter timeframe reinforces the bullish outlook. These technical indicators, when combined, paint a compelling picture for the immediate future of XRP. Understanding these patterns is fundamental to effective XRP price analysis . What Are the Next Price Targets in This XRP Price Analysis? With the breakout confirmed, many are wondering about the potential next steps for XRP’s price. The analysis from CryptoPotato provides some initial targets based on this bullish development. It suggests that if XRP can successfully maintain stable support at the $3 mark, it could pave the way for further short-term increases. Specifically, the outlet indicated a potential short-term increase to $3.4. It’s important to remember that these are projections based on technical analysis and market dynamics can change. However, holding key support levels after a breakout is often critical for sustaining upward trajectories. Important price levels to watch: Immediate Support: Maintaining above the former resistance line of the falling wedge. Crucial Support: The $3 level, as noted by CryptoPotato, is vital for further upside. Short-Term Target: A move towards $3.4 is anticipated if support holds. This phase requires careful monitoring, as sustained buying pressure and volume will be necessary to achieve these targets. Effective XRP price analysis always involves watching both technical patterns and trading volume. Why is This XRP Price Analysis So Important Right Now? The significance of this breakout extends beyond just technical charts. In the broader cryptocurrency landscape, a strong move from a major altcoin like XRP can often signal renewed investor confidence in the wider market. After periods of consolidation or decline, such breakouts can act as catalysts, attracting new capital and reinvigorating bullish sentiment. Furthermore, the legal clarity surrounding Ripple (the company behind XRP) continues to evolve, which can significantly influence investor perception and, consequently, XRP’s market performance. A positive technical signal, combined with potential regulatory clarity, creates a powerful narrative for potential growth. Challenges to consider: While the technical signals are strong, the crypto market is inherently volatile. Factors such as macroeconomic events, regulatory changes, and overall market sentiment can always influence price action. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider these broader influences. In conclusion, the recent breakout of XRP from its falling wedge pattern is a highly positive development for the asset. This technical move, supported by key moving averages and confirmed across multiple timeframes, suggests a strong potential for further upside. While specific price targets like $3.4 are on the horizon according to expert XRP price analysis , maintaining crucial support levels will be key to sustaining this momentum. As always, staying informed and understanding market dynamics is paramount for navigating the exciting world of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions About XRP Price Analysis Q1: What is a falling wedge pattern in cryptocurrency trading? A1: A falling wedge is a bullish chart pattern that forms when the price consolidates downward between two converging, downward-sloping trendlines. It typically signals that buying pressure is slowly overcoming selling pressure, often leading to a breakout to the upside. Q2: Why is the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) important for XRP? A2: The 100-day SMA is a widely watched technical indicator that represents the average closing price of XRP over the past 100 days. It often acts as a significant support or resistance level, and prices holding above it are generally seen as bullish, while falling below it can indicate weakness. Q3: Does this breakout guarantee XRP’s price will reach $3.4? A3: No, technical analysis provides probabilities, not guarantees. While the breakout is a strong bullish signal, and targets like $3.4 are projected by some analyses (like CryptoPotato’s), market conditions can change rapidly. It’s essential to monitor other factors like trading volume and overall market sentiment. Q4: What other factors should I consider when performing XRP price analysis? A4: Beyond technical patterns, consider fundamental factors such as developments within the Ripple ecosystem, regulatory news, partnerships, adoption rates, and the broader cryptocurrency market trends. Macroeconomic conditions and investor sentiment also play significant roles. Q5: How can I stay updated on XRP’s market movements? A5: To stay informed, follow reputable cryptocurrency news outlets, engage with expert analysts on social media, use reliable charting platforms, and consider setting price alerts.

Worldcoin, Chainlink, and Pi Coin remain in the pool, with each having its own offer in decentralized identity, smart contracts, and mobile-first onboarding. These are accompanied by Remittix (RTX) as a new altcoin to watch out for, especially as it is planning on releasing a beta wallet this September. This blend of old veterans and fresh opportunities is shaping the investment decision for people who are looking to invest in early stage crypto. Best Crypto To Invest In Today: Worldcoin, Chainlink, and Pi Coin Worldcoin is building global identity and finance, with its token at a price of $1.60 and market cap being $3.23 billion, although daily volume declined 26.21% to $592.01 million. Chainlink is still the backbone of the DeFi project economy, up 3.81% on a 24-hour basis to $24.54, supported by a $17.14 billion market cap and $1.17 billion in trading volume. Pi Coin also picked up pace, rising 3.21% to $0.3630, as its trading volume rose 52.24% to $70.67 million, signaling increased retail purchasing. These coins are repeatedly on top crypto to invest in today's lists, but the quest for low cap crypto gems is shifting focus elsewhere. That is where Remittix entered the conversation, building to solve very real issues in cross-border payments. Remittix: Utility Beyond Speculation Priced at $0.1080 per token, Remittix has already collected over $25.5 million in presale, selling over 660 million tokens. At the center are direct bank-to-crypto transfers in 30+ nations, real-time FX conversion, and the support of 40+ cryptocurrencies. The team just announced the wallet beta launch on September 15, with users being given a mobile-first utility to deal with crypto at low gas fees. To many, this is among the best crypto presales 2025 as it offers genuine infrastructure and not all hype. Why Remittix Is Picking Up Pace ● Wallet beta release on Sept 15, 2025● Over $25.5Million presale funding raised, 660Million+ tokens sold● 15% referral rewards paid daily in USDT● CEX listings revealed: BitMart and LBank Momentum in Community and Listings The main feature of the Remittix platform is its referral scheme, remunerating participants with 15% of their buyback as USDT. Combined with the $250,000 Remittix Giveaway, this has generated a strong word-of-mouth momentum. Milestones continue to roll in too. After reaching $20Million, the project made its initial exchange listing on BitMart. At $22Million, it went public with LBank being its second exchange partner. These are steps that make RTX more than just another crypto presale present today, but a project operating in tandem with mainstream adoption tactics. When discussing the Best Crypto To Buy Now, Worldcoin, Chainlink, and Pi Coin come to mind immediately. But Remittix offers something unique — a pure use case in cross-border remittances, health-oriented community incentives, and a product launch beginning this quarter. For those on the watch for the next significant altcoin 2025, RTX brings the qualities of a crypto addressing real-world problems together with the speed of one of the fastest-growing crypto presales. With the release of the wallet on the horizon, it is increasingly being considered something rather more than a presale token — potentially the next iteration in cross-border payments.

But while ADA offers steady growth, Remittix is emerging as the exciting new contender. With its ambitious global payments vision and aggressive reward program, it is positioning itself as a potential breakout star in the next bull cycle. This PayFi token is rapidly attracting investors. Together, these two projects highlight where investors are placing their bets in 2025. But which crypto assets will dominate the next cycle and deliver 40x returns in 2025? Cardano Shows Signs of Strength Recent updates from founder Charles Hoskinson confirmed that the Plomin hard fork will introduce decentralised governance. This could drive adoption and give the community more control over the network. Even with this uncertainty, Cardano continues to post steady trading volumes, and it appears major holders are still committed, even though analysts say ADA may not deliver quick profits. Source: Trading View Cardano (ADA) is trading around $0.90 with a market cap above $33 billion, and many long-term investors view it as one of the best cryptos under $1, with the potential to climb back toward its previous $3.10 high. According to the recent trading data, ADA is facing some selling pressure, with its daily chart forming a gravestone doji that signals short-term bearish momentum. This points to a possible pullback. Hence, many investors are shifting part of their ADA holdings into newer opportunities. Remittix: The High-Risk, High-Reward Play Unlike many early-stage projects, Remittix is moving aggressively in a different direction. It already has a working product roadmap and a full audit from CertiK. The project has raised more than $25.5 million, sold over 660 million tokens, and secured listings on BitMart and LBANK, with more exchanges on the horizon. This PayFi project is targeting the $19 trillion cross-border payments industry by enabling users to send cryptocurrency directly to bank accounts in over 30 countries. With a referral program offering 15% USDT rewards daily, staking opportunities, and strong adoption prospects, analysts believe this token could realistically deliver a 40x return in the coming cycle. While Cardano is building steadily, at just $0.10 per token, Remittix is attracting investors who are drawn to its potential upside. The Crypto With 40x Potential in 2025 For those seeking steady, long-term growth, Cardano remains a reliable choice.

Already priced at $0.1080 per token, Remittix has already surpassed more than $25.5 million in pre-sale. With a guaranteed listing on the centralized exchanges and a long-awaited beta wallet launch scheduled for this September, the project is rapidly becoming a hotspot for traders seeking the next breakout altcoin of 2025. Solana Price Outlook And Sentiment Solana is at $238.75, a slight 0.2% intraday decline. Its market cap sits at $129.33 billion, and trading volume has dropped over 25% to $8.95 billion. Though the figures are not in its favor, the majority of SOL holders are now weighing exposure to future crypto projects that are centered around addressing concrete real-world problems rather than purely speculative. That is where Remittix comes in. Contrary to hype-based meme tokens or Layer 2 Ethereum answers, Remittix offers an applicable link between decentralized finance and old-fashioned banking. Its architecture directly addresses issues in the $19 trillion global payments market, which is why it is attractive to individuals interested in a best long-term crypto investment. Beta Wallet Launch On September 15 Remittix's greatest achievement is its release of a beta wallet on September 15. The wallet supports 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies, with direct crypto-to-bank payments accepted in 30+ countries. In addition, the wallet boasts transparent real-time FX conversion to lower friction for freelancers, businesses, and regular remitters. This phone-first product forms the foundation of Remittix's mission as a low gas fee cryptocurrency project. By the utilization of simplicity, low fees, and borderless access, it stands out from moonshot coins and becomes one of the top DeFi projects of 2025. Presale Growth, Listings, And Referral Rewards Remittix presale has already surpassed $25.5 million, selling 660 million tokens at $0.1080 per token. Those milestones prompted early centralized exchange listings, first BitMart after the $20 million milestone and subsequently LBank after crossing $22 million. Community incentives additionally encourage adoption. A 15% USDT referral program enables members to accumulate rewards instantly via the dashboard, while a $250,000 giveaway is underway to broaden reach. These features highlight how Remittix is building liquidity, trust, and awareness prior to public launch. The Engines Behind Remittix’s Rapid Progress ● $25.5 million + raised in presale with 660 million + tokens sold● BitMart and LBank confirmed listings● September 15 beta wallet release● $250,000 community giveaway ongoing The overall Solana price outlook is still applicable, but the focus is moving towards tokens with known real-world adoption. As its wallet launch comes close, CEX listings are confirmed, and community rewards continue, Remittix is establishing itself as among the leading crypto under $1 and one of the most promising emerging crypto projects of the year.

Both coins' healthy ecosystem and Shiba Inu's growing community maintain them in the running, but attention is also being drawn toward upcoming projects that are starting to build early momentum. Among the most promising of these is Remittix (RTX), which currently sits at $0.1080 per token and has become one of the fast-rising altcoins with a clear use case. While ETH and SHIB remain to hold headlines, RTX is building steadily towards becoming the next biggie to keep an eye on. Ethereum Price Forecast and Shiba Inu Market Sentiment Ethereum has established itself as one of the leading blockchains, with healthy DeFi, staking, and smart contract adoption growth. At selling price $4,718.02, ETH has increased by 4.25% over the past 24 hours, reaching a market cap of $569.61 billion. Volume trading is also up, rising by 20.63%, to $41.66 billion, showing growing investor interest. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu Price momentum has been more grass-roots. SHIB is trading at $0.00001459, which accounts for a 10.03% day-to-day increase, with its market capitalization at $8.59 billion. Trade volume surged to $562.73 million, a staggering 134.83% increase, showing that Shiba Inu Coin is still attracting retail mania. Most SHIB owners are now contemplating other newer crypto ventures that possibly offer more real-world utility. Why Remittix Is Gaining Attention This is where Remittix enters the scene. Unlike meme coins or hype altcoins, Remittix DeFi project is built to solve a gigantic global issue: cross-border payments. It allows for crypto-to-fiat transfers to bank accounts across over 30 countries with minimal gas charges and settlement speed near-instant. The project has raised more than $25.5 million during its presale, with more than 660 million RTX tokens being sold. Success in presale has lined up future listings on BitMart and LBank, providing added liquidity and visibility on centralized exchanges. This positions RTX as more than a standard crypto presale of 2025, but a serious contender for long-term adoption. Key Drivers: Wallet Beta and Referral Program One of the key drivers of Remittix is the release of the September 15th wallet beta, which will give early adopters a first-hand feel of its mobile-first payment system. The wallet will include real-time FX conversion, fiat onboarding, and easy onboarding for crypto natives as well as new adopters. Equally exciting is the Remittix referral program, rewarding 15% instant USDT incentives for every new buyer referred. Rewards can be accrued daily, making it a strong choice for community building and passive rewards. With the inclusion of the $250,000 RemittixGiveaway, excitement continues to grow around this quickly growing project. ● Real-World Utility: Crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries● Wallet Launch: Beta launch on September 15th● Presale Growth: $25.5M+ raised and growing● Referral Rewards: 15% paid out daily in USDT As Ethereum and Shiba Inu updates continue to sit at the top of investors' lists, projects like Remittix are building the next generation of crypto adoption. At just $0.1080 per token, RTX is an emerging altcoin to watch with robust fundamentals, utility-based design, and growing market adoption. For those who want something more than ETH and SHIB in 2025, Remittix may be the next big crypto release to watch.

Yet, beyond meme coins, PayFi altcoins like Remittix are setting new benchmarks, raising over $25.5 million through the sale of 660 million tokens at $0.1080 each and emerging as the best crypto project 2025 investors are calling the next 100x crypto. PEPE Price Prediction Shows Explosive Potential Source: CryptOpus The PEPE price prediction has become a focal point after the token surged nearly 20% to $0.00001252 , backed by a staggering 280% increase in daily trading volume. Analysts highlight that PEPE has confirmed a breakout from a descending channel, turning the momentum in favor of buyers. Resistance sits near $0.0000130, with projections aiming for $0.0000160 and eventually $0.0000300 if strength holds. A recent $16 million whale buy further validates bullish sentiment, while CoinGlass data showing exchange outflows underpins the narrative. With its breakout structure and increasing adoption among traders, the PEPE price prediction suggests sharper volatility but also greater upside than other meme coins. Dogecoin News Adds Momentum to Meme Coins Source: Emilio Bojan/ TradingView Dogecoin news has fueled additional excitement, particularly with CleanCore acquiring over 500 million DOGE worth $148 million and positioning itself as an official Dogecoin treasury company. This corporate move echoes Bitcoin’s role as a balance sheet asset and highlights DOGE’s growing institutional relevance. Meanwhile, the long-hyped U.S. Dogecoin ETF by Rex-Osprey (ticker: DOJE) will become the first ETF to track a meme coin regulated in the U.S. Today, Dogecoin price has shot up over 8 percent, bursting through resistance areas and reaching a temporary high of $0.306. Currently, with a support of around $0.255, and the technical indicators that read green, the most recent Dogecoin news is indicating a consistent rise in momentum and institutional credibility of the token. Remittix Leads The PayFi Revolution While the PEPE price prediction and Dogecoin news highlight short-term catalysts, Remittix is building the foundation for long-term success. The PayFi project has broken records by raising over $25.5 million and is now entering a phase that could drive mass adoption. Why Remittix Stands Out ● Confirmed CEX listings on BitMart and LBank boost market access.● A $250,000 giveaway rewards early community members and fuels buzz.● PayFi infrastructure enables near-instant international payments.● Beta wallet launch on September 15 introduces live FX conversion tools.● 15% USDT referral rewards, claimable every 24 hours in the dashboard, supercharge organic growth. Remittix aims to make cross-border moves faster and cheaper. That utility aligns with a 50x PayFi narrative more than a pure meme cycle, which is why many are rotating toward Remittixduring this phase. With clear milestones and growing holders, Remittix keeps pulling attention from traders who want real use and upside. Why PayFi Could Outshine Meme Coins The PEPE price prediction and Dogecoin news show the strength of meme coin momentum, but PayFi altcoins like Remittix may deliver higher returns. With a model that blends crypto staking, low gas fee crypto transactions, and real-world use, Remittix offers the strongest case for early-stage crypto investment this September.

But $LBRETT is beginning to lead the charge as the best crypto to buy today. This next-gen Layer 2 memecoin is fusing meme culture with real blockchain utility, offering a unique blend of community energy and technical performance. Why traders are looking to Layer Brett for high returns Layer Brett presents a compelling answer to the question, Which is the best crypto to buy Today For The Highest Returns? Traditional memecoins often get stuck on slow, congested chains with zero utility. Layer Brett escapes that. This project leverages Ethereum Layer 2 technology, unlocking throughput with lightning-fast transactions and dramatically reduced gas fees, as low as $0.0001. Its purpose-built design provides scalability and performance that outpace basic meme tokens, making it a powerful contender. Layer Brett is a next-generation Layer 2 memecoin built on Ethereum, fusing viral culture with legitimate blockchain scaling solutions. It’s not just another meme token; it's Layer Brett with a purpose, featuring an evolving ecosystem that includes staking, token rewards, and plans for complete Layer 2 functionality. The project aims to disrupt the meme token landscape by delivering real-world blockchain scalability. Layer Brett achieves its speed and low costs by processing transactions off-chain, while still anchoring to Ethereum for decentralization and security. This design compresses fees and shrinks wait times. Users can buy and stake $LBRETT in seconds: connect a MetaMask or Trust Wallet, choose payment (ETH, USDT, or BNB), and purchase. Staking rewards are amplified due to lower operating costs enabled by Layer 2 scaling. It’s a seamless process. Cardano updates shift the market alternatives conversation The general market alternative has long been dominated by older meme tokens or legacy Layer 1 networks that lack real innovation. Many of these projects gained traction through popularity, yet they often fall short when addressing persistent challenges like high gas fees and network congestion. Unlike newer platforms, they typically provide limited ecosystem incentives, leaving them exposed to shifts in market sentiment. When examining price trends, older market alternatives often rely on speculation, which can lead to unstable growth. By comparison, Cardano offers a foundation supported by tangible improvements and long-term adoption potential. Analysts suggest that future Cardano updates could provide consistent demand, making it one of the more credible options in an environment where many alternatives lack utility. For investors, Cardano represents a market alternative rooted in innovation rather than hype. Layer Brett: The best crypto today for the highest gains Currently priced at $0.058 during its presale, Layer Brett offers early-entry pricing for those considering. Early adopters can stake their $LBRETT tokens immediately for high yields: coverage cites APY as high as 727% for initial participants. This aggressive reward structure and Layer 2 foundation position $LBRETT for potential explosive gains. The project clarifies, however, “$LBRETT is not an investment vehicle. Layer Brett represents a new chapter for memecoins, combining viral appeal with genuine Layer 2 utility. It’s fast, scalable, and community-powered, designed to deliver high-stakes rewards and low transaction costs. For those seeking the Best Crypto To Buy Today For The Highest Returns, this presale offers a chance to get in early on a project built for performance.

This is where Layer Brett($LBRETT) , a new Layer 2 crypto project blending meme appeal with real utility, comes in. With its presale underway, $LBRETT is currently priced at $0.058. It's capturing market attention, aiming to disrupt the meme token landscape while offering substantial staking rewards up to 727% APY for early participants. Analysts predict $LBRETT could see explosive gains. Layer Brett: Where meme meets mechanism Layer Brett outpaces many existing meme tokens by focusing on a Layer 2 blockchain architecture for Ethereum. Why settle for slower, costlier transactions? $LBRETT offers near-instant speeds, processing 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) with gas fees as low as $0.0001. This technical foundation provides true scalability, differentiating it from utility-free origins like the original Brett or much of the PEPE ecosystem. The project also features gamified staking and an evolving ecosystem, a real game-changer. This superior approach impacts future price prediction models. Layer Brett is a next-generation Layer 2 memecoin built on Ethereum, fusing meme culture with real blockchain utility. It isn't just another memecoin; it’s purpose-built for performance, scale, and user rewards. $LBRETT escapes the congestion and high gas fees of Ethereum Layer 1, delivering a faster, more cost-effective blockchain experience. The project notes: ""The network processes transactions off-chain."" Users connect their MetaMask or Trust Wallet, choose ETH, USDT, or BNB for payment, then buy and stake $LBRETT directly through the dApp. This simple setup unlocks amplified staking rewards, leveraging Layer 2's efficiency. With transparent tokenomics and a capped supply of 10 billion $LBRETT tokens, the project offers a controlled growth trajectory. Staking is on-chain, requires no KYC, and assets remain in complete control. This ensures user autonomy. Shiba Inu price prediction and market price outlook Traditional meme tokens often lack the foundational utility Layer Brett provides. They typically reside on Layer 1 chains, which can lead to congestion and higher transaction costs compared to an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. Assessing the Shiba Inu Price Prediction, alongside the PEPE general market, remains complex due to various factors like regulatory clarity and Federal Reserve policy. While assets like Shiba Inu and PEPE have seen notable past performance, they often present limited staking incentives compared to Layer Brett's high APYs. The overall market expects continued volatility, particularly with the largest monthly token unlock of the year on the horizon. This period creates both opportunities and risks across the board; $LBRETT is not an investment vehicle. Any price prediction for Shiba Inu requires caution. Layer Brett is positioned to overshadow Shiba Inu and PEPE in the meme space. Given its strong fundamentals and Layer 2 technology, Layer Brett is well-positioned for growth. Early buyers enjoy early-entry pricing at $0.058 per $LBRETT token. Coverage cites 727% APY for early stakers, a compelling incentive. The ongoing $1 million giveaway program further fuels community engagement. With its fixed supply of 10 billion tokens and focus on scalability, Layer Brett aims to capture significant value in the evolving DeFi landscape. This optimistic price prediction highlights its potential. Layer Brett combines meme power with genuine utility, offering an escape from Layer 1 limitations. Its presale provides an urgent opportunity for early participation and substantial staking rewards. As the crypto bull run of 2025 approaches, Layer Brett presents a fresh, scalable alternative to traditional meme tokens like Siba Inu and PEPE, promising a rewarding experience. This fuels a strong price prediction. Join the top Layer 2 Ethereum token now!

Layer Brett ($LBRETT) tokens are currently priced at $0.058. Solana holders are increasingly eyeing this trending meme coin, a new Ethereum Layer 2 protocol, as analysts predict a significant surge. The Layer Brett presale offers early access to a project fusing meme culture with real blockchain utility, providing substantial staking benefits. It's a compelling Crypto Presale opportunity. Why Layer Brett is capturing Solana holders' attention The future of meme coins isn't just about virality; it's about utility. Layer Brett stands out from typical Meme Token projects, including the original Brett, by leveraging Layer 2 Ethereum technology. This offers high-speed, low-cost transactions and unparalleled scalability. Why settle for less when utility-backed alternatives exist? Unlike many utility-free tokens, $LBRETT brings purpose to the meme landscape, aiming for dominance in the growing Layer 2 space with speed and community engagement, drawing attention from SOL holders. Layer Brett is a next-generation Memecoin built on Ethereum's Layer 2 network. It marries viral meme appeal with robust blockchain functionality—a project breaking free from its utility-free origins. The project aims to provide lightning-fast transactions, significantly lower gas fees, and substantial staking rewards, distinguishing itself from its predecessor, Brett. It's a true evolution for a Meme Token. Utilizing Layer 2 technology, Layer Brett compresses fees and unlocks throughput by processing transactions off-chain, while anchoring to Ethereum for security. This design facilitates near-instant interactions and dramatically reduces gas fees; coverage cites $0.0001. Early participants can stake their $LBRETT tokens immediately through the dApp for high-yield rewards, with coverage citing up to 900% APY. Solana Price Prediction and Market Outlook Solana has carved a place for itself as one of the most dynamic Layer 1 blockchains, standing out with its focus on speed, scalability, and developer-friendly infrastructure. Unlike chains that struggle with congestion or lack clear functionality, Solana was designed to process thousands of transactions per second while keeping fees low. This combination has allowed it to support a wide range of DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and gaming projects, making it more than a speculative asset. The outlook for Solana price prediction reflects both its strengths and market realities. Analysts note that while Solana benefits from rising adoption, its trajectory still depends on broader sentiment across the crypto market. Near-term resistance levels are being closely watched, but continued network growth and strong ecosystem demand could sustain its upward momentum. Long-term, Solana’s fundamentals position it as one of the few blockchains with potential beyond hype-driven cycles. Layer Brett vs. Solana: The race to the 2025 bull run Analysts are optimistic about Layer Brett 's trajectory, given its strong technical foundation and early presale success. Priced at $0.058, early investors could benefit from enhanced staking rates and dynamic ecosystem incentives. The integration of Layer 2 scalability, rivaling established solutions (e.g., Optimism, Arbitrum), positions $LBRETT as a strong contender among trending cryptocurrencies, offering potential for significant growth. However, the project clarifies: ""$LBRETT is not an investment vehicle."" Layer Brett represents a new frontier, combining meme power with genuine Layer 2 utility. Its presale offers a chance to engage with a project designed for speed and rewarding participation, attracting interest from SOL holders.

Currently priced at $0.058, this ERC-20 token is a Layer 2 crypto built to fuse meme culture with genuine blockchain utility. It aims to offer high-speed, low-cost transactions. This isn't just hype. Layer Brett: A new era for meme coins Layer Brett presents a compelling case for the future of meme coins by solving common blockchain pain points. While projects like Dogecoin remain on slower Layer 1 chains, Layer Brett, an Ethereum Layer 2, processes 10,000 transactions per second (TPS). This speed unlocks throughput, shrinking wait times. Its gas fees drop to as low as $0.0001, making transactions accessible for everyone. ""Layer Brett isn't here to blend in; it's here to break barriers."" This approach allows for enhanced rewards and a more dynamic user experience, truly making $LBRETT a trending crypto. Layer Brett is a next-generation Layer 2 memecoin built on Ethereum, designed to deliver real blockchain scalability. Unlike traditional meme tokens lacking utility, $LBRETT combines viral culture with legitimate solutions. It's fast, community-powered, and features an evolving ecosystem with staking and token rewards. This Layer Brett project brings a powerful blend of fun and function. Layer Brett operates as an additional protocol atop Ethereum, processing transactions off-chain for speed and affordability. This design helps it escape expensive Ethereum Layer 1 gas fees. Users can buy and stake $LBRETT immediately through the dApp for high-yield, Layer 2-powered rewards. This mechanism amplifies staking rewards due to lower operational costs, ensuring maximum value. Layer Brett also plans bridging solutions. Dogecoin news today and price forecast Dogecoin is a popular meme coin, an altcoin created in 2013 originally as a lighthearted joke. It runs on its own blockchain, a fork of Litecoin, using a proof-of-work consensus mechanism. While gaining immense popularity and a dedicated community, its core utility has remained mainly as a payment token, often characterized by high volatility. Despite recent Dogecoin news, it doesn't inherently offer advanced Layer 2 scaling or the diverse utility roadmap seen in newer projects like Layer Brett. Recent Dogecoin news continues to highlight market interest, especially with discussions around a potential DOGE ETF. While such a development could boost its value, Dogecoin price predictions remain highly speculative. Historically, its value moves are often driven by social media trends and broader crypto market sentiment. Can a meme coin with limited innovation truly outpace those built for performance? Analysts project modest gains for DOGE, with substantial external catalysts needed. Layer Brett is poised to outperform Dogecoin. Layer Brett's current presale price is $0.058, a low entry point. With its Ethereum Layer 2 foundation, 10,000 TPS, and ultra-low $0.0001 gas fees, the project notes it could attract substantial user adoption. Coverage cites 727% APY for early participants, potentially fueling strong initial demand. A $1 million giveaway (a significant community incentive) aims to attract more attention. Layer Brett is still in its presale stage, offering a chance to gain from early entry pricing and amplified staking rewards. This Layer 2 blockchain offers scalability and real utility, a refreshing change. The project notes that $LBRETT is not an investment vehicle, focusing on community interaction.

According to reporting from The Wall Street Journal, Robyn has already launched her pitch ahead of the November 6 shareholder vote, where Tesla is asking investors to approve a new $1 trillion compensation package for Elon. The goal? Get him to stay locked in for another ten years. The problem? Sales are down, investors are tired, and Tesla’s growth story looks shakier than ever. Robyn, who’s chaired Tesla’s board since 2018, has started doing interviews and meeting with big institutional shareholders. This is her second time doing this in under two years. She’s trying to push through a huge payday for Elon, again, with the not-so-subtle message that he could walk if he doesn’t get it. Robyn leans on investor fears as Tesla’s delivery numbers fall Robyn is selling this new package at a rough time. Tesla’s vehicle deliveries are down for the year. Its first all-new model in years, the Cybertruck, launched in 2023 and underdelivered. The company’s long-promised robotaxi tech finally showed up in June, but only as a small rollout in Austin, Texas, after almost ten years of yapping . And investors are still waiting for results. There’s also the mess from the 2018 pay plan. That $50 billion deal got thrown out by a Delaware judge, and now it’s tied up in court. Robyn admitted that shareholders are tired of hearing about it. Still, she claims this new plan is exactly what investors have been asking for. “I was getting a lot of questions from shareholders about what does the future look like, for Elon and the company,” Robyn said . In 2016, she led the push to get Tesla investors to approve the SolarCity acquisition, Elon’s other company, which many saw as a bailout. She’s clearly used to fighting these battles. And she’s still defending the 2018 pay package. Even after the judge slammed her for “lackadaisical” oversight, Robyn dismissed that criticism. “Crap,” she told a reporter. Her 95-year-old mother didn’t appreciate the language. But Robyn insists she’s doing her job. “I know that I work for the shareholders,” she said. She says her role is about managing both Elon and the board while keeping shareholder interests in the middle. And so far, the board seems fine with how she’s doing it. Tesla’s market value hit $1 trillion while Robyn’s been chair. She credits Elon’s previous pay package for pushing him to perform. But at most companies, the CEO doesn’t get this kind of freedom. Elon runs multiple businesses. He’s on social media constantly. He’s in politics. And he still has more control than most public company CEOs. Board committee writes new plan as Elon threatens to walk Last June, when shareholders reapproved the old pay plan, Elon jumped up and down on stage like it was his birthday. A few weeks later, he moved his focus to President Trump’s reelection campaign and moved to Washington. Investors started begging him to focus on Tesla again. Then in December, the same Delaware judge threw out the plan… again. By January, Tesla’s board had formed a special committee to come up with a solution. Robyn was in that group. The goal was to wrap up the mess around the 2018 deal and come up with something new. But Elon didn’t show up empty-handed. Tesla says he warned the board that he “may pursue other interests and leave Tesla” if he didn’t get what he wanted: full payment of the old package, at least 25% voting control, and no restrictions on his other ventures. The board had some requests, too. They wanted him to wind down his political side quests. That eventually happened, after Elon’s relationship with Trump’s White House soured publicly. “I’m not sure that he would say today that his stint in Washington was fabulous,” Robyn said. “I don’t think it was fabulous for the company, either.” Still, she says the board wants as much of his “time, energy and focus” as they can get. But the new plan doesn’t include any rules about how many hours he needs to work. Robyn says time doesn’t matter. “It’s not time that I measure,” she said, “it’s output.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Total wealth rose to a record $176.3 trillion, the largest jump since late 2020 during the COVID rebound. This is not normal. It’s rare as hell. And it comes while inflation’s above 3%, rates are being cut, and the job market is struggling. But the money’s flowing, just not to everyone. The numbers show the wealth gap is ripping wider. And most of this windfall? It came straight from Wall Street. The S&P 500 just pulled off a 30% rally in five months, starting in April. Only five times since 1975 has that happened. The last two were in 2020 and 2009. Stock boom hands top 1% a $40 trillion lead This stock run didn’t lift all boats. It supercharged the yachts. The top 1% now hold $40 trillion more than the bottom 50% combined. That lower half owns just 2.5% of the nation’s net worth. Meanwhile, the wealth-to-GDP ratio shot up to 581%, the highest since Q1 2022. That stat means asset owners, basically the rich, are getting richer at a speed that leaves wage earners far behind. Rate cuts are coming. And they’re not waiting for inflation to cool. For the first time in more than three decades, the Fed is set to lower rates with PCE inflation above 2.9%. Jerome Powell and his team will point to a soft labor market as the reason. But the impact is lower rates fuel higher asset prices. And those without assets, they’re just stuck watching. The top 10% of Americans, who already own most of the investable wealth, are set to benefit again. A survey shows 70% of consumers believe their income won’t keep up with inflation. That’s the setup: rising prices, falling rates, a roaring stock market, and most people falling behind. Fed fuels projections for $200 trillion by 2027 History says this rally isn’t done. Every time the S&P 500 has jumped 30%+ in 5 months, the next 12 months have all been positive. Carson Investment Research put the average return over that next year at 18.1%. Also, in the last 20 instances where rate cuts came with the S&P at a peak, the index rose 13.9% on average over the following 12 months. Even in the six months after such rallies, there’s never been a negative return, not once in 50 years. With that track record and the current setup, analysts now expect US household net worth to blow past $200 trillion by 2027. That’s the projection. And the Fed is the one stepping on the gas. Whether that’s good or bad depends on whether you actually hold assets. Here’s something wild: even with all this hype around stocks, gold is outperforming. Year-to-date, gold is up 36%, while the S&P 500 is only up 12%. That’s a problem for the narrative that equities are the only place to be. It also means that traditional hedges are working better than expected, even while crypto markets continue to watch from the sidelines. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

A fascinating trend is currently unfolding that could have profound implications for the market: Bitcoin miner deposits to exchanges are on a significant decline. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it’s a crucial signal often watched by savvy investors, hinting at reduced selling pressure and potentially a bullish turn for BTC. This development suggests that those who mine Bitcoin are holding onto their valuable assets rather than offloading them, a behavior that historically precedes upward price momentum. What Are Bitcoin Miner Deposits and Why Are They So Important? Understanding Bitcoin miner deposits is key to deciphering market sentiment. Simply put, these are the transfers of newly minted or previously held Bitcoin from miners’ wallets directly to cryptocurrency exchanges. Miners, who expend significant resources (electricity, hardware) to validate transactions and secure the Bitcoin network, receive BTC as a reward. When miners deposit large amounts of Bitcoin onto exchanges, it typically indicates an intent to sell. This action increases the available supply on the market, which can exert downward pressure on prices. Conversely, a decrease in these deposits suggests miners are choosing to accumulate or hold their BTC, thereby reducing the immediate supply available for sale. According to an insightful analysis by CryptoQuant contributor ShayanMarkets, this flow of coins from miner wallets to exchanges serves as a traditional indicator of supply-side pressure. Observing this metric provides a valuable window into the supply dynamics of Bitcoin. A Remarkable Drop in Bitcoin Miner Deposits The current data reveals a compelling story. The 30-day moving average of Bitcoin miner deposits has now dropped to a short-term low. This sustained decline is a powerful signal, suggesting a shift in miner behavior from selling to accumulating. What does this mean for the market? Here are some key takeaways: Reduced Selling Pressure: Fewer Bitcoin are being sent to exchanges, directly translating to less immediate sell-side pressure on the market. Miner Accumulation: Miners are likely choosing to hold onto their newly acquired Bitcoin, indicating a long-term bullish outlook from a fundamental source of BTC supply. Supply Shock Potential: If this trend continues, a reduced supply on exchanges coupled with steady or increasing demand could lead to significant price appreciation. This trend is not merely anecdotal; it’s a measurable shift that active traders and long-term investors alike should monitor closely. It paints a picture of conviction within the mining community, a group that has a vested interest in Bitcoin’s long-term success. What Does Miner Accumulation Mean for Bitcoin’s Future? Historically, periods of miner accumulation have often preceded significant upward price movements for Bitcoin. When miners, who are essentially the producers of Bitcoin, decide to hoard their output, it removes a substantial amount of potential selling pressure from the market. This creates a more favorable environment for price appreciation. From a technical perspective, ShayanMarkets added that if BTC successfully maintains support at the crucial $112,000 level, it could continue its upward momentum. This strong foundation could potentially pave the way for Bitcoin to challenge and even set a new all-time high. This scenario highlights the interconnectedness of fundamental miner behavior and technical price action. The decline in Bitcoin miner deposits acts as a fundamental tailwind, supporting the technical indicators for a potential rally. This isn’t just about the numbers; it’s about the psychology of the market. When key players like miners show confidence by accumulating, it can inspire broader market optimism and encourage other investors to hold or even buy more BTC. Actionable Insights: What Should Investors Consider? For investors, this trend in Bitcoin miner deposits offers a valuable piece of the puzzle when evaluating Bitcoin’s future trajectory. While no single indicator guarantees future price movements, a sustained reduction in miner selling pressure is undoubtedly a positive development. Consider these actionable insights: Monitor Support Levels: Keep a close watch on key technical support levels, such as the $112,000 mark mentioned by ShayanMarkets. Maintaining these levels strengthens the bullish case. Long-Term Perspective: This accumulation trend often aligns with a long-term bullish outlook. Investors with a multi-year horizon might find this data particularly encouraging. Diversify and Research: Always remember to diversify your portfolio and conduct thorough research. While miner activity is important, it’s one of many factors influencing the crypto market.

This positive shift in miner behavior could be a significant catalyst, signaling a potential new phase of growth for Bitcoin. Summary: A Bullish Horizon for Bitcoin The ongoing decline in Bitcoin miner deposits to exchanges represents a crucial and potentially bullish signal for the cryptocurrency market. This trend strongly indicates that miners are reducing their selling activities and instead opting to accumulate BTC, thereby decreasing the available supply on exchanges. This reduced selling pressure, combined with Bitcoin’s ability to hold key support levels, could fuel significant upward momentum, possibly leading to a new all-time high. As miners show increased confidence in Bitcoin’s future, the broader market may follow, setting the stage for an exciting period ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are Bitcoin miner deposits? A1: Bitcoin miner deposits refer to the transfer of Bitcoin from a miner’s wallet to a cryptocurrency exchange. This action typically signals an intent to sell the Bitcoin. Q2: Why is a decline in Bitcoin miner deposits considered a bullish sign? A2: A decline suggests that miners are choosing to hold onto their BTC rather than sell it. This reduces the supply available on exchanges, which, when coupled with consistent demand, can lead to increased prices due to scarcity and reduced selling pressure. Q3: Does reduced miner selling guarantee a Bitcoin price increase? A3: While it’s a strong bullish indicator, no single factor can guarantee price movements. The crypto market is influenced by many variables, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, and broader market sentiment. It’s one piece of a larger analytical puzzle. Q4: What is the significance of the $112,000 support level mentioned? A4: The $112,000 level is a technical support point. If Bitcoin can consistently maintain its price above this level, it suggests strong buying interest and reinforces the potential for continued upward price momentum, as highlighted by CryptoQuant contributor ShayanMarkets. Q5: How can I track Bitcoin miner activity? A5: You can track Bitcoin miner activity through various on-chain analytics platforms like CryptoQuant, Glassnode, or Santiment. These platforms provide data on miner flows, reserves, and other metrics that offer insights into their behavior. *** Did you find this analysis on Bitcoin miner deposits insightful?

A South Korean court instead handed the three unnamed individuals suspended sentences. It issued fines, despite conceding they had caused “astronomical damages.” The South Korean newspaper Seoul Shinmun and the news agency Yonhap reported on September 14, that the Criminal Division of the Daejeon District Court’s Cheonan Branch passed judgment on three individuals convicted of violating the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes. The presiding judge sentenced all three of the officials to three years in jail (suspended). The court also ordered them to serve five years of probation. The trio’s names were withheld for legal reasons. The court also ordered the first individual, referred to as A (a 61-year-old woman), to pay a 660 million won ($474,000) fine. The judge also ordered B (63, also female) to pay a 426 million won fine ($306,000). A man identified as C (aged 57) was ordered to pay 259 million won ($186,000). V Global Crypto Exchange: Fines, Suspended Sentences, and Probation Orders The trio, prosecutors told the court, occupied top positions in organizations that used multi-level marketing methods. They were tasked with luring customers to the V Global platform. Daejeon District Court. (Source: Minseong Kim [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Their efforts earned them up to 1.5 billion won ($1.1 million) each in profits, prosecution officials told the court. In sentencing, the presiding judge said: “The defendants caused astronomical damage by exploiting popular interest in cryptoassets. Over 50,000 victims are still living with the economic and mental pain of this crime. The damage done to society is considerable. A strict punishment is called for.” But the judge added that the executives did ensure that some of the victims received payouts and the “profits” they had been promised. The Supreme Court jailed Lee (given name withheld for legal reasons), the CEO of V Global, for 25 years for masterminding the fake exchange back in 2023 . A Marine Corps sergeant died Saturday after being shot in the head at a unit on an island off the country's west coast, military officials said. https://t.co/maMKtNNgRc — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) September 13, 2025 A Veneer of Authenticity The CEO and his staff created a realistic-looking trading platform, designed to resemble bona fide South Korean exchanges like Upbit and Bithumb. The platform featured real-time price charts for coins like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) , as well as coin tickers and realistic-looking trading volume tables. The V Global exchange used a “tiered membership system” that incorporated advanced multi-layered marketing methods. Its operators offered members payouts in V Global-branded tokens if they “recruited new members.” But the courts later determined that these coins were just as fake as the exchange itself, and had never launched on any blockchain protocol. South Korean courts have also jailed other senior V Global executives. One individual is currently serving a 14-year sentence. Another, meanwhile, is coming toward the end of a four-year jail term. V Global launched in mid-2020. But the rouse began to unravel in 2021, when disgruntled customers filed legal complaints, stating that they could not withdraw their assets from the exchange. At its height, the bogus exchange operated from a building in the heart of Seoul’s busy commercial district. The district is home to some of the country’s biggest crypto exchanges and most prominent blockchain technology startups.

Pi Coin Price Fails to Reclaim Bullish Momentum The hype with the Pi coin price during its first few weeks of entry has seen a drastic decline over the last few months as buying momentum reverses. This has seen a price difference of more than $2.5 as the price falls from its high of $2.9 in February to the current $0.36. Experts say the Pi coin price could tumble further this month as prices maintain a downward-facing momentum. Assessing Algorand And Cardano Price Position As the Best Crypto To Buy Cardano’s price recovery in the last few days is fueling new sentiment of a price breakout, potentially making the ADA coin one of the best cryptos to buy now. Similarly, the Algorand new aid portal is drawing in inflow that could see the coin breakout soon. According to price analysis, experts say this coin breakout could see them rise to 2x by early 2026. However, investors looking for the best crypto to buy are still looking for the best entry to maximise profit on these assets. Remittix Early Rise Places It On A 100x Surge Potential Data from the Remittix token price changes in the last few weeks is showing the coin could be nearing a breakout soon. This data shows the coin climbing over 6x already over the last few months as its presale makes new highs. But with a projected milestone this year, experts believe the Remittix coin could be the best crypto to buy this month, with a potential surge up to 40x by December. The talk about the Remittix token has also included a focus on the reward programs of this new PayFi asset. This includes an ongoing one that gives users 15% of their referrals’ purchases every day. Others to look into include: The coming wallet launch this month Exchange listings before the end of the year And the staking opportunity with the Remittix token Discover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their project here: Website: https://remittix.io/ Socials: https://linktr.ee/remittix $250,000 Giveaway: https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveaway",Press Release,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|ZRX|ADA|ALGO,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-14 23:40:00

A recent development from the Daejeon District Court’s Cheonan Branch highlights this reality: three accomplices in a massive South Korean crypto fraud case have been sentenced. This significant legal outcome underscores the global effort to combat elaborate crypto scams. Sentences for $1.6 Billion South Korean Crypto Fraud Case Three individuals received prison sentences for their roles in the notorious “V Global” investment scam. This elaborate scheme impacted over 50,000 victims, leading to collective losses of approximately 2.2 trillion won—a staggering $1.6 billion USD. The fraud operated from July 2020 to April 2021, revealing widespread financial devastation. Verdict: Each defendant received a three-year prison sentence, suspended for five years, contingent on good behavior. Financial Penalties: The court ordered forfeiture of illicit gains, ranging from 259 million won ($188,000) to 606 million won ($439,000) per individual. The sheer scale of this South Korean crypto fraud case serves as a potent reminder of the importance of robust regulatory frameworks and investor caution. Understanding the “V Global” Scam Mechanics The “V Global” scam was a classic Ponzi scheme, disguised as a legitimate cryptocurrency investment. Perpetrators lured victims with promises of high, guaranteed returns, often using a multi-level marketing (MLM) structure. Funds from new investors paid earlier ones, creating an illusion of profitability until collapse. Such schemes exploit a lack of understanding about crypto technology. Many victims, drawn by quick wealth, fail to recognize fraud signs. The V Global incident reinforces: if an investment seems too good to be true, it almost certainly is. Protecting Yourself from Crypto Scams Preventing future incidents like this South Korean crypto fraud case demands individual caution, public education, and vigilant regulatory oversight. Here are actionable insights for investors: Due Diligence: Research any investment platform thoroughly. Verify company information, founders, and operational history. Question Guaranteed Returns: Legitimate crypto investments cannot guarantee high returns. Fixed, unusually high profits are a major red flag. Educate Yourself: Learn crypto and blockchain basics. This knowledge helps identify unrealistic or misleading claims. Verify Regulatory Compliance: Check if the platform is registered with relevant financial authorities. Resist Pressure Tactics: Scammers use high-pressure sales. Take time, consult trusted advisors, and never feel forced. Report Suspicious Activity: Report potential scams to financial regulators or law enforcement. Your report helps protect others. Adopting these practices significantly reduces vulnerability to sophisticated fraud schemes. Broader Impact of Crypto Fraud Cases The repercussions of large-scale fraud like the V Global scam extend beyond immediate financial losses. Such incidents erode public trust in the legitimate crypto industry, make potential investors hesitant, and often lead to calls for stricter regulations. This South Korean crypto fraud case highlights long-term societal costs of digital financial crimes. Law enforcement and judicial systems are adapting to tackle these complex digital crimes. The sentencing sends a clear message: crypto fraudsters will face justice. It underscores international cooperation in tracking illicit funds and apprehending perpetrators. The sentencing in the $1.6 billion V Global scam marks a significant victory against cryptocurrency fraud. While justice has been served in this South Korean crypto fraud case , it serves as a potent reminder for all crypto market participants. Vigilance, education, and robust due diligence are your best defenses. Staying informed and cautious remains paramount for safeguarding investments and fostering a safer crypto ecosystem.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Hyperliquid’s validator community has chosen Native Markets to issue USDH, ending a weeklong contest that drew proposals from Paxos, Frax, Sky (ex-MakerDAO), Agora, and others. Native Markets, co-founded by former Uniswap Labs president MC Lader, researcher Anish Agnihotri, and early Hyperliquid backer Max Fiege, said it will begin rolling out USDH “within days,” according to a post by Fiege on X. According to onchain trackers , Native Markets' proposal took approximately 70% of validators' votes, while Paxos took 20%, and Ethena came in at 3.2%. The staged launch starts with capped mints and redemptions, followed by a USDH/USDC spot pair before caps are lifted. USDH is designed to challenge Circle’s USDC, which currently dominates Hyperliquid with nearly $6 billion in deposits , or about 7.5% of its supply. USDC and other stablecoins will remain supported if they meet liquidity and HYPE staking requirements. Most rival bidders had promised to channel stablecoin yields back to the ecosystem with Paxos via HYPE buybacks, Frax through direct user yield, and Sky with a 4.85% savings rate plus a $25 million “Genesis Star” project. Native Markets’ pitch instead stressed credibility, trading experience, and validator alignment. Market Movement BTC: BTC has recently reclaimed the $115,000 level, helped by inflows into ETFs, easing U.S. inflation data, and growing expectations for interest rate cuts. Also, technical momentum is picking up, though resistance sits around $116,000, according to CoinDesk's market insights bot. ETH : ETH is trading above $4600. The price is being buoyed by strong ETF inflows. Gold: Gold continues to trade near record highs as traders eye dollar weakness on expected Fed rate cuts.

Last week, creators on Pump.fun earned over $19 million in fees while SOL price spiked by 17%. Ethereum, which has been leading the altcoin rally, saw Solana outperforming it and flashing bullish sentiments for the ecosystem. Ethereum price remained up by more than 4% in the last 30 days while SOL price jumped by almost 30% in the same time. Pump.fun creator earnings spike Pump.fun first debuted its streaming feature in 2024 but paused it following reports of unsafe live sessions. This even included self-harm stunts. After a controlled reintroduction in 2025 with stricter moderation, the feature was rolled out to all users. The results have been immediate, Pump.fun now ranks close to 1% of Twitch’s channels and 10% of Kick’s. Adam shared the data from Dune for the first 7 days of the Pump.fun fee structure change. It saw $15.5 million in creator fees being claimed. He categorized the top 25 creator fee claimers before September 10. It involves 5 streamers, 9 serial deployers and 11 one-hit wonders.

Adam highlighted that Gainzy claimed $108K in creator fees over that period. The platform’s native PUMP token recently breached a $3 billion market cap. This milestone came in just two months after raising nearly $600 million in a 12-minute ICO. Viral streams and creator fees have been key growth drivers, with $19.3M earned by creators last week alone. Earlier, Cryptopolitan reported that PUMP managed to recover its ICO price as whales decided to accumulate. Wall Street piles into Solana Wall Street-backed Forward Industries has emerged as a major Solana treasury player. The publicly traded firm raised $1.65 billion in cash and stablecoin commitments with backing from Galaxy Digital, Multicoin Capital, and Jump Crypto. Combined with DeFi Technologies and Neptune Digital, these four entities now control over 2.82 million SOL (approx worth $577 million). Data shows that Forward Industries holds 1.45M SOL, Galaxy Digital has 1.35M SOL, while DeFi Technologies and Neptune Digital hold 12.8k SOL and Neptune Digital 9.6K, respectively. Solana’s broader ecosystem is finding ways to expand. Metaplex launched Uniform Price Auctions for fairer token launches, while Squads Protocol opened its Grid developer platform to all users.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a widely watched barometer of investor sentiment, has recently made a significant move. It has shifted from a state of ‘Greed’ to ‘Neutral,’ settling at a reading of 53. This change is more than just a number; it offers crucial insights into the collective mood of cryptocurrency investors. Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Does it Measure? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is essentially a thermometer for the market’s emotional state. Developed by Alternative.me, it gauges whether investors are feeling overly fearful or excessively optimistic. The index operates on a straightforward scale: zero represents extreme fear, indicating potential buying opportunities, while 100 signifies extreme optimism, often hinting at a market correction. But how is this sentiment calculated? It is not just a gut feeling. The index compiles data from several key factors, each weighted to provide a comprehensive picture: Volatility (25%): Measures the current market’s price fluctuations compared to average values. High volatility often signals fear. Trading Volume (25%): Analyzes current trading volumes against historical averages. Strong, sustained volume can indicate market strength or weakness. Social Media Mentions (15%): Scans various platforms for relevant cryptocurrency hashtags and mentions, assessing the level of public interest and sentiment. Surveys (15%): Although paused for now, historically these surveys directly polled investors for their market outlook. Bitcoin’s Market Cap Dominance (10%): An increasing dominance of Bitcoin can sometimes signal fear as investors flock to the perceived safety of BTC. Google Search Volume (10%): Tracks search queries related to cryptocurrencies, with spikes in certain terms often correlating with fear or excitement. Decoding the Shift: What Does a Neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index Mean? The recent two-point fall in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , bringing it to 53, marks a transition from ‘Greed’ to ‘Neutral.’ When the index was in ‘Greed,’ it suggested that investors were perhaps becoming overconfident, potentially leading to inflated asset prices. However, a move to ‘Neutral’ indicates a more balanced, albeit less decisive, market sentiment. This neutral stage suggests that the market is not dominated by either irrational exuberance or panic. Instead, investors might be exercising caution, awaiting clearer signals before making significant moves. It could mean a period of consolidation, where prices stabilize, or it might be a precursor to a new trend, either upward or downward. For those looking for extreme signals, neutral territory can sometimes feel ambiguous, but it offers its own set of unique opportunities and challenges. Navigating the Neutral Zone: Actionable Insights for Investors So, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index now in neutral territory, what should investors consider? This phase often calls for a more strategic and less emotional approach. Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: Use this period to review your holdings. Are your investments still aligned with your long-term goals and risk tolerance? Research and Due Diligence: A neutral market is an excellent time for in-depth research. Look into projects with strong fundamentals, clear roadmaps, and active communities. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, DCA involves investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price. This strategy can be particularly effective during periods of uncertainty. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, technological advancements, and regulatory developments. These factors can quickly shift sentiment. Avoid Impulse Decisions: The absence of extreme fear or greed can help you make more rational choices. Resist the urge to chase pumps or panic-sell on dips. A neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index does not necessarily mean stagnation; rather, it represents a moment of equilibrium. It’s a valuable time for thoughtful decision-making rather than reacting to heightened emotions. Conclusion: Embracing Prudence in a Balanced Market The shift of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to a neutral 53 underscores a cooling of investor exuberance and a move towards a more balanced outlook. While extreme readings often signal clear opportunities, a neutral stance calls for prudence and strategic thinking. By understanding the underlying factors of the index and adopting a disciplined approach, investors can navigate this phase effectively, positioning themselves for future market movements. This period is less about making bold, impulsive moves and more about informed, calculated decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the current sentiment of the cryptocurrency market, ranging from extreme fear (0) to extreme greed (100), based on various market factors. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? It is calculated using a weighted average of factors including volatility (25%), trading volume (25%), social media mentions (15%), Bitcoin’s market cap dominance (10%), and Google search volume (10%). What does a ‘Neutral’ reading on the index signify? A ‘Neutral’ reading, like the current 53, indicates that market sentiment is balanced, without significant dominance of either fear or greed. Investors are likely exercising caution and awaiting clearer market signals. Should I buy or sell when the index is neutral? A neutral reading does not provide a direct buy or sell signal. Instead, it suggests a time for careful analysis, portfolio re-evaluation, and strategic planning like dollar-cost averaging, rather than making impulsive decisions. How often does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index update? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is updated daily by Alternative.me, providing a fresh snapshot of market sentiment.

While crypto markets often move to their own beat, they are not immune to the gravitational pull of traditional finance. This week brings a series of crucial global macroeconomic events that could significantly influence investor sentiment and market trends, directly impacting your digital asset portfolio. Why Crucial Global Macroeconomic Events Matter for Crypto Many crypto investors focus solely on on-chain metrics and technological advancements. However, ignoring traditional finance indicators is a mistake. The decisions made by central banks and the health of major economies have a profound effect on liquidity, risk appetite, and the overall flow of capital into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Understanding these global macroeconomic events helps you anticipate potential market shifts. Factors like interest rates, inflation, and employment data directly influence how investors perceive risk and allocate their funds. When traditional markets experience volatility due to economic news, crypto often follows suit, either amplifying gains or exacerbating losses. Staying informed allows you to make more strategic decisions. Monday, Sept. 17: The FOMC’s Pivotal Decision on Global Macroeconomic Events The week kicks off with a heavyweight: the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decision and statement at 6:00 p.m. UTC. This is arguably one of the most anticipated global macroeconomic events of the month. What to Watch For: Interest Rate Hike/Hold/Cut: A hike typically strengthens the U.S. dollar, making risk assets like crypto less attractive. A hold or cut can signal a more dovish stance, potentially boosting crypto prices. Forward Guidance: The accompanying statement and press conference will offer insights into the Fed’s future monetary policy path. Any hints of prolonged high rates or upcoming cuts will send ripples through all markets. The FOMC’s actions directly influence global liquidity and investor appetite for risk. A hawkish stance could lead to a ‘risk-off’ environment, potentially putting downward pressure on Bitcoin and altcoins. Tuesday, Sept. 18: UK Rates and US Jobless Claims – A Dual Impact Tuesday brings another layer of crucial global macroeconomic events with significant implications: 11:00 a.m. UTC: UK Interest Rate Decision The Bank of England’s (BoE) decision will reflect the UK’s economic health and inflation battle. While regional, the BoE’s stance contributes to the overall global sentiment regarding monetary policy. A surprise move could cause broader market jitters. 12:30 p.m. UTC: U.S. Initial Jobless Claims This weekly data point provides a real-time snapshot of the U.S. labor market’s health. Higher-than-expected claims suggest a weakening economy, which might prompt the Fed to consider easing monetary policy in the future – often seen as positive for crypto. Conversely, lower claims indicate a strong labor market, potentially giving the Fed more room to maintain higher rates for longer, which can be a headwind for risk assets. These two data points, though different in nature, offer crucial insights into economic stability and central bank reactions, which are key drivers of investor behavior in crypto. Wednesday, Sept. 19: Japan’s Monetary Policy and Global Ripples from Global Macroeconomic Events The final key event of the week comes from Asia: 3:00 a.m. UTC: Japan Interest Rate Decision The Bank of Japan (BoJ) has historically maintained an ultra-loose monetary policy, making it an outlier among major central banks. Any hint of a shift away from this stance, such as tightening policy or adjusting yield curve control, would be a monumental event. Such a change could trigger significant volatility in currency markets (especially the Yen) and potentially lead to a repatriation of capital, affecting global liquidity. Japan’s decision adds another significant dimension to global macroeconomic events , as its policies have long-reaching implications for global financial stability and investment flows. Navigating the Week: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the lineup of crucial global macroeconomic events , how should crypto investors approach the week? Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on economic news and official statements. Understand the market’s initial reaction, but avoid impulsive decisions. Manage Risk: Volatility is often heightened around these announcements. Consider reducing leverage or setting tighter stop-loss orders if you are actively trading. Long-Term Perspective: For long-term holders, these events are often temporary blips. Focus on the underlying fundamentals of your chosen assets. Diversify: A diversified portfolio can help mitigate the impact of adverse market movements stemming from these events. Conclusion: The Unmissable Impact of Global Macroeconomic Events This week serves as a powerful reminder that the crypto market does not exist in a vacuum. The decisions made by central banks and the health of the global economy are deeply intertwined with the performance of digital assets. By paying attention to these crucial global macroeconomic events , crypto investors can gain a significant edge, making more informed decisions and navigating potential market turbulence with greater confidence. Staying ahead of the curve means understanding not just crypto-specific news, but also the broader economic currents that shape the entire financial world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are global macroeconomic events? A1: Global macroeconomic events are significant economic announcements, policy decisions, or data releases from major countries or international bodies that have the potential to influence financial markets worldwide. Examples include central bank interest rate decisions, inflation reports, and employment data. Q2: How do interest rate decisions affect cryptocurrency prices? A2: Interest rate decisions impact the cost of borrowing and the attractiveness of ‘risk-off’ assets like government bonds versus ‘risk-on’ assets like cryptocurrencies. Higher rates typically strengthen traditional currencies and can reduce investor appetite for speculative assets, potentially leading to lower crypto prices. Lower rates can have the opposite effect. Q3: Why are U.S. jobless claims important for crypto investors? A3: U.S. initial jobless claims provide an early indication of the health of the U.S. labor market. A strong labor market might lead the Federal Reserve to maintain higher interest rates, which can be bearish for crypto. Conversely, a weakening labor market could prompt the Fed to consider easing monetary policy, potentially boosting risk assets like crypto. Q4: Should I make trading decisions solely based on these events? A4: While these events are significant drivers of market volatility, it’s generally not advisable to make trading decisions solely based on them. They should be considered as part of a broader analysis, including technical indicators, on-chain data, and your overall investment strategy. Market reactions can be unpredictable. Q5: What is ‘forward guidance’ from a central bank? A5: Forward guidance refers to communication from a central bank about the likely future path of monetary policy. It helps market participants anticipate future interest rate changes or other policy shifts, influencing their current investment decisions and market expectations.

SOL is rising drastically, and BNB is creating new ATHs. But even with all of the rush and energy in Solana and BNB, the best crypto to buy now isn’t SOL or BNB, but the newcomer Layer Brett. Layer Brett isn’t just riding the wave; it’s building its own, fusing viral meme culture with genuine blockchain utility. Currently in crypto presale for $0.0058 , $LBRETT offers early participants access to staking rewards and a scalable ecosystem, distinguishing it from older meme tokens. What Makes Layer Brett Gain Attention? While Solana and BNB have seen impressive rallies, boasting all-time highs and robust ecosystems, Layer Brett emerges with a different story. This new meme coin isn’t burdened by the utility-free origins of some peers or the congestion of traditional chains. It’s fast. Unlike the original Brett on Base, Layer Brett is purpose-built on an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, designed for performance, speed, and user rewards. It aims to outpace legacy chains like Solana by compressing fees and unlocking throughput. Layer Brett isn’t just another meme token, but it has a mission. The project is built for speed, rewards, and a whole lot of character. Leveraging Ethereum Layer 2 technology, $LBRETT processes transactions off-chain, securing them on Ethereum. This unlocks throughput, compressing fees (coverage $0.0001 per transaction) and shrinking wait times. Its evolving ecosystem includes staking and token rewards. The market is keenly observing Layer Brett’s community-first approach. Early backers in the crypto presale are positioned for potential gains, with $LBRETT available at $0.0058 . Holders can immediately stake their tokens for high-yield, Layer 2-powered rewards—over 700% APY now, but decreasing as more stake. This strong incentive, plus a $1 million giveaway, drives significant FOMO. Layer Brett aims for dominance in the burgeoning Layer 2 space. Solana Flexing Muscles Solana is no longer an “Ethereum killer” but a powerhouse in its own right, backed by institutional interest and a thriving ecosystem of DeFi and gaming projects. Technical analysis points to continued bullish moves. Institutional demand is rising, and a cup-and-handle pattern breakout says it will rise even more. BNB: A New High for a Powerhouse BNB is not just a cryptocurrency; it’s the lifeblood of the world’s largest crypto ecosystem. A recent partnership with a major global asset firm has reignited market momentum, propelling BNB to a new all-time high. But the recent ATH is just the beginning. Experts say BNB is now in “uncharted territory,” with no historical resistance to hold it back. The MACD indicator is signaling a strong bullish momentum, and the RSI is still well below overbought levels. As more institutional capital and retail investors enter the market, BNB is exceptionally positioned to not only consolidate at its new high but also initiate a powerful breakout toward the $1,000 psychological milestone and beyond. Layer Brett: Best Crypto To Buy Now Even while SOL and BNB make waves, $LBRETT is having a bigger pull. Currently priced at $0.0058 in its ongoing crypto presale, its Layer 2 tech, meme power, NFT integrations, and cross-chain interoperability via bridges show it may rival both SOL and BNB soon. Layer Brett’s approach, paired with the high APY and a $1 million giveaway position $LBRETT as the best crypto to buy now over SOL and BNB. For Layer Brett, the presale is just the beginning.

This unexpected dip has caught the attention of investors and analysts alike, prompting questions about market stability and future trajectories. According to real-time market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $114,995.29 on the Binance USDT market, signaling a moment of caution for many. What’s Driving the Current Bitcoin Price Fall? The recent confirmation that the Bitcoin price fall below $115,000 has undoubtedly sent ripples through the digital asset landscape. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it represents a notable shift from recent highs, prompting many to ask: what exactly is fueling this downturn? While a single definitive cause is often elusive in the volatile crypto market, several potential factors are currently under discussion. Market analysts are closely examining a confluence of elements. Firstly, broader macroeconomic concerns, such as inflation data or interest rate decisions, can influence investor sentiment across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Secondly, regulatory uncertainties in key regions might lead to cautious trading behavior. Moreover, significant whale movements – large transactions by individual holders – can sometimes trigger cascading sell-offs, especially in a sensitive market, further contributing to a noticeable Bitcoin price fall . Navigating Volatility: What Does This BTC Price Dip Mean for Investors? For many in the crypto community, a significant Bitcoin price fall naturally raises concerns. However, it also presents different perspectives depending on an investor’s strategy. Short-term traders might view this as an opportunity for quick gains, attempting to ‘buy the dip’ in anticipation of a swift rebound. Conversely, long-term holders, often referred to as HODLers, typically remain unfazed, focusing on Bitcoin’s fundamental value and its potential over extended periods. Understanding the broader market sentiment is crucial here. While a dip, indicative of a Bitcoin price fall , can signal fear, it can also be a healthy market correction, flushing out speculative positions. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon. It is important to avoid emotional decisions during periods of heightened volatility. Instead, focusing on a well-researched investment plan remains paramount. Actionable Strategies During a Bitcoin Price Fall When faced with a sudden Bitcoin price fall , having a clear strategy can make all the difference. Panic selling is rarely the best approach. Instead, consider these actionable insights to navigate the current market conditions effectively: Reassess Your Portfolio: Take this opportunity to review your overall cryptocurrency holdings. Is your portfolio diversified enough, or is it heavily concentrated in a few assets? Diversification can help mitigate risks during market downturns. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Rather than attempting to time the market, DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price. This strategy can reduce the impact of volatility and potentially lower your average purchase price over time. Stay Informed, Avoid FUD: Be wary of fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) circulating on social media. Rely on reputable news sources and fundamental analysis rather than reacting to every market rumor. Set Stop-Loss Orders: For active traders, setting stop-loss orders can help limit potential losses if the price continues to decline, protecting against further Bitcoin price fall . Remember, market corrections are a natural part of any financial cycle. A disciplined approach is key. The recent Bitcoin price fall below $115,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility within the cryptocurrency market. While such dips can be unsettling, they also offer valuable lessons and opportunities for those prepared to act strategically. By understanding market dynamics, maintaining a long-term perspective, and employing sound investment principles, investors can navigate these turbulent times with greater confidence. The resilience of Bitcoin has been tested many times before, and each challenge contributes to its ongoing evolution. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What caused the recent Bitcoin price fall below $115,000? A1: The recent Bitcoin price fall is likely influenced by a combination of factors, including broader macroeconomic concerns, potential regulatory uncertainties, and significant whale movements in the market. No single cause is usually responsible for such market shifts. Q2: Is it a good time to buy Bitcoin after this dip? A2: Whether it’s a good time to buy depends on your individual investment strategy, risk tolerance, and research. Some investors see dips as ‘buy the dip’ opportunities, while others prefer to wait for signs of market recovery. Consider strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging. Q3: How does this dip affect long-term Bitcoin investors? A3: Long-term Bitcoin investors, often called HODLers, typically focus on Bitcoin’s fundamental value and its potential over extended periods. Short-term price fluctuations, including this Bitcoin price fall , usually have less impact on their overall strategy, as they are prepared for volatility. Q4: What is Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)? A4: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy where you invest a fixed amount of money into an asset at regular intervals, regardless of its price. This method helps to reduce the impact of volatility and can potentially lower your average purchase price over time. Q5: Will Bitcoin recover from this price fall? A5: Historically, Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience, recovering from numerous price corrections and downturns. While past performance does not guarantee future results, many analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. Recovery depends on market sentiment, adoption, and broader economic conditions. Did you find this analysis of the recent Bitcoin price fall helpful?

The Altcoin Season Index has just reached a remarkable 73, marking its highest point in 90 days. This isn’t just a number; it’s a crucial indicator that we might be on the cusp of an official “altcoin season,” a period where alternative cryptocurrencies truly shine. For anyone invested in or watching the crypto markets, understanding this metric is key to navigating potential opportunities. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? Before diving into the implications of the current score, let’s clarify what the Altcoin Season Index truly represents. It’s a metric developed by CoinMarketCap that provides a snapshot of the broader altcoin market’s performance relative to Bitcoin. Here’s how it works: The index tracks the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Stablecoins and wrapped coins are excluded to ensure a true representation of market sentiment towards volatile assets. It compares how these altcoins have performed against Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. An “altcoin season” is officially declared when 75% of these top altcoins outperform Bitcoin during that 90-day period. A score closer to 100 signifies even stronger, more widespread altcoin performance, indicating a robust market shift. Why is the Altcoin Season Index at 73 So Significant? Reaching 73 is not just another number; it’s a powerful signal. This metric’s 90-day high tells us that a significant portion of the altcoin market is currently showing impressive strength against Bitcoin. We are now just shy of the 75-point threshold, which means the market is teetering on the edge of what many investors eagerly anticipate: a full-fledged altcoin season. This proximity to the threshold suggests growing investor confidence in altcoins. It often indicates a rotation of capital from Bitcoin, which might have seen recent gains, into promising alternative projects. Such periods can offer substantial opportunities for those who understand the dynamics at play and have done their research. What Drives Altcoin Performance During Such Periods? The rise in the Altcoin Season Index doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Several factors typically contribute to altcoins outperforming Bitcoin: Bitcoin Dominance Shifts: Often, when Bitcoin’s dominance (its share of the total crypto market cap) begins to decline, capital tends to flow into altcoins, driving their prices up. Innovation and Development: New technologies, groundbreaking partnerships, and significant protocol upgrades within various altcoin ecosystems can attract fresh investment. Market Sentiment: A general bullish sentiment in the broader crypto market, coupled with positive news or hype around specific sectors like DeFi, NFTs, or Layer 2 solutions, can fuel altcoin rallies. Retail Investor Interest: Altcoin seasons often coincide with increased interest from retail investors, who might be looking for higher-growth opportunities beyond Bitcoin. Understanding these underlying drivers can help investors anticipate and react to market movements more effectively, especially when the Altcoin Season Index signals a shift. Navigating a Potential Altcoin Season: Actionable Insights With the Altcoin Season Index flashing green, many are wondering how to best prepare. While no investment is without risk, here are some actionable insights to consider: Do Your Research: Focus on projects with strong fundamentals, clear utility, active development teams, and robust communities. Don’t just follow the hype. Diversify Your Portfolio: Instead of putting all your eggs in one basket, spread your investments across several promising altcoins to mitigate risk. Understand Risk Management: Set clear entry and exit strategies. Consider using stop-loss orders to protect against sudden downturns and take profits strategically. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, project updates, and broader economic trends that could impact the crypto space. Remember, the goal is to make informed decisions, not impulsive ones, especially when indicators like the Altcoin Season Index suggest a potentially lucrative period. Challenges and Considerations in an Altcoin-Focused Market While the prospect of an altcoin season is exciting, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent challenges and risks. The altcoin market is notoriously volatile, and prices can fluctuate dramatically in short periods. Not all altcoins will perform equally, and some may even decline despite a rising Altcoin Season Index. Furthermore, the space is not immune to scams, “rug pulls,” and projects that fail to deliver on their promises. Therefore, due diligence is paramount. The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable macro indicator, but it does not guarantee individual project success. Always be skeptical, verify information, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. In conclusion, the current rise of the Altcoin Season Index to a 90-day high of 73 is a compelling signal for the cryptocurrency market. It indicates a period of heightened interest and performance for altcoins, bringing us tantalizingly close to an official altcoin season. While opportunities may abound, a cautious, well-researched approach remains essential for navigating this dynamic landscape successfully. Staying informed and making strategic decisions based on sound analysis will be key to harnessing the potential of this exciting market phase.

An altcoin season is a period when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? The index compares the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) against Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. A higher score indicates stronger altcoin performance. What does an Altcoin Season Index of 73 mean? A score of 73 means that 73% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. It signifies that the market is very close to an official “altcoin season” threshold of 75. Should I invest in altcoins when the index is high? While a high Altcoin Season Index suggests potential opportunities, it’s crucial to conduct thorough research, understand the risks, and diversify your portfolio. It’s an indicator, not a guarantee of individual project success. What are the main risks during an altcoin season? Key risks include high volatility, potential for significant price drops, scams (like rug pulls), and the possibility that not all altcoins will perform well. Diligence and risk management are essential. Did you find this analysis of the Altcoin Season Index insightful?

Meanwhile, bigger momentum is shifting to the up-and-coming DeFi project, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which most investors think will see much higher returns throughout the next bull run. Mutuum Finance has already completed five rounds of presales with the sixth round still ongoing at a token price of $0.035. Those investors who buy tokens now will experience an immense ROI when the coin enters the open markets. Presale has 16280 supporters and has already garnered more than 15.68 million funds. While Cardano (ADA) is perpetrating its presence as one of the top layer-1 blockchains, Mutuum Finance is gaining momentum with its novel attitude to decentralized lending and capital productivity, providing investors an alternative perspective in the marketplace. Cardano Price Analysis and September Forecast ADA is currently trading at a price of $0.90 and analysts have predicted that it can rise by 15 percent in September due to the existing market strength. The blockchain is still oriented towards the development and adoption of the wider ecosystem, and its performance is directly dependent on the overall situation on the crypto market. Simultaneously, focus in the market is also being put on emergent DeFi projects like Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance and CertiK Introduce $50,000 Bug bounty A partnership with CertiK has been announced by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to implement a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program in order to invite developers, security experts, and ethical hackers to the project. The participants are rewarded when they find and report weaknesses that might affect the security of the protocol. The amount of the payout depends on the nature of the problem (minor bugs to critical threats), and the maximum payout is $50,000 in USDT. This will make the protocol more resilient, secure users, and enhance investor trust in the platform. Besides the bounty program, Mutuum Finance has introduced another program, a community giveaway of $100,000 to incentivize early adoption and user participation. Ten winners will receive $10,000 MUTM tokens, which is a reflection of the desire by the project to reward those who are joining the community. Liquidity Management, Volatility, and Market Risk Mutuum Finance incorporates an advanced model to reduce market risk, volatility, and the stability of their systems even in times of liquidity pressure. Liquidity thresholds and Loan to Value (LTV) changes according to the market conditions. Creating a Secure, Scalable and Community-Driven Ecosystem In addition to technical protection, Mutuum Finance is aimed at creating a community-oriented DeFi. Its sales performance in presale, along with its consistent security trainings and user-reward programs, emphasizes the duality of the project i.e. stability in the long term and active participation of the community. Mutuum Finance is becoming a reliable and scalable DeFi platform of tomorrow by combining a solid security architecture with incentivized participation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming one of the leading DeFi altcoins, and it is expected to be more attractive to investors aiming for greater gains during a bull-run than Cardano (ADA). Phase 6 presale tokens cost $0.035, attracting 16,280 backers and raising 15.68M, while promising early adopters the potential of huge ROI. The project has a CertiK bug bounty of $50K, community giveaway of $100K, and innovative risk and liquidity management through dynamic LTV ration and reserve funds. MUTM can be a strong competitor to the investors aiming to earn as much as possible this bull season due to its focus on the secure, scalable, and community-driven DeFi.

Mark Casey, a portfolio manager with 25 years at the firm, led the strategy. According to a Sunday report by The Wall Street Journal, Casey, who credits Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett as key influences on his investment philosophy, has become a vocal advocate for Bitcoin. “I just love Bitcoin, I just think it is so interesting,” Casey said during a podcast interview with venture firm Andreessen Horowitz. He called Bitcoin “one of the coolest things that has ever been created by people,” per the WSJ report. Over the past four years, Capital Group has expanded its exposure mainly through investments in Bitcoin treasury companies, public firms that accumulate and hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. US fund house Capital Group has appointed Henry Chan to lead financial intermediaries in Hong Kong. In his new position, Chan will manage the city’s team of financial intermediaries, focus on expanding distribution, and enhance existing working relationships with clients. He will be based in Hong Kong and will report to Toby Chan, the head of the Greater China client group. With 20 years of industry experience, Chan has considerable expertise from time spent in distribution roles at large asset managers, including seven years with Capital Group. This appointment reinstates Capital Group’s strong commitment to Hong Kong as a key market and its emphasis on delivering high-quality service through deep client relationships and thought leadership. Capital Group turns $500M Bitcoin Bet into $6.2B payday Capital Group’s most prominent Bitcoin-linked investment is in Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), the software company turned Bitcoin vehicle under founder Michael Saylor. In 2021, the firm purchased a 12.3% stake in Strategy for more than $500 million. That holding, now diluted to 7.89% through share issuance and modest trimming, is valued at roughly $6.2 billion after Strategy’s stock skyrocketed more than 2,200% over the past five years. Beyond Strategy, Capital Group also holds a 5% stake in Japan-based Metaplanet, a hotel operator that pivoted to Bitcoin, and shares in mining company Mara Holdings. Public firms hit 1M BTC milestone as buying spree slows Public companies’ Bitcoin holdings crossed the 1 million BTC milestone in August, yet overall accumulation slowed compared to July—a pause that coincided with Bitcoin’s bull market losing momentum. According to the latest Bitcoin Treasuries Adoption Report, tracked treasury entities added 47,718 BTC ($5.2 billion) last month, less than half of July’s 100,000+ BTC haul. That brought total holdings across public companies, private firms, governments, and ETFs to 3.68 million BTC, valued at around $400 billion month-end. The 1.2% monthly increase marked a sharp slowdown from July’s 4.6%. The relaxation in corporate purchases of BTC may explain why the surge higher towards $123,000 was not sustained. In mid-August, bitcoin reached an all-time high but plummeted by more than 11.5% by the month’s end to less than $109,000. The slowdown happened despite aggressive fundraising announcements. Treasury stocks would see more than $15 billion in new equity raised, including Strategy (MSTR), KindlyMD (NAKA), and Metaplanet (3350). Those commitments have not yet translated into immediate purchases, creating a split between fundraising headlines and actual market reality. MicroStrategy, rebranded as Strategy, remains the largest corporate holder with 636,505 BTC . MARA Holdings follows with more than 52,000 BTC. New entrants such as XXI and Bitcoin Standard Treasury are rapidly climbing the leaderboard, while firms including Metaplanet, Bullish, and Coinbase round out the top 10. Get seen where it counts.

Conduct Your Own Research: Never solely rely on institutional actions. Understand Solana’s fundamentals, risks, and your own investment goals. Consider Long-Term Potential: Institutional investments often indicate a long-term outlook. Evaluate SOL’s potential beyond short-term price fluctuations.

51739144,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=204348,1757899211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/51739144.jpeg,Monero Block Reorganization: Alarming Incident Sparks Hack Fears,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/monero-block-reorganization-fears/,"BitcoinWorld Monero Block Reorganization: Alarming Incident Sparks Hack Fears The Monero (XMR) network recently faced a significant and somewhat unsettling event: an alarming Monero block reorganization . On September 14th, around 9:00 a.m. UTC, the network experienced a reorganization of 18 blocks. This incident, which led to the invalidation of 118 transactions, immediately sent ripples of concern through the cryptocurrency community. Consequently, intense speculation about a potential hack quickly emerged, raising crucial questions about network stability and the robust security Monero is known for. This event served as a stark reminder of the complexities inherent in maintaining decentralized blockchain integrity. What Exactly Happened During the Alarming Monero Block Reorganization? A Monero block reorganization occurs when a temporary fork in the blockchain is resolved, and the network ultimately agrees on a single, longest chain as the canonical history. In this specific event, 18 blocks that were previously thought to be confirmed were effectively “undone” and replaced by a new, longer chain. This process, while a normal and intended part of decentralized network operation, is usually much smaller in scale, often involving only one or two blocks. The fact that 18 blocks were reorganized simultaneously is quite significant and unusual for Monero. This means that any transactions included in those 18 invalidated blocks were effectively reversed or never confirmed on the finally accepted chain. As Bitcoin.com News reported , 118 transactions were affected by this sudden shift. For users, this could translate into their sent or received Monero not having gone through as expected, potentially requiring them to resend funds or carefully verify their transaction status. Understanding the mechanism behind such an event is crucial for grasping its implications. Why Did This Monero Block Reorganization Spark Intense Hack Suspicions? The immediate community reaction to the Monero block reorganization was one of profound suspicion, largely due to the potential for a double-spend attack. In essence, a double-spend attack is an attempt to spend the same cryptocurrency twice. While Monero’s robust privacy features, such as Ring Signatures and Stealth Addresses, typically make such tracking incredibly difficult, the large-scale reorganization fueled fears that a malicious actor might have exploited a vulnerability to execute such an attack. Moreover, Monero’s inherent privacy, while a core benefit for its users, also means that tracing the invalidated transactions or identifying any potential perpetrators becomes extremely challenging. This limited transparency into the “why” of the event can heighten anxiety during unusual network occurrences. Community discussions across various forums, including Reddit and Twitter, quickly erupted, with users trying to piece together the events, analyze the implications, and seek reassurance from developers and fellow enthusiasts. The lack of immediate clear answers amplified the initial concerns. Understanding the Implications of a Monero Block Reorganization for Users For everyday Monero users, a large-scale Monero block reorganization can be both confusing and inconvenient. If your transaction was among the 118 invalidated ones, it means your funds were not confirmed on the final, accepted blockchain. You would then need to resend those transactions once the network had stabilized and your wallet was fully synchronized. Key takeaways and actionable insights for users: Always Verify Transactions: It is paramount to always verify that your Monero transactions have received sufficient confirmations, especially during periods of reported network instability or unusual activity. Maintain Wallet Synchronization: Ensure your Monero wallet is consistently and fully synchronized with the latest blockchain. This ensures that your balance and transaction history accurately reflect the current state of the network.

This significant milestone, highlighted by data from Token Terminal, is not just a number; it is a powerful indicator of the growing maturity, utility, and confidence within the digital asset ecosystem. It signals a pivotal moment for stablecoins and their foundational role in the broader crypto economy. What Drives This Remarkable Growth in Ethereum-based Stablecoins? To truly appreciate this surge, it helps to understand what Ethereum-based stablecoins are. Essentially, these are digital currencies built on the Ethereum blockchain that maintain a stable value, usually pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ether, stablecoins offer a reliable store of value and a medium of exchange. Several factors contribute to their remarkable ascent: Market Stability: In an often-volatile crypto market, stablecoins provide a crucial haven. Traders use them to lock in profits or avoid downturns without converting back to traditional fiat currency. DeFi Dominance: Ethereum hosts the largest and most vibrant Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Ethereum-based stablecoins are the lifeblood of DeFi, serving as collateral for lending, borrowing, and liquidity provision on decentralized exchanges. Global Utility: They facilitate fast, low-cost international remittances and payments, bypassing traditional banking hurdles. This utility is particularly attractive for users seeking efficient cross-border transactions. The $168 billion figure underscores their widespread adoption and essential function across various crypto applications. It confirms their status as a cornerstone of the digital financial world. The Impact of Surging Ethereum-based Stablecoins on DeFi and Beyond The immense growth of Ethereum-based stablecoins carries profound implications for both the DeFi sector and the wider financial landscape. Their increased supply provides deeper liquidity, which is vital for the smooth functioning of decentralized applications. Consider the benefits: Enhanced Liquidity: A larger supply means more capital is available for trading, lending, and other financial activities within DeFi protocols. This leads to better price execution and reduced slippage for users. Increased Accessibility: Stablecoins lower the barrier to entry for individuals worldwide to participate in financial services, regardless of their geographical location or access to traditional banking. Innovation Catalyst: The reliability of stablecoins fosters innovation, enabling developers to build more complex and robust financial products and services on Ethereum.

This kind of explosive rally makes many wonder: Is it the best crypto to buy now, or are there alternative opportunities emerging? While MYX shows what’s possible, the Layer Brett presale offers a distinct path, combining meme appeal with tangible Layer 2 utility and high staking rewards. It’s a compelling alternative. MYX Finance’s Explosive Rally and Its Market Context The recent performance of MYX has been nothing short of spectacular. This decentralized derivatives exchange has seen its price climb from an all-time low in June to nearly $19 in September, marking a gain of over 40,000%. MYX boasts a market capitalization of approximately $1.88 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of about $209 million. Its all-time high of $18.92 was reached just days ago, on September 11, 2025. This rapid ascent, however, comes with extreme volatility, including intraday swings that can exceed 200%. For some investors, the question becomes: how sustainable is this momentum?

Business executives greatly attributed Trump’s threatening tariff policies to be the root cause of the situation, resulting in higher costs and a barrier to expansion plans. Among the industries affected were manufacturing, wholesale and retail, and the energy sector . Julie Robbins, the CEO and co-owner of EarthQuaker Devices, a guitar pedal manufacturer based in Akron, Ohio, commented on the topic of discussion. According to Robbins, these tariff policies have dragged behind the process of manufacturing industries and reduced the advantages manufacturers like her enjoyed earlier. She referred to the tariffs as unexpected taxes and obstacles to the industry’s hiring and growth. The US job market declines amid Trump’s threatening tariff policies Robbins described her business strategy before the imposition of Trump’s tariff policies. According to her, she would normally want to hire around three to four more workers for her work group of 35 members; however, since Trump’s tariff policies took effect, Robbins’ company is now operating effectively on a hiring freeze. In a statement, the manufacturer mentioned that they cannot hire more workers or expand their businesses unless stability in policy and predictability in costs are ensured. She added that they were currently forced to operate in an unpredictable, tough environment. This decline in the job market has prompted economists to anticipate that the US Federal Reserve will reduce interest rates for the first time in 2025 next week. Concerning this situation, Jerome Powell, the United States Federal Reserve Chairman, pointed out that slowing job growth might lessen the inflationary impacts of Trump’s tariff policies. Meanwhile, reliable sources reveal that August’s poor job reports resulted from the effects of Trump’s tariffs on the production sector. Based on the report, the US economy’s hiring drastically decreased with the addition of only 22,000 jobs. To break down the losses encountered in the job market in 2025, the manufacturing sector was significantly hit with a loss of 12,000 jobs, accounting for 78,000 of the total losses, and the mining sector, which includes gas and oil, faced a loss of 6,000 jobs. Additionally, the wholesale trade sector’s employment rate decreased by 32,000. In August, industrial executive John Deere complained that these tariffs had cost them $300 million and were likely to double by the end of the year. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has stated that the job market decrease was observed earlier, even before Trump took office. Based on their data, there were one million fewer jobs available than in March last year. Despite the ongoing challenges, the Trump administration claims these tariffs encourage US firms to invest more in their operations to bring back production. According to their argument, this will soon lead to a significant boost in employment. Industry leaders encounter hardship in their operations amid economic uncertainties Scott Bessent, a United States Secretary of the Treasury, also commented on the topic of discussion. According to Bessent, “For every John Deere, we have companies telling us, ‘The tariffs have benefited our business, we’re boosting our capital expenditures and planning to hire more workers.” His statement contradicts the reports from some industry leaders. According to them, they fear hiring more workers because of economic uncertainties affecting their operations. An example of these industry leaders is Traci Tapani, the CEO of Wyoming Machine, a metal fabrication firm. Tapani stated that she has encountered hardship in operating her company due to the fast changes in tariffs and the back-and-forth nature of things. She further highlighted that this situation has triggered them to apply a strategy whereby they do not replace workers who leave the company. Notably, most of the industries affected are those that US President Donald Trump pledged to revive during his campaign. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

This week brings a significant event for several digital assets: major token unlocks . According to detailed analytics from Tokenomist, investors and enthusiasts alike should be aware of a substantial release of tokens, including a whopping $90.5 million in OP tokens. These scheduled releases can sometimes introduce notable volatility, making it crucial to understand their implications for your portfolio and overall market dynamics. What Exactly Are Token Unlocks and Why Do They Matter? In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, token unlocks refer to the process where previously restricted digital tokens are released into the circulating supply. These tokens are often held by early investors, project team members, or advisors, typically under vesting schedules. Vesting is a mechanism designed to prevent a massive sell-off immediately after a project’s launch, ensuring long-term commitment. While essential for a project’s sustained health and decentralized distribution, these unlocks can significantly increase the available supply of a token on exchanges. Consequently, the market impact can be quite varied: Increased Supply: More tokens becoming available can, theoretically, put downward pressure on prices if market demand doesn’t keep pace with the new influx. Investor Sentiment: The anticipation of large unlocks often creates FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) among existing holders, potentially leading to pre-emptive selling as they brace for a price dip. However, it’s not always a negative outcome. Sometimes, the market has already factored in the unlock event, or strong buying pressure absorbs the new supply without significant price changes. Therefore, understanding the specifics of each unlock, including the project’s fundamentals, is absolutely key. Key Token Unlocks to Watch This Week (Sept. 15-21) This particular week is poised to be quite active, featuring several notable token unlocks that warrant investor attention. Here’s a detailed breakdown of what’s scheduled: Sept. 15, 12:00 p.m. UTC: SEI will unlock 55.56 million tokens, valued at approximately $18.42 million. This release represents 1.18% of its current circulating supply. Sept. 16, 1:00 p.m. UTC: ARB is set to unlock 92.65 million tokens, worth about $47.83 million, accounting for 2.03% of its circulating supply. Sept. 17, 8:00 a.m. UTC: ZK will see 173 million tokens unlocked, valued at $10.32 million, which is 3.61% of its circulating supply. Sept. 17, 12:30 p.m. UTC: APE has 15.60 million tokens scheduled for release, totaling $9.35 million, or 1.72% of its circulating supply. Sept. 18, 12:00 a.m. UTC: FTM will unlock 20 million tokens, an impressive $89.80 million, making up 2.08% of its circulating supply. Sept. 20, 12:00 a.m. UTC: VELO is preparing for a substantial release of three billion tokens, valued at $47.73 million, which is a significant 13.63% of its circulating supply. Sept. 21, 12:00 a.m. UTC: OP will experience the largest unlock this week, with 116 million tokens valued at $90.49 million, representing 6.89% of its circulating supply. These figures clearly highlight the sheer volume of assets poised to enter the market. Investors should pay close attention to the percentages relative to the circulating supply, as larger percentages can sometimes lead to more pronounced price effects. How Can Savvy Investors Prepare for Upcoming Token Unlocks ? Proactive preparation for these events is paramount for minimizing potential risks and, conversely, maximizing opportunities. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Research Thoroughly: Always delve into the project’s fundamentals. Is there strong, ongoing development activity? What is the community sentiment like? A robust project with clear utility might absorb unlocks more easily. Monitor Market Sentiment: Keep a close eye on social media discussions, crypto news outlets, and on-chain data. Is there significant chatter around a particular unlock? This can offer valuable clues about potential short-term price action. Evaluate Your Position: If you currently hold any of the tokens facing unlocks, it’s wise to evaluate your personal risk tolerance. You might consider hedging strategies or adjusting your position if you are concerned about immediate volatility. Look for Entry Points: For some astute investors, unlocks can paradoxically present compelling opportunities. If a token’s price dips post-unlock due to the increased supply, it could be an attractive entry point for long-term holders who possess strong conviction in the project’s future potential. Remember, the cryptocurrency market is inherently dynamic and often unpredictable. While token unlocks are a known and scheduled factor, their precise impact can vary significantly depending on overall market conditions, broader economic trends, and project-specific developments. Staying well-informed and adaptable is your best strategy. A Deeper Dive: The Long-Term View on Token Unlocks While short-term price movements often capture the immediate attention, it’s equally important to consider the long-term implications of token unlocks . For many legitimate projects, these unlocks are a natural and planned component of their economic model. They are designed to reward early contributors, incentivize ongoing development, and ensure a more decentralized distribution of tokens over time. Therefore, they are not inherently negative; rather, they often signify the maturation of a project and the systematic execution of its planned tokenomics. Successful projects typically navigate these unlock phases by maintaining strong community engagement, consistently delivering on their roadmaps, and demonstrating tangible, real-world utility for their tokens. This consistent progress helps to build investor confidence and sustained demand, which can effectively offset the increased supply. Consequently, looking beyond the immediate price action and focusing on the project’s underlying fundamentals remains a prudent strategy for long-term investors. Key Takeaways: Navigating This Week’s Major Token Unlocks This week certainly presents a series of significant token unlocks , with OP, FTM, and VELO experiencing particularly substantial releases. While these events inherently carry the potential for short-term market volatility, they are also an integral, planned part of a cryptocurrency project’s lifecycle. By remaining informed, conducting thorough due diligence, and understanding the broader market context, you can navigate these releases more effectively. Ultimately, successful investing in the fast-paced crypto space demands a proactive and well-researched approach to understanding market dynamics. Keep a close watch on these critical dates and carefully assess how they might influence your current holdings and future investment decisions. Indeed, knowledge is power, especially when it comes to anticipating and reacting to shifts in the crypto market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Token Unlocks Q1: What is a token unlock? A token unlock is when a predetermined amount of cryptocurrency tokens, previously held in a locked state (often by founders, team members, or early investors), are released into the circulating supply. These tokens are typically subject to a vesting schedule. Q2: Why do projects implement token unlocks? Projects use vesting schedules and token unlocks to ensure long-term commitment from team members and early investors. It also helps to prevent a large supply of tokens from flooding the market immediately after launch, promoting more stable growth. Q3: How do token unlocks affect the market price? Token unlocks can increase the circulating supply of a token. If demand doesn’t rise proportionally, this increased supply can potentially lead to downward pressure on the token’s price. However, the actual impact varies greatly depending on market sentiment, the project’s fundamentals, and overall market conditions. Q4: Should I sell my tokens before an unlock? Whether to sell before an unlock depends on your personal investment strategy, risk tolerance, and belief in the project’s long-term potential. Some investors might sell to avoid potential short-term dips, while others might hold or even buy more if they see a dip as a buying opportunity. Always do your own research. Q5: Are all token unlocks negative for price? Not necessarily. While they can introduce volatility, many unlocks are anticipated and already priced into the market. Strong projects with active development and community support can often absorb unlocks without significant negative impact. Sometimes, a post-unlock dip can even be seen as a healthy market correction or a chance for new investors to enter. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

Security Audits: Conducting thorough security checks to protect user assets. Regulatory Compliance: Adapting to new or evolving regulatory requirements. Technical Issues: Addressing unforeseen technical challenges related to the specific asset. Users should remain patient and monitor Bithumb’s official communication channels for further updates regarding the exact reasons or the expected duration of the suspension. Immediate Actions for ZETA Holders If you hold ZETA deposits on Bithumb or plan to interact with the asset, taking immediate action is paramount. Here’s what you should consider: Review Your Holdings: Check your ZETA balance on Bithumb before the deadline. Plan Ahead: If you need to deposit or withdraw ZETA, ensure these transactions are completed well before 9:00 a.m. UTC on September 16. Stay Informed: Regularly check Bithumb’s official announcements page or their social media channels for any new information. Consider Alternatives (if necessary): For those needing to transact ZETA during the suspension period, exploring other reputable exchanges that support ZETA might be an option, though always exercise caution.

Understanding the Impact on Your ZETA Deposits A temporary suspension of ZETA deposits and withdrawals means that during the specified period, you will not be able to move ZETA tokens into or out of your Bithumb account. Your existing ZETA holdings within the exchange will remain secure, but their liquidity will be temporarily restricted. This situation highlights the importance of understanding exchange policies and being prepared for such operational adjustments. While inconvenient, these measures are often in place to safeguard the integrity of the trading environment and protect users from potential issues during critical operational periods. What Happens After the Suspension of ZETA Deposits? Typically, once the underlying reason for the suspension is resolved, Bithumb will announce the resumption of ZETA deposits and withdrawals. This process usually involves another official communication detailing the exact time and any new procedures. It’s rare for such suspensions to be permanent unless there are significant underlying issues with the asset itself or regulatory mandates. Therefore, while the immediate impact is a temporary halt, the expectation is that services will eventually resume. Keeping an eye on Bithumb’s official news will be key to knowing when you can once again freely manage your ZETA tokens on the platform.

The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) behind Polkadot has made a monumental decision, approving a proposal to cap the total Polkadot DOT supply at 2.1 billion. This isn’t just a technical tweak; it’s a strategic move with significant implications for the future of one of the blockchain world’s most ambitious projects. If you’re invested in DOT or simply curious about the evolution of crypto economics, this development is certainly worth your attention. What Does This Historic Polkadot DOT Supply Cap Mean? Imagine a world where the total number of something valuable is fixed. That’s essentially what the Polkadot community has decided for its native token, DOT. The proposal, which garnered an impressive 81% approval from the DAO, sets a hard limit on the total supply of DOT tokens. This means no more than 2.1 billion DOT will ever exist. This isn’t an overnight change. The plan involves a gradual reduction in the issuance of new DOT tokens, which will occur every two years. Think of it as a pre-scheduled, controlled deflationary mechanism. The aim is to introduce scarcity and predictability into Polkadot’s economic model, potentially enhancing its long-term value proposition. How Will the Polkadot DOT Supply Cap Be Implemented? Understanding the ‘how’ behind this decision is key. Polkadot operates with a robust governance model, where its community members, through the DAO, vote on crucial network upgrades and policy changes. The overwhelming support for the Polkadot DOT supply cap underscores a strong consensus within the community for this direction. The phased reduction in DOT issuance is designed to be smooth and predictable. It aims to avoid sudden shocks to the ecosystem while steadily moving towards the 2.1 billion cap. This approach reflects a thoughtful consideration of network stability and participant incentives. It’s a bit like Bitcoin’s halving events, but with a different schedule and mechanism, specifically tailored for Polkadot’s unique architecture. The Potential Benefits and Challenges of Limiting DOT Every major economic shift brings both opportunities and considerations. For Polkadot, capping the DOT supply could unlock several benefits: Increased Scarcity: A finite supply often leads to a perception of higher value, especially as demand grows. Predictable Economics: Knowing the maximum supply provides clarity for investors and developers, aiding long-term planning. Inflation Control: It helps to combat potential inflation, making DOT a more attractive asset over time. However, there are also challenges to consider: Flexibility Concerns: A hard cap might limit the network’s ability to issue new tokens for specific future needs, such as incentivizing new parachains or securing the network during unforeseen circumstances. Ecosystem Growth: Balancing token scarcity with the need to fund and incentivize a growing ecosystem will be an ongoing task for the DAO. What’s Next for Polkadot After This Supply Decision? This historic decision sets a new trajectory for Polkadot. It signals a mature approach to economic management within a decentralized framework. For existing DOT holders, this move could reinforce confidence in the asset’s long-term potential, as scarcity often drives value. Developers building on Polkadot’s parachain ecosystem might also see this as a positive signal, indicating a commitment to a stable and valuable underlying asset. It encourages deeper engagement and investment in the network’s future. The focus will now shift to how Polkadot continues to innovate and attract users within this new supply framework. The approval of the Polkadot DOT supply cap at 2.1 billion marks a pivotal moment for the project. It reflects a strong community vision for a more stable, predictable, and potentially more valuable token economy. As Polkadot continues to evolve its multi-chain architecture, this decision positions DOT for a future where scarcity and decentralized governance play an even more central role. It’s a bold step, and the crypto world will be watching closely to see its full impact unfold. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the new cap for Polkadot (DOT) supply? The Polkadot DAO has approved a proposal to cap the total supply of DOT tokens at 2.1 billion. 2. Why did the Polkadot DAO approve this supply cap?

At the time of the chart, XRP was trading near $3.11. The chart included several technical indicators and annotations that outlined why the analyst expects such a move. The most notable feature was the use of Fibonacci extensions, with the 1.618 level marked around $4.45, the 2.618 level near $6.16, and the 3.618 level positioned at approximately $8.52. Papa highlighted these levels as part of the technical case for the projection, with the highest extension coinciding with the stated target. A breakout structure was also illustrated, showing a descending trendline being broken to the upside, with a large arrow indicating a projected strong advance toward the target zone. system says 8.50 $XRP by november pic.twitter.com/0CuHSXqGmR — papa (@mamagucci) September 13, 2025 An RSI reading was included on the chart, showing values in the low 60s, specifically around 60.94 and 62.17. This placement suggests momentum is leaning positive without yet entering an overbought range on the two-week chart, which supports the analyst’s bullish stance. Papa’s annotations explain the alignment between Fibonacci extensions, the breakout structure, and the RSI positioning, pointing toward a system-based signal for continuation higher. Community’s Reactions The post received replies ranging from skepticism to outright dismissal. A user named Word Noise wrote , “*december *january *february *whenever we feel like flipping the switch,” indicating doubt over the strict timeline presented by Papa. Another user, CerealKiller, countered the bullish outlook by stating , “System says XRP top will be JackSparrow added a sarcastic comment, writing , “Yes. By November 2090,” to highlight disbelief in the November 2025 target. The framing of the projection Papa’s tweet definitively delivers the forecast, presenting the $8.50 target as a system-driven conclusion rather than a speculative scenario. The chart itself is presented with technical precision, incorporating Fibonacci levels and breakout geometry to back the claim.

Considerations for the forecast The projection outlines a clear bullish scenario and demonstrates the technical basis for the target. At the same time, it is a forecast based on technical analysis tools that does not factor in market conditions such as regulatory developments , liquidity shifts, or macroeconomic changes that could affect XRP’s trajectory . Papa’s post sets out a specific timeframe and price level, marking a bold forecast in line with the system referenced.

There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $4,660 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).

In his post, he compared two charts labeled “Before” and “After,” illustrating the development of the price action. He stated that his earlier four-hour prediction was accurate, with the move now unfolding in line with the analysis he provided previously. #XRP : Breaking Out of the Descending Channel (UPDATE): Before: After: https://t.co/MfECqhPoOY pic.twitter.com/7XxVM0tqlX — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 13, 2025 Technical Levels Highlighted In the “Before” chart, XRP was still trading within the descending channel. The chart displayed both the 21-period and 100-period exponential moving averages, with an inset illustration of an ascending triangle formation showing potential entry and target points. In the “After” chart, XRP’s price is shown above the upper boundary of the channel, signaling the breakout Egrag Crypto highlighted. The updated chart shows XRP testing and breaking through the 3.03000 level, which is marked as a significant point of resistance. Above this level, the next target identified is 3.12122. On the downside, Egrag marked 2.99053 as an important support area to watch, with a lower support zone highlighted at 2.85500. The 21 EMA is positioned directly beneath recent candles in the updated chart, with the analyst emphasizing its role as a dynamic support level in this move. Implications of the Update Egrag Crypto’s update presents the breakout as confirmation of the anticipated measured move. His focus on the 21 EMA suggests that it is a key reference point for judging whether the breakout sustains. Maintaining price action above 3.03000 strengthens the case for continuation toward 3.12122, while a breakdown below the 2.99053 support would put pressure back on the structure and shift focus to 2.85500.

The agreement will draw in investment for new plants and reactors in the country. U.S. President Donald Trump lands in Britain on Tuesday for a 2-day state visit. During the trip, Trump and Starmer are due to set out the nuclear partnership and the various projects lined up for development. The plan is to speed up the investments and funding for nuclear development. Among the steps expected is an announcement by US-based X-energy and British-based Centrica to pursue the development of over 12 modular reactors in areas of northeast England. The move would add to efforts to grow a fleet of next-generation nuclear units that can be built faster than traditional plants. Another package being lined up is an £11 billion ($15 billion) plan for the development of advanced data centres that run on small modular reactors at Cottam coal power site in central England. US-based Holtec International is expected to announce the project in collaboration with France’s EDF and property partner Tritax. Starmer and Trump discussed closer work on small modular reactors earlier during their meeting at the U.S. president’s Scotland resort in July. “These major commitments set us well on course to a golden age of nuclear that will drive down household bills in the long run,” Starmer said on Monday. In a government statement, Chris Wright, US Energy Secretary said, “Today’s commercial deals set up a framework to unleash commercial access in both the U.S. and UK.” The UK government has also pledged £14 billion ($19 billion) for a new power plant at Sizewell C and is advancing plans for a Rolls-Royce unit to deliver the country’s first small modular reactors. Officials argue that a bigger nuclear fleet will strengthen energy security and help cut exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices. The Sizewell C is plant will add over £200,000 per year to energy bills The growing pipeline also comes with costs. Analysis by Cornwall Insight shows the development cost for Sizewell C will result in the addition of over £200,000 a year to the energy bills of major businesses that haven’t received exemptions. These companies will face levies of about £221,000 in 2026 to help fund Sizewell C. Separate funds to upgrade and extend electricity cables will separately add around £100,000 for large users who haven’t received exemptions, from April 2026, rising to £250,000 by 2030. This means that a rough increase of 5% is expected on the energy bills of these affected companies. Currently, steelmakers are among the top 500 largest electricity consumers. They receive a discount of 60% on network charges, which is set to increase to 90% by 2026. Centrica to support £10 billion modular nuclear reactors plan Centrica is also deepening its nuclear race as part of a £10 billion plan with U.S. partner X-energy to bring advanced modular reactors to the UK. The companies said they have signed am agreement for the deployment of X-energy’s Xe-100 reactors in Britain. The first step is to 12 80-megawatt units at a site in Hartlepool, with output claimed to be enough to power 1.5 million homes. The plan follows Centrica’s £1.3 billion investment for a 15 per cent stake in the 3.2GW Sizewell C project. Advanced nuclear modular reactors tend to be smaller and a lot more flexible compared with conventional plants, allowing them to be added in stages. X-energy says the Xe-100 design has been completed, and its first plant is being developed in Texas. Downing Street says the transatlantic deal is designed to line up private capital and speed delivery of new stations. Ministers link the programme to lower long-term bills, even as near-term charges for heavy power users continue to rise under existing levies already.

A significant announcement from Binance is making waves across the crypto community. The platform has revealed a temporary Binance OM suspension for both deposits and withdrawals, a crucial update that requires immediate attention from users. This move, while temporary, has important implications for those holding or planning to transact with OM. What’s Happening with OM on Binance? Binance has confirmed it will temporarily halt deposits and withdrawals for OM. This specific Binance OM suspension is scheduled to begin promptly at 3:00 a.m. UTC on September 26. It is important for users to mark this date and time. Deposits Affected: OM deposits will be suspended on the Ethereum network.

It underscores the importance of staying informed about exchange announcements and planning your crypto activities accordingly. Actionable Steps for OM Investors Given the upcoming Binance OM suspension , it is crucial for OM holders to take proactive steps. Timely action can help mitigate any potential disruptions to your crypto management strategy. Here are some immediate actions you should consider: Review Your Holdings: Check your Binance account to ascertain your current OM balance. Plan Transfers Now: If you intend to deposit or withdraw OM, ensure these transactions are completed well before the 3:00 a.m. UTC deadline on September 26. Stay Updated: Regularly monitor official Binance announcement channels for any further updates regarding the suspension, including its duration and resumption of services. Being prepared and acting swiftly will ensure that you are not caught off guard by the temporary halt in services. Looking Ahead: The Importance of Staying Informed The temporary Binance OM suspension serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market and the platforms that facilitate its trading. While such suspensions can be inconvenient, they are often a necessary part of maintaining a robust and secure digital asset ecosystem. Always prioritize staying informed through official channels. This practice not only helps you navigate temporary service changes but also empowers you to make well-informed decisions regarding your digital assets. Your vigilance is your best asset in the fast-paced world of crypto. Summary: Binance is implementing a temporary suspension of OM deposits and withdrawals starting September 26, 3:00 a.m. UTC, affecting Ethereum and BSC networks.

James, the insightful co-founder and a core developer of MAP Protocol (MAPO), recently made waves with a bold declaration: he will no longer be selling his personal holdings of MAPO. Even more compelling, he plans to channel his daily profits directly into consistent MAPO buybacks . This strategic move is poised to strengthen the token’s foundation and bolster community confidence. What’s Driving the MAPO Buybacks Initiative? James shared his groundbreaking intentions on X, outlining a personal commitment to the MAP Protocol’s long-term success. His decision to cease selling his holdings is a powerful statement, demonstrating unwavering faith in the project. Furthermore, his pledge to utilize daily profits for MAPO buybacks signals a proactive approach to supporting the token’s value. This isn’t just a personal endeavor; James is also actively engaging the ButterSwap team, encouraging them to dedicate their profits to this same buyback initiative. Such concerted efforts can create a substantial impact on the token’s ecosystem. This latest development builds upon an earlier indication from last month, where James first hinted at plans for a MAPO buyback. The recent announcement provides more concrete details and a clear path forward, transforming an idea into an actionable strategy. Understanding Token Buybacks and Their Benefits For those new to the concept, a token buyback occurs when a project, or a significant holder like James, repurchases its own tokens from the open market. This action typically has several positive implications: Reduced Supply: By buying back tokens, the circulating supply is effectively decreased. According to basic economic principles, a reduced supply, assuming constant or increasing demand, can lead to an increase in the token’s value. Increased Demand: The act of buying itself creates demand for the token, which can further support its price. Investor Confidence: A consistent buyback program signals strong belief from core developers and the project team in the token’s future. This can significantly boost investor confidence and attract new holders. Price Stability: Regular buybacks can help absorb selling pressure, potentially leading to greater price stability for the token. The commitment to daily MAPO buybacks , especially from a co-founder, demonstrates a dedication that resonates deeply within the crypto community. It reflects a tangible investment in the project’s future, beyond just development work. The Potential Impact of ButterSwap Joining the MAPO Buybacks James’s efforts to persuade the ButterSwap team to join the MAPO buybacks initiative are particularly noteworthy. ButterSwap, as a decentralized exchange (DEX) within the ecosystem, generates its own profits from trading fees. If ButterSwap allocates a portion of these profits towards repurchasing MAPO tokens, the scale of the buyback program could significantly expand. This collaboration would: Amplify Market Impact: Combining personal and protocol-level profits for buybacks would create a more substantial and consistent buying force in the market. Strengthen Ecosystem Synergy: It showcases a unified vision across different components of the MAP Protocol ecosystem, reinforcing trust and cohesion. Sustainable Growth: Utilizing operational profits for buybacks creates a self-sustaining mechanism for supporting the token’s value, independent of external capital injections. Such a multi-faceted approach to MAPO buybacks could set a precedent for how projects engage with their native tokens, prioritizing long-term value and community benefit. What Does This Mean for MAP Protocol’s Future? This initiative underscores a robust commitment to the MAP Protocol’s long-term vision. MAP Protocol aims to be a leading Web3 infrastructure for omnichain interoperability, enabling seamless communication and asset transfer across various blockchains. A strong, stable native token like MAPO is crucial for fueling this vision, incentivizing network participants, and securing the protocol. While buybacks are generally positive, it’s always important for investors to conduct their own research and understand that market dynamics are influenced by many factors. However, the transparent and proactive stance taken by James, particularly regarding MAPO buybacks , provides a compelling narrative for the project’s future. In conclusion, James’s announcement of daily MAPO buybacks, coupled with his efforts to involve ButterSwap, marks a pivotal moment for MAP Protocol. This strategic move demonstrates a deep commitment from leadership, aiming to foster greater token stability, enhance investor confidence, and ultimately contribute to the sustained growth and success of the MAP Protocol ecosystem. It’s a testament to the belief in the project’s mission to build a truly interoperable Web3 future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is MAP Protocol (MAPO)? MAP Protocol is a leading Web3 infrastructure focused on omnichain interoperability, enabling seamless and secure communication and asset transfer across different blockchain networks. Its native token is MAPO. What are token buybacks in cryptocurrency? Token buybacks involve a project or a significant holder repurchasing its own tokens from the open market. This action aims to reduce the circulating supply, increase demand, and potentially stabilize or increase the token’s value. How do these MAPO buybacks benefit token holders? MAPO buybacks can benefit holders by potentially reducing the token’s circulating supply, which can lead to increased scarcity and upward price pressure. They also signal strong confidence from the project’s leadership, boosting overall investor trust. Who is James from MAP Protocol? James is the co-founder and a core developer of MAP Protocol. He recently announced his personal commitment to daily MAPO buybacks using his profits and is encouraging ButterSwap to join the initiative. What is ButterSwap’s role in this initiative? ButterSwap is a decentralized exchange within the MAP Protocol ecosystem. James is persuading the ButterSwap team to use its operational profits to participate in the MAPO buybacks, which would significantly amplify the initiative’s impact. Do MAPO buybacks guarantee a price increase? While MAPO buybacks are generally a positive indicator and can support token value, they do not guarantee a price increase.

Following a recent security breach, the Sui (SUI)-based trading platform is taking decisive action to support its community. Nemo Protocol has announced an innovative plan to issue temporary NEOM debt tokens as a core component of its compensation strategy for those affected by the hack. This move highlights a proactive approach to restoring trust and ensuring victim recovery. What Exactly Are NEOM Debt Tokens? Nemo Protocol, a decentralized trading platform operating on the Sui blockchain, recently experienced a significant security incident. This unfortunate event led to losses for many users, prompting an immediate response from the protocol’s team. To address the situation, Nemo Protocol is introducing NEOM debt tokens , a unique solution designed to provide flexible and stable compensation. These tokens are not just any digital asset; they are specifically designed to represent a debt owed by the protocol to its users. Crucially, each NEOM debt token will be backed by the U.S. dollar, ensuring a stable value for victims. This backing is a key feature, aiming to mitigate further volatility for those who have already experienced losses. Why Are NEOM Debt Tokens a Preferred Option for Compensation? The decision to issue NEOM debt tokens offers several compelling advantages for victims. Instead of immediate direct dollar payments, which might not suit everyone’s preferences or regional financial regulations, these tokens provide an alternative. Victims who prefer not to receive direct dollar payments will have the option to receive NEOM debt tokens. Stability: Being backed by the U.S. dollar, the NEOM debt tokens offer a stable value, protecting recipients from further market fluctuations. Flexibility: This approach provides choice.

Transparency: The issuance of these tokens provides a clear, auditable record of compensation, enhancing trust and accountability. This strategy demonstrates Nemo Protocol’s commitment to finding a fair and user-centric solution during a challenging time. It acknowledges the diverse needs of its user base, offering a tailored recovery path. How Will the NEOM Debt Tokens Be Distributed and Redeemed? The exact mechanics of distribution and redemption for the NEOM debt tokens are crucial for victims. Nemo Protocol plans to distribute these tokens to eligible users based on their verified losses from the hack. The process will likely involve a claims portal or a direct airdrop to affected wallet addresses. While the tokens are temporary, their redemption mechanism will be clearly outlined. Users will have the option to convert their NEOM debt tokens back into U.S. dollars at a later, specified date, or potentially use them for other purposes within the Nemo Protocol ecosystem. Details regarding the redemption timeline and any associated procedures will be communicated transparently by the Nemo Protocol team. The implementation of this system requires careful planning and execution to ensure fairness and efficiency. Nemo Protocol is expected to provide comprehensive guidelines to all affected users, ensuring they understand their options and the steps involved in claiming and utilizing their compensation. What Does This Mean for Nemo Protocol’s Future? The introduction of NEOM debt tokens is more than just a compensation mechanism; it’s a critical step in Nemo Protocol’s journey to rebuild trust and fortify its platform. By addressing the hack’s aftermath proactively and transparently, the protocol aims to demonstrate resilience and a strong commitment to its community. Moving forward, Nemo Protocol will undoubtedly focus on enhancing its security infrastructure, implementing more robust auditing processes, and fostering a stronger, more secure environment for its users. This incident, while unfortunate, presents an opportunity for the protocol to emerge stronger and more reliable. Conclusion: A Resilient Path Forward with NEOM Debt Tokens Nemo Protocol’s decision to issue NEOM debt tokens represents a thoughtful and user-centric approach to hack compensation. By offering a dollar-backed, stable alternative to direct payments, the protocol is empowering victims with choice and stability during a difficult period. This innovative solution not only addresses immediate losses but also lays a foundation for rebuilding trust and reinforcing the platform’s commitment to security and user welfare. As Nemo Protocol navigates this challenging phase, its proactive measures with NEOM debt tokens set a precedent for resilience in the decentralized finance space.

Recently, a significant event sent ripples across the digital asset landscape: a massive crypto futures liquidation totaling an astonishing $95 million in just 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH) found itself at the forefront of this market upheaval, highlighting the inherent volatility and risks associated with leveraged trading. What is a Crypto Futures Liquidation, and Why Does it Matter? For those new to the intricacies of crypto trading, understanding what a crypto futures liquidation entails is crucial. Essentially, it occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange due to a sudden and substantial price movement against their bet. This happens because the trader’s margin balance falls below the maintenance margin requirement, meaning they no longer have enough collateral to cover potential losses. It’s an automated process designed to prevent traders from incurring further debt than their initial margin. The past 24 hours witnessed a dramatic display of this mechanism, with substantial volumes being liquidated across major cryptocurrencies: ETH: A staggering $56.70 million was liquidated, with long positions (bets on price increase) accounting for a dominant 66.29% of these forced closures. DOGE: This meme coin saw $20.33 million liquidated, with an even higher percentage of long positions at 83.17%. BTC: The market’s largest cryptocurrency experienced $18.03 million in liquidations, with long positions making up 81.54%. These figures underscore a prevailing sentiment among many traders who were betting on upward price movements, only to be caught off guard by a sudden downturn or sideways consolidation that triggered their stop-loss levels or margin calls. The prevalence of long liquidations suggests that market participants were largely bullish, making them vulnerable to any negative price action. Why Did This Massive Crypto Futures Liquidation Occur? Several factors can contribute to such a significant crypto futures liquidation event. Market volatility is, without a doubt, the primary culprit. Cryptocurrencies are known for their rapid price swings, and when traders utilize high leverage, even small market movements can have outsized impacts on their positions. A sudden dip, perhaps triggered by macroeconomic news, regulatory FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt), or even a large sell-off by whales, can quickly push leveraged positions into unprofitable territory. In this particular instance, ETH leading the charge suggests that Ethereum-specific news, network developments, or broader sentiment around its ecosystem might have played a role. However, the widespread impact across DOGE and BTC indicates a broader market correction or a shift in investor confidence. When one asset experiences significant selling pressure, it often creates a ripple effect, prompting other traders to close positions or triggering automated liquidations across the board. Navigating the Risks: Lessons from the Crypto Futures Liquidation For traders, especially those engaging in futures and leveraged trading, events like this serve as a powerful reminder of the inherent risks. While leverage can amplify gains, it equally magnifies losses, leading to swift account depletion if not managed meticulously. The forced closure of positions, or a crypto futures liquidation , is a painful lesson for many who over-leveraged their trades or failed to implement robust risk management strategies. Key takeaways for traders include: Understanding Leverage: Use leverage cautiously and only when fully comprehending its implications. Implementing Stop-Losses: Always set stop-loss orders to limit potential losses on a trade. Diversification: Avoid putting all your capital into highly leveraged positions on a single asset. Market Awareness: Stay informed about market news, technical indicators, and overall sentiment. This event underscores that even established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin are not immune to sharp corrections, and Dogecoin’s higher long liquidation ratio points to its often speculative nature. What’s Next for the Crypto Market? While a $95 million crypto futures liquidation is substantial, it’s also a relatively common occurrence in the fast-paced world of digital assets. Such events often serve to ‘cleanse’ the market of over-leveraged positions, potentially setting the stage for more sustainable price movements in the future. However, they also highlight that market participants should remain vigilant and prepared for continued volatility. The recent liquidations, particularly those involving ETH, remind us that the crypto market is a dynamic environment where fortunes can change in an instant. Prudent risk management, continuous learning, and a clear understanding of market mechanics are paramount for anyone looking to navigate these exciting yet challenging waters successfully. Always prioritize capital preservation over aggressive speculation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a crypto futures liquidation? A crypto futures liquidation is the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange when their margin balance falls below the required level, preventing further losses and debt. Q2: Why did Ethereum (ETH) lead this liquidation event? While specific reasons can vary, ETH leading the liquidation suggests that a significant number of traders had highly leveraged long positions on Ethereum, making them particularly vulnerable to recent price downturns or market corrections. Q3: What does it mean for long positions to account for a high percentage of liquidations? When long positions account for a high percentage of liquidations, it means that a majority of traders who were betting on price increases (going ‘long’) were caught off guard by a price drop, leading to their positions being forcibly closed. Q4: How can traders protect themselves from crypto futures liquidation? Traders can protect themselves by using lower leverage, setting strict stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin, and practicing sound risk management strategies, including diversifying their portfolio and staying informed about market conditions. Q5: Is a crypto futures liquidation a rare event? No, significant crypto futures liquidation events are not uncommon in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market. They occur periodically as a natural consequence of leveraged trading and market price swings. Did you find this analysis helpful?

While dollar stablecoins often appear as a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto realm, the BOK’s recent assessment suggests they could pose a surprising threat to the U.S. dollar’s long-standing status as a safe-haven asset. This analysis, part of a detailed report on dollar hegemony, urges a closer look at these digital assets. What Are Dollar Stablecoins and Why Are They Under Scrutiny? Simply put, dollar stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. They achieve this stability by holding reserves in dollars or dollar-denominated assets. Many see them as a crucial component of the crypto ecosystem, facilitating trading and international remittances. However, the BOK’s report, released on September 15th, highlights a nuanced perspective. While their widespread adoption in international trade could initially strengthen the dollar’s global footprint, the central bank identifies potential pitfalls that could undermine its stability. The Double-Edged Nature of Digital Dominance for Dollar Stablecoins On one hand, the BOK acknowledges that if dollar stablecoins become a primary medium for cross-border transactions, they could indeed reinforce the U.S. dollar’s global dominance. This scenario would mean more demand for dollar-backed assets, further cementing the greenback’s role in the international financial system. Conversely, the BOK warns of a darker side. The very nature of these digital assets could inadvertently erode the dollar’s coveted safe-haven status. A safe-haven asset is typically a reliable store of value during times of market turbulence, like gold or the U.S. dollar itself. The central bank’s concern stems from the potential for sudden, large-scale movements within the stablecoin market. How Could Dollar Stablecoins Threaten Financial Stability? The BOK’s primary concern revolves around the potential for rapid, large-scale withdrawals from dollar stablecoins . Imagine a scenario where a significant portion of stablecoin holders suddenly decide to redeem their digital assets for physical dollars. This could trigger a cascade of effects: Mass Redemptions: Stablecoin issuers might be forced to liquidate their underlying dollar-denominated assets, such as U.S. Treasury bonds, very quickly. Market Volatility: Such large-scale, forced selling could create significant volatility in government bond markets, disrupting a critical component of global finance. Liquidity Crunch: This could lead to a liquidity crunch, where traditional financial institutions struggle to meet their short-term obligations, potentially spilling over into broader markets. These risks are not merely theoretical. The BOK’s analysis points to the interconnectedness of digital assets and traditional finance, suggesting that shocks originating in the stablecoin market could have far-reaching global ripple effects, echoing the report’s focus on U.S.-originated shocks. Navigating the Future: What Does This Mean for Investors and Policymakers? The BOK’s warning serves as a crucial reminder for both investors and policymakers. For investors, understanding the underlying reserves and regulatory frameworks of different dollar stablecoins becomes paramount. Diversification and careful risk assessment are always key. For policymakers, the report underscores the urgent need for comprehensive regulatory frameworks. Clear rules regarding stablecoin reserves, transparency, and redemption mechanisms are essential to mitigate these potential systemic risks. International cooperation among central banks will also be vital to address the cross-border nature of these digital assets and ensure global financial stability. The evolving landscape of digital currencies demands proactive and informed responses to safeguard the integrity of the traditional financial system. The Bank of Korea’s assessment presents a compelling paradox: while dollar stablecoins could bolster the U.S. dollar’s international standing, they also harbor the potential to destabilize its fundamental role as a safe-haven asset. The risk of large-scale withdrawals and subsequent market volatility highlights the intricate challenges posed by these innovative digital assets. As the digital economy continues to evolve, understanding and effectively managing these emerging risks will be paramount for maintaining global financial stability. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a safe-haven asset? A1: A safe-haven asset is an investment that is expected to retain or increase in value during times of market turbulence or economic uncertainty. The U.S. dollar, gold, and certain government bonds are traditionally considered safe havens. Q2: How could dollar stablecoins strengthen the USD’s dominance? A2: If dollar stablecoins become widely adopted for international trade and transactions, it would increase the demand for dollar-denominated assets held as reserves, thereby reinforcing the U.S. dollar’s global role. Q3: What specific risks did the BOK identify? A3: The Bank of Korea warned about the potential for large-scale withdrawals from dollar stablecoins , which could force issuers to liquidate underlying assets and create significant volatility in government bond prices. Q4: Are all stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar? A4: No, while dollar stablecoins are the most common, there are stablecoins pegged to other fiat currencies (like the Euro or Yen) or even to commodities like gold. Q5: What is the main takeaway for investors regarding dollar stablecoins? A5: Investors should be aware of the potential risks, including market volatility and the stability of underlying reserves. It’s crucial to research the regulatory compliance and transparency of any stablecoin before investing.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation as Binance, one of the largest exchanges globally, makes another significant announcement: the Binance AVNT listing . This move brings a new token into the spotlight, offering both exciting prospects and important considerations for traders. Are you ready to dive into what this means for the evolving digital asset landscape? What Does the Binance AVNT Listing Mean for Traders? Binance officially announced that it will list AVNT, opening trading pairs for users worldwide. This highly anticipated event is scheduled for 5:00 a.m. UTC on September 15th. For many, a Binance AVNT listing represents a gateway to new investment opportunities within the dynamic crypto market. Increased Accessibility: Listing on Binance provides AVNT with massive exposure to millions of users, significantly boosting its liquidity and trading volume. Market Validation: A listing on such a prominent exchange often lends credibility to a project, signaling its potential to a broader audience. New Trading Pairs: Users will gain access to specific trading pairs, allowing them to buy and sell AVNT against established cryptocurrencies. However, it’s essential to remember that while listings can be exciting, they also introduce new dynamics into the market. Navigating the Seed Tag: Understanding AVNT’s Volatility A crucial aspect of this announcement is that Binance will apply its Seed Tag to the AVNT token. What exactly does this mean for potential investors and the future of the Binance AVNT listing ? The Seed Tag is a special designation Binance uses for projects that may exhibit higher volatility and risk compared to other established tokens. It serves as a warning, prompting traders to exercise extra caution. Higher Risk: Tokens with a Seed Tag can experience rapid and significant price fluctuations, both upwards and downwards. Innovation Focus: These projects are often newer, highly innovative, and still in their early development stages, carrying inherent uncertainties. Enhanced Due Diligence: Binance encourages users to conduct thorough research and understand the project’s fundamentals before engaging with Seed Tag tokens. Understanding the implications of the Seed Tag is paramount for anyone considering participating in the Binance AVNT listing . It’s not just about the potential gains; it’s also about managing the potential downsides. Preparing for the Binance AVNT Listing: Key Considerations As the date for the Binance AVNT listing approaches, what actionable insights can traders adopt to navigate this new opportunity effectively? Prudent preparation is key to making informed decisions in such a fast-paced environment. Firstly, thorough research is non-negotiable. Dive deep into the AVNT project’s whitepaper, team, technology, and use cases. Understand its market position and what problem it aims to solve. This foundational knowledge will help you assess its long-term viability. Secondly, consider your risk tolerance. Given the Seed Tag, AVNT is expected to be volatile. Only invest what you can comfortably afford to lose. Setting stop-loss orders can be a valuable strategy to mitigate potential losses during sharp price movements. Moreover, diversifying your portfolio is always a wise approach. Avoid putting all your capital into a single new listing, especially one with a Seed Tag. A balanced portfolio helps spread risk and can protect you from significant impacts if one asset underperforms. Finally, stay informed. Follow official Binance announcements and AVNT project updates. The crypto market evolves rapidly, and timely information can make a significant difference in your trading strategy. Seizing the Moment: A Strategic Approach to AVNT The upcoming Binance AVNT listing presents an exciting, albeit high-risk, opportunity for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. While the potential for significant gains exists, the presence of Binance’s Seed Tag underscores the importance of a cautious and well-researched approach. Traders should prioritize understanding the project’s fundamentals, managing their risk exposure, and staying updated with market developments. Ultimately, navigating new listings successfully comes down to informed decision-making and a disciplined strategy. Are you ready to embrace the potential of AVNT while safeguarding your investments? Frequently Asked Questions About the Binance AVNT Listing Here are some common questions regarding the upcoming AVNT listing on Binance: What is the exact time of the Binance AVNT listing? Binance will list AVNT at 5:00 a.m. UTC on September 15th. Always confirm the exact time zone conversion for your local region. What does the “Seed Tag” on AVNT mean? The Seed Tag is a label Binance applies to projects that may carry higher volatility and risk compared to other tokens. It’s a reminder for users to conduct extra due diligence.

In his post and accompanying video, Hilton noted that XRP had risen more than four percent in a single day and was up roughly eight to nine percent over the past few days. He explained that XRP had been consolidating for several weeks around the $2.80 level but has recently moved upward by nearly ten percent in just two days. Hilton linked this movement to broader developments in the cryptocurrency space. He said the total cryptocurrency market capitalization had returned to above $4 trillion, with Bitcoin taking approximately 60% of that value. He emphasized that institutional interest is starting to re-emerge, with cash and liquidity returning to the market, which he believes is contributing to XRP’s recent performance. Fellow XRP Holders! It's Happening… pic.twitter.com/lMP7c9Dt01 — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) September 13, 2025 Federal Reserve Decision and Speculation A key point raised in Hilton’s analysis was the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting scheduled for September 17 . He mentioned that the market is anticipating a potential interest rate cut of either 25 or 50 basis points. According to Hilton, speculation surrounding this decision is already influencing market sentiment, with traders and institutions positioning ahead of the announcement. He noted that there could be a “buy the rumor, sell the news” effect depending on the outcome, explaining that a smaller 25 basis point reduction might lead to short-term selling if investors had hoped for a larger cut. However, he stressed that two additional interest rate meetings remain before the end of the year, making the fourth quarter of 2025 a critical period for crypto markets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Long-Term Outlook and Investment Approach Hilton reinforced his belief that the crypto community often underestimates the long-term potential of the market. He recalled his earlier commentary on a Fidelity report suggesting that Bitcoin could reach $1 billion by 2038, highlighting the credibility of the source. Based on his outlook, he shared that he personally intends to increase his own XRP holdings, even at current levels, and also plans to buy more Ethereum and Bitcoin. He suggested that investors consider strategies such as small, regular purchases through automated drafts on exchanges, which allow consistent accumulation without waiting for larger capital reserves. Hilton framed this as a practical way to remain engaged in the market and avoid missing opportunities during periods of price growth. Hilton concluded by restating his optimism about XRP and the broader crypto market in the months ahead, stressing the importance of preparing for potential volatility around the Federal Reserve’s decision and looking toward the final quarter of the year as a significant period for digital assets.

Both have been worked on and integrated for years, so many investors rely on them. However, their huge market caps and present network saturation have limited their short-term development potential. As a result, traders and retail investors are looking into smaller, utility-driven projects that have more room to expand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming a strong option among these. MUTM was just $0.035 during its presale, but it offers similar innovation in decentralized finance, stablecoin issuance, and liquidity management—all at a much lower cost, making it a good option for investors looking for new opportunities while other networks are stuck. MUTM is a good alternative for people who want to keep up with crypto collapse news, look at how crypto ETFs are doing, or figure out why crypto is down. Presale momentum and urgency for new investors The presale for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now in Phase 6, and the price is $0.035. So far, $15.66 million has been raised. More than 16,250 people are taking part, and 38% of this allocation has been taken. The next phase is likely to cause the price to go up by 15% to $0.040, which will make investors want to get in early before the token goes up even more. People who own AVAX and TRX and want to make money quickly would like MUTM because it is cheaper and has a lot of room for growth based on adoption. MUTM makes sure that there is both demand and opportunity for new participants by offering a well-structured presale with clear boundaries. This makes it possible to buy a token for less than 4 cents, which is very rare for a token that is developed for utility and scalability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has strong decentralized stablecoin mechanisms that only mint the stablecoin when users borrow against overcollateralized assets like ETH and burn it when they pay it back or sell it. Interest rates set by the governance keep the stablecoin fixed to $1, and arbitrage opportunities naturally help keep the peg. This approach makes both lenders and borrowers feel safe since it keeps the system safe while allowing money to flow freely. Borrowing interest rates change based on how much money is available. They are low when there is a lot of liquidity to encourage borrowing and high when there is not enough capital to encourage repayments and attract new deposits from lenders looking for better returns. For instance, a user who locks up $12,000 in LINK will get mtLINK rewards and steady returns, while another user who uses $8,000 in XRP as collateral can unlock liquidity without having to sell during times of high volatility. Price discovery, roadmap, and security assurance Price discovery at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) depends on a mix of Chainlink oracles, fallback oracles, aggregated feeds, and time-weighted average price (TWAP) measures. These steps guarantee that collateralized assets are valued correctly, even if the main data sources are slow or down. This framework gives customers trust and makes borrowing and lending activities more stable. This makes MUTM an infrastructure-ready project before it is listed on the main market. The four-phase roadmap shows even more how serious MUTM is about structured growth. Phase 1 includes presale execution, marketing campaigns, completing an external audit, giving things away, and listing on tracking platforms. Most of the big activities are almost done. In Phase 2, the main focus will be on developing core smart contracts and dApps, building back-end infrastructure, using advanced analytics, and integrating risk parameters. In Phase 3, the focus is on beta testing on testnet, launching functional demos, getting ready for exchange listings, and doing final audits. Phase 4 will bring the live platform, make it possible to claim tokens, set up collaborations with institutions, and add other blockchains to the network, making sure that it can grow and be used for a long time. MUTM puts a lot of emphasis on safety and getting people involved in their community. The platform got CertiK scores of 95 on Token Scan and 78 on Skynet. Also, a $100,000 incentive encourages people to sign up early, and a $50,000 USDT bug bounty program compensates bugs based on how serious they are: critical issues get up to $2,000, major issues get up to $1,000, medium issues get up to $500, and low-risk issues get up to $200. These steps protect the integrity of smart contracts and encourage a vibrant, engaged community. Final words Investors looking for both stability and growth are turning their attention to new utility tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as AVAX and TRX continue to develop and offer limited near-term multiples. MUTM has a good case for being the next altcoin that can make big profits. It has a stablecoin ecosystem, a dynamic borrow and liquidity strategy, presale momentum, and a safe architecture. For investors who are keeping an eye on crypto ETFs or trying to figure out why crypto prices are going down, MUTM offers a chance to get in on a project that is created for acceptance, scalability, and measurable benefit.

The Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA), created under the Virtual Assets Ordinance 2025, reportedly issued a call for Expressions of Interest this Saturday from firms already operating in other major jurisdictions. With over 40m users and an estimated $300b in annual trading volume, Pakistan’s virtual asset market shows rapid growth, but until now it has remained largely unregulated. Authorities say the licensing drive aims to curb illicit finance while also providing a stable framework for fintech innovation. Pakistan Targets Trusted International Firms for Its New Crypto Regime PVARA wants applicant companies to already hold licenses from prominent regulators such as the US SEC, the UK Financial Conduct Authority, the EU’s VASP framework, the UAE’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority, or the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Bilal bin Saqib, CEO of Pakistan Crypto Council, told Cryptonews in an earlier interview that the cost of doing business in the country is much cheaper than elsewhere. “We have access to amazing talent. We are in a very strategic location. For blockchain and crypto, what you need is great human resource,” he said. Pakistan is consulting with global regulators to build a “Pakistan-first” crypto framework, Crypto Council CEO @Bilalbinsaqib told Cryptonews. #Pakistan #CryptoCouncil https://t.co/GZ9vkwUTo5 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 1, 2025 Submissions must include detailed company profiles, licensing information from other jurisdictions, track records in compliance – especially on anti-money laundering, counter-terrorism financing, and know-your-customer standards. Applicants must also define their proposed business model for operating in Pakistan. Applications Accepted on Rolling Basis for Greater Flexibility The licensing framework also includes regulatory sandboxes to foster innovation, including products compliant with Shariah law. PVARA said these measures will align Pakistan’s virtual asset sector with international norms set by institutions like the Financial Action Task Force, IMF, and World Bank. Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis via email, giving eligible firms flexibility to submit when ready. The Virtual Assets Ordinance came into force on July 8, 2025, establishing PVARA with the power to license, regulate and supervise virtual asset service providers across Pakistan. PVARA’s governing board includes heads of key institutions such as the State Bank of Pakistan, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Federal Board of Revenue. It must ensure strong cybersecurity frameworks and consumer protection alongside preventing illicit financial flows. Policy Support and Infrastructure Development Gain Momentum Officials describe this as a pivotal step toward integrating Pakistan’s digital-asset economy with global financial practices while offering legal clarity to investors and consumers. Earlier this year, Pakistan boosted its commitment to crypto regulation by launching the Pakistan Crypto Council, appointing Binance founder Changpeng Zhao as a strategic adviser and working to build infrastructure and policy support. As the regulatory framework settles, the government hopes that this licensing regime will signal stability to foreign investors while providing Pakistani users with safer, regulated options.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency avoided sharp volatility but remained on watch for signals that could shape its near-term direction. Cautious Market Moves Data from TradingView showed Bitcoin dropping toward $115,000 after peaking at $116,800 during Friday’s Wall Street session — its highest level since late August. “Pretty clear price is being walked down here yet again going into a new week,” trader Skew wrote on X, adding that there was “some pretty decent bid depth & liquidity just below $115K.” “Time to pay attention,” he concluded. Other analysts emphasized that Bitcoin’s short-term goal was not a breakout, but rather regaining stability at key support levels. Traders Focus on $114K Support Popular analyst Rekt Capital explained that the immediate task was for Bitcoin to reclaim $114,000 as a firm base. “The goal isn’t for Bitcoin to break $117k in the short-term,” he wrote. “The goal is for Bitcoin to reclaim $114k into support first. Because that’s what would enable the premium-buying necessary to get price above $117k later on.” Despite short-term uncertainty, Rekt Capital maintained that Bitcoin’s bull market remained intact and that fresh all-time highs were likely still ahead. He added that a weekly close above $114,000 would be considered “bullish.” Fed Rate Cut Expectations Dominate Beyond Bitcoin, the spotlight was firmly on the Federal Reserve’s upcoming policy decision. Markets were near-unanimous in predicting a 0.25% rate cut, a move that could further support risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Analysts argued that improving U.S. economic data, looser financial conditions, and broad participation from cyclical industries all point to continued economic expansion. In a recent update, trading firm Mosaic Asset Company struck an optimistic tone. “The combination of improving leading indicators, ongoing loose financial conditions, and strong market breadth that includes participation by cyclical industries favors an ongoing economic expansion in my opinion,” its author wrote. “That supports the earnings outlook which is ultimately good for stock prices at the same time the Fed is set to resume rate cuts. That could make for an excellent trading environment into next year.”",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-09-15 04:50:18

BTC and ETH price spikes have made the news, but a lot of new investors are wondering where they can put their money to make big profits without having to wait years. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming a platform that offers just that: overcollateralized lending, stablecoin minting, and staking-based rewards. MUTM is a great alternative to storing ETH passively since it has new mechanisms and institutional-level security. It also lets regular investors take part in faster growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to protect investors’ money while also providing a steady return. Borrowers have to overcollateralize, which makes a buffer that keeps the protocol safe from abrupt drops in asset values. Liquidation processes make sure that positions that drop below safety levels are dealt with right away, and liquidators are given bonuses to keep the system healthy. The stable interest rate model gives borrowers predictable repayment schedules and lets the protocol adjust rates when the market is very unstable. This combination makes sure that people may confidently earn yield, lend money, or stake mtTokens, even when crypto values go up and down or the market as a whole corrects itself. ETH treasury firm BitMine scoops $200M of ETH On September 12, 2025, BitMine, a big treasury corporation, bought $200 million worth of Ethereum (ETH). This raised the price of ETH to about $4,400, with a trading volume of $37.07 billion in 24 hours. The purchase is part of a larger trend of companies building up their treasuries, which shows that institutions have a lot of faith in Ethereum’s DeFi and layer-2 ecosystems. Technical indications reveal that ETH is testing the $4,150 support level, with the RSI at 48 and the resistance level at $4,500. People on social media are excited about BitMine’s shift and the planned Pectra upgrade, but there are concerns about things like US tariffs and $346.46 million in liquidations. If $4,500 clears, analysts say the aim is $4,868. But if it drops below $4,150, it might drop to $3,950. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): presale momentum and retail window The presale for Phase 6 of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now open, and each token costs $0.035. There are more than 16,300 holders taking part, and $15.66 million has been raised so far. 38% of the 170 million token supply has already been sold. The price will go up to $0.040 in the following phase, which means this is the last chance to get tokens at a discount before launch. Investors who bought in Phase 1 at $0.010 are already seeing gains of more than 250%. When MUTM lists at $0.20, investors who bought in Phase 6 will be able to get 500% returns. The platform’s restricted quantity of 4 billion tokens, staking incentives, and protocol buybacks all work together to keep the token’s price going up. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lets regular investors actively make money while whales keep a lot of ETH. Lending yields, stablecoin minting, and staking programs all make money all the time. This makes a system that is always changing, like early DeFi successes like AAVE and UNI, which saw their prices go up 5–10X in their first few months. MUTM gives regular investors a way to get into this kind of high-growth environment that is easy to understand and offers both safety and predictable returns. The platform’s improved collateral efficiency makes it easier to borrow more money for linked assets. At the same time, carefully controlled deposit and borrow caps lower exposure to volatile tokens, which keeps the protocol stable. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is more trustworthy since it has a CertiK audit score of 95, an AI-powered helpdesk service, partnerships with institutional roadmaps, and a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. These protections provide investors even more confidence that the platform is intended to handle complex operational and security needs as well as large rewards. So, early participants are joining a system that balances development potential with strong risk management. This gives them an obvious edge over people who just keep crypto. Conclusion Investors who get in during Phase 6 are putting themselves in a position to make money like ETH did. The lack of tokens, along with early staking payouts and buyback programs, ensures that the price trend is maintained from many directions. The price will soon go up to $0.040, and 38% of the current phase has already been sold. This opportunity is closing fast. People who wait will miss the chance to own MUTM at a lower price, while people who act quickly will get positions in a protocol where smart money is making 500% gains by moving profits around. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is for investors who want to combine safety, yield, and the chance to grow. Institutional ETH accumulation gets a lot of attention, but MUTM gives regular investors the ability to get involved in a fast-moving ecosystem with predictable payouts and significant upward momentum. Now is the time to get in, join early staking programs, and get in line with the next wave of attractive crypto investments before listing increases yields.

Binance, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, is set to launch the highly anticipated AVNT/USDT margin trading pair. This significant announcement means traders can now access cross and isolated margin trading for AVNT/USDT starting today, 5:00 a.m. UTC. This new listing opens up exciting avenues for amplifying potential gains and diversifying trading strategies within the dynamic crypto market. What Does AVNT/USDT Margin Trading Mean for You? For those new to the concept, margin trading allows you to trade with borrowed funds, effectively increasing your exposure to a particular asset. When Binance lists the AVNT/USDT margin trading pair, it means you can now borrow either AVNT or USDT to open larger positions than your initial capital would normally permit. This approach can lead to significantly higher profits if the market moves in your favor. Cross Margin: Your entire margin account balance is used as collateral, shared across all your open positions. This offers greater flexibility but also higher risk if one position goes south. Isolated Margin: A specific amount of capital is allocated as collateral for a single position. If the market moves against you, only that isolated margin is at risk of liquidation, protecting the rest of your funds. Understanding these two types is crucial before diving into AVNT/USDT margin trading , as they dictate your risk exposure and strategy. Why is This AVNT/USDT Listing a Game-Changer? The addition of the AVNT/USDT margin trading pair on Binance is more than just another listing; it’s a strategic move that enhances market liquidity and offers advanced trading tools. Increased liquidity for AVNT/USDT means smoother transactions and potentially tighter spreads, benefiting all traders. Moreover, margin trading allows traders to capitalize on both rising and falling markets. You can go ‘long’ if you expect AVNT’s price to increase, or ‘short’ if you anticipate a decrease. This flexibility provides sophisticated strategies for experienced traders looking to maximize their returns in various market conditions. It also signifies growing interest and confidence in the AVNT token within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Navigating the Risks of AVNT/USDT Margin Trading While the allure of amplified profits is strong, it’s vital to acknowledge the inherent risks associated with AVNT/USDT margin trading . Trading with borrowed funds can magnify losses just as easily as it can amplify gains. A sudden market downturn or high volatility could lead to rapid liquidation of your position, meaning you lose your collateral. Therefore, prudent risk management is paramount. Consider these points: Start Small: Begin with a small portion of your portfolio to understand the mechanics and market behavior. Set Stop-Loss Orders: These automatically close your position if the price hits a predetermined level, limiting potential losses. Monitor Constantly: The crypto market is fast-paced. Stay updated on market news and AVNT-specific developments. Educate Yourself: Fully grasp how margin calls and liquidation work before committing significant capital. Approaching AVNT/USDT margin trading with caution and a well-defined strategy is the key to sustainable success. Getting Started with AVNT/USDT Margin Trading on Binance Ready to explore the opportunities with the AVNT/USDT margin trading pair? Here’s a quick guide to help you begin: Fund Your Account: Ensure you have sufficient USDT or AVNT in your Binance spot wallet. Transfer to Margin Wallet: Move funds from your spot wallet to your cross or isolated margin wallet. Borrow Funds: Based on your collateral, you can borrow additional funds for trading. Place Your Order: Select the AVNT/USDT pair, choose your margin type (cross or isolated), and place your buy (long) or sell (short) order. Always remember that thorough research and a clear understanding of market dynamics are your best allies. Binance provides various educational resources to help users navigate these advanced trading options safely. Conclusion The listing of the AVNT/USDT margin trading pair on Binance marks a significant development for the AVNT community and the broader crypto market. It introduces enhanced liquidity and advanced trading opportunities for those looking to leverage their positions. While the potential for amplified returns is appealing, it’s crucial to approach margin trading with a clear understanding of its risks and implement robust risk management strategies. By doing so, traders can potentially capitalize on this new offering and navigate the exciting world of cryptocurrency with greater confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

Currently, the spotlight is firmly on Asia FX , where currencies are exhibiting a muted response, heavily influenced by a confluence of factors that signal potential shifts across the entire financial landscape. From the bustling trading floors of Tokyo to the economic powerhouses of Beijing, a quiet tension is building, driven by underwhelming data from the Chinese economy and the looming shadow of a critical Federal Reserve meeting. This complex interplay of regional challenges and global policy anticipation is creating a fascinating, albeit cautious, environment for investors worldwide. Asia FX: Decoding the Muted Response – What’s Happening? The Asian foreign exchange markets are currently characterized by a distinct lack of significant movement, a phenomenon often described as ‘muted.’ This isn’t necessarily a sign of stability, but rather a reflection of underlying caution and uncertainty that permeates investor sentiment. Participants are treading carefully, digesting a mix of regional economic signals and bracing for global policy shifts that could dramatically alter market dynamics. The performance of Asia FX is intrinsically linked to the economic health of its largest player, China. When the engine of the Chinese economy sputters, the reverberations are felt across the continent, impacting trade flows, investment, and ultimately, currency valuations. Several key factors contribute to this subdued activity: Interdependence with China: Many Asian economies are heavily reliant on trade with China. Weak demand from China directly translates to lower export revenues and slower economic growth for its neighbors, putting downward pressure on their currencies. Risk Aversion: Global uncertainties, including geopolitical tensions and inflation concerns, often lead investors to seek safer assets, drawing capital away from emerging Asian markets and their currencies. Central Bank Policies: While some Asian central banks have tightened monetary policy, their actions are often constrained by the need to support economic growth, especially when facing external headwinds. This can limit their ability to strengthen their respective currencies significantly. Dollar Dominance: The sustained strength of the US Dollar, driven by higher interest rates and its safe-haven appeal, makes it challenging for Asian currencies to gain significant ground. Currencies like the Japanese Yen, South Korean Won, and the Malaysian Ringgit have all experienced periods of weakness or limited upside, struggling against the backdrop of a stronger dollar and regional economic concerns. The muted response in Asia FX thus hides significant underlying pressures and a delicate balance of forces at play. What’s Driving the Weakness in the Chinese Economy? Recent economic indicators from China have painted a less-than-rosy picture, sending ripples of concern through global markets and significantly influencing Asia FX . Data points across several key sectors reveal a slowdown that is more pronounced than many analysts had anticipated. This weakness in the Chinese economy is not a singular event but a complex interplay of internal structural issues and external pressures. Key areas of concern include: Property Market Crisis: The prolonged downturn in China’s vast property sector remains a major drag. Defaults by major developers, unfinished projects, and falling housing prices have eroded consumer confidence and posed systemic risks to the financial system. Weak Consumer Spending: Despite initial hopes for a post-pandemic rebound, consumer spending has remained subdued. Factors such as high youth unemployment, property market uncertainties, and a cautious outlook on future income have led households to save rather than spend. Retail sales growth has often fallen short of expectations. Deflationary Pressures: China has been battling persistent deflation, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) sometimes dipping into negative territory. While this might sound good for consumers, sustained deflation can signal weak demand, discourage investment, and make debt burdens heavier. Industrial Output and Exports: Industrial production has shown signs of softening, reflecting weaker domestic and international demand. Export figures, once a cornerstone of China’s growth, have also faced headwinds due to slowing global trade and geopolitical tensions. Local Government Debt: Many local governments are burdened with substantial debt, limiting their capacity for infrastructure spending and economic stimulus, which historically played a crucial role in driving growth. The challenges facing the Chinese economy are multifaceted, requiring careful navigation by policymakers. The spillover effects of this slowdown are profound, impacting commodity prices, global supply chains, and investment flows into Asia, directly contributing to the cautious sentiment in Asia FX markets. Is US Dollar Strength Sustainable? A Look at its Safe Haven Appeal While Asian currencies grapple with local and regional headwinds, the US Dollar Strength continues to be a dominant narrative in the global currency arena. The dollar has remained remarkably steady, often gaining ground against major peers, as investors flock to its perceived safety. This steadfast performance isn’t accidental; it’s a testament to several underlying factors that position the U.S. economy and its currency as a preferred destination during times of global uncertainty. Reasons underpinning the dollar’s resilience: Interest Rate Differential: The Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary tightening cycle in response to inflation has resulted in significantly higher interest rates compared to many other developed economies. This yield advantage makes dollar-denominated assets more attractive to international investors. Relative Economic Resilience: Despite global slowdown concerns, the U.S. economy has shown a degree of resilience, particularly in its labor market. This relative strength compared to other major economies enhances the dollar’s appeal. Safe-Haven Status: In periods of geopolitical instability, economic uncertainty, or financial market stress, the U.S. dollar traditionally serves as the ultimate safe-haven currency. Its deep and liquid financial markets, coupled with the perceived stability of the U.S. government, make it a preferred store of value. Global Reserve Currency Role: The dollar’s status as the world’s primary reserve currency means it is widely used in international trade, finance, and central bank reserves, creating constant demand. The sustained US Dollar Strength has significant implications. For emerging markets, it can make dollar-denominated debt more expensive to service and can draw capital away from their economies. For global trade, a strong dollar makes U.S. exports more expensive but reduces the cost of imports for U.S. consumers and businesses. Understanding this dynamic is crucial for anyone monitoring Global Macro Trends . How Will the Fed Meeting Impact Global Markets and Your Portfolio? All eyes are now fixed on the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting. The decisions made by the U.S. central bank have a profound and immediate Fed Meeting Impact that extends far beyond American borders, influencing everything from bond yields to global equity markets and, crucially, currency valuations. The market is keenly awaiting signals regarding future interest rate policy, specifically whether the Fed will maintain its hawkish stance, signal a pivot towards easing, or adopt a wait-and-see approach. Potential scenarios and their broad implications: Scenario Potential Fed Action Market Impact Hawkish Stance (Rate Hike/Strong Signal) Another rate hike or strong rhetoric indicating future hikes. Further US Dollar Strength , potentially higher bond yields, pressure on equities, capital outflow from emerging markets and Asia FX . Dovish Pivot (Rate Cut/Easing Signal) A rate cut or clear signal of impending cuts. Potential dollar weakening, bond yields may fall, boost for equities and risk assets (including cryptocurrencies), potential capital inflow to emerging markets and Asia FX . Hold and Wait (Status Quo) Rates remain unchanged, but future guidance is ambiguous or data-dependent. Market volatility, continued focus on economic data, investors seeking clarity, moderate impact on US Dollar Strength , and continued cautiousness in Asia FX . The precise Fed Meeting Impact hinges on the nuances of the statement and the subsequent press conference. Investors will scrutinize every word for clues about the trajectory of monetary policy, which will, in turn, influence global liquidity and risk appetite, directly affecting the performance of currencies and other asset classes, including digital ones. Navigating Global Macro Trends: Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor The current environment is a complex tapestry of interconnected Global Macro Trends . From geopolitical shifts to evolving monetary policies and the economic performance of major powers, understanding these dynamics is essential for informed decision-making. Investors, particularly those in the crypto space, must recognize how these traditional market forces can directly or indirectly influence digital asset valuations and liquidity. Here are some actionable insights for navigating these turbulent waters: Diversification is Key: Do not put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify across different asset classes, geographies, and even within the crypto market itself to mitigate risks associated with specific regional downturns or currency fluctuations. Monitor Economic Indicators Closely: Keep a keen eye on key economic data points, especially from major economies like China and the U.S. (e.g., inflation rates, GDP growth, employment figures, retail sales). These provide early signals of shifts in Global Macro Trends . Understand Central Bank Communication: Pay close attention to statements and speeches from central bank officials, particularly the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the People’s Bank of China. Their forward guidance is a powerful tool in shaping market expectations. Consider Hedging Strategies: For those with significant exposure to specific currencies or regions, exploring hedging strategies (e.g., currency forwards, options) can help protect against adverse movements. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility can be unsettling, maintaining a long-term investment perspective often helps weather temporary storms. Focus on fundamental value rather than reacting impulsively to daily market noise. Assess Risk Appetite: Regularly reassess your personal risk tolerance. In an environment of heightened uncertainty, it may be prudent to adjust portfolio allocations to align with a more conservative stance if necessary.

Traders welcomed the move as proof of resilience in a shaky market. Yet behind the celebrations, analysts are questioning XRP’s long-term growth potential. That has led many investors to look elsewhere for bigger upside, with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi project, emerging as a contender for 2025’s breakout token. Ripple (XRP) September breakout XRP jumped 4.15% to $3.02, shattering the psychological resistance level that had restrained its performance this year. Optimism around a potential Fed rate cut and news of an expanded custody partnership with Spain’s BBVA provided the momentum. For market participants, XRP’s break above $3 served as vindication following an extended consolidation phase. Still, many analysts caution against overstating the move. XRP carries a massive market capitalization, meaning that while it can deliver steady gains, the explosive returns of its early surges are far less likely to repeat. This is why some investors are gradually shifting their focus toward lower-cost utility tokens with greater room to scale. Adding to the cautious outlook, on-chain metrics reveal potential pressure points. Exchange reserves are swelling, signaling that more XRP is being parked on trading platforms, which could translate into selling pressure. Meanwhile, Total Value Locked (TVL) on the XRP Ledger is declining, a worrying sign for DeFi traction. Even Google search interest has dropped, suggesting retail enthusiasm is fading just as the token pushes past resistance. The takeaway? XRP’s September rally is impressive, but questions remain about its ability to sustain momentum in the long run. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) While XRP wrestles with growth limitations, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting investors with its early-stage entry. The token launched its presale at just $0.01 and has since surged to $0.035, a 350% gain. With the confirmed official launch price of $0.06, buyers at today’s level are still looking at nearly 2x upside before open-market trading begins. Momentum has been clear: the project has already raised more than $15.65 million and welcomed over 16,250 holders into its community. Each presale stage increases the price, and the next phase is set to climb to $0.04, almost a 20% jump from current levels. For investors, this creates urgency: secure a position now, or pay a higher entry cost in the next round. Analysts call MUTM the best cryptocurrency to invest in now What’s separating Mutuum Finance from other presale tokens is its utility-first model. Instead of leaning on meme-driven cycles, MUTM is structured as a lending and borrowing protocol. The platform supports both peer-to-contract (P2C) lending, where users deposit assets like ETH, BNB, or MATIC into liquidity pools and receive mtTokens in return, and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, where agreements can be struck directly between participants with flexible terms. Borrowers can choose variable or stable rates, balancing predictability with cost-efficiency. The roadmap also sets Mutuum Finance apart. The beta platform will debut with the token listing, enabling users to access borrowing, lending, and staking immediately. Long-term, the protocol plans to integrate Layer-2 scaling to lower fees and improve transaction speeds, and deploy a robust oracle system using Chainlink feeds with fallback options to protect against outages or manipulation. Security is another cornerstone. Mutuum Finance has already completed a CertiK audit with a 95/100 Token score, launched a $50,000 bug bounty program, and announced a $100,000 community giveaway to build trust and broaden adoption. Together, these factors create both near-term catalysts and long-term sustainability, two ingredients analysts say are often missing in new projects. XRP’s rally above $3 this September underscores its resilience, but also exposes its limitations. Swelling exchange reserves, declining TVL, and fading retail enthusiasm highlight the challenges of driving exponential growth in such a high-cap asset. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still at the beginning of its journey, but momentum is already building fast. Presale gains have climbed past 350%, and the roadmap lays out clear milestones like a live beta platform, stablecoin integration, and L2 scaling. Together, these steps position MUTM to grow into a serious force within DeFi lending.

The offering may be structured across multiple maturities and currencies, adding to the company’s $17.75 billion in outstanding notes. Its sale also coincides with a record-setting year for dim sum bonds, with Chinese issuers securing $46.2 billion year-to-date on the back of favorable financing conditions and robust investor interest. So far, Tencent has tapped JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Securities, and Morgan Stanley to arrange the program. Tencent has upcoming obligations, including a $500 million maturing in April 2026 Tencent deal’s timing will hinge on market conditions, internal capital requirements, and investor appetite, in compliance with the applicable regulation s. The company has yet to reveal how much it intends to raise, but the move seems driven by both necessity and market opportunity. With the September issuance window wide open, many issuers are hurrying to lock in financing before conditions potentially turn less favorable. Tencent already faces a squeezing debt schedule, with a $500 million note maturing in April 2026 and another $1 billion bond due in January 2026. Although the company had long floated the prospect of dollar- and yuan-denominated issuance, the deal only came to market this year. However, with rates in Asia’s currency markets that are friendly to the company, this window may enable Tencent to deal with its upcoming debt maturities effectively. On the earnings side, the company reported strong June-quarter results with sales rising 15% to $25.7 billion, about 3% ahead of its guidance. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , the company posted a 17% rise in net income, driven largely by the firm’s stronger margins across advertising and gaming segments. Among the contributors cited by the company for its results were AI-powered advertisements and the growth of gaming and social media efforts. Besides, Tencent is ramping up its investments in artificial intelligence R&D. The company has even added Yao Shunyu, an artificial intelligence expert who formerly worked at OpenAI, to its team. According to people familiar with the matter, Yao will work from Tencent’s main offices in Shenzhen, helping integrate AI across its products. Tencent has been a leader in pushing forward AI research. It chose to weave AI software into all its offerings rather than introducing new AI platforms. DeepSeek’s R1 fuels its gaming and social media applications, together with its proprietary Hunyuan model. The company’s cloud platform offers computing capacity to customers building AI systems. Rivals, including Alibaba and ByteDance, have also introduced their models in the process of an AI arms race. Alibaba Group Holdings revealed its $3.2 billion pricing of its note offering Alibaba Group Holdings also disclosed the $3.2 billion pricing of its convertible note sale, making it the biggest offering so far in 2025. The offering is scheduled to close on September 16, 2025, pending standard closing conditions. The company estimates earning about $3.13 billion from the net offering. Toughly 80% of which will be used to strengthen its cloud infrastructure, including scaling data centers, upgrading systems, and enhancing service quality. Around 20% of the balance will be invested in international commerce operations, emphasizing operational improvements to boost the global market presence. Upon issuance, the notes will be senior unsecured obligations of Alibaba and will mature on September 15, 2032, unless they are redeemed or repurchased, or converted before that time. These investors cannot convert the notes during the 40 days following issuance, referred to as a “distribution compliance period.” After that, and until the business day before March 15, 2032, holders may convert their notes in $1,000 increments as long as certain conditions are met. In other words, if Alibaba decides to settle conversions, it can pay in cash, ADSs, or a combination of both, providing the company with flexibility to address dilution. Investors who wish to receive ordinary shares instead of ADSs will be required to complete a separate process outside the DTC system and follow applicable deadlines.

Recently, a mysterious Ethereum whale made headlines by acquiring a substantial amount of ETH, stirring curiosity and speculation across the market. This latest move highlights the continuous, dynamic nature of digital asset investments and the powerful influence of major players. Unveiling the Ethereum Whale’s Latest Moves In a fascinating turn of events, an anonymous address recently received a staggering 13,322 ETH, valued at approximately $61.92 million, directly from the institutional trading platform FalconX. This transaction, reported by Onchainlens, occurred just an hour ago, catching the attention of on-chain analysts and investors alike. This isn’t an isolated incident. The same address has been actively accumulating Ethereum, bringing its total haul to an impressive 22,556 ETH, worth around $104.87 million, all sourced through FalconX within the last four days. Such rapid and large-scale accumulation by an Ethereum whale often signals a strategic long-term outlook or a calculated market play. What exactly defines an Ethereum whale ? Significant Holdings: An individual or entity holding a substantial amount of ETH. Market Influence: Their buying or selling actions can significantly impact market sentiment and price. Anonymity: Often, these large holders remain anonymous, known only by their wallet addresses. Why Does an Ethereum Whale’s Activity Matter? The movements of an Ethereum whale are closely watched for several crucial reasons. When a whale makes such a substantial purchase, it can send ripples throughout the market, affecting both investor psychology and the actual supply-demand dynamics of ETH. Consider the potential implications: Bullish Signal: Large-scale accumulation can be interpreted as a strong vote of confidence in Ethereum’s future, potentially encouraging other investors to buy. Supply Shock: Removing a significant amount of ETH from the circulating supply can create scarcity, which, if demand remains constant or increases, could lead to price appreciation. Market Stability: Consistent accumulation by large holders might also indicate a belief in Ethereum’s long-term stability and growth trajectory. Conversely, a sudden sell-off by a whale could trigger panic and significant price drops. Therefore, understanding these patterns is a vital part of cryptocurrency market analysis. Tracking the Mysterious Ethereum Whale: What Can We Learn? While the identity of this particular Ethereum whale remains unknown, the transparent nature of blockchain technology allows anyone to observe their transactions. On-chain data platforms like Onchainlens provide invaluable insights into these movements, offering a window into the strategies of major market participants. Observing whale activity can provide: Trend Indicators: Early signs of potential market shifts or emerging trends. Liquidity Insights: An understanding of where large amounts of capital are moving. Behavioral Patterns: Clues about institutional or sophisticated investor strategies. However, it’s crucial to remember that while on-chain data is transparent, the intentions behind these large transactions are not always clear. An accumulation could be for various reasons, from long-term holding to preparing for a major staking event or even an OTC (over-the-counter) deal. Navigating the Waters: Actionable Insights for Investors For individual investors, the actions of an Ethereum whale can be both fascinating and a source of guidance. However, it’s important not to blindly follow these large movements without conducting your own thorough research. Here are some actionable insights: Diversify Your Portfolio: Never put all your eggs in one basket, regardless of whale activity. Conduct Due Diligence: Always research Ethereum’s fundamentals, technological advancements, and ecosystem growth. Use Whale Data as One Metric: Incorporate whale tracking into a broader analysis strategy, alongside technical and fundamental analysis. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Crypto markets are volatile; invest only what you can afford to lose. The significant accumulation by this anonymous Ethereum whale serves as a potent reminder of the dynamic forces at play in the crypto market. While such large transactions can spark excitement and speculation, they also underscore the importance of informed decision-making and a balanced approach to investing. This latest move from a significant Ethereum whale is certainly one to watch. Whether it signals an imminent market shift or simply a strategic long-term play, it undeniably adds another layer of intrigue to the ever-evolving narrative of the cryptocurrency space. Keeping an eye on these powerful players, while maintaining a clear investment strategy, remains key for navigating the digital asset landscape successfully. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an Ethereum whale? An Ethereum whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Ethereum (ETH). Their holdings are significant enough that their buying or selling activities can notably influence the market price and sentiment of ETH. Why do Ethereum whale movements matter to the market? Whale movements matter because their large transactions can signal potential market trends. Significant buying (accumulation) can indicate bullish sentiment and potentially lead to price increases due to reduced supply, while large selling can signal bearish sentiment and potential price drops. How can I track Ethereum whale activity? You can track Ethereum whale activity using on-chain analytics platforms like Onchainlens, Etherscan, or Whale Alert. These tools monitor large transactions on the Ethereum blockchain and often report them, though the identities of the whales typically remain anonymous. Should I invest based solely on an Ethereum whale’s actions? No, it is not advisable to invest solely based on an Ethereum whale’s actions. While whale movements can provide interesting insights, they should be just one factor in a comprehensive investment strategy. Always conduct your own research, understand market fundamentals, and consider your personal risk tolerance. What is FalconX? FalconX is a cryptocurrency prime brokerage platform that provides institutional investors with a suite of services, including trading, credit, and clearing. It facilitates large-volume transactions for institutions, making it a common platform for significant crypto movements like those seen from this Ethereum whale.

In early 2025, that spotlight is shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . With a presale already delivering 350% gains for its earliest backers, whales contributing six-figure allocations, and momentum building with every stage, MUTM is quietly breaking records, and analysts believe it could be one of the most important DeFi launches of the year. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance’s presale metrics have already set it apart from the crowd. To date, the project has raised more than $15.65 million and attracted 16,250 holders, a milestone rarely seen this early in a token’s lifecycle. The presale is currently in Stage 6, priced at $0.035, and is selling out quickly. Once this stage closes, the price will climb to $0.04, a nearly 20% increase — before the token officially launches at $0.06. For investors entering today, that means locking in early exposure before broader market adoption. Early participants at $0.01 have already seen 350% gains, while even today’s buyers can expect close to 100% upside at launch. To put the numbers into perspective, a $900 investment in MUTM at the current phase stage would be worth $1,550 at the confirmed launch price of $0.06. When MUTM reaches $0.30 post-launch, the stake could surge to $7,750, and at a long-term target of $1.25, that same $900 could be worth over $32,000. Why records matter, the XRP comparison Breaking presale records is more than just a headline; it can be an indicator of what comes next. To see why, look back at XRP’s early growth. Ripple (XRP) started as a relatively obscure project before quickly amassing significant investor interest. That momentum propelled XRP into the top tier of cryptocurrencies, where it remains today. Like XRP in its early days, Mutuum Finance is demonstrating its ability to attract both retail buyers and whales before listing. The presale isn’t just raising funds; it’s building a base of engaged holders who will carry momentum into launch. Analysts argue that this kind of foundation is often the difference between a token that fizzles out and one that becomes a long-term success story. If history is any guide, record-breaking presales can foreshadow explosive adoption once the token is live. Dual lending, borrow rates, and mtTokens Mutuum Finance’s appeal isn’t just about presale numbers; it’s about utility. At its core, the project is a lending and borrowing protocol built to connect lenders and borrowers through two models: In peer-to-contract (P2C) lending, users supply assets such as ETH, BNB, or MATIC into liquidity pools managed by smart contracts. Borrowers can instantly access these funds, while lenders receive mtTokens that represent their deposits and accrue rewards. Interest rates adjust automatically depending on liquidity, creating a balance between supply and demand. In peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, users negotiate directly, making this model ideal for assets that don’t fit neatly into broad pools. Meme coins like DOGE or PEPE, for example, can be loaned or borrowed under custom agreements. The terms are flexible, but smart contracts enforce them transparently, reducing counterparty risk. Mutuum Finance also offers both variable and stable borrowing rates. Variable rates rise or fall with liquidity, while stable rates give borrowers predictable repayment terms even in volatile markets. Combined with the redistribution model — where protocol fees buy MUTM tokens on the open market and redistribute them to mtToken stakers — this system ties token demand directly to platform usage. It’s a structure designed to ensure long-term sustainability, not just presale excitement. Why analysts say MUTM is built to last The presale records are impressive, but analysts say the roadmap is what could make Mutuum Finance truly game-changing. The first major milestone is the beta platform launch, which is scheduled to go live on the same day MUTM lists. That means from day one, users will be able to borrow, lend, and stake — a stark contrast to presale projects that launch without utility. A working platform at listing not only builds immediate trust with investors but also increases the likelihood of top-tier exchange listings. Looking further ahead, the roadmap includes Layer-2 (L2) integration, which will help Mutuum Finance scale as adoption grows. By offloading transactions from congested Layer-1 chains, the protocol can keep fees low and transaction speeds high, even during periods of heavy market activity. This scalability is key to ensuring that Mutuum can support both retail participants and institutional flows without bottlenecks. Taken together, the beta platform and L2 integration are more than just features — they’re proof that MUTM’s growth targets are grounded in planned catalysts, not guesswork. Mutuum Finance is proving it can raise millions, onboard tens of thousands of holders, and deliver triple-digit gains before even hitting exchanges. But what makes it stand out is the combination of record-breaking presale numbers with real fundamentals and a roadmap designed for adoption. With $15.65M raised, whales going all in, a 90/100 CertiK audit, and catalysts like the beta platform launch and L2 scalability, MUTM is positioned for both short-term momentum and long-term impact. Add in future plans such as an over-collateralized stablecoin, and the message becomes clear: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a DeFi protocol structured to last.

It’s not Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana—but rather Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi project priced at just $0.035 that has already soared 350% since its earliest phase. With whale activity, a strong roadmap, and top-tier security measures, many are now comparing MUTM to the early days of some of crypto’s biggest success stories. Analysts’ track record When analysts highlight a new project, it pays to listen. In the past, experts who followed the right signals correctly identified early winners like Solana and Aave. Solana started trading under $5 before exploding past $200 in its peak cycle. At the time, analysts focused on its fast transaction speeds and growing ecosystem as proof that it wasn’t just another blockchain; it was a legitimate competitor to Ethereum. Their calls proved accurate, delivering some of the most dramatic returns in crypto history. Similarly, Aave began as a relatively unknown lending platform but gained traction as analysts pointed to its utility-driven model. It later became one of the leading DeFi protocols, with its token price multiplying rapidly as adoption grew. In both cases, analysts spotted the key indicators: low entry price, strong utility, and a roadmap that was delivered. These same signals are now being connected to Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) After launching at just $0.01, Mutuum Finance’s presale price has already risen to $0.035. That marks a 350% surge for early backers and demonstrates the project’s ability to attract sustained interest. The presale is structured to reward those who enter early. Each new stage lifts the price, with the next phase set at $0.04, almost a 20% increase from where it stands today. The token will officially launch at $0.06, offering today’s buyers significant upside before the market even opens. This steady progression is why analysts say MUTM isn’t just enjoying a one-off spike, but rather building momentum that could carry into its post-launch trading. At its core, Mutuum Finance connects lenders and borrowers through peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending models. In P2C, assets like XRP, USDC, and MATIC are supplied into smart contract pools where borrowers can access liquidity instantly, while lenders earn returns through mtTokens. In P2P, borrowers and lenders negotiate directly, making it possible to use riskier assets such as DOGE or PEPE with customized loan terms. What makes MUTM different Backing these dual lending models is a carefully designed buy-and-redistribute system, one of the protocol’s strongest long-term catalysts. A fraction of every fee generated within Mutuum Finance, whether from lending, borrowing, or repayments, is used to purchase MUTM tokens directly from the open market. These tokens are then redistributed to users who stake their mtTokens, which are received when they deposit assets into the protocol. This mechanism creates a self-sustaining cycle of demand: platform activity funds token buybacks, buybacks fuel staking rewards, and staking encourages users to remain engaged. Over time, this positive feedback loop provides continuous organic buy pressure, something that meme-driven tokens simply cannot replicate since their value often depends solely on social sentiment rather than structural mechanics. Perhaps even more importantly, Mutuum Finance has confirmed that its beta platform will go live on the same day as the token listing, giving it an immediate edge in adoption. Instead of entering the market as a token without real functionality, a common occurrence in the presale space, MUTM will debut with a live platform where users can borrow, lend, and stake from day one. This means the utility that underpins the token will be visible and usable right at launch, which analysts believe is a major catalyst for attracting both retail users and institutional participants. Having a working product also increases the likelihood of early Tier-1 exchange listings, since exchanges tend to prioritize tokens that demonstrate functionality and active ecosystems. For investors, this alignment between launch and utility signals that MUTM is positioned not as a short-term hype-driven play, but as a protocol engineered for fast-tracked adoption. Short-term vs long-term targets With its fundamentals, presale momentum, and whale backing, analysts are setting bold predictions for MUTM’s future. In the short term, once the token lists at $0.06 and the beta platform is live, expectations point to a 300–400% increase from the launch price, driven by exchange listings and immediate utility. Looking into 2025 and beyond, projections become even stronger. Analysts who once identified Solana and Aave early are now suggesting that MUTM could deliver 50x returns over the long term. That would imply a price north of $1.50, turning today’s presale entries into potentially life-changing gains. These targets aren’t based on guesswork but on MUTM’s roadmap. With stablecoin integration, Layer-2 compatibility, and a clear focus on scalability, the protocol is structured for steady growth rather than hype-driven spikes. Analysts have been right before. They spotted Solana when it was trading under $5 and Aave when it was a niche lending platform. Both went on to become giants. Now, those same signals—low cost, utility-driven design, whale confidence, and a strong roadmap—are being tied to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With a presale surge of 350%, over $15.65 million raised, and a beta platform launching at listing, MUTM is already showing signs of strength that many presale projects lack. Add in its CertiK audit score of 90/100 and its ambitious roadmap, and analysts argue it may indeed be the next crypto to explode.

When It Starts, It Will Be Fast and Violent",https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-bull-market-hasnt-started-yet-when-it-starts-it-will-be-fast-and-violent/,"Crypto enthusiast CryptoBull shared a strong view on the current state of XRP, stating that the digital asset’s bull market has not yet begun. In his post, he wrote that the start of the bull run is imminent and emphasized that when it happens, it will be fast and violent. His outlook suggests that the current price action is still in a preparatory stage for a significant move upward. Chart Analysis The chart attached to his post highlights XRP/USD on the one-week timeframe. The chart shows XRP’s historical price behavior divided into bull and bear zones, with the asset currently positioned at the edge of the bear territory and nearing a transition into the bull region. The setup mirrors a past movement where XRP broke out from a bear phase into a strong upward rally. The diagram points to the potential for a similar shift in the near term, indicating that XRP is close to completing the bear cycle and entering the bull phase once again. #XRP Bull market hasn’t even started yet. It will soon. It will be fast and violent pic.twitter.com/zCmgzwv2ZJ — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) September 13, 2025 Community Responses Several community members shared their views in response to CryptoBull’s statement. A user with the name TulipDreamer commented that perhaps the bull market has already arrived, adding that when news of an official interest rate cut is confirmed, the cryptocurrency market could grow rapidly. This comment connects macroeconomic factors , particularly monetary policy decisions, with the possible momentum behind cryptocurrency price action. Another user, identified as TUBombAk47YU, contributed additional information by sharing his perspective on CryptoBull’s price targets. He stated that CryptoBull’s targets remain the same, and while they were not mentioned in the original post, he shared them directly. This user also attached a detailed chart that illustrated a long-term view of XRP. Additional Chart Insights The chart shared by TUBombAk47YU shows XRP breaking out of an eight-year trend, completing what is described as the “cup top level.” The chart also references an earlier breakout from a four-year trend in XRP’s past. It highlights the significance of the current phase, noting that the green circle represents a period of nine months in which XRP has broken the eight-year trend, retested, and is continuing forward. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Projections on the chart display Fibonacci extension levels, with targets at approximately $5.86, $18.22, and $36.76. These levels suggest the possibility of major long-term price appreciation if the breakout structure continues as anticipated. CryptoBull’s post and the supporting chart from another community member emphasize the view that XRP is on the verge of entering a new bull market phase. The analysis ties together past breakout structures, macroeconomic conditions, and technical indicators to present a case for accelerated growth. While CryptoBull did not provide explicit price targets, the shared community chart filled in those details, pointing toward a broad range of potential price levels. Overall, the message delivered is that XRP’s most significant upward movement may still lie ahead, with its official bull market phase yet to begin.

However, the pace of the next upward move in these cryptocurrencies will largely hinge on the magnitude of the anticipated Fed rate cut scheduled for Sept. 17. BTC's seven-day call/put skew, which measures how implied volatility is distributed across calls versus puts expiring in a week, has recovered to nearly zero from the bearish 4% a week ago, according to data source Amberdata. The 30- and 60-day option skews, though still slightly negative, have rebounded from last week’s lows, signaling a notable easing of downside fears. Ether’s options skew is exhibiting a similar pattern at the time of writing. The skew shows the market's directional bias, or the extent to which traders are more concerned about prices rising or falling. A positive skew suggests a bias towards calls or bullish option plays, while a negative reading indicates relatively higher demand for put options or downside protection. The reset in options comes as bitcoin and ether prices see a renewed upswing in the lead-up to Wednesday's Fed rate decision, where the central bank is widely expected to cut rates and lay the groundwork for additional easing over the coming months. BTC has gained over 4% to over $116,000 in seven days, with ether rising nearly 8% to $4,650, according to CoinDesk data. What happens next largely depends on the size of the impending Fed rate cut. According to CME's Fed funds futures, traders have priced in over 90% probability that the central bank will cut rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 4%-4.25%. But there is also a slight possibility of a jumbo 50 bps move. BTC could go berserk in case the Fed delivers the surprise 50 bps move. ""A surprise 50 bps rate cut would be a massive +gamma BUY signal for ETH, SOL and BTC,"" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said in an email. ""Gold will go absolutely nuts as well."" Note that the Deribit-listed SOL options already exhibit a strong bullish sentiment, with calls trading at 4-5 volatility premium to puts. Magadini explained that if the decision comes in line with expectations for a 25 bps cut, then a continued calm ""grind higher"" for BTC looks likely. ETH, meanwhile, may take another week or so to retest all-time highs and convincingly trade above $5,000, he added.",Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|Solana|Options|Markets|market analysis|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|BTC|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-15 05:29:55

While the decision is a big step for Hyperliquid, it also drew some criticism from the crypto community. Some people in the industry called the process unfair and suggested it favored Native Markets from the start. At the same time, Yala’s Bitcoin-backed stablecoin YU came under pressure after an attempted exploit led to a sharp depeg, dropping as low as $0.2046 before partially recovering. Despite assurances that all funds are still safe, YU still trades below its intended $1 peg at about $0.8667. Native Markets Wins USDH Stablecoin Bid Native Markets officially secured the USDH ticker for Hyperliquid’s upcoming dollar-pegged stablecoin. The decision followed a community vote, where Native Markets emerged as the clear frontrunner after prediction market odds spiked to nearly 100% on Polymarket when Ethena, another major contender, withdrew from the race late last week. The result sets the stage for Hyperliquid’s first-ever Improvement Proposal (HIP), through which Native Markets will soon launch USDH alongside an ERC-20 token on Ethereum. According to Native Markets founder Max Fiege , the rollout will begin with a testing phase, where minting and redeeming transactions of up to $800 will be allowed for an initial group of users. After this limited trial, the USDH/USDC spot order book will open, followed by the full launch of uncapped mints and redeems. The main goal of the carefully staged rollout is to ensure stability and security as the new stablecoin enters the market. On the other hand, the process that led to Native Markets’ victory caused a lot of debate in the crypto community. People in the industry criticized the selection process by suggesting it may have been less open than advertised. Dragonfly managing partner Haseeb Qureshi called the request-for-proposal process “a farce,” and claimed that validators showed little to no willingness to consider any bidders other than Native Markets. His comments fed into speculation that the outcome was actually predetermined, with even some framing it as evidence of behind-the-scenes dealmaking. Others used the controversy to shed some light on the broader trends in the stablecoin sector. Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Helius, said that the competition proved how commoditized stablecoins have become. He predicted that in the future, exchanges may streamline the user experience by removing stablecoin tickers altogether, simply displaying “USD” on the front end while managing the backend swaps between stablecoins themselves. Despite the heated competition and subsequent debate around USDH, the launch of the Hyperliquid’s stablecoin is a big step forward in its bid to establish a robust stablecoin presence in the market. Yala’s Bitcoin Stablecoin YU Struggles In other stablecoin news, Yala’s Bitcoin-backed stablecoin YU struggled to recover its dollar peg after an incident on Sunday that sent its value tumbling to $0.2046. The team described the event as an “attempted attack” and assured users that all funds remain safe, with Bitcoin reserves held either self-custodially or in vaults. Yala confirmed that no user assets were lost, though some product features have been paused as a precaution while the team investigates with security firm SlowMist and other partners. In the meantime, the Convert and Bridge functions of the protocol have been disabled to prevent even more instability, while other operations remain unaffected. Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported that an attacker minted 120 million YU on Polygon, bridged a portion to Ethereum and Solana, and sold 7.71 million YU for 7.7 million USDC. The attacker then converted the funds into 1,501 ETH and dispersed them across multiple wallets. There are still large amounts of YU on Polygon, Ethereum, and Solana, which raised concerns about potential further disruptions. YU is designed to maintain a $1 peg using overcollateralized Bitcoin reserves and grew to a $119 million market cap before the incident. However, its liquidity remains shallow, with only $340,000 in USDC available in its Ethereum pool. After crashing below $0.21, YU briefly rebounded as high as $0.917 but has since struggled to hold its value. At press time, the token was trading around $0.8667, still far from its intended peg. YU’s price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The turmoil came as the broader stablecoin market edged toward a historic $300 billion milestone. According to market data, Tether’s USDT, Circle’s USDC, and Ethena Labs’ yield-bearing USDe are still the main drivers of growth, and Yala’s setback proved the challenges newer entrants face when it comes to securing trust and liquidity.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|ETH|BTC|ENA,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-15 05:30:00
51749254,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=808603,1757914232,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51749254.jpeg,China’s economy lost momentum in August,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/chinas-economy-lost-momentum-in-august/,"China’s economy lost momentum for another month in a row, with fresh data showing a deeper-than-expected slowdown and a sharp pullback in investment. The figures raise the odds that Beijing will add support to keep growth on course for its target, increasing the chance authorities will deploy extra steps to steady activity. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said that industrial output, covering mines and factories, rose 5.2% in August compared with the previous year. That was weaker than July’s 5.7% increase and below the 5.6% median forecast in a Bloomberg survey. Furthermore, China’s consumer prices fell 0.4% in August, according to an earlier report by Cryptopolitan . The NBS said “the economy was generally stable” in August, but added that “there are still plenty of instabilities and uncertainties with the external environment, and the economy still faces many risks and challenges.” Household demand also softened. Retail sales grew 3.4% year over year in August, missing expectations for a 3.8% gain and easing from 3.7% in July. Fixed-asset spending for January to August expanded by just 0.5%. The surveyed urban jobless rate edged up to 5.3%. “This confirms a sharp slowdown in the second half of 2025, especially on the investment side,” said Carlos Casanova, senior Asia economist at Union Bancaire Privée in Hong Kong. Economists expect the economy to slow down for the remaining year With an earlier surge in exports fading, many analysts and investors now expect growth to downshift in the closing months of 2025 after the Chinese economy expanded 5.3% in the first half. The scale of any cooling in China, set to remain the biggest driver of global growth from 2025 – 2030, matters for a world economy already under strain from Trump’s tariffs. Even so, the upbeat results in the first six months have left Chinese leaders confident they can still achieve the official goal of “around 5%,” even if momentum weakens later this year. So far, officials haven’t shown any serious signs of preparing a large stimulus package as exports continue to hold up amid Trump’s 2nd trade war. Yet pressures are building, judging by a run of disappointing numbers in recent weeks. A broad measure of credit growth slowed in August for the first time this year. Exports also came in below forecasts, with growth slipping to 4.4% last month. Labor-market signals have softened, too, according to purchasing managers’ indexes and private surveys. Another challenge is the government’s “anti-involution” drive, meant to curb overcapacity and cut back excessive competition among firms. The push, which ramped up in early July, may have contributed to July’s output declines in products from steel to copper. While stock prices have climbed on hopes that the measures will boost profitability, they also risk damping hiring and household spending unless matched by stronger demand-side support. How the campaign plays out remains uncertain, making it difficult to tell when China might break entrenched deflationary pressures. Housing prices in China fell in August Housing adds to the strain. Official figures show new-house prices decreased 0.3% in August from July, the same monthly drop as in July, extending a weak streak that began in May 2023. Compared with a year earlier, prices fell 2.5% in August, moderating from a 2.8% decline in July. The property downturn began in 2021, and multiple rounds of relief, including mortgage-rate cuts and a program to renovate urban villages, have yet to deliver a lasting turn. The sustained weakness in demand means the housing market remains a drag on growth. Price declines were widespread. Of the 70 cities surveyed by the NBS, 57 reported decreases month-on-month, and 65 saw year-on-year declines. Prices for existing homes also weakened. Tier-one cities posted a 3.5% drop from a year earlier, prices in tier-two cities fell 5.2%, and tier-three cities were down 6.0%. Separate figures highlighted the industry’s slump. Property investment tumbled 12.9% year over year in the January–August period, while property sales by floor area fell 4.7%. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Many investors stayed on the sidelines at first because they were skeptical, but they later saw SOL become one of the best performers in the last cycle. If you look at crypto prices today, it looks like history is about to repeat itself with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi startup that is now worth only $0.035 in its presale. Presale momentum meets innovative lending design Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already demonstrating the same underdog spirit that Solana (SOL) used to have. The token is in Phase 6 of its presale and has raised $15.75 million. More than 16,300 people bought it early. Forty percent of the current supply has already been sold, and the CertiK audit is making people feel more secure about it quickly. Investors are starting to link its climb to Solana (SOL)’s early ascent because of this momentum. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model is the most important part of Mutuum’s design. It will put deposits of assets like USDT, USDC, ETH, and ADA into certified smart contracts. Lenders will always get a return on their investment, while borrowers will be able to access cash without having to sell their possessions. If you deposit $8,000 worth of USDT, for instance, you will get mtUSDT tokens and make about $1,200 in a year at a 15% APY. Another user, on the other hand, will be able to borrow about $1,125 by putting up $1,500 worth of LINK as collateral. This way, they will still be exposed to LINK’s future performance while getting cash right away. This balance between making money and borrowing money will be what makes people want to buy MUTM tokens. And with a beta launch scheduled before the official listing, customers will be able to try out these features for themselves, which is expected to get more people interested. Risk controls and expanding market opportunities Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also offer a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending model for assets that are too volatile for pooled contracts. This will help keep the protocol safe and able to grow. In this arrangement, tokens like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE will be kept separate. Lenders and borrowers will talk openly about interest rates, loan terms, and how long they have to pay back the loan. This method will create more ways to make money without putting the primary liquidity pools’ stability in danger. Market volatility has always been an important part of how well DeFi platforms do. Mutuum is getting ready to deal with this by establishing Stability Factors, Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, and liquidation methods that are well thought out. Assets like ETH and stablecoins will have an LTV of up to 75% and a liquidation threshold of about 80%. Riskier tokens, on the other hand, will have an LTV of just 35–40% and a liquidation threshold of about 65%. Liquidators will also have reasons to settle troubled loans, which will keep the protocol solvent even when the market is very volatile. For investors who keep an eye on crypto charts or the movement of institutional money into new crypto ETFs, these protections show that Mutuum is more than simply another DeFi platform. It is being created to keep growing in both good and bad markets. It’s getting harder and harder to deny how similar this is to Solana (SOL) in its early days. Ignoring MUTM at $0.035 could be a move that investors regret later, just like SOL was ignored before it broke records. With a planned listing price of $0.06 already projected and major exchanges getting ready to add the tokens, this presale is your final chance to get them at this lower price. In the DeFi market, people who act before the crowd are always rewarded. With a strong presale, a buy-and-distribute mechanism, and an upcoming beta launch, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is on track to become the next token to tell the same success story as Solana (SOL)—but this time with even more momentum.

51749747,https://invezz.com/?p=2881217,1757914560,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Best cheap crypto to buy now is a DeFi token with real utility and 120x potential,https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/15/best-cheap-crypto-to-buy-now-is-a-defi-token-with-real-utility-and-120x-potential/,"In a market where retail investors are still unsure why crypto is down, even though more people are using it, the best long-term strategy will focus on ventures that offer both low prices and real usefulness. Tokens that are made to do more than just trade will do well in the next bull run. They will also help the economy grow. This is why analysts are looking into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi token that was only $0.035 in presale but is expected to rise to $4.20 in the future, giving early investors a chance to make 120 times their money. Utility that drives real demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a loan protocol that has two new parts: peer-to-contract (P2C) pools and peer-to-peer (P2P) lanes. This setup will let customers select between pooled liquidity and direct matching, which will work for both retail traders and institutions. The project will also release mtTokens, which are digital tokens that reflect deposits and staking claims inside the ecosystem. People who stake mtTokens will get MUTM incentives, which will keep the demand for the token going. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stablecoin is another important thing that is being worked on. When people borrow, it will be made, and when they pay it back, it will be burned. This links the circulation of stablecoins directly to borrowing. These mechanisms, along with a systematic repurchase program funded by protocol income, will keep MUTM in a state of utility and demand-driven. This blend of loan usefulness, stablecoin demand, and token staking gives crypto investors a solid base that many other speculative assets don’t have. Presale details and the urgency window The price of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is $0.035, and it is in Phase 6 of its presale. More than 16,300 people have already bought 40% of this phase, bringing in $15.75 million. CertiK gave the security a Token Scan score of 90.00 and a Skynet rating of 79.00. The community is still growing, with more than 12,000 Twitter followers. The next step will raise the price to $0.04, which is a 15% increase. This is the last chance to get in at this lower price before the value goes up. People who keep an eye on the crypto fear and greed index will see this as a unique chance to buy before big companies do. A customer in Phase 6 who pays $0.035 will see the price go up to $0.06 when the item is listed. This is a rise of 70% on paper. For instance, you can buy 71,400 tokens with a $2,500 allocation. That position will be worth $4,300 at $0.06, which means you will make almost $1,800 right away. If you increase today’s $0.035 by 120X, you get a confident long-term estimate of $4.20. If you pay $500 today, you will get 14,300 tokens. That investment will be worth $60,000 when the price hits $4.20, which is a whopping 120X what you put in. People who joined Phase 1 early and paid $0.01 will see $4.20 as a 420X gain, which means their $1,000 will become $420,000. These results show how much potential genuine utility tokens can have over time. Why the 120x path is credible Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE) will help stablecoin borrowers use correlated assets more efficiently, which will lead to bigger, more frequent borrowing flows. As the value of locked dollars grows, the amount of money made from fees will grow a lot. The utilization-based interest model will change rates in real time, raising them when there isn’t enough money and lowering them when there is. This design will keep deep liquidity and make sure that fee income is predictable so that it can be used for buybacks and staking incentives. The protocol treasury will get the money from liquidation fines. When an under-collateralized loan is paid off, the money will go into reserves that can be used to pay for incentives and buybacks later. Over time, this will lower the amount of money in circulation and help prices go up. These mechanisms, along with more people using them, will support the long-term 120× growth. At listing, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch its ecosystem on a Layer-2 chain. Compared to Layer-1 networks, this integration will lower transaction costs by a huge amount, making it possible to use borrowing and staking capabilities often. Along with this, the Beta version of the site will be available, allowing early users to use real features and start making money right away. This dual launch will soon produce network effects, which will speed up the rise of total value locked and boost demand for MUTM. Conclusion Security and incentives for the community make the market even more ready. The CertiK audit gives you a strong reason to trust it. A $50,000 bug bounty with tiered prizes up to $2,000 encourages outside testing, and a $100,000 giveaway will get more people involved and spread the word around the world. In Phase 6, 40% of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already been sold. Once this stage is over, Phase 7 will boost the price to $0.04, which means that new players won’t be able to make any money right away. This DeFi token has a 70% return on listing and a long-term path to $4.20. It is one of the best 120× possibilities on the market because it is cheap to buy and has practical uses. Now is the time for investors who want more than just speculation.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple all posted notable price action, supported by favourable macroeconomic indicators and increasing institutional activity. Traders now await the Federal Reserve’s rate decision later this week, with most analysts anticipating a 25 basis point cut on Wednesday. The outcome is expected to shape near-term momentum across the cryptocurrency market, which has seen renewed optimism despite ongoing volatility. Bitcoin above $116,000 but faces resistance Bitcoin recovered above the $116,000 threshold, helped by expectations of US Federal Reserve rate cuts and political shifts that could broaden institutional adoption of digital assets. The world’s largest cryptocurrency gained 3.72% last week but met resistance at the $116,000 daily level on Saturday before slipping slightly. By Monday, it traded at around $116,300. Market watchers suggest that a daily close above $116,000 could drive Bitcoin toward the psychological $120,000 level. However, selling pressure from long-term holders could weigh on momentum. Lookonchain reported that two Bitcoin wallets tied to an eight-year holder deposited 1,176 BTC—worth about $136 million—into trading platform Hyperliquid on Sunday and “started dumping.” Lookonchain @lookonchain · Follow After a two-week break, the #BitcoinOG who exchanged 35,991 $BTC ($4.04B) for 886,371 $ETH ($4.07B) is back to selling $BTC !2 wallets linked to this #BitcoinOG have deposited 1,176 $BTC ($136.2M) to Hyperliquid in the past 2 hours and started dumping. x.com/lookonchain/st… 6:54 pm · 14 Sept 2025 67 Reply Copy link Read 23 replies The same wallet had previously exchanged over $4 billion worth of Bitcoin for Ether in August. Ethereum strengthens on price breakout and ETF flows Ethereum continued its upward momentum, trading above $4,600 with a weekly gain of about 8%. The cryptocurrency broke through the $4,488 consolidation boundary on Friday, rallying 5.68% before pulling back 2.25% over the weekend. At Monday’s levels near $4,620, analysts suggest ETH could extend its rally toward the record high of $4,956 if it holds above $4,488. A drop below that level, however, could send prices lower toward $4,232. Institutional flows are reinforcing Ethereum’s rally. Spot Ether ETFs saw $405.55 million in net inflows on Friday, marking a fourth straight day of gains. BlackRock’s ETHA pulled in $165.56 million, while Fidelity’s FETH attracted $168.23 million. Total Ether ETF inflows have now reached $13.36 billion, with net assets at $30.35 billion. XRP holds momentum after technical breakout Ripple also posted gains after breaking out of a falling wedge pattern last week, a move that favours bullish sentiment. XRP rallied 2.5% through Friday and Saturday before easing slightly on Sunday. By Monday, it hovered around $3.03. If XRP sustains its upward momentum, analysts point to a potential move toward its $3.40 resistance level. A downside correction, however, could bring it back toward the 50-day EMA at $2.94.

People who saw its potential to disrupt things early on made life-changing profits, while those who waited had to pay higher costs to get in. People are having a similar discourse about Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a penny token that is currently in presale and is being compared to the early days of Bitcoin (BTC). MUTM is becoming one of the crypto coins that analysts are making bold predictions about since it is based on innovation and has a clear roadmap for the future. More and more, investors who are keeping an eye on what’s going on with crypto nowadays know that fresh tokens are where the best chances are. Early adoption has always been a big factor in making money with digital assets. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is putting itself at the center of decentralized finance innovation by introducing a new lending model, stablecoin mechanics, and a buyback-and-distribute framework that will reward people who stick around for a long time. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has captured attention Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is working on a decentralized loan and borrowing platform that will also have a built-in stablecoin system. The stablecoin will always try to stay at $1. It will only be created when people borrow against collateral like ETH, and it will be burned automatically when the loans are paid back or liquidated. Interest rates will not change depending only on market supply and demand, which is different from other procedures. Instead, the governance will change them to keep the stablecoin in balance. When the peg goes above $1, rates will go down to promote more borrowing. When the peg goes below $1, rates will go up. Arbitrage will make stability even stronger since traders will make money off of slight variations to bring the value back to its target. The project’s presale development shows that it is gaining speed. MUTM is currently in Phase 6 and costs $0.035. It has already raised more than $15.75 million and sold 40% of its supply to 16,300 investors. As Phase 7 gets near, the presale price will go up to $0.040, which will bring investors one step closer to the expected listing price of $0.06. This framework makes anyone who wants to get in on the ground floor of what many now see as a future blue-chip DeFi platform feel like they need to act quickly. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just a stablecoin; but it is also creating a sustainable way to borrow money. Interest rates will change according on how much each pool is used, keeping things fair between lenders and borrowers. When there is a lot of cash available, borrowing costs will stay low, which makes loans more appealing. When liquidity gets tighter, rates will go up, which will benefit lenders and encourage people to pay back their loans. This cycle will let Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stay efficient even when things are unstable, which will help both lenders and borrowers expand steadily. Roadmap, trust, and security There are four obvious steps in the vision for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Phase 1 has already included the launch of the presale, marketing efforts, giveaways, an audit of the smart contract, tracking platform listings, and the addition of an AI-powered helpdesk. The last tasks in Phase 1, such as developing teaching materials and putting together a compliance team, will be done soon. In Phase 2, the main focus will be on creating the core smart contracts, the DApp front-end and back-end systems, as well as code reviews and the introduction of risk parameters. The demo version, testnet beta, thorough audits, and end of the presale will all happen in Phase 3. Last but not least, Phase 4 will launch the live Mutuum Finance (MUTM) platform, add listings on exchanges, develop collaborations with institutions, and expand to multiple chains. Security safeguards make investors feel even more secure. CertiK has looked into the MUTM smart contract and given it a Token Scan Score of 90 and a Skynet score of 79. These numbers put it much above average for projects in their early stages and show how committed the team is to being open. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also giving a 50,000 USDT bug bounty program to encourage people in the community to help keep the platform safe. Rewards are based on how serious the problem is. Critical problems can earn up to $2,000, large problems can earn up to $1,000, medium-level finds can win up to $500, and low-level reports can earn up to $200. This method adds expert oversight to decentralized participation, which makes the platform stronger as it gets bigger. More and more, experts are comparing the early adoption curve of BTC to where MUTM is currently. Both are examples of revolutionary technologies that came out when many were skeptical. They both include mechanics that make them scalable over time, and they both reward people who see promise before the rest of the market does. With Phase 6 almost done and a price spike coming soon, the rationale for getting in early is greater than ever. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of the best prospects in the market for people looking for the next initiative to follow in Bitcoin’s (BTC) amazing path.

They have both become dominant by using smart contracts, staking ecosystems, and deep liquidity. This is why they are always seen on crypto charts and are often used as benchmarks for the whole market. However, with crypto prices today demonstrating a growing interest in fresh, high-yield DeFi solutions, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming a project that will not only be spoken about but is also expected to do better than both SOL and ETH in the next cycle. How Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will redefine DeFi lending beyond ETH and SOL With its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) approach, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is getting ready to change how decentralized lending and borrowing function. This mechanism will put together user deposits of stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and DAI, as well as major tokens like ETH, ADA, and BTC, into smart contracts that have been checked. Then, borrowers will be able to get these funds by putting up assets that are worth more than the loan amount. Lenders will keep making money as long as they are involved. Interest rates will change according on how much the pool is used, making sure that both capital efficiency and system solvency stay the same. For example, A lender puts $12,500 worth of USDC into the system and gets mtUSDC tokens in exchange. This investor will make $1,900 in passive income in a year with an average yearly percentage yield of 15%. On the other hand, a borrower locks up $3,000 worth of ADA as collateral and borrows $2,300 without having to sell their ADA. This way, you can get your money back without giving up your chance to invest in ADA’s future growth. The presale, which is now in Phase 6 and has tokens priced at $0.035, is at the heart of this development. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has now raised $15.75 million and sold 40% of this phase’s allocation. More than 16,300 people have joined, and a CertiK audit has made it more credible. This presale performance shows why MUTM is being studied attentively as one of the next breakout tokens. Investors who follow crypto ETF movements and know how institutions choose safe, income-generating assets will comprehend this. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s dual lending system and risk controls signal outperformance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will have both a pooled lending model and a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system, which is different from Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). This feature will let lenders and borrowers talk directly about interest rates, repayment terms, and loan amounts for tokens that are more risky or volatile, like DOGE, PEPE, or FLOKI. By keeping these assets separate from the P2C pools, the platform will keep its essential stability while also opening up other ways to make money. Managing volatility will also be an important part of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s structure. The Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios will change depending on the asset. For example, stablecoins and ETH will have LTVs of up to 75%, while higher-risk tokens would only have LTVs of 35–40%. Stable assets will have a liquidation barrier of 80%, and volatile tokens will have a threshold of 65%. This will provide liquidators room to settle undercollateralized positions at a lower price. Reserve factors of 10% to 40% will give an extra layer of protection, making sure the platform stays solvent even when prices change quickly. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be able to take advantage of both bullish and negative markets by being stable and flexible at the same time. Investors looking at crypto prices now know how volatility affects lending processes. This kind of multi-layered design will make MUTM stand out as a stable long-term performer. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is approaching the market at the appropriate time. There will be a beta launch before the official token release, and major exchanges are likely to offer the token after that. As the larger cycle picks up speed and institutional money flows into crypto ETFs because of Bitcoin’s impending halving, the need for new DeFi methods will grow.

The 81-year-old billionaire, Oracle’s co-founder and current CTO, became the richest person in the world for a day last week after Oracle shares exploded on the back of massive AI contracts. The key driver? A huge new partnership with OpenAI, plus over $455 billion in signed contracts tied to cloud and artificial intelligence. That earnings report triggered Oracle’s biggest single-day gain since 1992. Larry, who owns around 40% of the company, shot up to a net worth of $363 billion, briefly overtaking Elon Musk, as Cryptopolitan previously reported. And he’s doing it all with Donald Trump’s backing. At a White House event in January, Trump appeared with Larry to announce Stargate, a $500 billion AI data center venture between Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank. Larry stood on stage next to Trump, Sam Altman, and Masayoshi Son. Larry told former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair at a Dubai summit in February, “AI is a much bigger deal than the Industrial Revolution, electricity and everything that’s come before.” Larry moves into media, Trump wants him to buy TikTok Right after that Oracle earnings bombshell, The Wall Street Journal reported the Ellison family is now preparing a majority-cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery. That would combine Paramount Global, already taken over by Larry’s son David Ellison, with another entertainment giant, creating a new super-conglomerate controlling Paramount+, HBO Max, and two of Hollywood’s biggest studios. David is running Skydance Media, which merged with Paramount to form this new powerhouse. But it’s Larry who controls the entities that own it. The same week the Warner Bros. news leaked, it also came out that David is pursuing an acquisition of the Free Press, the digital news site founded by Bari Weiss. Talks are underway to give Bari a leading editorial role at CBS News, which Skydance now owns under its new setup. David has also installed Trump ally Kenneth Weinstein as CBS News ombudsman, tightening his grip on the editorial direction. Trump himself called David “a great man” after reaching a $16 million legal settlement with CBS over a “60 Minutes” episode. While Larry was once a supporter of Bill Clinton, he now sits comfortably in Trump’s orbit. In 2020, he even hosted a fundraiser for Trump at his estate, but didn’t show up personally. The TikTok angle is just as loud. Larry’s been circling TikTok since 2020, when Trump tried to force its Chinese parent ByteDance to sell off U.S. operations. Biden signed a TikTok ban in 2024, but Trump returned to office and paused enforcement while trade talks with China continued. At the White House event in January, Trump was asked about Elon buying TikTok. He said, “I’d be fine with that… I’d like Larry to buy it, too.” Larry stays in control at Oracle and builds his personal empire Even after handing over the CEO title, Larry’s still running things. People inside Oracle say he leads weekly development meetings and keeps a tight partnership with CEO Safra Catz. In 2024, it bought health-data company Cerner for $28.3 billion, and Larry used that to explain his long-term strategy. “Healthcare was the only big problem Elon left us,” he said at the Oracle Health Summit. Larry doesn’t hide his admiration for Elon Musk, often calling him an influence. When Elon needed investors for the $44 billion Twitter buyout, Larry texted him offering “a billion… or whatever you recommend.” His Ellison Institute of Technology is directly inspired by Elon’s company network. The institute is working with Oxford University researchers using Oracle tech to find profitable solutions for climate change, food security, and more. Larry’s obsession with control goes back decades, as Cryptopolitan detailed in an Op-ed by the same author. In 2000, during Microsoft’s antitrust scandal, he admitted to hiring investigators to dig into Microsoft’s ties to lobbyists and politicians. He called it his “civic duty.” In the early 2000s, Larry got sued by shareholders after dumping $900 million in Oracle stock before earnings missed. He didn’t admit guilt but settled and donated $100 million to charity. Larry started all this after dropping out of college twice, getting a job at Ampex, and working on a CIA database project named “Oracle.” He liked the name so much, he used it for his own startup in 1977. Oracle went public in 1986, and by the ’90s, he was a billionaire. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

He recently shared an astounding statistic on X: a staggering $625 billion in capital has flowed into Bitcoin’s network over just the last 1.5 years, from 2024 to 2025. This figure is not just significant; it absolutely dwarfs the cumulative $435 billion recorded over Bitcoin’s entire previous 15-year history, from 2009 to 2024. What does this massive surge in capital mean for the world’s leading cryptocurrency? Understanding the Monumental Bitcoin On-Chain Inflows When we talk about Bitcoin on-chain inflows , we are referring to the total value of Bitcoin moving onto exchanges or other known on-chain entities. This metric often indicates the amount of capital entering the Bitcoin ecosystem, either for trading, investment, or other purposes. A higher inflow suggests increased participation and liquidity within the market. Ju Ki-young’s data highlights an unprecedented shift: Recent Surge: $625 billion in capital inflows over the past 1.5 years (2024-2025). Historical Context: This surpasses the $435 billion accumulated over the previous 15 years (2009-2024). Magnitude: The recent period alone accounts for nearly 1.5 times the total inflows of the entire preceding era. This dramatic acceleration in capital entering the Bitcoin network underscores a profound change in investor behavior and market dynamics. What’s Fueling This Unprecedented Bitcoin On-Chain Surge? Several key factors are likely contributing to this monumental increase in Bitcoin on-chain inflows . Understanding these drivers helps us grasp the current market sentiment and future potential: Spot Bitcoin ETFs: The approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in major markets has opened the floodgates for institutional and traditional retail investors. These regulated products provide an easier, more familiar avenue for capital to enter the Bitcoin market without directly owning the underlying asset. Institutional Adoption: Beyond ETFs, more corporations and financial institutions are allocating capital to Bitcoin, either directly or through derivatives. They view Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, a hedge against inflation, or a strategic investment. Macroeconomic Climate: Global economic uncertainties, inflation concerns, and a search for alternative stores of value continue to push investors towards Bitcoin. Its decentralized nature and finite supply make it an attractive option during turbulent times. Retail Investor Interest: Renewed media attention, coupled with Bitcoin’s price appreciation, often sparks a ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO) among individual investors, driving more capital into the market. These combined forces create a powerful tailwind, propelling Bitcoin into a new era of capital influx. The Far-Reaching Implications of Growing Bitcoin On-Chain Inflows The implications of such significant Bitcoin on-chain inflows are vast and multifaceted. They signal a maturing market and could shape Bitcoin’s trajectory for years to come. Increased Liquidity and Stability: Higher capital inflows generally lead to greater market liquidity, potentially reducing price volatility over the long term as the market deepens. Validation of Bitcoin: The sheer volume of capital entering the ecosystem serves as a powerful validation of Bitcoin’s legitimacy and long-term viability as a global asset. Ecosystem Growth: More capital means more resources for development, innovation, and expansion within the broader crypto ecosystem, including layer-2 solutions and DeFi protocols. Potential for Price Appreciation: While not a direct predictor, sustained inflows often precede or accompany periods of significant price appreciation, reflecting strong demand. However, it is also important to consider that large inflows can sometimes be followed by outflows, particularly if market sentiment shifts or profit-taking occurs. Monitoring these metrics provides crucial insights. Navigating the Future of Bitcoin’s Capital Dynamics The data from CryptoQuant’s CEO, Ju Ki-young, paints a clear picture: Bitcoin is experiencing an unprecedented era of capital accumulation. This isn’t just a fleeting trend; it represents a fundamental shift in how the world views and invests in digital assets. The transition from niche technology to mainstream investment vehicle is accelerating, driven by robust institutional interest and evolving global economic landscapes. For investors, understanding these massive Bitcoin on-chain inflows means recognizing the growing mainstream acceptance and the potential for continued market expansion. While volatility remains a characteristic of the crypto market, the underlying capital commitment suggests a strong foundation for future growth. Staying informed about on-chain metrics and broader market trends will be key to navigating this exciting phase of Bitcoin’s journey. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What exactly are Bitcoin on-chain inflows? Bitcoin on-chain inflows refer to the total value of Bitcoin moving into wallets on exchanges or other known on-chain entities. This metric is typically measured in fiat currency (like USD) and indicates the amount of capital being deposited into the Bitcoin ecosystem, often for trading or investment purposes. 2. Why are the recent Bitcoin on-chain inflows so significant? The recent inflows are significant because, according to CryptoQuant CEO Ju Ki-young, $625 billion has entered the network in just the past 1.5 years (2024-2025). This figure dramatically surpasses the cumulative $435 billion recorded over Bitcoin’s entire previous 15-year history (2009-2024), highlighting an unprecedented acceleration of capital adoption. 3. What factors are contributing to this massive surge in Bitcoin capital? Key factors include the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have made Bitcoin more accessible to institutional and traditional investors, increasing institutional adoption, a favorable macroeconomic climate driving demand for alternative assets, and renewed interest from retail investors. 4. How do these large inflows impact Bitcoin’s price and market stability? While not a direct guarantee of price increases, significant inflows generally indicate strong demand and can contribute to price appreciation. They also tend to increase market liquidity, which can help stabilize prices over the long term as the market becomes deeper and more mature. 5. Is this trend of increasing Bitcoin on-chain inflows sustainable? Many analysts believe the trend is sustainable due to ongoing institutional adoption, the expanding utility of Bitcoin, and its role as a hedge in a volatile global economy. However, market dynamics can change, and continued monitoring of economic indicators and regulatory developments is essential.

It was expected that after the Bitcoin price hit multiple new all-time highs over the last two years, altcoins would follow. Bitcoin continued to outperform the top altcoins by a large margin, and this blocked the way for the altcoin season to begin. However, with the market recovery, there is now a chance that the altcoin season might begin again. Altcoin Season Index On The Rise The Altcoin Season index takes into account the performance of the top 100 altcoins versus the performance of the Bitcoin price. This comparison is then charted and plotted over a 90-day period to show how these large-cap altcoins have performed against the pioneer cryptocurrency. Depending on the number of altcoins that are outperforming Bitcoin in this 90-day period, the index deduces whether the market is headed into an altcoin season or not. Now, the higher the figure on the index, the higher the chances that an alt season might begin. When there are more than 75 altcoins outperforming the Bitcoin price in a 90-day period, then it is the needed signal that the alt season has begun. In 2025, the Altcoin Season Index has trended low, mostly below the 50% mark. However, with the recent market recovery over the weekend, the index has now achieved its highest level this year, suggesting that an altcoin season is drawing closer. According to data from the CoinMarketCap website, the Altcoin Season Index is sitting at a score of 67% at the time of this writing. With 75% being the target, it means that the market just needs another 8 of the top 100 altcoins to outperform Bitcoin to use in an alt season. What To Expect Previous market performances have shown altcoin seasons to be a period of explosive rallies for altcoins. The last alt season was categorized by notable rallies such as Dogecoin’s 36,000% rise and Shiba Inu’s legendary rally that saw it temporarily flip Dogecoin. There was also the DeFi summer during this time that ushered the likes of Fantom, Polygon, and Uniswap into the limelight. Given this, it is expected that the next altcoin season will send existing altcoins flying while giving new narratives a chance to outperform as well.",Altcoins|Altcoin|altcoin news|Altcoin season Altcoin season|Altcoin season news|altcoins|Altcoins news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-15 06:00:08

In the post, he addressed this pullback, framing it as a short-term development within a broader uptrend. His analysis suggested that while downside levels should be monitored, the overall trend remains positive. THIS IS WHY #XRP DUMPED! (watch within 24 hours) pic.twitter.com/idUlueKj8A — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 14, 2025 XRP’s Recent Pullback The video centered on recent chart behavior. He pointed out that XRP had broken out from a falling wedge pattern a few days ago, and initially moved higher, regaining the $3.1 level and showing signs of a continued climb. However, it has since encountered some resistance. On lower time frames, the token has been retreating, prompting questions about whether this downturn signals deeper weakness or a temporary correction. Support Levels in Focus The analyst applied a Fibonacci retracement to the latest upward move that began from the lowest point on September 1 . From this perspective, key support levels emerge at $2.98, $2.93, and the stronger $2.87 zone, which he described as the golden ratio. According to him, these areas represent important markers for traders considering entries in line with the prevailing trend. He argued that this pullback may offer opportunities rather than concern. “This could be a very interesting area to potentially open up new long positions,” he explained, linking short-term weakness to the potential for renewed upside now that the asset’s consolidation phase is over . Upside Targets Remain Intact Steph positioned the correction as a healthy part of market structure rather than a sign of trend reversal. Despite the immediate pullback, the analyst highlighted that the technical price target following the wedge breakout sits around $3.64, just below the recent peak of $3.65 . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He described this as a gain of more than 20% from current levels. Beyond that, he noted the next targets at $4, $4.5, $4.6, and potentially $5, while stressing the importance of approaching each step sequentially. He further pointed to the daily EMA ribbons, noting that XRP continues to trade above them. This, in his view, shows that “the trend is still up” despite short-term corrections. The daily RSI, he added, does not yet show bearish divergence, reinforcing the argument for continuation higher. He noted bearish divergence on XRP’s weekly chart, signaling a possible correction in a few months. Still, he framed the weekend dip as minor. From a risk-to-reward perspective, he concluded that the downside appears limited compared to the “absolutely massive” potential upside.

This will be Trump’s fourth extension since he started his second term in January. The law originally gave ByteDance until January 2025 to sell TikTok’s U.S. assets or face a ban. The extension comes as American and Chinese officials meet for a second day of trade talks in Spain on Monday amid a deadline this month for the Chinese owner of TikTok to find a buyer. The talks, led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, are the latest effort to defuse a trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Trump extends TikTok deadline again during talks “We may let it die, or we may, I don’t know, it depends, up to China. It doesn’t matter too much. I’d like to do it for the kids.” Those were Trump’s uncertain comments on Sunday when a reporter inquired about TikTok’s future. The president had already moved the deadline multiple times , first to April, then to June, and now to September. With each extension, he said that American buyers are ready to take over TikTok’s operations and wanted to give the talks more time, but he never settled on one clear path forward. The White House hasn’t confirmed the extension yet, but these repeated delays show that Trump isn’t entirely certain about shutting down the app for good. Over 170 million people across the country use TikTok, and cutting them off would cause frustration and risk their income sources. A ban could also trigger pushback from the younger Americans, which is risky for Trump, who wants to keep their support. At the same time, lawmakers in Washington remain strict about China and warn that TikTok gives Beijing access to personal information . With this, the country can influence what Americans see online and risk national security. Besides national security, Trump also wants to keep TikTok alive for political reasons. The app was one of his biggest campaign channels in 2024, as it allowed the president to reach the younger voters and give him the advantage he needed. With these delayed extensions, Trump is trying to buy more time to negotiate with ByteDance and possible U.S investors while avoiding direct confrontation with a generation of voters who may not take the ban as lightly or calmly. U.S.-China trade talks delay TikTok sale deal The fact that any transfer of TikTok’s prized algorithm cannot happen without approval from Beijing has slowed down efforts to close a deal. Officials and investors almost had a deal that would give a new company in the U.S. major ownership of TikTok’s U.S. operations, but China retracted the talks after Trump announced steep tariffs on Chinese goods. Negotiations started again on Sunday in Spain. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and top trade negotiator Li Chenggang. They included TikTok in the agenda for the first time, unlike the previous Geneva, London, and Stockholm meetings, where it was never mentioned. Still, people close to the talks said they don’t expect an agreement before the September 17 deadline. Adding TikTok to the public agenda in Spain is a strategic play by the Trump administration to extend the deadline again, since it can now argue that active talks with China are ongoing. But this move doesn’t come without political risks because both Republicans and Democrats in Congress supported the law that required ByteDance to sell TikTok’s U.S. operations or face a shutdown. Many lawmakers are now frustrated with the repeated extensions and may put a lot of pressure on Trump’s administration if he does it one more time.

Key Takeaways: Native Markets won the USDH stablecoin bid for Hyperliquid, defeating Paxos and other rivals. Paxos failed to gain traction despite a revised proposal offering deep PayPal integration, incentives, and capped revenue share. Native Markets plans a phased USDH rollout, backed by validator support and a reserve strategy involving BlackRock and Superstate. The decision, finalized Sunday , followed weeks of speculation and community debate, with Native Markets ultimately pulling ahead after validator commitments and prediction markets heavily favored the team. Ethena, once seen as a top contender, exited the race on Thursday , citing community concerns about its non-native infrastructure. Paxos Falls Short in USDH Bid Despite Midweek Proposal Revision Paxos remained in contention but failed to gain momentum despite revising its proposal midweek. Paxos’ Version 2 pitch included a deep integration of USDH into PayPal and Venmo, zero-cost on/off-ramps, and a $20 million incentive plan. It also commited all USDH revenue to Hyperliquid’s growth until $1 billion in total value locked (TVL) is reached, with Paxos capping its own share at 5% beyond $5 billion. Criticism emerged over the process itself. Some observers argued the compressed RFP timeline and validator links to Hyperliquid infrastructure may have given Native Markets an edge. Still, the vote concluded with broad validator backing and strong odds on prediction platform Myriad. Founder Max Fiege announced a phased rollout plan beginning with the submission of a Hyperliquid Improvement Proposal. The launch will include limited minting and redemption trials, capped at $800 per user, to test core functions before opening a USDH/USDC spot market and eventually unlocking full access. Native Markets has been awarded the USDH ticker on Hyperliquid. Thank you to all HYPE stakers and network validators for their time and effort in reviewing the proposals put forward. — max.hl (@fiege_max) September 14, 2025 Native Markets pitched a tightly integrated stablecoin strategy tailored to Hyperliquid. Reserves in cash and US Treasuries will be managed off-chain by BlackRock, while on-chain tokenized assets will be handled via Superstate and Stripe’s Bridge infrastructure. Notably, the team pledged to split all reserve yield between Hyperliquid’s Assistance Fund and broader ecosystem growth. The team’s credibility was bolstered by backers with experience at Uniswap Labs, Paradigm, and Polychain. Early endorsements from validator groups such as CMI Trading helped further solidify support. Trump-Backed GENIUS Act Boosts US Push for Dollar-Pegged Stablecoins The recent passage of the GENIUS Act , signed by President Trump, aims to cement the dollar’s dominance by backing dollar-pegged stablecoins in global markets. The Treasury Department expects the stablecoin market to exceed $2 trillion by 2028, a projection that places greater emphasis on liquidity, interoperability, and regulatory alignment across the ecosystem. Tether’s latest move underscores a pragmatic shift toward that future. As reported, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has said the stablecoin sector is poised for explosive growth, projecting the market could balloon from its current $250 billion capitalization to as much as $2 trillion in the near future. “Many people think it will reach $1 to $2 trillion in a handful of years,” Garlinghouse said, adding that Ripple is positioned to benefit from that trajectory. Meanwhile, Western Union is positioning itself for a new phase of digital transformation, signaling strong interest in using stablecoins to modernize its global remittance operations.

Nasdaq-listed Forward Industries (FORD) has revealed its intentions to invest directly in the burgeoning Solana-based decentralized finance sector. This isn’t just a rumor; it’s a confirmed strategic move that has caught the attention of both traditional finance and crypto enthusiasts alike. Why is Forward Industries Investing in the Solana DeFi Ecosystem? The news initially surfaced through a report by The Block, later solidified by Forward Industries’ CEO, Kyle Samani. The confirmation came in a direct reply to a post on X from Ansem, a prominent anonymous crypto analyst with nearly half a million followers. Ansem had provocatively suggested that an investment from a firm like Forward Industries would provide a much-needed boost to Solana’s DeFi sector, which he noted was lagging behind Ethereum’s. Samani, who is also the founder of the influential crypto investment firm Multicoin Capital, didn’t mince words. He stated unequivocally that this is precisely what the company plans to do. This endorsement from a figure deeply entrenched in both traditional and crypto finance adds significant weight to the announcement, highlighting a strategic alignment that could redefine perceptions of the Solana DeFi ecosystem . What Does This Mean for Solana DeFi? This investment is more than just capital injection; it’s a powerful vote of confidence from a publicly traded company. Here’s why it’s a big deal: Increased Legitimacy: A Nasdaq-listed company entering the space can attract other institutional investors, lending further credibility to the Solana DeFi ecosystem . Capital Inflow: New capital can fuel innovation, development, and expansion of existing DeFi protocols on Solana. Bridging TradFi and Crypto: It serves as a bridge, potentially encouraging more traditional financial entities to explore the benefits and opportunities within decentralized finance. Addressing Perceived Weaknesses: As Ansem pointed out, Solana’s DeFi has room to grow compared to Ethereum. This investment could be the catalyst needed to accelerate that growth. The move by Forward Industries underscores a growing trend of traditional businesses recognizing the disruptive potential of blockchain technology and decentralized finance. It’s a clear signal that the digital asset space is maturing and attracting serious players. Forward Industries’ Strategic Financial Backing It’s important to note that this isn’t Forward Industries’ first foray into significant capital raises. On September 8, the company successfully raised an impressive $1.65 billion in a private investment round. This round was led by a consortium of heavyweight firms, including Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital. The involvement of such prominent names, particularly Multicoin Capital with Kyle Samani at its helm, paints a picture of a well-orchestrated strategy to tap into high-growth areas within the crypto landscape. This prior fundraising provides Forward Industries with the financial muscle to execute its ambitious plans within the Solana DeFi ecosystem . The alignment of these major players suggests a shared vision for Solana’s potential, focusing on its speed, scalability, and lower transaction costs compared to some of its competitors. What’s Next for the Solana DeFi Ecosystem? The coming months will be crucial for observing the impact of this investment. We can anticipate several potential developments: Innovation Surge: Increased funding could lead to new protocols, dApps, and services launching on Solana. Enhanced User Experience: More capital might be directed towards improving user interfaces and overall accessibility within the ecosystem. Increased Liquidity: Greater institutional involvement often translates to deeper liquidity pools, benefiting all users of Solana DeFi. Market Competition: This could intensify competition among various blockchain ecosystems, pushing all players to innovate further. Ultimately, Forward Industries’ strategic pivot is a significant moment for Solana. It highlights the growing confidence in Solana’s underlying technology and its capacity to host a robust and scalable decentralized finance future. This investment could indeed be the catalyst that propels the Solana DeFi ecosystem into a new era of growth and adoption.

Key Takeaways: Jimmy Song argues Taproot introduced a social attack surface that enabled spam-like activity via Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens. He claims Taproot failed to deliver on privacy and usability promises, particularly in multi-signature setups. The divide over Bitcoin’s purpose deepens, as developers debate whether to support or limit nonfinancial transactions on the network. In a video posted on X , Song said developers underestimated the unintended consequences of enabling nonfinancial transactions at scale. “What they ignore is that Taproot had significant trolling value as the upgrade that Bitcoiners were placing their hopes in,” Song said. “The increase in the social attack surface of this upgrade wasn’t accounted for at all.” Taproot Aimed to Boost Bitcoin Privacy and Efficiency with Schnorr Signatures Taproot, activated in November 2021, was introduced to improve Bitcoin’s privacy, efficiency, and scripting capabilities through Schnorr signatures and Script Path Spend. However, Song argues the upgrade failed to deliver on its core promises. He pointed to poor user experience with multi-signature implementations, noting that Taproot made the process even more complex compared to traditional multisig. “Bad user experience basically made it a non-starter,” he added. Song’s comments reflect a broader ideological rift in the Bitcoin community. On one side are figures like Adam Back, Dennis Porter, and Luke Dashjr, who support Bitcoin’s role strictly as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. On the other hand are proponents of Ordinals and Runes, like pseudonymous developer Leonidas, who argue that all valid transactions, financial or otherwise, should be welcomed. That divide intensified earlier this year when Bitcoin Core developers voted to remove the 80-byte limit on OP_RETURN, opening the door for larger non-financial payloads like images, videos, and audio. While some saw this as progress, others feared a reversal. The uncertainty has led to an exodus to Bitcoin Knots, a competing implementation. Knots nodes now make up nearly 28% of the network, up from just 67 nodes in March. #vlog 27 Was Taproot A Wise Decision? pic.twitter.com/sUjtf8JA2z — Jimmy Song (송재준) (@jimmysong) September 13, 2025 Despite his criticism, Song hasn’t completely written off Taproot. “It can, of course, redeem itself,” he said, citing future applications like BitVM and Ark as possible ways to justify the upgrade’s cost. Meanwhile, Leonidas claims that Ordinals and Runes have contributed over $500 million in transaction fees, bolstering Bitcoin’s long-term security as the block subsidy diminishes. Still, Dune Analytics data shows fee revenues are inconsistent, ranging from just $3,000 to $537,000 per day in 2025, a far cry from the nearly $10 million peak seen in December 2023. Dev Threatens Bitcoin Core Fork Over v30 Upgrade and Ordinals Censorship Leonidas, a leading figure in the Ordinals ecosystem, has warned he will fund a Bitcoin Core fork if developers attempt to censor Ordinals or Runes transactions in the upcoming v30 upgrade. The open letter, backed by miners controlling over 50% of the network’s hash rate, signals a deepening divide over Bitcoin’s future utility as the network prepares to expand on-chain data capacity. The v30 upgrade, set for October 2025, will remove the 80-byte OP_RETURN limit and enable up to 4MB of data per transaction, fueling the rise of what critics call “JPEG spam.” Adam Back of Blockstream argues these data-heavy inscriptions are displacing legitimate transactions, while Leonidas counters that Ordinals have contributed over $500 million in fees since 2023. As tensions mount, the alternative Bitcoin Knots implementation, opposed to v30’s data policy changes, has grown to control 18% of the network.

The company purchased the digital assets from Binance, Coinbase, and Bybit across 13 transactions during the last 24 hours. The global leader in digital assets and data center infrastructure has recently acquired batches of Solana from exchanges. On Sunday, on-chain data showed that the company purchased around 6.5 million SOL in the past five days, worth $1.57 billion. At the same time, Arkham Intelligence showed that Galaxy moved millions of SOL to other addresses, mainly to custody wallets on Fireblocks. Galaxy provides capital investment to Forward Industries Last week, Galaxy Digital partnered with Jump Crypto and Multicoin Capital to launch a Solana-centered digital asset treasury strategy. The trio agreed to provide capital worth $1.65 billion in cash and stablecoin for a private investment in public equity offering to Forward Industries. The initiative aims to position Forward Industries as the Solana ecosystem’s leading publicly traded institutional participant. Forward Industry also aims to generate differentiated on-chain returns and build long-term shareholder value through active participation in the Solana ecosystem. “Solana has emerged as one of the most innovative and widely adopted blockchain ecosystems in the world.” – Michael Pruitt , CEO of Forward Industries. Galaxy’s CEO, Mike Novogratz, also said last week that the crypto market is entering the season of Solana. He acknowledged the recent $1.65 billion fundraise for FORD, saying that treasury companies focused on altcoins are bringing new energy and money into the space. Novogratz also noted a shifting regulatory backdrop as the U.S. SEC Chair Paul Atkins revealed efforts to modernize crypto rules and regulations. Atkins said the agency is working to modernize the securities rules and regulations to enable markets to move on-chain. Novogratz called the initiative a radical departure from prior regulations and a sign that institutional adoption is accelerating. Atkins also mentioned that entrepreneurs and investors should be able to raise capital on-chain without endless legal uncertainty. The SEC chair maintained that most crypto tokens are not securities and fall outside the agency’s remit. Galaxy’s CEO acknowledged Atkin’s comments, saying they are pushing things in the right direction. He also believes blockchains are now fast, safe, secure, and trusted, and they are ready for Wall Street adoption once regulatory frameworks are in place. Novogratz pointed out that Solana’s speed and high transaction capacity make it a tailor-made blockchain suited for financial markets. The tech executive also said digital assets represent healthy competition in rebuilding global financial infrastructure. Novogratz sees more capital flowing into Solana Novogratz is confident that capital will move into the ecosystem as the company starts moving from narrative to execution. Bitwise chief investment officer, Matt Hougan, also pointed to a potential emergence in the Solana season. He anticipates that ETF approvals, subsequent inflows, and corporate treasury purchases will fuel runs similar to Bitcoin and Ether’s. Hougan said several issuers, including Galaxy Digital, have filed for spot Solana ETFs in the U.S. He also said the SEC is expected to decide by October 10 on the SOL funds, which could potentially set up multiple launches in Q4. He also acknowledged this week’s capital pledge to Forward Industries, which mirrors what Michael Saylor has done for Bitcoin and Tom Lee for Ethereum. Due to its speed and low costs, Hougan believes Solana is a programmable blockchain built for stablecoins, tokenized assets, and DeFi. He noted that SOL offers transactions costing less than a cent and finalizes them in milliseconds after a pending upgrade, which is far faster than Ethereum. The tech executive also stated that Solana doesn’t rely on Layer 2s like Ethereum, which offers the digital asset a simpler user experience. He believes that a relatively small amount of flows into Solana could significantly impact prices. At the publication time, Solana is exchanging hands at around $243.15. The digital asset has surged by 17.42% in the past seven days and by more than 30% in the last 30 days.

Mutuum Finance is emerging as the most-touted opportunity for retail traders considering the potential to turn low stakes into massive gains. The venture has raised over $15.8 million from over 16,300 supporters during presale. Aside from Pepe (PEPE), Mutuum Finance stands out as one of the innovators with its new positioning in a crowded market, fueling rumination on whether it would be the next giant breakout story in the crypto economy. PEPE Trades Near $0.000012 as Meme-Token Activity Persists PEPE (PEPE) is trading at $0.00001214. The token has recorded a double-digit 24-hour advance and high volume relative to its recent averages, suggesting short-term buying interest. Because PEPE is a social meme token, the price remains sensitive to social and on-chain sentiment, which creates wild intraday whips within the range of the week. Market watchers are monitoring volume and resistance at the recent weekly highs for follow-through, while new DeFi opportunities such as Mutuum Finance are also receiving attention. Mutuum Finance Presale Speed up Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is performing well in presale phase six, securing tremendous traction as investors’ volumes keep soaring. The project has already hit over 16,300 recorded owners and has reached over $15.8 million in locked-up capital, with recent activities showing that the pace will continue to increase. Such a humongous boost is a clear indicator of growing investors’ confidence as the platform continues to inch closer to going live. Strategic Value for First Movers Not only are investors buying at the presale price exposing themselves to tokens at significantly lower cost, but they are also setting themselves up for astronomical short-term returns of up to 300% on launch day one, and even greater long-term opportunity as the ecosystem continues to expand. Early adopters are crowding towards a project on the basis of extremely future-centric dual lending model, longevity-long-term-conceived stablecoin, fully audited and open-source codebase, and tokenomics to generate scarcity and appreciation. Put them all together, and Mutuum Finance is an extremely well-capable player to revolutionize the next level of DeFi innovation. Bug Bounty Program Securing Security As part of another move towards ensuring security in its ecosystem, Mutuum Finance has partnered with CertiK to launch an official bug bounty program backed by a $50,000 USDT bounty pool. Reward is given at four levels of severity, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, so that all types of vulnerability can be discovered and eliminated. By making itself open to external developer and researcher scrutiny of its platform, Mutuum adopts cutting-edge security controls, further enhancing security and trust to its investing base. Risk Controls Embedded and Market Provisions Mutuum Tiered Loan-to-Value percentages and liquidation points fluctuate depending on the volatility of the underlying collateral. Less volatile assets support higher borrowing, while riskier tokens enjoy more restricted borrowing. The second stability is safeguarded by reserve multipliers, ranging from about 10% for low-volatility instruments to as much as 35% for riskier instruments. The system is extremely well-balanced between access and safety, making further market participation possible and reducing systemic risk. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Pepe (PEPE) rank among the most sought-after names among investors looking for outlier returns. Although PEPE is selling at $0.00001214 and is very community-driven, Mutuum Finance is going heavy with $15.8M in funding and 16,300+ holders already on the offer. Stage 6 presale tokens are currently available for sale at $0.035, with estimates to see up to 300% gains on day one of launch and long-term value many times greater. Backed by a $50K CertiK bug bounty, twin lending protocols, and strong risk management, MUTM is designed for scalability, security, and long-term growth. Lock up your tokens on Stage 6 today before the next price increase.

51753520,580925,1757921439,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51753520.jpeg,Cardano Founder Blasts Ghost Chain Critics: ‘Cavalry Is Coming’,https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-ghost-chain-critics-cavalry-coming/,"Broadcasting “from rough and rugged Wyoming” late on September 14, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson delivered a forceful rebuttal to what he called years of dismissive “ghost chain” narratives, arguing that the industry has “moved the goalposts” away from decentralization and toward VC-favored speed and token economics. “It sucks to go to cryptocurrency Reddit and no matter what you say or do, you’re criticized and demeaned and attacked,” he said, after reading a community post lamenting the “overwhelming negative sentiment outside of our community.” Hoskinson’s message: Cardano will stick to its original brief—resilience, censorship resistance, and self-governance—and the payoff is near. “Keep the faith and don’t give up hope. The cavalry is coming. We are moving exactly as we need to,” he said. Hoskinson Blasts Cardano Critics And ‘VC Chains’ The livestream ’s central theme was a clash of first principles. Hoskinson traced early crypto’s mission to “disintermediation and decentralization,” saying the sector has since rewarded throughput and speculative manias—NFTs, GameFi, memecoins, and now RWAs—over credible neutrality. “The goalpost moved from disintermediation and decentralization to, well, let’s build high-performance systems and we don’t particularly care if those systems are resilient or decentralized,” he argued. In his telling, Cardano’s refusal to compromise on those design goals explains both the network’s slower, research-driven cadence and its perceived under-appreciation in Web3 circles: “We’ve beat that drum and we’ve built protocol after protocol doing things the right way. Not the sexy way, not the VC-friendly way.” Hoskinson framed the project’s past decade as an exercise in building durable primitives: the extended UTXO model for deterministic smart contracts; “liquid non-custodial staking”; the Ouroboros family of protocols; the Hard Fork Combinator for “telescoping” upgrades; end-to-end on-chain governance and treasury; and newer concepts such as isomorphic state channels, a partner-chains paradigm, and “Bitcoin DeFi” to align with what he called a principles-first ecosystem. “Every year, Cardano continues to get more decentralized, more resilient,” he said. “We’re able to take the best of all the ideas in the space, but never once have we compromised on who we are.” On scalability, Hoskinson said Cardano is “on the dawn” of its next phase. He stated that “ Leios is now in a SIP,” describing it as “the last stage before implementation” and “the foundation of a scalability agenda that is endless,” language he linked to a co-evolution with Hydra and advances in zero-knowledge cryptography. Taken together, he said, these efforts aim at “infinite scale just in time to absorb the needs of the economic, political and social systems abroad and at home.” He pointed to Hydra’s maturation—from a “toy” to demonstrations including a “vending machine” and tests he described as “a million transactions a second”—as a key pillar of the network’s L2 posture. The founder set out a go-to-market plan that deliberately looks beyond crypto natives. “Less than 5% of the world is in the cryptocurrency space,” he said. “So why do we particularly care about a minority of a minority when there’s a big wide world out there?” He urged “physicalizing Cardano,” citing Hydra-backed point-of-sale and ATM integrations, and stressed “rational privacy for all” through Midnight . He also cast Cardano as “the best place to launch a new blockchain,” linking that claim to the partner-chains initiative and what he called the “best AVS experience in the space.” Bitcoin remains the critical ally in this strategy, he said: “We have to partner with ecosystems that are principles first like Bitcoin… And we’re doing this with Bitcoin DeFi.” Cavalry Coming? Geographically, Hoskinson highlighted Argentina and Africa. He said Input Output maintains the “largest cryptocurrency office” in Buenos Aires and hosts biweekly events, adding that Cardano “continues to grow throughout Latin America.” In Africa, he said the long-trailed identity push is “almost ready to roll out,” with 2026 targeted to “turn on the ability to bring economic identity to the millions eventually billions who don’t have it.” Throughout, he contrasted these efforts with what he characterized as short-lived hype cycles: “To be truly a visionary, you have to accept that you have to go alone sometimes into the wilderness… And we’ve done that for 10 years.” Governance milestones formed another through-line. Hoskinson declared the project’s “Voltaire” era “mission accomplished,” citing a community-elected constitutional committee, “hundreds of DReps,” a ratified on-chain constitution, and an annual budget. “We’re already talking about the next constitution and an incredible suite of governance tools,” he said, arguing that this collective machinery lets the ecosystem “speak with one voice,” ratify upgrades, and “converge to a budget” without compromising liveness or safety. “We are the only chain in the history of the cryptocurrency industry to do this,” he asserted. The address included rare self-critique. Hoskinson said he wished Cardano had “moved faster in certain areas,” made “slightly different decisions about the ordering of the roadmap,” and staffed partnerships more aggressively. He nonetheless credited the privacy-focused Midnight initiative with “more than a hundred partnerships,” positioning it as a commercial bridge that “will bring hundreds more, if not thousands.” He also revisited longstanding allegations from rival communities, saying he is “still inundated” with claims he “stole $600 million,” and added that a “128-page” forensic audit “gave complete exoneration,” a result he said received little attention from crypto media. “The asymmetries of information sting long, hard, and unfortunately take years or decades to undo,” he said. Hoskinson closed by returning to community morale, urging Cardano’s governance participants to “forget the past and… look to the future,” redirecting energy toward entrepreneurs who can “bring in the countless millions to tens of millions to hundreds of millions of users.” The core bet, he said, is unchanged: that decentralization, credible governance, and research-led engineering will ultimately outlast every hype cycle. “The next 24 to 36 months, Cardano will be in a position where it’s the fastest, most secure, and frankly speaking, best platform… to build anything at scale for anyone,” Hoskinson concluded, adding: “Cardano’s best days are ahead of it. I will always believe that. And that’s because Cardano has the best people.” At press time, ADA traded at $0.89.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|Cardano news|Cardano Price,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FORKS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-15 07:30:39

Even if there has been a lot of uncertainty and low real yield for years, retail traders are still betting on XRP. At the same time, institutions and experienced traders are getting ready for the next wave of decentralized finance, where safety, predictable income, and good token mechanisms will be more important than hype. This is why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming the name that big companies are interested in. Early investors are already being told that they may make 600% to 1,500% on their money. Why giants are watching Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being constructed as a dual lending marketplace. It will have both P2C (peer-to-contract) and P2P (peer-to-peer) models that will let both retail and institutional users lend and borrow money easily. When a user inputs assets, the system will generate mtTokens. These tokens will be a liquid receipt that will increase in value over time and can be staked in smart contracts to earn MUTM incentives. The protocol will also add a mint-and-burn mechanism for stablecoins, which will make the token more valuable as more people borrow it. Safeguards of institutional quality will be very important. There will be limits on how much you may deposit and borrow, which will keep lending pools balanced. There will also be limits on how much collateral you can use, which will stop people from using unstable assets in dangerous schemes. With Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE), users will be able to borrow more money against their deposits. This will make capital more efficient, which will raise the total value locked and, in turn, bring in more protocol revenue. The money will go into buybacks, which will keep the token in demand. The presale is already at Phase 6, with a price of $0.035. It has raised $15.75 million and sold 40% of the 170 million tokens available. The following step will raise the price to $0.04, which means that anyone who comes late will have to pay 15% more. Security is already a big deal, with a CertiK audit showing good results (90/79), a $50,000 bug bounty, and a $100,000 community giveaway to get people to join early. ROI scenarios that traders can measure Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has set up its presale in a way that traders can easily check the math. The expected listing price is $0.06, which sets a baseline for the upside. In a conservative example, purchasers entered at $0.015 in Phase 2. That entry will have given a 300% return on investment by listing on paper. Once institutions lift the token’s value to $0.09, the Phase 2 entrance will turn into a 600% return on investment (ROI), proving that predictable growth would benefit patient users. The aggressive scenario begins at Phase 3 and costs $0.02. The return on investment (ROI) will be 200% if you list at $0.06. The valuation will grow to $0.30, and the ROI will rise to 1,400% as institutional demand, buybacks, and total value locked expansion increase. The numbers are apparent for traders: A person who put $10,000 into Phase 3 at $0.02 got 500,000 MUTM tokens. Those tokens will be worth $30,000 when they go on sale, which is a 200% rise. The value will reach $150,000 at the $0.30 long-term prediction, which means a 1,400% return on investment. These sorts of performance won’t happen because of speculation; they will happen because institutions adopt Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s lending architecture and the steady income cycle that powers buybacks. Mechanics are made to draw in giants. Borrow limitations and limited collateralization make it harder for bad actors to manipulate liquidity pools, which means they won’t be destabilized. Reserve Factor rules and penalties for liquidation give lenders a safety net, which is the kind of assurance that institutions want. Buyback programs paid for by lending fees will keep demand rising, which will help the market price grow correctly without being hurt by too much selling pressure. Traders will also be able to make money straight via staking. For example, if a user locks $25,000 worth of mtTokens into smart contracts, they will get MUTM incentives on top of the interest that borrowers are already earning. At competitive reward rates, this can add up to thousands of dollars a year. Staking will also lower the amount of coins that are available and raise demand on the open market. Final words First and foremost are safety and trust. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is showing that it is ready to grow responsibly by getting good grades from a CertiK audit, offering bug bounties of up to $50,000, and giving away $100,000 to build the community. The strategy is focused on beta launch and exchange listings, which gives traders confidence that liquidity and adoption will follow. The market as a whole has been unstable, and a lot of retail investors are still confused about why crypto is down when more people are using it. Traders who know how the market works and keep an eye on the crypto fear and greed index know that the best time to make money is during presale phases and early re-ratings. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is meant to do well in both bullish and conservative markets because its concept is based on real revenue and institutional flows instead of just speculation. Phase 6 is already 40% sold, and if you wait, you’ll have to pay 15% more at Phase 7. For traders who want both short-term listing gains and the institutional upside that might raise ROI from 600% to 1,500%, this presale is the kind of move that big companies are already undertaking.

Analysts are now pointing to a new AI-powered altcoin, Ruvi AI (RUVI), as a prime candidate. With its presale gaining historic momentum and Phase 3 already nearing the 10% sold mark just days after launching, many are asking if this could be 2025’s fastest-growing altcoin. The excitement is backed by hard numbers that are difficult to ignore. The Ruvi AI presale is rapidly approaching the $3.6 million fundraising milestone, a testament to its powerful market appeal. A fast-growing global community of over 3,500 investors has already purchased more than 265 million RUVI tokens . This intense demand, especially at such an early stage, is a classic sign of a project set for a major breakout. A Modern Utility for Ethereum-Like Growth Ethereum’s initial explosion was driven by its revolutionary smart contract technology. Ruvi AI is built on a similar principle of game-changing utility, but it’s targeted at one of the most dynamic markets today: the $104 billion creator economy . This focus on a tangible, real-world application is what separates Ruvi AI from purely speculative projects and gives it a credible path to Ethereum-like growth. The project’s credibility is further enhanced by its commitment to security and transparency. Ruvi AI has successfully completed a comprehensive smart contract audit with CyberScope , assuring investors of the platform’s integrity. This crucial step, combined with a high-profile listing on CoinMarketCap , has established Ruvi AI as a legitimate, high-growth project attracting serious capital. The Super App Fueling the Forecast The engine behind the forecast of Ruvi AI becoming 2025’s fastest-growing altcoin is its revolutionary super app. This all-in-one ecosystem is engineered to become an essential tool for content creators, creating sustained, long-term demand for the RUVI token. Key features include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they become saturated, giving creators a crucial competitive edge. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, streamlining content production. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative process for maximum efficiency. Final Opportunity: A Guaranteed 40% Price Surge is Imminent The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token available at the highly attractive price of $0.020 . However, with the presale selling out at an astonishing rate, this ground-floor opportunity is vanishing quickly. According to the project’s official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to lock in a guaranteed paper gain. Strategic Partnership and High-Reward VIP Tiers Ruvi AI’s journey is further amplified by a strategic partnership with WEEX , a major cryptocurrency exchange. This collaboration will ensure deep liquidity and a seamless trading experience upon launch, paving the way for rapid price discovery and broad market adoption. For investors looking to position themselves for potentially life-changing returns, the project’s VIP program offers a clear path: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A competitive leaderboard giveaway also rewards top supporters, fostering a vibrant and engaged community that adds to the project’s unstoppable momentum. Is This the Next Ethereum? As the presale accelerates and a 40% price increase looms, the parallels to the early days of revolutionary projects are becoming clear. For investors seeking to get in on the ground floor of what could be 2025’s fastest-growing altcoin, all signs are pointing to Ruvi AI.

This plan, according to Financial Times, would make the UK the only major jurisdiction trying to lock users out of full access to stablecoins, at a time when both the US and EU are expanding regulatory clarity without placing hard limits. The move, if enforced, would set the UK apart in a way that critics say looks paranoid and counterproductive. Officials inside the BoE argue that caps are necessary to keep Britain’s banking system stable as crypto expands. They say too much money flowing into stablecoins could drain bank deposits, cut off credit, and cause a ripple effect across lending markets. Sasha Mills, who heads financial market infrastructure at the bank, said the idea is to prevent “large and rapid outflows of deposits” and limit the impact of new payment systems while they scale. But she also called the measure “transitional,” suggesting it might not be permanent, though there’s no actual timeline or plan to phase it out. Coinbase says caps are bad for savers and the City Tom Duff Gordon, Coinbase’s policy chief outside the US, said , “Imposing caps on stablecoins is bad for UK savers, bad for the City and bad for sterling.” He pointed out that no other major country, not even under Donald Trump’s renewed presidency, has tried anything like this. And it’s not just about ideology; crypto payments are already global, and Tom made it clear that these limits would slam the UK into a corner while the rest of the world moves on. Simon Jennings, who leads the UK Cryptoasset Business Council, added that enforcing the BoE’s idea would be a technical nightmare. “Limits simply don’t work in practice,” Simon said. “Stablecoin issuers don’t have sight of who holds their tokens at any given time, so enforcing caps would require a costly, complex new system, such as digital IDs or constant co-ordination between wallets.” He said it would be like trying to track who owns physical cash, and spending millions doing it. Riccardo Tordera-Ricchi, head of policy at The Payments Association, also rejected the proposal outright. “Just as there are no limits on cash, bank accounts, or e-money, there is no reason beyond scepticism to impose limits on stablecoin ownership,” Riccardo said. “This is a step in the wrong direction.” He said the plan would cause more harm than good, especially as stablecoins are already being used for fast, low-cost payments globally. UK Treasury pushes innovation, BoE resists The debate is triggering fresh tension between the BoE and the UK Treasury. Rachel Reeves, the UK’s new chancellor, wants to support the crypto industry and grow financial innovation. She said in her Mansion House speech that she would “drive forward developments in blockchain technology, including tokenised securities and stablecoins.” But Andrew Bailey, the BoE governor, blocked her from meeting regulators to push for a banking licence for Revolut, the country’s biggest fintech still waiting for approval. The BoE still plans to publish a formal consultation later this year to update its regulatory framework for stablecoins. But crypto groups say even calling for a cap already sends the wrong signal. It tells the global market that the UK sees crypto more as a threat than an opportunity. Meanwhile, the global stablecoin market has grown to $288 billion and counting. Most of that is US-dollar based. In July, the US Congress passed the Genius Act to regulate stablecoins and integrate them into the official financial system. Coinbase projects that market could reach $1.2 trillion by 2028. Gilles Chemla, professor at Imperial Business School and co-director of its financial tech research center, said stablecoins aren’t some early-stage tech anymore. “Stablecoins are no longer experimental technologies, they are becoming the foundation of the global digital economy.” Gilles warned that the UK is losing its advantage. “London has the talent, the markets, and the history to lead the digital economy, but the delay in implementing a regulatory framework for stablecoins is eroding that advantage.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",News|BOE|Coinbase|GPB,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-15 07:42:47

The Binance coin price prediction for 2028 projects a maximum price of $4,094.79 and a minimum price of $3,582.95. By 2031, BNB’s price could surge to $6,654.04 with broader acceptance in mainstream finance. After notable changes in its executive team, Binance has shown resilience and prospects for recovery. The departure of Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO, who was also embroiled in legal challenges, initially caused a decline in the value of Binance coin (BNB). Despite this initial setback, the cryptocurrency has shown a positive trend. In September 2020, Binance introduced BNB Smart Chain, which was initially designed for trading and transferring tokens and runs parallel to Binance Chain and What’s next for BNB in the remainder of 2025 and beyond?

According to an overall analysis, the altcoin gained 0.82 percent of its worth, as the coin is still trending in its higher price envelopes.

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The coin’s value has increased to $931.4 in the past 24 hours. If traders continue buying tokens, the BNB price might see a further jump, and the next target could be above its ATH of $943.08. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $6,654.04 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB found support, and the price moved toward $931.4, but it may find resistance as it’s near its ATH. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 0.82 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $1000? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $1000 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2027, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $6,654.04 by 2031. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice. Recent news/opinion on BNB BNB Chain said in a post that Clovis Pre-Deposit vaults are now live on its platform. Users will be able to lend and swap assets by bridging into one cross-chain liquidity layer. https://twitter.com/BNBCHAIN/status/1962712100767236336 BNB price predictions for September 2025 According to expert analysis, Binance coin could reach a maximum price of $896 in September 2025.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. Heading into September, BNB is trading at approximately $854.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-15 07:48:00

Avalanche (AVAX) just smashed through its $26 resistance level, surging to $30.44 and hitting seven-month highs that have analysts scrambling to update their price targets. But here’s what’s really interesting about this market cycle: While everyone celebrates AVAX’s 325% potential upside to $126 and Portal to Bitcoin’s revolutionary cross-chain capabilities keep gaining institutional attention, the smartest money is quietly positioning in something completely different. KIKICat sits at $0.0008 with a story that makes every other opportunity look ordinary by comparison. KIKI is built on 14 billion Giphy views and AI-powered content generation that creates engagement cycles most projects can only dream about. While others depend on external catalysts and celebrity endorsements, KIKI’s AI agents work around the clock building community and creating content autonomously. AVAX’s Technical Picture Couldn’t Be More Bullish The charts are screaming right now. Avalanche’s breakout above $26.50 resistance has triggered what technical analysts call a “continuation pattern,” the kind of setup that historically leads to explosive moves higher. Javon Marks is calling for $126.03, while other prominent traders see $34.50 as the immediate target before things get really interesting. The fundamentals are backing up the technicals perfectly. Avalanche processed 35.8 million C-Chain transactions in August alone, setting new records that prove this isn’t just speculation driving the price. $2.02 billion in Total Value Locked and $569.6 million in daily DEX volume show real economic activity happening on the network. Even better, regulatory clarity is accelerating adoption. $GUN became the first gaming token to receive EU MiCAR approval, proving that Avalanche can deliver both innovation and compliance. This opens doors to massive European markets that have been waiting for regulatory certainty before deploying serious capital. But here’s the mathematical reality that smart traders understand. AVAX needs to climb from $30 to $126 for that 325% gain. That requires billions in new institutional capital flowing into an already established ecosystem. Compare that to opportunities trading under $1M market cap where the same capital inflows create exponentially larger percentage returns. Portal to Bitcoin and SPX6900 Capture Different Audiences Portal to Bitcoin deserves serious respect for solving real problems in the cross-chain space. PTB’s mainnet launch on September 3rd enabled trust-minimized Bitcoin swaps across multiple Layer-2 networks, addressing the $1.3 billion Bitcoin DeFi market that’s been waiting for reliable infrastructure. Major exchanges like Binance and Kraken adding PTB support shows institutional confidence in the technology. SPX6900 is riding a completely different wave of momentum. Reddit communities are calling it “the meme coin with soul” because it distinguishes itself from typical pump-and-dump projects. Three consecutive days of trending on social media demonstrates the kind of organic community growth that creates lasting value rather than temporary hype. But neither project offers the unique combination of factors that creates life-changing wealth opportunities. PTB faces established DeFi competitors with deeper liquidity and longer track records. SPX6900 competes in an increasingly crowded meme coin space where differentiation becomes harder every day. KIKICat Represents Something Entirely Different KIKICat operates in a completely different paradigm that most traders haven’t fully grasped yet. Current price: $0.0007 with $800k market cap means you’re not competing with institutional whales or algorithmic trading systems. You’re getting ground-floor access to what could be the first truly successful AI-native meme coin before the concept becomes mainstream. The 14 billion Giphy view foundation isn’t just impressive numbers. It represents instant global brand recognition that most startups spend millions in marketing trying to achieve. Every smartphone user has encountered KIKI content without realizing they’re looking at the intellectual property backing a tradeable cryptocurrency. Here’s what makes KIKI genuinely revolutionary. Traditional meme coins require constant community management and external catalyst events to maintain engagement. KIKI’s AI agents process real-time community inputs to generate personalized content, evolving narratives, and collaborative experiences that keep users actively participating rather than passively holding. The timing convergence is perfect. AI content generation is becoming consumer expectation rather than novel feature. Community takeover narratives are accelerating across social platforms. Sub-$1M market caps with billion-view brand foundations represent maximum leverage opportunities before mainstream discovery. The window is closing faster than most realize. Missing this positioning phase means watching others capture the generational wealth as meme coin culture integrates with the ongoing AI narrative.

He pointed to the emergence of a strong parabolic curvature on the chart, which he described as an unprecedented structure with potentially historic implications for XRP. His chart highlighted the role of the nine-period exponential moving average and long-term trendlines that have supported the asset’s rise. In his assessment, Egrag stated that a close above $3.70 with a full-bodied candle on the two-month chart could serve as a decisive signal, indicating the beginning of a major upward phase for XRP. He also identified the $2.00 price level as a key benchmark. If the asset dips below that figure, he noted that it could resemble earlier phases of growth seen in other markets, comparing it to the time when Bitcoin was trading at $200. He suggested that those who accumulate at $2.00 could eventually be recognized as early adopters in a future valuation context. The chart he shared further included ranges labeled conservative, average, and optimistic, which outlined potential outcomes depending on how price action develops. These long-term targets were linked to the structural signals he sees in the market, with consecutive higher candles and a steep price curve reinforcing his thesis of a strong advance if the conditions he outlined are met. #XRP – Even The Most #Bullish #Bullls Are Not #Bullish Enough: Historical Patterns The two-month time frame chart shows five distinct body candles at new all-time highs (ATH).

He reiterated that his focus remains on a macro strategy, which he summarized as buying at low prices and selling at higher valuations. For those who are active traders, he suggested that it may be reasonable to allocate a smaller portion of holdings, such as 10 to 20 percent, for shorter-term trades. However, he emphasized that his own outlook centers on longer-term positioning rather than frequent trading. Egrag made clear that the price close above $3.70 is the condition he views as necessary for a significant new phase in XRP’s market performance . At the same time, he acknowledged the importance of the $2.00 level, presenting it as a threshold where risk and opportunity intersect.

Personal conviction and message to holders In his remarks, Egrag also reflected on his prior calls when XRP was trading under $1. He recalled that during that period, he consistently encouraged accumulation, despite facing criticism and dismissive responses from others in the market. He stated that his persistence comes from a determination to see his strategy through, regardless of the reactions of others. He concluded by addressing the XRP community directly, underscoring that trading success requires resilience and discipline. He encouraged holders to remain steady and committed to their strategies, while wishing them success in navigating the market. His overall message combined technical milestones, a clear long-term trading approach, and a personal account of persistence intended to reinforce confidence in his analysis.

Thị trường đang tràn đầy sự quan tâm khi nhiều tài sản kỹ thuật số cho thấy khả năng tăng trưởng đột phá. Các nhà đầu tư tập trung vào những token có tiềm năng mang lại lợi nhuận vượt trội, đặc biệt là những đồng coin đang được dự đoán sẽ có bước tiến mạnh mẽ. Nhiều người tin rằng đây có thể là cơ hội vàng tiếp theo trong thế giới crypto. Trong số những token đầy hứa hẹn này có Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), SEI, APT, XRP – một meme coin tiên phong kết nối người hâm mộ bóng đá, bóng rổ, MMA và nhiều môn thể thao khác trong một hệ sinh thái sôi động. Phân tích dưới đây cung cấp cái nhìn sâu hơn về những dự án này và lý giải vì sao chúng có thể tăng trưởng tới 5.000% trong những tháng tới. Bitcoin Hyper: Đưa Bitcoin lên tầm cao mới Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) không chỉ là một meme coin khác – đây là giải pháp Layer 2 mở rộng cho mạng Bitcoin được xây dựng trên Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Với tốc độ giao dịch cực nhanh, phí thấp và khả năng tương tác mạnh mẽ, HYPER hướng tới việc khai phá toàn bộ tiềm năng của Bitcoin như một blockchain hiệu suất cao. Dự án đã thu hút được sự quan tâm lớn ngay từ giai đoạn presale , huy động hàng triệu USD trong thời gian ngắn. Các nhà phân tích dự đoán vị thế độc đáo của HYPER – kết hợp sự bảo mật của Bitcoin với tốc độ của Solana – có thể giúp đồng coin này đạt mức tăng trưởng bùng nổ. Với kỳ vọng lợi nhuận lên tới 5.000% trong chu kỳ sắp tới, Bitcoin Hyper nổi bật như một trong những token đầy tham vọng và đổi mới nhất năm 2025. Làm chủ blockchain, mở rộng Bitcoin chưa từng có Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) đang nổi lên như một trong những dự án sáng tạo nhất trong thị trường crypto – một giải pháp Layer 2 mạnh mẽ kết hợp sự bảo mật của Bitcoin với tốc độ của Solana. Thay vì chỉ chạy theo xu hướng, HYPER mang đến giá trị thực: giao dịch siêu nhanh, phí thấp và khả năng tương tác liền mạch. Hãy nhớ lại cách Ethereum phát triển mạnh mẽ nhờ các Layer 2 rollup – Bitcoin Hyper đặt mục tiêu làm điều tương tự cho Bitcoin, nhưng với hiệu suất SVM có thể xử lý hàng nghìn giao dịch mỗi giây. Với tiềm năng hàng tỷ USD khối lượng giao dịch chảy qua hệ sinh thái Bitcoin, HYPER có cơ hội nắm bắt giá trị khổng lồ. Hiện tại, HYPER vẫn đang bị định giá thấp và ở giai đoạn presale, mang lại cho các nhà đầu tư sớm cơ hội hiếm có để tham gia trước khi được niêm yết trên các sàn lớn. Các nhà phân tích tin rằng khi mức độ chấp nhận tăng, những người mua trong presale có thể đạt được lợi nhuận thay đổi cuộc đời trong đợt bull run sắp tới. PEPE (PEPE) PEPE là một memecoin giảm phát đã trở thành hiện tượng toàn cầu trong thế giới tiền điện tử. Được ra mắt trên mạng Ethereum như một lời tri ân đến meme Pepe the Frog của Matt Furie, PEPE khai thác sự hài hước và tính lan truyền của văn hóa internet. Với chính sách không thuế và mô hình đơn giản, PEPE nhanh chóng thu hút sự chú ý của cả những người yêu thích meme và các nhà giao dịch. Vào tháng 4 và tháng 5 năm 2023, vốn hóa thị trường của PEPE đã bùng nổ lên 1,6 tỷ USD, biến nhiều nhà đầu tư ban đầu thành triệu phú. Sự tăng trưởng này đã khởi động một “mùa memecoin”, khi thị trường tràn ngập các loại tiền điện tử mới dựa trên meme tìm cách tận dụng làn sóng này. PEPE hiện đặt mục tiêu gia nhập hàng ngũ những đồng memecoin hàng đầu như Dogecoin và Shiba Inu. Lộ trình của nó bao gồm niêm yết trên các sàn giao dịch lớn và chiến dịch “meme takeover” táo bạo nhằm củng cố vị trí trong lịch sử crypto. Dù không có tính ứng dụng truyền thống, sức mạnh của PEPE nằm ở cộng đồng và khả năng lan truyền. Với kỳ vọng bull run sắp tới sau đợt halving của Bitcoin, PEPE vẫn là một lựa chọn hấp dẫn cho những ai chấp nhận rủi ro cao để tìm kiếm lợi nhuận lớn. Sei (SEI) Trong môi trường blockchain năng động, Sei nổi bật như một nhà đổi mới. Đây là blockchain Layer 1 đầu tiên được phát triển dành riêng cho giao dịch, mang lại lợi thế vượt trội cho các sàn giao dịch. Sei có khả năng xử lý khối lượng lệnh khổng lồ mỗi giây, với thời gian hoàn tất giao dịch chỉ 380 mili giây – gần như tức thì. Được hậu thuẫn bởi các tổ chức lớn và tập trung mạnh mẽ vào bảo mật, Sei mang đến sự kết hợp hoàn hảo giữa tốc độ và độ tin cậy. Trên thị trường hiện tại, tiềm năng tăng trưởng của Sei đang ngày càng thu hút sự chú ý. Theo ước tính, giá của nó có thể tăng tới 323,76% vào năm 2030. Không giống như nhiều blockchain nhắm tới ứng dụng chung, Sei được thiết kế đặc biệt để phục vụ nhu cầu giao dịch. Với sự phát triển của DeFi và nhu cầu ngày càng tăng đối với các giao dịch nhanh chóng, an toàn, công nghệ của Sei có thể biến nó thành một trong những lựa chọn nổi bật trong giai đoạn tiếp theo của thị trường crypto. Aptos (APT) Aptos, thường được gọi là “Solana Killer”, đã xuất hiện như một đối thủ mới trên sân khấu blockchain. Sứ mệnh của nó là cung cấp một blockchain nhanh hơn, rẻ hơn và đáng tin cậy hơn, giải quyết các vấn đề về phí giao dịch cao và tắc nghẽn mạng mà Ethereum và các dự án khác từng gặp phải. Đứng sau Aptos là Aptos Labs, được thành lập bởi những thành viên cũ của dự án Diem của Meta. Blockchain này sử dụng cơ chế proof-of-stake và giới thiệu ngôn ngữ lập trình mới mang tên Move, được thiết kế linh hoạt và an toàn cho việc phát triển hợp đồng thông minh và ứng dụng Web3. Điều khiến Aptos nổi bật trong thị trường crypto đông đúc là sự tập trung vào khả năng mở rộng và tốc độ. Chính những yếu tố này có thể giúp nó vượt qua Solana và Ethereum. Trong chu kỳ thị trường hiện tại, nơi đổi mới là chìa khóa thành công, Aptos mang đến một khởi đầu mới đầy hứa hẹn. Tuy nhiên, giống như bất kỳ đồng coin mới nào, hiệu suất dài hạn vẫn là yếu tố mà nhà đầu tư cần theo dõi chặt chẽ. XRP (XRP) XRP là một loại tiền kỹ thuật số được thiết kế để giúp thanh toán toàn cầu trở nên nhanh chóng và tiết kiệm hơn. Nó vận hành trên XRP Ledger – một hệ thống phi tập trung không có cơ quan trung ương, đảm bảo các giao dịch an toàn, không thể đảo ngược và không cần tài khoản ngân hàng. XRP được tạo ra bởi Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto và David Schwartz, với nguồn cung ban đầu 100 tỷ token, trong đó 80 tỷ được tặng cho Ripple để mở rộng mạng lưới. Ripple sử dụng XRP để tăng tính thanh khoản và quản lý việc phát hành thông qua cơ chế ký quỹ (escrow). Ngày nay, XRP có lợi thế rõ rệt so với Bitcoin và Ethereum nhờ tốc độ và chi phí giao dịch thấp. Sự tập trung vào thanh toán xuyên biên giới khiến nó trở thành lựa chọn hấp dẫn cho các giao dịch quốc tế. Với nhu cầu ngày càng tăng đối với các giải pháp thanh toán nhanh chóng và tiết kiệm, XRP có vị trí đặc biệt trong ngành crypto, mặc dù các yếu tố pháp lý sẽ có ảnh hưởng lớn đến tương lai của nó. Kết luận Trong khi Bitcoin vẫn đang tìm cách chinh phục mốc quan trọng 70.000 USD, PEPE, Sei, Aptos và XRP thu hút sự chú ý của các nhà đầu tư nhờ các giải pháp hiệu quả và cộng đồng mạnh mẽ. XYZVerse (XYZ) nổi bật như một memecoin đầy tham vọng với tiềm năng tăng trưởng bùng nổ, mang đến một hệ sinh thái thể thao – meme chưa từng có. Ngoài ra, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) xứng đáng có một vị trí đặc biệt trong phân tích – như một giải pháp Layer 2 kết hợp sự bảo mật của Bitcoin với tốc độ của Solana. Nhờ ứng dụng công nghệ Solana Virtual Machine tiên tiến, HYPER mang lại giao dịch nhanh, chi phí thấp và được định vị như một dự án có tiềm năng to lớn. Kết hợp với sự quan tâm ngày càng tăng trong giai đoạn presale và kỳ vọng niêm yết trên các sàn lớn, Bitcoin Hyper có thể trở thành một trong những người chiến thắng quan trọng nhất trong đợt bull run sắp tới.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|PEPE|XRP|APT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-15 07:56:14

This currency, originally created for entertainment, has now become the cornerstone of financial freedom for many. A Dogecoin ETF will be another significant breakthrough for crypto assets in traditional financial markets, following the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. GoldenMining , the best Dogecoin mining website for 2025, has launched an advanced AI-powered cloud mining system, providing users with a seamless way to earn daily cryptocurrency returns without owning hardware or managing technical infrastructure. This article will explore how to earn $15,000 per day using Dogecoin cloud mining. What is Dogecoin cloud mining? Dogecoin cloud mining refers to the process by which cloud mining providers earn new Dogecoin rewards by reviewing transactions on the Dogecoin blockchain. While seemingly simple, it’s actually quite complex! Cloud mining providers process the same batch of transactions simultaneously across multiple computers, but only one computer receives the new token reward. The way to obtain new tokens is that nodes add new transaction blocks to old blocks. This is achieved through complex mathematical equations. The node that solves the math problem first wins! It can then append its newly confirmed block of transactions to the rest of the blockchain. Most crypto mining works this way. However, Dogecoin mining differs from other currencies in some important ways. These include: Algorithm: Each crypto has a set of rules for mining new coins. These rules are called a mining algorithm or hashing algorithm. Block time: This is the average time it takes to check a new block of transactions and add it to the blockchain. Difficulty: This number indicates how difficult it is to mine each new block for that currency. Mining difficulty fluctuates based on the number of miners. The currency’s protocol also adjusts the difficulty to ensure that block time remains constant. Reward: This is the reward a miner receives for each new block they mine. How to Cloud Mine Dogecoin Step 1: Select a cloud mining service provider, GoldenMining . In rare cases, the platform has a professional analyst and IT team who analyze the hashrate generated by miners and replace them with the latest mining machines, ensuring higher returns from cloud mining.

51754370,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=821576,1757923257,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/51754370.jpeg,December 2024 Crypto Crash Signal Returns As Altcoins Go Wild,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/december-2024-crypto-crash-signal-returns/,"Crypto analyst Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) warned on September 14 that a familiar—and historically unfriendly—market pattern has reappeared: speculative leverage pouring into altcoins while Bitcoin’s derivatives positioning stays conspicuously muted. “History doesn’t repeat, but it often rhymes, and right now a major warning signal is flashing,” he said, stressing that his message is not to incite panic but to flag a shift in market climate that “any smart investor” should not ignore. At the core of Maartunn’s diagnosis is open interest, the notional value of active futures and perpetual positions across venues. “We keep throwing around this term, open interest. What is it? Well, to put it simply, it’s a way to measure the total amount of money and active bets in the market. When open interest rises, it means new money, often speculative money, is coming in,” he explained. Crypto’s ‘Musical Chairs’ Moment In his read, altcoin open interest is “through the roof,” while Bitcoin—“the anchor of the whole market”—is flat. The divergence, he argued, is precisely what preceded the late-2024 drawdown. “Altcoin speculation is heating up — the gap between BTC and Altcoin Open Interest just hit a new high,” Maartuun wrote via X. Maartunn anchored his warning in a recent analogue. “Back in December of 2024, the exact same story played out. Altcoin speculation was running wild, while Bitcoin was just stagnating. And the result? It wasn’t pretty.” The immediate aftermath, he recalled, was a sharp, broad-based markdown and then a tedious consolidation. Related Reading: Crypto Faces Liquidity Endgame—Debt And Inflation Risks Mount By 2026 “We’re talking [about] a 30% drop,” he said of Bitcoin’s move, adding that such declines “don’t happen in a vacuum.” Liquidity retreats to safety, correlations rise, and “those high-flying, speculative altcoins… get hit the hardest.” What followed was “three whole months” of rangebound “chop modus,” a period that historically bleeds momentum strategies and punishes late-cycle leverage. To illustrate how leverage-heavy phases can abruptly unravel, he leaned on a metaphor. “It’s a high-stakes game of musical chairs,” he said. As long as flows are positive, “the party’s in full swing, and everyone feels like a genius.” The structural risk emerges at the moment “the music stops”—an adverse headline, an exogenous macro shock, or simply fatigued bid depth. “Everyone makes a mad dash for a chair, for safety. But in a panic, there just aren’t enough chairs for everybody, and someone always gets left holding the bag.” In crypto’s derivatives-driven microstructure, that dash translates into forceful de-risking and liquidations that can cascade across thin order books. Related Reading: Kraken Co-CEO And Barry Silbert Warn Of Crypto Bubble; 99% Tokens Could Tank Crucially, Maartunn framed his assessment as situational risk—not a deterministic crash call. “This isn’t about predicting a crash or trying to cause a panic, not at all,” he said at the outset. The point, rather, is to recognize that the “growing split in the market” between exuberant altcoin leverage and a subdued Bitcoin base “can’t last forever.” “The level of risk in the market has clearly gone up,” he concluded. “The music is absolutely still playing, but it’s probably a good time to know where the emergency exits are.” The open question is the one he leaves viewers with: whether this is merely “the market… enjoying the music before another painful dip,” as in December 2024, or whether “this time really [is] different.” In either case, Maartunn’s thesis hinges on the same observable setup: a momentum-chasing build-up of altcoin derivatives exposure with no confirming expansion in Bitcoin’s positioning. If the past is a guide, the divergence is less a timing tool than a warning label on the current phase of the cycle—one that tends to end not when everyone expects it, but when liquidity blinks. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood $4.0 trillion.

After the token rallied, the whale started distributing tokens to other exchanges. Ahead of the weekend, a whale made one of the biggest consolidation purchases of PEPE through Kraken. The whale withdrew and stored 1.52T PEPE, sparking speculation of another price cycle and even an all-time peak for the meme. The whale wallet was later identified as Auros Global , following the initial speculations about institutional involvement. The whale injected $16M into the PEPE market, potentially reviving the coin just as the altcoin market was entering its hottest phase. Auros Global built one of the significant PEPE wallets, and started distributing tokens to multiple exchanges, also sending funds to Swiss Borg. | Source: Bubblemaps . Based on Bubblemaps data, Auros Global holds 0.78% of the PEPE supply, and is ranked 19th among top wallets. The Auros wallet also sent PEPE to the Swiss Borg hot wallet, despite the exchange suffering an exploit in the past week. Currently, PEPE is not showing any high-velocity trading, and the Auros wallet is not part of a cluster. PEPE whale buyer starts moving coins On Monday, the whale buyer started moving coins, some of them deposited back to Kraken. Deposits were made to Binance as well, and some of the coins were sent to intermediary addresses. Auros Global is an algorithmic trading firm, and the recent PEPE movements may be linked to its market-making activity. The spreading of PEPE to multiple exchanges may be in preparation for more active trading, suggesting a season of increased volatility for the meme. PEPE was trading at $0.000011, up over 16% in the past week. However, over the past days, the token saw some drawdowns. In 2025, PEPE mostly had short-lived rallies, and is yet to recover to its all-time peak from December 2024. As Cryptopolitan recently reported , altcoin season is in full swing, with the main index at 82. Demand for altcoins may affect all assets that are seen as undervalued. PEPE is still trading below its local highs, suggesting another rally may be coming. PEPE long and short positions relatively balanced PEPE’s open interest rose to $105M, a level not seen since December 2024. Most of the activity is happening on OKX, with 95% of the volumes concentrated on the exchange. On Hyperliquid, the PEPE market remains relatively small. A total of 20 whales have set up positions trading kPEPE, representing 1,000 tokens. The whale positions are balanced, with exactly 50% of the whales going long or short. The biggest PEPE short position is for $15.60M, while the most significant long position has a notional value of $16.8M. Historically, PEPE has performed the best in September, though the bull season at the end of 2024 was unique for crypto exuberance. Despite this, PEPE can still deliver 100% rallies and has short-term seasons within the span of a month. The recent movement of coins by a market maker may be a sign of increased trading activity across multiple markets. On DEX spot markets, sellers outnumber buyers, as even a small rally is seen as an opportunity to cash out. At the same time, whale purchases have been noticed, accumulating PEPE in the case of an eventual breakout.

Interest is rising around the question of whether Pepe Coin can match this level of excitement and investment. The answer could reshape what comes next for both projects, sparking new debates about which token might become the next big hit. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $15 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.005. At the next 14th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.01, meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits PEPE: The Frog Coin Hopping Toward Meme Crown PEPE is a frog-themed coin on Ethereum. It is deflationary, so the supply slowly shrinks. The token salutes Pepe the Frog, an online legend born in the early 2000s. In April 2023 its value shot to $1.6 billion, making early buyers rich and sparking a wave of copycat coins. Unlike Dogecoin or Shiba Inu, PEPE has no tax and no grand plan. That stark honesty attracts traders who just want a pure meme play. The roadmap is simple: trend on social media, win more exchange listings, then try a full “meme takeover.” If the market turns bullish after the next Bitcoin halving, a tight supply and a loud fan base could push PEPE higher. Yet memecoins move fast both up and down, so only time will tell if the frog lands on a lily pad or leaps even further. Conclusion PEPE shows strength, yet XYZVerse (XYZ), the first all-sport memecoin, blends memes with football, basketball and esports, offers community control, and eyes 20,000% gains, hinting at momentum this bull run.

Mặc dù chưa thể vượt qua cột mốc 100.000 USD, nhưng lập trường thân thiện với crypto của Tổng thống đắc cử Donald Trump sau cuộc tái đắc cử ngày 5/11 đã tạo ra tâm lý lạc quan trên thị trường. Các tập đoàn lớn tại Mỹ đã gia tăng đầu tư vào Bitcoin, thúc đẩy sự bùng nổ giá trị của các token liên quan đến tiền điện tử. Trong số những dự án nổi bật nhất là Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) và MaxiDoge ($MAXI) – cả hai đều mang đến cơ hội hấp dẫn cho nhà đầu tư muốn tận dụng sự tăng trưởng của Bitcoin. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): Đột phá Layer-2 Bitcoin Hyper là một trong những dự án mới đáng chú ý trong hệ sinh thái Bitcoin. Với vai trò là giải pháp Layer-2, dự án sử dụng Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) để mang lại giao dịch nhanh hơn, chi phí rẻ hơn, khả năng mở rộng và tích hợp DeFi. Hiện tại, Bitcoin Hyper đang trong giai đoạn presale , thu hút sự chú ý lớn từ giới đầu tư. Token $HYPER có giá bán khởi điểm khoảng 0,012375 USD, với tổng cung giới hạn ở mức 21 tỷ token – yếu tố mang lại tính khan hiếm. Chiến lược của dự án là xây dựng một hệ sinh thái tương thích với Bitcoin, nhưng có thêm chức năng smart contract và DeFi. Nếu Bitcoin tiếp tục tăng trưởng và các giải pháp Layer-2 được áp dụng rộng rãi, $HYPER có thể hưởng lợi như một “đòn bẩy” cho mạng lưới BTC. Một số dự báo cho rằng giá có thể đạt 0,05–0,06 USD vào cuối năm 2025 nếu roadmap được triển khai đúng tiến độ. MaxiDoge (MAXI): Meme token với tiềm năng bùng nổ MaxiDoge ($MAXI) kết hợp văn hóa meme với tokenomics rõ ràng hơn. Ra mắt trên mạng Ethereum, token này có giá bán presale khởi điểm ở mức 0,00025 USD với tổng cung 150,24 tỷ token. Presale diễn ra từ tháng 7 đến tháng 10/2025, thu hút nhà đầu tư nhờ các cuộc kiểm toán từ Coinsult và SolidProof, xác nhận không có chức năng “mint” ẩn hay blacklist. Mục tiêu của dự án là huy động hơn 15 triệu USD cho phát triển hệ sinh thái, marketing và phần thưởng staking. Không giống như mô hình khai thác hay tích trữ Bitcoin của các công ty truyền thống, MaxiDoge dựa vào cộng đồng và hiệu ứng lan truyền, tương tự như Dogecoin hay Shiba Inu thời kỳ đầu. Điều này khiến nó trở thành một khoản đầu tư rủi ro cao, nhưng cũng có thể mang lại lợi nhuận đột biến khi thị trường hưng phấn. Kết luận Khi Bitcoin tiến gần mốc 100.000 USD và bối cảnh pháp lý dần thuận lợi hơn, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) và MaxiDoge ($MAXI) trở thành hai cơ hội đầu tư khác biệt nhưng đầy hứa hẹn: Bitcoin Hyper mang đến giá trị công nghệ dài hạn nhờ Layer-2 và khả năng mở rộng. MaxiDoge tận dụng sức mạnh cộng đồng và văn hóa meme, tạo ra tiềm năng tăng trưởng nhanh. Cả hai đều tiềm ẩn rủi ro cao, nhưng đồng thời mở ra cơ hội sinh lời lớn cho nhà đầu tư sẵn sàng tham gia vào thị trường tài sản số đầy biến động trong năm 2025.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|SHIB|DOGE|ETH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-15 08:09:18

This innovative move signals a new era for how digital assets are managed and traded, promising enhanced efficiency and accessibility across the market. For anyone tracking the convergence of traditional finance and cutting-edge technology, this is a pivotal moment. What is the LSEG Blockchain Platform and How Does it Work? LSEG’s new venture is named the Digital Market Infrastructure (DMI). This sophisticated LSEG blockchain platform is specifically designed to revolutionize the entire lifecycle of private funds. It covers everything from the initial issuance of digital assets to their tokenization and eventual settlement. The DMI provides a comprehensive solution aimed at streamlining complex processes that have traditionally been manual, time-consuming, and often opaque. This ambitious initiative is built on a foundation of strong collaboration. Notably, LSEG partnered with tech giant Microsoft, which provides robust infrastructure support, ensuring scalability and security for the DMI. Furthermore, two key players in the digital asset space, UK-based cryptocurrency exchange Archax and asset manager MembersCap, have already joined as the platform’s inaugural clients. Their early adoption highlights the industry’s confidence in the transformative potential of the LSEG blockchain platform . Why is DMI a Game-Changer for Private Funds? So, what exactly does this mean for the private funds sector? The introduction of the Digital Market Infrastructure brings a host of compelling benefits that could fundamentally redefine how private investments are managed and accessed: Enhanced Efficiency: The platform automates many of the manual processes involved in private fund management. This drastically reduces operational overheads, minimizes human error, and accelerates processing times for transactions and record-keeping. Increased Transparency: Blockchain’s inherent immutability provides an unparalleled level of transparency. All participants gain access to a clear, verifiable, and tamper-proof record of transactions, fostering greater trust and accountability. Greater Accessibility: Tokenization, a core feature of the DMI, allows for the fractional ownership of traditionally large and illiquid assets. This innovation has the potential to open private funds to a much broader investor base, democratizing access to exclusive investment opportunities. Improved Liquidity: By creating digital representations of traditionally illiquid assets, the platform aims to enhance their tradability. This can lead to improved liquidity in secondary markets, offering investors more flexibility and exit strategies. This strategic shift towards digital infrastructure is not merely about adopting new technology; it’s about cultivating a more agile, transparent, and inclusive financial ecosystem for private investments globally. Navigating the Digital Future: Challenges and Opportunities for the LSEG Blockchain Platform While the prospects are undoubtedly exciting, the journey of any pioneering technology involves both significant opportunities and potential hurdles. The LSEG blockchain platform opens up immense avenues for financial innovation, enabling the creation of new types of investment products and more dynamic capital formation models. It could truly set a new global standard for how private capital is raised and managed. However, potential challenges include navigating the rapidly evolving regulatory landscapes across different jurisdictions. Ensuring widespread adoption among a diverse range of market participants, from institutional investors to smaller fund managers, will also be crucial. Building trust and educating the market about the robust benefits and stringent security protocols of blockchain technology will be paramount for the DMI’s long-term success. Furthermore, establishing clear legal frameworks and maintaining top-tier cybersecurity measures will be ongoing priorities. What’s Next for LSEG’s Digital Market Infrastructure? The launch of the Digital Market Infrastructure is just the initial step in a much larger vision. As more clients onboard and the platform continues to evolve, it possesses the potential to become a cornerstone of the global digital finance landscape. LSEG’s proactive move demonstrates a clear commitment to embracing technological innovation and strategically positioning London at the forefront of digital asset evolution. This significant initiative could inspire other traditional financial institutions to explore and implement similar blockchain-based solutions, thereby accelerating the digital transformation of finance on a global scale. Summary: A New Horizon for Private Investments The London Stock Exchange Group’s launch of its LSEG blockchain platform marks a truly pivotal moment for private funds. By skillfully leveraging blockchain technology for digital asset issuance, tokenization, and settlement, LSEG is actively paving the way for a more efficient, transparent, and accessible future for private investments. With strong collaborations and enthusiastic early client adoption, the DMI is poised to revolutionize how capital is managed in this exciting new digital age. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Digital Market Infrastructure (DMI)? The Digital Market Infrastructure (DMI) is LSEG’s new blockchain platform designed to facilitate digital asset issuance, tokenization, and settlement specifically for private funds. It aims to streamline and enhance the efficiency of private market transactions. 2. How does blockchain technology benefit private funds through DMI? Blockchain technology in DMI offers benefits such as increased efficiency through automation, enhanced transparency with immutable records, greater accessibility for investors through fractional ownership (tokenization), and improved liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets. 3.

This move would mean lower token production and increased scarcity. Polkadot Caps DOT Supply at 2.1 Billion According to the DAO's announcement, referendum 1710 passed with 81% of the vote. The new model introduces a two-year token inflation schedule, abandoning the current unlimited supply model. The previous system produced approximately 120 million DOT annually and had no supply cap. According to Polkadot's post, supply will be around 1.91 billion DOT by 2040 under the new model. Had the old model continued, that figure was expected to reach 3.4 billion DOT. Thanks to the OpenGov system, which Polkadot DAO launched in 2023, token holders can directly submit suggestions, vote, or delegate their voting rights. Following the decision, the price of DOT fell 2.4% to $4.24 in the last 24 hours, but rose 9.8% in the last week. The token's total market capitalization stands at $6.6 billion. *This is not investment advice.

The whale previously executed one of the largest Bitcoin-to-Ethereum rotations in crypto history, trading 35,991 BTC valued at $4.04 billion for 886,371 ETH worth $4.07 billion. Since Aug 20, the Bitcoin OG has sold 35,991 $BTC ($4.04B) and bought 886,371 $ETH ($4.07B) at a 0.0406 rate on #Hyperliquid . He still holds 49,634 $BTC ($5.43B) in 4 wallets. pic.twitter.com/ns7T1zMtAO — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 1, 2025 The renewed selling activity comes as BTC Inc CEO David Bailey claimed earlier this month that two massive whales prevented the cryptocurrency from reaching $150,000, with one whale eliminated and another halfway through liquidations. Multiple dormant Bitcoin addresses from 2011-2012 have awakened recently, creating selling pressure that contributed to Bitcoin’s struggle to maintain momentum above previous highs. The whale’s ETH-BTC arbitrage position currently faces losses of approximately 460 BTC worth $53 million if reversed, as the ETH/BTC ratio has remained below 0.05 since July 2024. Despite Ethereum’s 155% rally since July and new all-time highs near $4,957, the ratio peaked at 0.14 in 2017 and currently sits around 0.0401 – 0.0403. Source: CoinMarketCap Mystery Whales are Executing Strategic Portfolio Rotations – But Why? The Bitcoin OG’s selling strategy involves systematic liquidations across multiple wallets while maintaining substantial reserves. Lookonchain data reveals the whale still controls 49,634 BTC worth $5.43 billion distributed across four separate addresses following the latest $136 million deposit. After a two-week break, the #BitcoinOG who exchanged 35,991 $BTC ($4.04B) for 886,371 $ETH ($4.07B) is back to selling $BTC ! 2 wallets linked to this #BitcoinOG have deposited 1,176 $BTC ($136.2M) to Hyperliquid in the past 2 hours and started dumping. https://t.co/LTiJHW049j pic.twitter.com/L0m2bEG1J7 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 14, 2025 Previous whale activity has shown sophisticated market timing, with one holder selling 24,000 BTC worth $2.7 billion in coordinated transactions that drove Bitcoin from $115,000 to $111,000 within hours. The sudden liquidation occurred during weekend trading, when thinner volumes amplify the price impacts of large transactions. Another early adopter rotated 400 BTC in August, worth approximately $45.5 million, into leveraged Ethereum positions using 3x and 10x leverage across four wallets. The whale opened combined long positions totaling 68,130 ETH worth $295 million, bridging funds back to the Ethereum mainnet after executing spot market swaps. Dormant wallet activations accelerated throughout September, with addresses inactive since 2011-2013 transferring Bitcoin to exchanges, including Kraken. One wallet holding 445 BTC made its first transaction in nearly 13 years, while another containing 480 BTC moved funds for the first time since 2012. David Bailey’s whale elimination theory suggests coordinated selling at specific price levels, with “one for 80k bitcoin and the other for 120k bitcoin.” Market analysis indicates the first whale completed massive liquidations while the second continues rotating substantial positions into altcoins. @DavidFBailey says Bitcoin needs to slay two massive whales before $150K as mystery holders dump billions. #Bitcoin #Whales https://t.co/bmtfWK4EUZ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 2, 2025 Technical Breakdown Indicates Deeper Correction Risks Bitcoin faces mounting technical challenges as whale selling coincides with bearish momentum indicators across multiple timeframes. The 50-day exponential moving average at 113,465 now acts as resistance, while MACD signals turned negative with bearish crossovers confirming trend deterioration. Source: TradingView September saw US spot Bitcoin ETFs record their first weekly outflows since June, with $126.64 million in net redemptions during August compared to $6 billion inflows in July. The reversal ended a six-week streak of consistent institutional accumulation as momentum shifted toward Ethereum products. Ethereum ETFs significantly outperformed Bitcoin funds, attracting nearly $4 billion in August inflows while Bitcoin products recorded $622.5 million in net outflows. September historically represents Bitcoin’s weakest month, delivering average losses of 3.77% during bull market years and earning the “Rektember” nickname among traders. Bitcoin closed August at $109,000, marking a 6% monthly decline despite reaching all-time highs above $124,000 earlier in the cycle. So far, after rising from $111,000 last week to above $115,000, Bitcoin has not been able to break the $116,000 resistance, and this whale activity can impact sentiment even more negatively. According to the last Bitfinex Alpha , Bitcoin is holding precisely steady between $108,000 and $112,000, with buyers actively defending key support zones while filling the gap created by July’s sharp rally. However, the exchange acknowledged that the risk of a deeper correction remains, and consolidation appears to be the more likely outcome. September has historically marked a cyclical low for Bitcoin, setting the stage for a stronger Q4 performance. Amid all these, institutional accumulation persists despite retail liquidations, as corporate Bitcoin holdings have surged above $200 billion across 190 entities. In fact, according to a Cryptonew report covered earlier this month, businesses across major industries have purchased 1,755 Bitcoin daily (worth $195.2 million), contributing over $1.3 trillion to Bitcoin’s market cap during the past 20 months alone.
