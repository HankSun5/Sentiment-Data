This ratio measures Ethereum’s value relative to Bitcoin, offering insights into which of these crypto giants is currently outperforming the other. Recently, however, this crucial indicator has faced significant headwinds. Despite a wave of institutional interest in Ethereum and ETH itself reaching impressive new all-time highs, the ETH/BTC ratio has notably failed to reclaim the critical 0.05 level. This persistent struggle raises important questions for investors and market watchers alike. What exactly is holding Ethereum back from truly breaking free of Bitcoin’s gravitational pull? Understanding the ETH/BTC Ratio: A Key Metric for Investors The ETH/BTC ratio is more than just a number; it’s a barometer for market sentiment and capital flow between the two largest cryptocurrencies. When the ratio rises, it suggests that capital is flowing from Bitcoin into Ethereum, indicating stronger confidence or higher growth expectations for ETH. Conversely, a falling ratio often points to Bitcoin’s relative strength or a broader market shift towards the perceived safety of BTC. Understanding this dynamic is vital for anyone navigating the crypto space. It helps investors gauge potential shifts in market leadership and adjust their portfolios accordingly. Historical Performance: Why Has the ETH/BTC Ratio Faced Resistance? Looking back at history provides crucial context for the current performance of the ETH/BTC ratio . On-chain analyst James Check highlighted that Ethereum has only outperformed Bitcoin during roughly 15% of its existence. Its most significant bull runs, where ETH truly shone, occurred between 2015 and 2017. This period was characterized by groundbreaking innovations like the introduction of smart contracts and the explosive ICO boom, which were unique to Ethereum at the time. However, since 2020, Bitcoin has largely maintained a relative advantage. This suggests that while Ethereum brings innovation, Bitcoin often retains its position as the market’s primary store of value and first mover. The recent struggle below 0.05 continues this trend, even as Ethereum’s ecosystem expands. The Paradox of Institutional Interest: What’s Holding ETH Back? It seems counterintuitive, doesn’t it? Ethereum is attracting substantial institutional interest, with new investment products and corporate adoption on the rise. Yet, the ETH/BTC ratio remains stubbornly below 0.05. This paradox can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, institutional capital often prioritizes established assets with clear regulatory pathways, and Bitcoin, as the pioneer, still holds an edge in this regard. Secondly, while institutional demand for ETH is growing, it might not yet be strong enough to consistently outpace Bitcoin’s broader market dominance or absorb profit-taking pressure. Moreover, the sheer size and liquidity of Bitcoin’s market mean it can often absorb large inflows without significant price impact on the ratio, while Ethereum’s movements are more reactive. Expert Outlook: What’s Next for the ETH/BTC Ratio? So, what does the future hold for the ETH/BTC ratio ? Analysts offer mixed perspectives. Jake Kennish from Nansen, a crypto data analytics firm, predicted that Ethereum might be due for a short-term correction. As ETH hovers near its previous all-time highs, some consolidation is natural before a potential new peak. He suggested it could take several weeks or even months for Ethereum to establish a truly new price ceiling and, consequently, influence the ratio more significantly. Investors should watch for catalysts such as major Ethereum network upgrades (like the upcoming Dencun or future Pectra upgrades), which could inject new life and utility into the ecosystem, potentially boosting the ETH/BTC ratio . Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Investors For investors, understanding the current state of the ETH/BTC ratio offers valuable insights. Diversify Wisely: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. While Ethereum has immense potential, Bitcoin’s stability often provides a foundational layer for crypto portfolios. Monitor Key Events: Keep an eye on Ethereum’s development roadmap, especially major upgrades. These can be significant catalysts for price action and ratio shifts. Analyze Market Sentiment: Understand whether the broader market is in a “risk-on” phase (favoring altcoins like ETH) or a “risk-off” phase (favoring Bitcoin). Long-Term Vision: Both assets have strong fundamentals. Short-term fluctuations in the ETH/BTC ratio should be viewed within a broader, long-term investment strategy. Remember, market analysis is crucial, and staying informed about both Bitcoin and Ethereum’s individual trajectories is key. Summary: The Enduring Battle for Crypto Dominance The ongoing struggle of the ETH/BTC ratio below 0.05 highlights the complex dynamics at play within the cryptocurrency market. Despite Ethereum’s innovative strength and growing institutional appeal, Bitcoin’s historical dominance and market depth continue to exert significant influence. While experts predict potential short-term corrections for ETH, the long-term outlook remains tied to Ethereum’s ability to deliver on its technological promises and attract sustained, deep institutional capital. For now, the battle for crypto dominance continues, making the ETH/BTC ratio a fascinating indicator to watch. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does the ETH/BTC ratio signify? A1: The ETH/BTC ratio indicates Ethereum’s value relative to Bitcoin. A rising ratio suggests Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin, while a falling ratio means Bitcoin is showing stronger relative performance. It helps investors understand capital flow between the two assets. Q2: Why is the ETH/BTC ratio struggling to reclaim 0.05? A2: The ETH/BTC ratio is struggling due to several factors, including Bitcoin’s historical dominance since 2020, its perceived status as a safer institutional asset, and the market’s absorption of new ETH supply or profit-taking. Despite institutional interest in ETH, it hasn’t yet translated into sustained outperformance against BTC. Q3: Has Ethereum ever significantly outperformed Bitcoin? A3: Yes, Ethereum significantly outperformed Bitcoin during its early years, particularly between 2015 and 2017. This period was driven by the introduction of smart contracts and the ICO boom, which were revolutionary developments unique to Ethereum. Q4: What role does institutional interest play in the ETH/BTC ratio? A4: While institutional interest in Ethereum is growing, it’s not always enough to consistently boost the ETH/BTC ratio above key resistance levels. Institutional capital often flows into Bitcoin first due to its established nature and regulatory clarity. However, sustained institutional adoption of Ethereum could become a long-term catalyst. Q5: What factors could help improve the ETH/BTC ratio in the future? A5: Future Ethereum network upgrades (like Dencun or Pectra), increased utility and adoption of decentralized applications (dApps), and a broader market shift towards “risk-on” assets could potentially help improve the ETH/BTC ratio . Continued, deep institutional investment into Ethereum-specific products would also be a significant driver. Did this analysis of the ETH/BTC ratio help you understand the market better?

While XRP continues to attract institutional focus, many investors are widening their scope and looking at new altcoin projects with a mix of low pricing and strong adoption signals. One such project that is generating a lot of attention from investors and analysts right now is Remittix (RTX), an Ethereum-based PayFi solution showing strong performance. XRP News Shows Strong Ripple Price Performance Ripple remains in a rising trend channel in the medium term. This steady upward structure signals that investor demand for XRP is intact. The Ripple price recently broke through a short-term resistance level, leaving analysts to speculate if that upwards momentum could eventually lead to the XRP price hitting the $3.35 resistance level as well. However, investors remain cautious because if the Ripple price fails to hold above the $3.10 level, it could invite sellers, which will, in turn, lead to the price being dragged back toward $2.77. While bullish interest remains, investors are also looking to lock in positions on lower-priced opportunities in upcoming crypto projects that offer significant upside. Why Investors Are Watching Remittix Closely Amid the XRP news, Remittix has positioned itself as a new altcoin to watch. Built as a PayFiproject solving real-world problems, it enables cross-border transfers across 30+ countries. This utility-driven approach sets it apart from speculative tokens. Remittix’s utility is a key feature of why investors are paying attention to the cross-border payment solution. But the numbers also tell an interesting story. The numbers tell their own story. Remittix has already raised over $25.5 million, sold more than 660 million tokens, and remains priced at just $0.1080, firmly placing it among the top crypto under $1. Exchange milestones are also coming fast, with listings on Tier-1 CEXs like BitMartand LBANK confirmed already. Adding to the momentum, the Remittix Beta Wallet is launching on September 15, further streamlining crypto-powered global payments. Other key attention drivers pulling investors into Remittix include: ● $250,000 community giveaway to boost adoption efforts● Strong presale performance with over $25.5 million raised and more than 660 million tokens sold.● Global design with support for 30 fiat currencies and over 50 cryptocurrencies● Remittix also has a referral program paying 15% in USDT live, which has become a talking point among investors. The latest XRP news shows Ripple price action holding key support, but the upside remains dependent on breaking resistance at $3.35. As such, investors are looking more at Remittix to deliver better momentum and performance.

It announced the launch of the USDH HIP-1 and ERC-20, following its acquisition of the USDH ticker. Native Markets has officially been awarded the USDH ticker on Hyperliquid, after a community governance process involving HYPE stakers and network validators, who reviewed competing proposals for the native stablecoin of the Hyperliquid perpetual futures DEX. Native Markets has secured the USDH ticker The competition for the USDH ticker on Hyperliquid saw participation from some of the biggest names in the stablecoin and DeFi space, with Paxos, Frax Finance, Sky and Agora all submitting proposals. Other contenders, including Ethena, OpenEden, Curve, BitGo, and Bastion, submitted or considered proposals, though some either withdrew or failed to generate the same momentum as Native Market. While announcing this milestone, Native Markets expressed appreciation to the Hyperliquid community. “Thank you to all HYPE stakers and network validators for their time and effort in reviewing the proposals put forward,” Native Markets stated in its announcement. They also noted “deep respect” for the other projects that submitted competing proposals, emphasizing their excitement about seeing different teams execute on their visions for the Hyperliquid ecosystem.

Recent market movements suggest exciting times ahead for holders and traders alike. A detailed XRP price analysis reveals that the digital asset has made a significant move, breaking out of a long-term falling wedge pattern. This development is catching the attention of analysts and could signal a renewed potential for a sustained rally. What Does This Crucial Breakout Mean for XRP Price Analysis? For weeks, XRP has been consolidating, forming what technical analysts call a ‘falling wedge’ pattern. This pattern is generally considered bullish, often preceding an upward price reversal. The recent breakout from this multi-month formation on the daily chart is a strong indicator of changing market sentiment. According to reports from CryptoPotato, XRP successfully halted its previous decline precisely at the 100-day simple moving average (SMA). This key technical level often acts as a dynamic support or resistance, and holding above it is a positive sign for future price action. Furthermore, the asset decisively breached the upper resistance line of the falling wedge pattern, confirming the breakout. Examining the Bullish Momentum: A Deeper Look at XRP Price Analysis The bullish signals don’t stop there. CryptoPotato also highlighted that a similar breakout from a multi-month falling wedge pattern was observed on the four-hour chart. This dual confirmation across different timeframes often indicates robust and classic bullish momentum, giving traders and investors more confidence in the move. Key takeaways from the breakout: Daily Chart Confirmation: A long-term falling wedge pattern has been successfully broken. 100-Day SMA Support: XRP found strong support at this crucial moving average, preventing further downside. Four-Hour Chart Alignment: A similar pattern breakout on a shorter timeframe reinforces the bullish outlook. These technical indicators, when combined, paint a compelling picture for the immediate future of XRP. Understanding these patterns is fundamental to effective XRP price analysis . What Are the Next Price Targets in This XRP Price Analysis? With the breakout confirmed, many are wondering about the potential next steps for XRP’s price. The analysis from CryptoPotato provides some initial targets based on this bullish development. It suggests that if XRP can successfully maintain stable support at the $3 mark, it could pave the way for further short-term increases. Specifically, the outlet indicated a potential short-term increase to $3.4. It’s important to remember that these are projections based on technical analysis and market dynamics can change. However, holding key support levels after a breakout is often critical for sustaining upward trajectories. Important price levels to watch: Immediate Support: Maintaining above the former resistance line of the falling wedge. Crucial Support: The $3 level, as noted by CryptoPotato, is vital for further upside. Short-Term Target: A move towards $3.4 is anticipated if support holds. This phase requires careful monitoring, as sustained buying pressure and volume will be necessary to achieve these targets. Effective XRP price analysis always involves watching both technical patterns and trading volume. Why is This XRP Price Analysis So Important Right Now? The significance of this breakout extends beyond just technical charts. In the broader cryptocurrency landscape, a strong move from a major altcoin like XRP can often signal renewed investor confidence in the wider market. After periods of consolidation or decline, such breakouts can act as catalysts, attracting new capital and reinvigorating bullish sentiment. Furthermore, the legal clarity surrounding Ripple (the company behind XRP) continues to evolve, which can significantly influence investor perception and, consequently, XRP’s market performance. A positive technical signal, combined with potential regulatory clarity, creates a powerful narrative for potential growth. Challenges to consider: While the technical signals are strong, the crypto market is inherently volatile. Factors such as macroeconomic events, regulatory changes, and overall market sentiment can always influence price action. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider these broader influences. In conclusion, the recent breakout of XRP from its falling wedge pattern is a highly positive development for the asset. This technical move, supported by key moving averages and confirmed across multiple timeframes, suggests a strong potential for further upside. While specific price targets like $3.4 are on the horizon according to expert XRP price analysis , maintaining crucial support levels will be key to sustaining this momentum. As always, staying informed and understanding market dynamics is paramount for navigating the exciting world of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions About XRP Price Analysis Q1: What is a falling wedge pattern in cryptocurrency trading? A1: A falling wedge is a bullish chart pattern that forms when the price consolidates downward between two converging, downward-sloping trendlines. It typically signals that buying pressure is slowly overcoming selling pressure, often leading to a breakout to the upside. Q2: Why is the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) important for XRP? A2: The 100-day SMA is a widely watched technical indicator that represents the average closing price of XRP over the past 100 days. It often acts as a significant support or resistance level, and prices holding above it are generally seen as bullish, while falling below it can indicate weakness. Q3: Does this breakout guarantee XRP’s price will reach $3.4? A3: No, technical analysis provides probabilities, not guarantees. While the breakout is a strong bullish signal, and targets like $3.4 are projected by some analyses (like CryptoPotato’s), market conditions can change rapidly. It’s essential to monitor other factors like trading volume and overall market sentiment. Q4: What other factors should I consider when performing XRP price analysis? A4: Beyond technical patterns, consider fundamental factors such as developments within the Ripple ecosystem, regulatory news, partnerships, adoption rates, and the broader cryptocurrency market trends. Macroeconomic conditions and investor sentiment also play significant roles. Q5: How can I stay updated on XRP’s market movements? A5: To stay informed, follow reputable cryptocurrency news outlets, engage with expert analysts on social media, use reliable charting platforms, and consider setting price alerts.

Worldcoin, Chainlink, and Pi Coin remain in the pool, with each having its own offer in decentralized identity, smart contracts, and mobile-first onboarding. These are accompanied by Remittix (RTX) as a new altcoin to watch out for, especially as it is planning on releasing a beta wallet this September. This blend of old veterans and fresh opportunities is shaping the investment decision for people who are looking to invest in early stage crypto. Best Crypto To Invest In Today: Worldcoin, Chainlink, and Pi Coin Worldcoin is building global identity and finance, with its token at a price of $1.60 and market cap being $3.23 billion, although daily volume declined 26.21% to $592.01 million. Chainlink is still the backbone of the DeFi project economy, up 3.81% on a 24-hour basis to $24.54, supported by a $17.14 billion market cap and $1.17 billion in trading volume. Pi Coin also picked up pace, rising 3.21% to $0.3630, as its trading volume rose 52.24% to $70.67 million, signaling increased retail purchasing. These coins are repeatedly on top crypto to invest in today's lists, but the quest for low cap crypto gems is shifting focus elsewhere. That is where Remittix entered the conversation, building to solve very real issues in cross-border payments. Remittix: Utility Beyond Speculation Priced at $0.1080 per token, Remittix has already collected over $25.5 million in presale, selling over 660 million tokens. At the center are direct bank-to-crypto transfers in 30+ nations, real-time FX conversion, and the support of 40+ cryptocurrencies. The team just announced the wallet beta launch on September 15, with users being given a mobile-first utility to deal with crypto at low gas fees. To many, this is among the best crypto presales 2025 as it offers genuine infrastructure and not all hype. Why Remittix Is Picking Up Pace ● Wallet beta release on Sept 15, 2025● Over $25.5Million presale funding raised, 660Million+ tokens sold● 15% referral rewards paid daily in USDT● CEX listings revealed: BitMart and LBank Momentum in Community and Listings The main feature of the Remittix platform is its referral scheme, remunerating participants with 15% of their buyback as USDT. Combined with the $250,000 Remittix Giveaway, this has generated a strong word-of-mouth momentum. Milestones continue to roll in too. After reaching $20Million, the project made its initial exchange listing on BitMart. At $22Million, it went public with LBank being its second exchange partner. These are steps that make RTX more than just another crypto presale present today, but a project operating in tandem with mainstream adoption tactics. When discussing the Best Crypto To Buy Now, Worldcoin, Chainlink, and Pi Coin come to mind immediately. But Remittix offers something unique — a pure use case in cross-border remittances, health-oriented community incentives, and a product launch beginning this quarter. For those on the watch for the next significant altcoin 2025, RTX brings the qualities of a crypto addressing real-world problems together with the speed of one of the fastest-growing crypto presales. With the release of the wallet on the horizon, it is increasingly being considered something rather more than a presale token — potentially the next iteration in cross-border payments.

But while ADA offers steady growth, Remittix is emerging as the exciting new contender. With its ambitious global payments vision and aggressive reward program, it is positioning itself as a potential breakout star in the next bull cycle. This PayFi token is rapidly attracting investors. Together, these two projects highlight where investors are placing their bets in 2025. But which crypto assets will dominate the next cycle and deliver 40x returns in 2025? Cardano Shows Signs of Strength Recent updates from founder Charles Hoskinson confirmed that the Plomin hard fork will introduce decentralised governance. This could drive adoption and give the community more control over the network. Even with this uncertainty, Cardano continues to post steady trading volumes, and it appears major holders are still committed, even though analysts say ADA may not deliver quick profits. Source: Trading View Cardano (ADA) is trading around $0.90 with a market cap above $33 billion, and many long-term investors view it as one of the best cryptos under $1, with the potential to climb back toward its previous $3.10 high. According to the recent trading data, ADA is facing some selling pressure, with its daily chart forming a gravestone doji that signals short-term bearish momentum. This points to a possible pullback. Hence, many investors are shifting part of their ADA holdings into newer opportunities. Remittix: The High-Risk, High-Reward Play Unlike many early-stage projects, Remittix is moving aggressively in a different direction. It already has a working product roadmap and a full audit from CertiK. The project has raised more than $25.5 million, sold over 660 million tokens, and secured listings on BitMart and LBANK, with more exchanges on the horizon. This PayFi project is targeting the $19 trillion cross-border payments industry by enabling users to send cryptocurrency directly to bank accounts in over 30 countries. With a referral program offering 15% USDT rewards daily, staking opportunities, and strong adoption prospects, analysts believe this token could realistically deliver a 40x return in the coming cycle. While Cardano is building steadily, at just $0.10 per token, Remittix is attracting investors who are drawn to its potential upside. The Crypto With 40x Potential in 2025 For those seeking steady, long-term growth, Cardano remains a reliable choice.

Already priced at $0.1080 per token, Remittix has already surpassed more than $25.5 million in pre-sale. With a guaranteed listing on the centralized exchanges and a long-awaited beta wallet launch scheduled for this September, the project is rapidly becoming a hotspot for traders seeking the next breakout altcoin of 2025. Solana Price Outlook And Sentiment Solana is at $238.75, a slight 0.2% intraday decline. Its market cap sits at $129.33 billion, and trading volume has dropped over 25% to $8.95 billion. Though the figures are not in its favor, the majority of SOL holders are now weighing exposure to future crypto projects that are centered around addressing concrete real-world problems rather than purely speculative. That is where Remittix comes in. Contrary to hype-based meme tokens or Layer 2 Ethereum answers, Remittix offers an applicable link between decentralized finance and old-fashioned banking. Its architecture directly addresses issues in the $19 trillion global payments market, which is why it is attractive to individuals interested in a best long-term crypto investment. Beta Wallet Launch On September 15 Remittix's greatest achievement is its release of a beta wallet on September 15. The wallet supports 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies, with direct crypto-to-bank payments accepted in 30+ countries. In addition, the wallet boasts transparent real-time FX conversion to lower friction for freelancers, businesses, and regular remitters. This phone-first product forms the foundation of Remittix's mission as a low gas fee cryptocurrency project. By the utilization of simplicity, low fees, and borderless access, it stands out from moonshot coins and becomes one of the top DeFi projects of 2025. Presale Growth, Listings, And Referral Rewards Remittix presale has already surpassed $25.5 million, selling 660 million tokens at $0.1080 per token. Those milestones prompted early centralized exchange listings, first BitMart after the $20 million milestone and subsequently LBank after crossing $22 million. Community incentives additionally encourage adoption. A 15% USDT referral program enables members to accumulate rewards instantly via the dashboard, while a $250,000 giveaway is underway to broaden reach. These features highlight how Remittix is building liquidity, trust, and awareness prior to public launch. The Engines Behind Remittix’s Rapid Progress ● $25.5 million + raised in presale with 660 million + tokens sold● BitMart and LBank confirmed listings● September 15 beta wallet release● $250,000 community giveaway ongoing The overall Solana price outlook is still applicable, but the focus is moving towards tokens with known real-world adoption. As its wallet launch comes close, CEX listings are confirmed, and community rewards continue, Remittix is establishing itself as among the leading crypto under $1 and one of the most promising emerging crypto projects of the year.

Both coins' healthy ecosystem and Shiba Inu's growing community maintain them in the running, but attention is also being drawn toward upcoming projects that are starting to build early momentum. Among the most promising of these is Remittix (RTX), which currently sits at $0.1080 per token and has become one of the fast-rising altcoins with a clear use case. While ETH and SHIB remain to hold headlines, RTX is building steadily towards becoming the next biggie to keep an eye on. Ethereum Price Forecast and Shiba Inu Market Sentiment Ethereum has established itself as one of the leading blockchains, with healthy DeFi, staking, and smart contract adoption growth. At selling price $4,718.02, ETH has increased by 4.25% over the past 24 hours, reaching a market cap of $569.61 billion. Volume trading is also up, rising by 20.63%, to $41.66 billion, showing growing investor interest. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu Price momentum has been more grass-roots. SHIB is trading at $0.00001459, which accounts for a 10.03% day-to-day increase, with its market capitalization at $8.59 billion. Trade volume surged to $562.73 million, a staggering 134.83% increase, showing that Shiba Inu Coin is still attracting retail mania. Most SHIB owners are now contemplating other newer crypto ventures that possibly offer more real-world utility. Why Remittix Is Gaining Attention This is where Remittix enters the scene. Unlike meme coins or hype altcoins, Remittix DeFi project is built to solve a gigantic global issue: cross-border payments. It allows for crypto-to-fiat transfers to bank accounts across over 30 countries with minimal gas charges and settlement speed near-instant. The project has raised more than $25.5 million during its presale, with more than 660 million RTX tokens being sold. Success in presale has lined up future listings on BitMart and LBank, providing added liquidity and visibility on centralized exchanges. This positions RTX as more than a standard crypto presale of 2025, but a serious contender for long-term adoption. Key Drivers: Wallet Beta and Referral Program One of the key drivers of Remittix is the release of the September 15th wallet beta, which will give early adopters a first-hand feel of its mobile-first payment system. The wallet will include real-time FX conversion, fiat onboarding, and easy onboarding for crypto natives as well as new adopters. Equally exciting is the Remittix referral program, rewarding 15% instant USDT incentives for every new buyer referred. Rewards can be accrued daily, making it a strong choice for community building and passive rewards. With the inclusion of the $250,000 RemittixGiveaway, excitement continues to grow around this quickly growing project. ● Real-World Utility: Crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries● Wallet Launch: Beta launch on September 15th● Presale Growth: $25.5M+ raised and growing● Referral Rewards: 15% paid out daily in USDT As Ethereum and Shiba Inu updates continue to sit at the top of investors' lists, projects like Remittix are building the next generation of crypto adoption. At just $0.1080 per token, RTX is an emerging altcoin to watch with robust fundamentals, utility-based design, and growing market adoption. For those who want something more than ETH and SHIB in 2025, Remittix may be the next big crypto release to watch.

Yet, beyond meme coins, PayFi altcoins like Remittix are setting new benchmarks, raising over $25.5 million through the sale of 660 million tokens at $0.1080 each and emerging as the best crypto project 2025 investors are calling the next 100x crypto. PEPE Price Prediction Shows Explosive Potential Source: CryptOpus The PEPE price prediction has become a focal point after the token surged nearly 20% to $0.00001252 , backed by a staggering 280% increase in daily trading volume. Analysts highlight that PEPE has confirmed a breakout from a descending channel, turning the momentum in favor of buyers. Resistance sits near $0.0000130, with projections aiming for $0.0000160 and eventually $0.0000300 if strength holds. A recent $16 million whale buy further validates bullish sentiment, while CoinGlass data showing exchange outflows underpins the narrative. With its breakout structure and increasing adoption among traders, the PEPE price prediction suggests sharper volatility but also greater upside than other meme coins. Dogecoin News Adds Momentum to Meme Coins Source: Emilio Bojan/ TradingView Dogecoin news has fueled additional excitement, particularly with CleanCore acquiring over 500 million DOGE worth $148 million and positioning itself as an official Dogecoin treasury company. This corporate move echoes Bitcoin’s role as a balance sheet asset and highlights DOGE’s growing institutional relevance. Meanwhile, the long-hyped U.S. Dogecoin ETF by Rex-Osprey (ticker: DOJE) will become the first ETF to track a meme coin regulated in the U.S. Today, Dogecoin price has shot up over 8 percent, bursting through resistance areas and reaching a temporary high of $0.306. Currently, with a support of around $0.255, and the technical indicators that read green, the most recent Dogecoin news is indicating a consistent rise in momentum and institutional credibility of the token. Remittix Leads The PayFi Revolution While the PEPE price prediction and Dogecoin news highlight short-term catalysts, Remittix is building the foundation for long-term success. The PayFi project has broken records by raising over $25.5 million and is now entering a phase that could drive mass adoption. Why Remittix Stands Out ● Confirmed CEX listings on BitMart and LBank boost market access.● A $250,000 giveaway rewards early community members and fuels buzz.● PayFi infrastructure enables near-instant international payments.● Beta wallet launch on September 15 introduces live FX conversion tools.● 15% USDT referral rewards, claimable every 24 hours in the dashboard, supercharge organic growth. Remittix aims to make cross-border moves faster and cheaper. That utility aligns with a 50x PayFi narrative more than a pure meme cycle, which is why many are rotating toward Remittixduring this phase. With clear milestones and growing holders, Remittix keeps pulling attention from traders who want real use and upside. Why PayFi Could Outshine Meme Coins The PEPE price prediction and Dogecoin news show the strength of meme coin momentum, but PayFi altcoins like Remittix may deliver higher returns. With a model that blends crypto staking, low gas fee crypto transactions, and real-world use, Remittix offers the strongest case for early-stage crypto investment this September.

But $LBRETT is beginning to lead the charge as the best crypto to buy today. This next-gen Layer 2 memecoin is fusing meme culture with real blockchain utility, offering a unique blend of community energy and technical performance. Why traders are looking to Layer Brett for high returns Layer Brett presents a compelling answer to the question, Which is the best crypto to buy Today For The Highest Returns? Traditional memecoins often get stuck on slow, congested chains with zero utility. Layer Brett escapes that. This project leverages Ethereum Layer 2 technology, unlocking throughput with lightning-fast transactions and dramatically reduced gas fees, as low as $0.0001. Its purpose-built design provides scalability and performance that outpace basic meme tokens, making it a powerful contender. Layer Brett is a next-generation Layer 2 memecoin built on Ethereum, fusing viral culture with legitimate blockchain scaling solutions. It’s not just another meme token; it's Layer Brett with a purpose, featuring an evolving ecosystem that includes staking, token rewards, and plans for complete Layer 2 functionality. The project aims to disrupt the meme token landscape by delivering real-world blockchain scalability. Layer Brett achieves its speed and low costs by processing transactions off-chain, while still anchoring to Ethereum for decentralization and security. This design compresses fees and shrinks wait times. Users can buy and stake $LBRETT in seconds: connect a MetaMask or Trust Wallet, choose payment (ETH, USDT, or BNB), and purchase. Staking rewards are amplified due to lower operating costs enabled by Layer 2 scaling. It’s a seamless process. Cardano updates shift the market alternatives conversation The general market alternative has long been dominated by older meme tokens or legacy Layer 1 networks that lack real innovation. Many of these projects gained traction through popularity, yet they often fall short when addressing persistent challenges like high gas fees and network congestion. Unlike newer platforms, they typically provide limited ecosystem incentives, leaving them exposed to shifts in market sentiment. When examining price trends, older market alternatives often rely on speculation, which can lead to unstable growth. By comparison, Cardano offers a foundation supported by tangible improvements and long-term adoption potential. Analysts suggest that future Cardano updates could provide consistent demand, making it one of the more credible options in an environment where many alternatives lack utility. For investors, Cardano represents a market alternative rooted in innovation rather than hype. Layer Brett: The best crypto today for the highest gains Currently priced at $0.058 during its presale, Layer Brett offers early-entry pricing for those considering. Early adopters can stake their $LBRETT tokens immediately for high yields: coverage cites APY as high as 727% for initial participants. This aggressive reward structure and Layer 2 foundation position $LBRETT for potential explosive gains. The project clarifies, however, “$LBRETT is not an investment vehicle. Layer Brett represents a new chapter for memecoins, combining viral appeal with genuine Layer 2 utility. It’s fast, scalable, and community-powered, designed to deliver high-stakes rewards and low transaction costs. For those seeking the Best Crypto To Buy Today For The Highest Returns, this presale offers a chance to get in early on a project built for performance.

This is where Layer Brett($LBRETT) , a new Layer 2 crypto project blending meme appeal with real utility, comes in. With its presale underway, $LBRETT is currently priced at $0.058. It's capturing market attention, aiming to disrupt the meme token landscape while offering substantial staking rewards up to 727% APY for early participants. Analysts predict $LBRETT could see explosive gains. Layer Brett: Where meme meets mechanism Layer Brett outpaces many existing meme tokens by focusing on a Layer 2 blockchain architecture for Ethereum. Why settle for slower, costlier transactions? $LBRETT offers near-instant speeds, processing 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) with gas fees as low as $0.0001. This technical foundation provides true scalability, differentiating it from utility-free origins like the original Brett or much of the PEPE ecosystem. The project also features gamified staking and an evolving ecosystem, a real game-changer. This superior approach impacts future price prediction models. Layer Brett is a next-generation Layer 2 memecoin built on Ethereum, fusing meme culture with real blockchain utility. It isn't just another memecoin; it’s purpose-built for performance, scale, and user rewards. $LBRETT escapes the congestion and high gas fees of Ethereum Layer 1, delivering a faster, more cost-effective blockchain experience. The project notes: ""The network processes transactions off-chain."" Users connect their MetaMask or Trust Wallet, choose ETH, USDT, or BNB for payment, then buy and stake $LBRETT directly through the dApp. This simple setup unlocks amplified staking rewards, leveraging Layer 2's efficiency. With transparent tokenomics and a capped supply of 10 billion $LBRETT tokens, the project offers a controlled growth trajectory. Staking is on-chain, requires no KYC, and assets remain in complete control. This ensures user autonomy. Shiba Inu price prediction and market price outlook Traditional meme tokens often lack the foundational utility Layer Brett provides. They typically reside on Layer 1 chains, which can lead to congestion and higher transaction costs compared to an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. Assessing the Shiba Inu Price Prediction, alongside the PEPE general market, remains complex due to various factors like regulatory clarity and Federal Reserve policy. While assets like Shiba Inu and PEPE have seen notable past performance, they often present limited staking incentives compared to Layer Brett's high APYs. The overall market expects continued volatility, particularly with the largest monthly token unlock of the year on the horizon. This period creates both opportunities and risks across the board; $LBRETT is not an investment vehicle. Any price prediction for Shiba Inu requires caution. Layer Brett is positioned to overshadow Shiba Inu and PEPE in the meme space. Given its strong fundamentals and Layer 2 technology, Layer Brett is well-positioned for growth. Early buyers enjoy early-entry pricing at $0.058 per $LBRETT token. Coverage cites 727% APY for early stakers, a compelling incentive. The ongoing $1 million giveaway program further fuels community engagement. With its fixed supply of 10 billion tokens and focus on scalability, Layer Brett aims to capture significant value in the evolving DeFi landscape. This optimistic price prediction highlights its potential. Layer Brett combines meme power with genuine utility, offering an escape from Layer 1 limitations. Its presale provides an urgent opportunity for early participation and substantial staking rewards. As the crypto bull run of 2025 approaches, Layer Brett presents a fresh, scalable alternative to traditional meme tokens like Siba Inu and PEPE, promising a rewarding experience. This fuels a strong price prediction. Join the top Layer 2 Ethereum token now!

Layer Brett ($LBRETT) tokens are currently priced at $0.058. Solana holders are increasingly eyeing this trending meme coin, a new Ethereum Layer 2 protocol, as analysts predict a significant surge. The Layer Brett presale offers early access to a project fusing meme culture with real blockchain utility, providing substantial staking benefits. It's a compelling Crypto Presale opportunity. Why Layer Brett is capturing Solana holders' attention The future of meme coins isn't just about virality; it's about utility. Layer Brett stands out from typical Meme Token projects, including the original Brett, by leveraging Layer 2 Ethereum technology. This offers high-speed, low-cost transactions and unparalleled scalability. Why settle for less when utility-backed alternatives exist? Unlike many utility-free tokens, $LBRETT brings purpose to the meme landscape, aiming for dominance in the growing Layer 2 space with speed and community engagement, drawing attention from SOL holders. Layer Brett is a next-generation Memecoin built on Ethereum's Layer 2 network. It marries viral meme appeal with robust blockchain functionality—a project breaking free from its utility-free origins. The project aims to provide lightning-fast transactions, significantly lower gas fees, and substantial staking rewards, distinguishing itself from its predecessor, Brett. It's a true evolution for a Meme Token. Utilizing Layer 2 technology, Layer Brett compresses fees and unlocks throughput by processing transactions off-chain, while anchoring to Ethereum for security. This design facilitates near-instant interactions and dramatically reduces gas fees; coverage cites $0.0001. Early participants can stake their $LBRETT tokens immediately through the dApp for high-yield rewards, with coverage citing up to 900% APY. Solana Price Prediction and Market Outlook Solana has carved a place for itself as one of the most dynamic Layer 1 blockchains, standing out with its focus on speed, scalability, and developer-friendly infrastructure. Unlike chains that struggle with congestion or lack clear functionality, Solana was designed to process thousands of transactions per second while keeping fees low. This combination has allowed it to support a wide range of DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and gaming projects, making it more than a speculative asset. The outlook for Solana price prediction reflects both its strengths and market realities. Analysts note that while Solana benefits from rising adoption, its trajectory still depends on broader sentiment across the crypto market. Near-term resistance levels are being closely watched, but continued network growth and strong ecosystem demand could sustain its upward momentum. Long-term, Solana’s fundamentals position it as one of the few blockchains with potential beyond hype-driven cycles. Layer Brett vs. Solana: The race to the 2025 bull run Analysts are optimistic about Layer Brett 's trajectory, given its strong technical foundation and early presale success. Priced at $0.058, early investors could benefit from enhanced staking rates and dynamic ecosystem incentives. The integration of Layer 2 scalability, rivaling established solutions (e.g., Optimism, Arbitrum), positions $LBRETT as a strong contender among trending cryptocurrencies, offering potential for significant growth. However, the project clarifies: ""$LBRETT is not an investment vehicle."" Layer Brett represents a new frontier, combining meme power with genuine Layer 2 utility. Its presale offers a chance to engage with a project designed for speed and rewarding participation, attracting interest from SOL holders.

Currently priced at $0.058, this ERC-20 token is a Layer 2 crypto built to fuse meme culture with genuine blockchain utility. It aims to offer high-speed, low-cost transactions. This isn't just hype. Layer Brett: A new era for meme coins Layer Brett presents a compelling case for the future of meme coins by solving common blockchain pain points. While projects like Dogecoin remain on slower Layer 1 chains, Layer Brett, an Ethereum Layer 2, processes 10,000 transactions per second (TPS). This speed unlocks throughput, shrinking wait times. Its gas fees drop to as low as $0.0001, making transactions accessible for everyone. ""Layer Brett isn't here to blend in; it's here to break barriers."" This approach allows for enhanced rewards and a more dynamic user experience, truly making $LBRETT a trending crypto. Layer Brett is a next-generation Layer 2 memecoin built on Ethereum, designed to deliver real blockchain scalability. Unlike traditional meme tokens lacking utility, $LBRETT combines viral culture with legitimate solutions. It's fast, community-powered, and features an evolving ecosystem with staking and token rewards. This Layer Brett project brings a powerful blend of fun and function. Layer Brett operates as an additional protocol atop Ethereum, processing transactions off-chain for speed and affordability. This design helps it escape expensive Ethereum Layer 1 gas fees. Users can buy and stake $LBRETT immediately through the dApp for high-yield, Layer 2-powered rewards. This mechanism amplifies staking rewards due to lower operational costs, ensuring maximum value. Layer Brett also plans bridging solutions. Dogecoin news today and price forecast Dogecoin is a popular meme coin, an altcoin created in 2013 originally as a lighthearted joke. It runs on its own blockchain, a fork of Litecoin, using a proof-of-work consensus mechanism. While gaining immense popularity and a dedicated community, its core utility has remained mainly as a payment token, often characterized by high volatility. Despite recent Dogecoin news, it doesn't inherently offer advanced Layer 2 scaling or the diverse utility roadmap seen in newer projects like Layer Brett. Recent Dogecoin news continues to highlight market interest, especially with discussions around a potential DOGE ETF. While such a development could boost its value, Dogecoin price predictions remain highly speculative. Historically, its value moves are often driven by social media trends and broader crypto market sentiment. Can a meme coin with limited innovation truly outpace those built for performance? Analysts project modest gains for DOGE, with substantial external catalysts needed. Layer Brett is poised to outperform Dogecoin. Layer Brett's current presale price is $0.058, a low entry point. With its Ethereum Layer 2 foundation, 10,000 TPS, and ultra-low $0.0001 gas fees, the project notes it could attract substantial user adoption. Coverage cites 727% APY for early participants, potentially fueling strong initial demand. A $1 million giveaway (a significant community incentive) aims to attract more attention. Layer Brett is still in its presale stage, offering a chance to gain from early entry pricing and amplified staking rewards. This Layer 2 blockchain offers scalability and real utility, a refreshing change. The project notes that $LBRETT is not an investment vehicle, focusing on community interaction.

According to reporting from The Wall Street Journal, Robyn has already launched her pitch ahead of the November 6 shareholder vote, where Tesla is asking investors to approve a new $1 trillion compensation package for Elon. The goal? Get him to stay locked in for another ten years. The problem? Sales are down, investors are tired, and Tesla’s growth story looks shakier than ever. Robyn, who’s chaired Tesla’s board since 2018, has started doing interviews and meeting with big institutional shareholders. This is her second time doing this in under two years. She’s trying to push through a huge payday for Elon, again, with the not-so-subtle message that he could walk if he doesn’t get it. Robyn leans on investor fears as Tesla’s delivery numbers fall Robyn is selling this new package at a rough time. Tesla’s vehicle deliveries are down for the year. Its first all-new model in years, the Cybertruck, launched in 2023 and underdelivered. The company’s long-promised robotaxi tech finally showed up in June, but only as a small rollout in Austin, Texas, after almost ten years of yapping . And investors are still waiting for results. There’s also the mess from the 2018 pay plan. That $50 billion deal got thrown out by a Delaware judge, and now it’s tied up in court. Robyn admitted that shareholders are tired of hearing about it. Still, she claims this new plan is exactly what investors have been asking for. “I was getting a lot of questions from shareholders about what does the future look like, for Elon and the company,” Robyn said . In 2016, she led the push to get Tesla investors to approve the SolarCity acquisition, Elon’s other company, which many saw as a bailout. She’s clearly used to fighting these battles. And she’s still defending the 2018 pay package. Even after the judge slammed her for “lackadaisical” oversight, Robyn dismissed that criticism. “Crap,” she told a reporter. Her 95-year-old mother didn’t appreciate the language. But Robyn insists she’s doing her job. “I know that I work for the shareholders,” she said. She says her role is about managing both Elon and the board while keeping shareholder interests in the middle. And so far, the board seems fine with how she’s doing it. Tesla’s market value hit $1 trillion while Robyn’s been chair. She credits Elon’s previous pay package for pushing him to perform. But at most companies, the CEO doesn’t get this kind of freedom. Elon runs multiple businesses. He’s on social media constantly. He’s in politics. And he still has more control than most public company CEOs. Board committee writes new plan as Elon threatens to walk Last June, when shareholders reapproved the old pay plan, Elon jumped up and down on stage like it was his birthday. A few weeks later, he moved his focus to President Trump’s reelection campaign and moved to Washington. Investors started begging him to focus on Tesla again. Then in December, the same Delaware judge threw out the plan… again. By January, Tesla’s board had formed a special committee to come up with a solution. Robyn was in that group. The goal was to wrap up the mess around the 2018 deal and come up with something new. But Elon didn’t show up empty-handed. Tesla says he warned the board that he “may pursue other interests and leave Tesla” if he didn’t get what he wanted: full payment of the old package, at least 25% voting control, and no restrictions on his other ventures. The board had some requests, too. They wanted him to wind down his political side quests. That eventually happened, after Elon’s relationship with Trump’s White House soured publicly. “I’m not sure that he would say today that his stint in Washington was fabulous,” Robyn said. “I don’t think it was fabulous for the company, either.” Still, she says the board wants as much of his “time, energy and focus” as they can get. But the new plan doesn’t include any rules about how many hours he needs to work. Robyn says time doesn’t matter. “It’s not time that I measure,” she said, “it’s output.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Total wealth rose to a record $176.3 trillion, the largest jump since late 2020 during the COVID rebound. This is not normal. It’s rare as hell. And it comes while inflation’s above 3%, rates are being cut, and the job market is struggling. But the money’s flowing, just not to everyone. The numbers show the wealth gap is ripping wider. And most of this windfall? It came straight from Wall Street. The S&P 500 just pulled off a 30% rally in five months, starting in April. Only five times since 1975 has that happened. The last two were in 2020 and 2009. Stock boom hands top 1% a $40 trillion lead This stock run didn’t lift all boats. It supercharged the yachts. The top 1% now hold $40 trillion more than the bottom 50% combined. That lower half owns just 2.5% of the nation’s net worth. Meanwhile, the wealth-to-GDP ratio shot up to 581%, the highest since Q1 2022. That stat means asset owners, basically the rich, are getting richer at a speed that leaves wage earners far behind. Rate cuts are coming. And they’re not waiting for inflation to cool. For the first time in more than three decades, the Fed is set to lower rates with PCE inflation above 2.9%. Jerome Powell and his team will point to a soft labor market as the reason. But the impact is lower rates fuel higher asset prices. And those without assets, they’re just stuck watching. The top 10% of Americans, who already own most of the investable wealth, are set to benefit again. A survey shows 70% of consumers believe their income won’t keep up with inflation. That’s the setup: rising prices, falling rates, a roaring stock market, and most people falling behind. Fed fuels projections for $200 trillion by 2027 History says this rally isn’t done. Every time the S&P 500 has jumped 30%+ in 5 months, the next 12 months have all been positive. Carson Investment Research put the average return over that next year at 18.1%. Also, in the last 20 instances where rate cuts came with the S&P at a peak, the index rose 13.9% on average over the following 12 months. Even in the six months after such rallies, there’s never been a negative return, not once in 50 years. With that track record and the current setup, analysts now expect US household net worth to blow past $200 trillion by 2027. That’s the projection. And the Fed is the one stepping on the gas. Whether that’s good or bad depends on whether you actually hold assets. Here’s something wild: even with all this hype around stocks, gold is outperforming. Year-to-date, gold is up 36%, while the S&P 500 is only up 12%. That’s a problem for the narrative that equities are the only place to be. It also means that traditional hedges are working better than expected, even while crypto markets continue to watch from the sidelines. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

A fascinating trend is currently unfolding that could have profound implications for the market: Bitcoin miner deposits to exchanges are on a significant decline. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it’s a crucial signal often watched by savvy investors, hinting at reduced selling pressure and potentially a bullish turn for BTC. This development suggests that those who mine Bitcoin are holding onto their valuable assets rather than offloading them, a behavior that historically precedes upward price momentum. What Are Bitcoin Miner Deposits and Why Are They So Important? Understanding Bitcoin miner deposits is key to deciphering market sentiment. Simply put, these are the transfers of newly minted or previously held Bitcoin from miners’ wallets directly to cryptocurrency exchanges. Miners, who expend significant resources (electricity, hardware) to validate transactions and secure the Bitcoin network, receive BTC as a reward. When miners deposit large amounts of Bitcoin onto exchanges, it typically indicates an intent to sell. This action increases the available supply on the market, which can exert downward pressure on prices. Conversely, a decrease in these deposits suggests miners are choosing to accumulate or hold their BTC, thereby reducing the immediate supply available for sale. According to an insightful analysis by CryptoQuant contributor ShayanMarkets, this flow of coins from miner wallets to exchanges serves as a traditional indicator of supply-side pressure. Observing this metric provides a valuable window into the supply dynamics of Bitcoin. A Remarkable Drop in Bitcoin Miner Deposits The current data reveals a compelling story. The 30-day moving average of Bitcoin miner deposits has now dropped to a short-term low. This sustained decline is a powerful signal, suggesting a shift in miner behavior from selling to accumulating. What does this mean for the market? Here are some key takeaways: Reduced Selling Pressure: Fewer Bitcoin are being sent to exchanges, directly translating to less immediate sell-side pressure on the market. Miner Accumulation: Miners are likely choosing to hold onto their newly acquired Bitcoin, indicating a long-term bullish outlook from a fundamental source of BTC supply. Supply Shock Potential: If this trend continues, a reduced supply on exchanges coupled with steady or increasing demand could lead to significant price appreciation. This trend is not merely anecdotal; it’s a measurable shift that active traders and long-term investors alike should monitor closely. It paints a picture of conviction within the mining community, a group that has a vested interest in Bitcoin’s long-term success. What Does Miner Accumulation Mean for Bitcoin’s Future? Historically, periods of miner accumulation have often preceded significant upward price movements for Bitcoin. When miners, who are essentially the producers of Bitcoin, decide to hoard their output, it removes a substantial amount of potential selling pressure from the market. This creates a more favorable environment for price appreciation. From a technical perspective, ShayanMarkets added that if BTC successfully maintains support at the crucial $112,000 level, it could continue its upward momentum. This strong foundation could potentially pave the way for Bitcoin to challenge and even set a new all-time high. This scenario highlights the interconnectedness of fundamental miner behavior and technical price action. The decline in Bitcoin miner deposits acts as a fundamental tailwind, supporting the technical indicators for a potential rally. This isn’t just about the numbers; it’s about the psychology of the market. When key players like miners show confidence by accumulating, it can inspire broader market optimism and encourage other investors to hold or even buy more BTC. Actionable Insights: What Should Investors Consider? For investors, this trend in Bitcoin miner deposits offers a valuable piece of the puzzle when evaluating Bitcoin’s future trajectory. While no single indicator guarantees future price movements, a sustained reduction in miner selling pressure is undoubtedly a positive development. Consider these actionable insights: Monitor Support Levels: Keep a close watch on key technical support levels, such as the $112,000 mark mentioned by ShayanMarkets. Maintaining these levels strengthens the bullish case. Long-Term Perspective: This accumulation trend often aligns with a long-term bullish outlook. Investors with a multi-year horizon might find this data particularly encouraging. Diversify and Research: Always remember to diversify your portfolio and conduct thorough research. While miner activity is important, it’s one of many factors influencing the crypto market.

This positive shift in miner behavior could be a significant catalyst, signaling a potential new phase of growth for Bitcoin. Summary: A Bullish Horizon for Bitcoin The ongoing decline in Bitcoin miner deposits to exchanges represents a crucial and potentially bullish signal for the cryptocurrency market. This trend strongly indicates that miners are reducing their selling activities and instead opting to accumulate BTC, thereby decreasing the available supply on exchanges. This reduced selling pressure, combined with Bitcoin’s ability to hold key support levels, could fuel significant upward momentum, possibly leading to a new all-time high. As miners show increased confidence in Bitcoin’s future, the broader market may follow, setting the stage for an exciting period ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are Bitcoin miner deposits? A1: Bitcoin miner deposits refer to the transfer of Bitcoin from a miner’s wallet to a cryptocurrency exchange. This action typically signals an intent to sell the Bitcoin. Q2: Why is a decline in Bitcoin miner deposits considered a bullish sign? A2: A decline suggests that miners are choosing to hold onto their BTC rather than sell it. This reduces the supply available on exchanges, which, when coupled with consistent demand, can lead to increased prices due to scarcity and reduced selling pressure. Q3: Does reduced miner selling guarantee a Bitcoin price increase? A3: While it’s a strong bullish indicator, no single factor can guarantee price movements. The crypto market is influenced by many variables, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, and broader market sentiment. It’s one piece of a larger analytical puzzle. Q4: What is the significance of the $112,000 support level mentioned? A4: The $112,000 level is a technical support point. If Bitcoin can consistently maintain its price above this level, it suggests strong buying interest and reinforces the potential for continued upward price momentum, as highlighted by CryptoQuant contributor ShayanMarkets. Q5: How can I track Bitcoin miner activity? A5: You can track Bitcoin miner activity through various on-chain analytics platforms like CryptoQuant, Glassnode, or Santiment. These platforms provide data on miner flows, reserves, and other metrics that offer insights into their behavior. *** Did you find this analysis on Bitcoin miner deposits insightful?

A South Korean court instead handed the three unnamed individuals suspended sentences. It issued fines, despite conceding they had caused “astronomical damages.” The South Korean newspaper Seoul Shinmun and the news agency Yonhap reported on September 14, that the Criminal Division of the Daejeon District Court’s Cheonan Branch passed judgment on three individuals convicted of violating the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes. The presiding judge sentenced all three of the officials to three years in jail (suspended). The court also ordered them to serve five years of probation. The trio’s names were withheld for legal reasons. The court also ordered the first individual, referred to as A (a 61-year-old woman), to pay a 660 million won ($474,000) fine. The judge also ordered B (63, also female) to pay a 426 million won fine ($306,000). A man identified as C (aged 57) was ordered to pay 259 million won ($186,000). V Global Crypto Exchange: Fines, Suspended Sentences, and Probation Orders The trio, prosecutors told the court, occupied top positions in organizations that used multi-level marketing methods. They were tasked with luring customers to the V Global platform. Daejeon District Court. (Source: Minseong Kim [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Their efforts earned them up to 1.5 billion won ($1.1 million) each in profits, prosecution officials told the court. In sentencing, the presiding judge said: “The defendants caused astronomical damage by exploiting popular interest in cryptoassets. Over 50,000 victims are still living with the economic and mental pain of this crime. The damage done to society is considerable. A strict punishment is called for.” But the judge added that the executives did ensure that some of the victims received payouts and the “profits” they had been promised. The Supreme Court jailed Lee (given name withheld for legal reasons), the CEO of V Global, for 25 years for masterminding the fake exchange back in 2023 . A Marine Corps sergeant died Saturday after being shot in the head at a unit on an island off the country's west coast, military officials said. https://t.co/maMKtNNgRc — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) September 13, 2025 A Veneer of Authenticity The CEO and his staff created a realistic-looking trading platform, designed to resemble bona fide South Korean exchanges like Upbit and Bithumb. The platform featured real-time price charts for coins like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) , as well as coin tickers and realistic-looking trading volume tables. The V Global exchange used a “tiered membership system” that incorporated advanced multi-layered marketing methods. Its operators offered members payouts in V Global-branded tokens if they “recruited new members.” But the courts later determined that these coins were just as fake as the exchange itself, and had never launched on any blockchain protocol. South Korean courts have also jailed other senior V Global executives. One individual is currently serving a 14-year sentence. Another, meanwhile, is coming toward the end of a four-year jail term. V Global launched in mid-2020. But the rouse began to unravel in 2021, when disgruntled customers filed legal complaints, stating that they could not withdraw their assets from the exchange. At its height, the bogus exchange operated from a building in the heart of Seoul’s busy commercial district. The district is home to some of the country’s biggest crypto exchanges and most prominent blockchain technology startups.

Pi Coin Price Fails to Reclaim Bullish Momentum The hype with the Pi coin price during its first few weeks of entry has seen a drastic decline over the last few months as buying momentum reverses. This has seen a price difference of more than $2.5 as the price falls from its high of $2.9 in February to the current $0.36. Experts say the Pi coin price could tumble further this month as prices maintain a downward-facing momentum. Assessing Algorand And Cardano Price Position As the Best Crypto To Buy Cardano’s price recovery in the last few days is fueling new sentiment of a price breakout, potentially making the ADA coin one of the best cryptos to buy now. Similarly, the Algorand new aid portal is drawing in inflow that could see the coin breakout soon. According to price analysis, experts say this coin breakout could see them rise to 2x by early 2026. However, investors looking for the best crypto to buy are still looking for the best entry to maximise profit on these assets. Remittix Early Rise Places It On A 100x Surge Potential Data from the Remittix token price changes in the last few weeks is showing the coin could be nearing a breakout soon. This data shows the coin climbing over 6x already over the last few months as its presale makes new highs. But with a projected milestone this year, experts believe the Remittix coin could be the best crypto to buy this month, with a potential surge up to 40x by December. The talk about the Remittix token has also included a focus on the reward programs of this new PayFi asset. This includes an ongoing one that gives users 15% of their referrals’ purchases every day. Others to look into include: The coming wallet launch this month Exchange listings before the end of the year And the staking opportunity with the Remittix token Discover the future of PayFi with Remittix by checking out their project here: Website: https://remittix.io/ Socials: https://linktr.ee/remittix $250,000 Giveaway: https://gleam.io/competitions/nz84L-250000-remittix-giveaway",Press Release,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|ZRX|ADA|ALGO,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-14 23:40:00

A recent development from the Daejeon District Court’s Cheonan Branch highlights this reality: three accomplices in a massive South Korean crypto fraud case have been sentenced. This significant legal outcome underscores the global effort to combat elaborate crypto scams. Sentences for $1.6 Billion South Korean Crypto Fraud Case Three individuals received prison sentences for their roles in the notorious “V Global” investment scam. This elaborate scheme impacted over 50,000 victims, leading to collective losses of approximately 2.2 trillion won—a staggering $1.6 billion USD. The fraud operated from July 2020 to April 2021, revealing widespread financial devastation. Verdict: Each defendant received a three-year prison sentence, suspended for five years, contingent on good behavior. Financial Penalties: The court ordered forfeiture of illicit gains, ranging from 259 million won ($188,000) to 606 million won ($439,000) per individual. The sheer scale of this South Korean crypto fraud case serves as a potent reminder of the importance of robust regulatory frameworks and investor caution. Understanding the “V Global” Scam Mechanics The “V Global” scam was a classic Ponzi scheme, disguised as a legitimate cryptocurrency investment. Perpetrators lured victims with promises of high, guaranteed returns, often using a multi-level marketing (MLM) structure. Funds from new investors paid earlier ones, creating an illusion of profitability until collapse. Such schemes exploit a lack of understanding about crypto technology. Many victims, drawn by quick wealth, fail to recognize fraud signs. The V Global incident reinforces: if an investment seems too good to be true, it almost certainly is. Protecting Yourself from Crypto Scams Preventing future incidents like this South Korean crypto fraud case demands individual caution, public education, and vigilant regulatory oversight. Here are actionable insights for investors: Due Diligence: Research any investment platform thoroughly. Verify company information, founders, and operational history. Question Guaranteed Returns: Legitimate crypto investments cannot guarantee high returns. Fixed, unusually high profits are a major red flag. Educate Yourself: Learn crypto and blockchain basics. This knowledge helps identify unrealistic or misleading claims. Verify Regulatory Compliance: Check if the platform is registered with relevant financial authorities. Resist Pressure Tactics: Scammers use high-pressure sales. Take time, consult trusted advisors, and never feel forced. Report Suspicious Activity: Report potential scams to financial regulators or law enforcement. Your report helps protect others. Adopting these practices significantly reduces vulnerability to sophisticated fraud schemes. Broader Impact of Crypto Fraud Cases The repercussions of large-scale fraud like the V Global scam extend beyond immediate financial losses. Such incidents erode public trust in the legitimate crypto industry, make potential investors hesitant, and often lead to calls for stricter regulations. This South Korean crypto fraud case highlights long-term societal costs of digital financial crimes. Law enforcement and judicial systems are adapting to tackle these complex digital crimes. The sentencing sends a clear message: crypto fraudsters will face justice. It underscores international cooperation in tracking illicit funds and apprehending perpetrators. The sentencing in the $1.6 billion V Global scam marks a significant victory against cryptocurrency fraud. While justice has been served in this South Korean crypto fraud case , it serves as a potent reminder for all crypto market participants. Vigilance, education, and robust due diligence are your best defenses. Staying informed and cautious remains paramount for safeguarding investments and fostering a safer crypto ecosystem.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Hyperliquid’s validator community has chosen Native Markets to issue USDH, ending a weeklong contest that drew proposals from Paxos, Frax, Sky (ex-MakerDAO), Agora, and others. Native Markets, co-founded by former Uniswap Labs president MC Lader, researcher Anish Agnihotri, and early Hyperliquid backer Max Fiege, said it will begin rolling out USDH “within days,” according to a post by Fiege on X. According to onchain trackers , Native Markets' proposal took approximately 70% of validators' votes, while Paxos took 20%, and Ethena came in at 3.2%. The staged launch starts with capped mints and redemptions, followed by a USDH/USDC spot pair before caps are lifted. USDH is designed to challenge Circle’s USDC, which currently dominates Hyperliquid with nearly $6 billion in deposits , or about 7.5% of its supply. USDC and other stablecoins will remain supported if they meet liquidity and HYPE staking requirements. Most rival bidders had promised to channel stablecoin yields back to the ecosystem with Paxos via HYPE buybacks, Frax through direct user yield, and Sky with a 4.85% savings rate plus a $25 million “Genesis Star” project. Native Markets’ pitch instead stressed credibility, trading experience, and validator alignment. Market Movement BTC: BTC has recently reclaimed the $115,000 level, helped by inflows into ETFs, easing U.S. inflation data, and growing expectations for interest rate cuts. Also, technical momentum is picking up, though resistance sits around $116,000, according to CoinDesk's market insights bot. ETH : ETH is trading above $4600. The price is being buoyed by strong ETF inflows. Gold: Gold continues to trade near record highs as traders eye dollar weakness on expected Fed rate cuts.

Last week, creators on Pump.fun earned over $19 million in fees while SOL price spiked by 17%. Ethereum, which has been leading the altcoin rally, saw Solana outperforming it and flashing bullish sentiments for the ecosystem. Ethereum price remained up by more than 4% in the last 30 days while SOL price jumped by almost 30% in the same time. Pump.fun creator earnings spike Pump.fun first debuted its streaming feature in 2024 but paused it following reports of unsafe live sessions. This even included self-harm stunts. After a controlled reintroduction in 2025 with stricter moderation, the feature was rolled out to all users. The results have been immediate, Pump.fun now ranks close to 1% of Twitch’s channels and 10% of Kick’s. Adam shared the data from Dune for the first 7 days of the Pump.fun fee structure change. It saw $15.5 million in creator fees being claimed. He categorized the top 25 creator fee claimers before September 10. It involves 5 streamers, 9 serial deployers and 11 one-hit wonders.

Adam highlighted that Gainzy claimed $108K in creator fees over that period. The platform’s native PUMP token recently breached a $3 billion market cap. This milestone came in just two months after raising nearly $600 million in a 12-minute ICO. Viral streams and creator fees have been key growth drivers, with $19.3M earned by creators last week alone. Earlier, Cryptopolitan reported that PUMP managed to recover its ICO price as whales decided to accumulate. Wall Street piles into Solana Wall Street-backed Forward Industries has emerged as a major Solana treasury player. The publicly traded firm raised $1.65 billion in cash and stablecoin commitments with backing from Galaxy Digital, Multicoin Capital, and Jump Crypto. Combined with DeFi Technologies and Neptune Digital, these four entities now control over 2.82 million SOL (approx worth $577 million). Data shows that Forward Industries holds 1.45M SOL, Galaxy Digital has 1.35M SOL, while DeFi Technologies and Neptune Digital hold 12.8k SOL and Neptune Digital 9.6K, respectively. Solana’s broader ecosystem is finding ways to expand. Metaplex launched Uniform Price Auctions for fairer token launches, while Squads Protocol opened its Grid developer platform to all users.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a widely watched barometer of investor sentiment, has recently made a significant move. It has shifted from a state of ‘Greed’ to ‘Neutral,’ settling at a reading of 53. This change is more than just a number; it offers crucial insights into the collective mood of cryptocurrency investors. Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Does it Measure? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is essentially a thermometer for the market’s emotional state. Developed by Alternative.me, it gauges whether investors are feeling overly fearful or excessively optimistic. The index operates on a straightforward scale: zero represents extreme fear, indicating potential buying opportunities, while 100 signifies extreme optimism, often hinting at a market correction. But how is this sentiment calculated? It is not just a gut feeling. The index compiles data from several key factors, each weighted to provide a comprehensive picture: Volatility (25%): Measures the current market’s price fluctuations compared to average values. High volatility often signals fear. Trading Volume (25%): Analyzes current trading volumes against historical averages. Strong, sustained volume can indicate market strength or weakness. Social Media Mentions (15%): Scans various platforms for relevant cryptocurrency hashtags and mentions, assessing the level of public interest and sentiment. Surveys (15%): Although paused for now, historically these surveys directly polled investors for their market outlook. Bitcoin’s Market Cap Dominance (10%): An increasing dominance of Bitcoin can sometimes signal fear as investors flock to the perceived safety of BTC. Google Search Volume (10%): Tracks search queries related to cryptocurrencies, with spikes in certain terms often correlating with fear or excitement. Decoding the Shift: What Does a Neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index Mean? The recent two-point fall in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , bringing it to 53, marks a transition from ‘Greed’ to ‘Neutral.’ When the index was in ‘Greed,’ it suggested that investors were perhaps becoming overconfident, potentially leading to inflated asset prices. However, a move to ‘Neutral’ indicates a more balanced, albeit less decisive, market sentiment. This neutral stage suggests that the market is not dominated by either irrational exuberance or panic. Instead, investors might be exercising caution, awaiting clearer signals before making significant moves. It could mean a period of consolidation, where prices stabilize, or it might be a precursor to a new trend, either upward or downward. For those looking for extreme signals, neutral territory can sometimes feel ambiguous, but it offers its own set of unique opportunities and challenges. Navigating the Neutral Zone: Actionable Insights for Investors So, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index now in neutral territory, what should investors consider? This phase often calls for a more strategic and less emotional approach. Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: Use this period to review your holdings. Are your investments still aligned with your long-term goals and risk tolerance? Research and Due Diligence: A neutral market is an excellent time for in-depth research. Look into projects with strong fundamentals, clear roadmaps, and active communities. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, DCA involves investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price. This strategy can be particularly effective during periods of uncertainty. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, technological advancements, and regulatory developments. These factors can quickly shift sentiment. Avoid Impulse Decisions: The absence of extreme fear or greed can help you make more rational choices. Resist the urge to chase pumps or panic-sell on dips. A neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index does not necessarily mean stagnation; rather, it represents a moment of equilibrium. It’s a valuable time for thoughtful decision-making rather than reacting to heightened emotions. Conclusion: Embracing Prudence in a Balanced Market The shift of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to a neutral 53 underscores a cooling of investor exuberance and a move towards a more balanced outlook. While extreme readings often signal clear opportunities, a neutral stance calls for prudence and strategic thinking. By understanding the underlying factors of the index and adopting a disciplined approach, investors can navigate this phase effectively, positioning themselves for future market movements. This period is less about making bold, impulsive moves and more about informed, calculated decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the current sentiment of the cryptocurrency market, ranging from extreme fear (0) to extreme greed (100), based on various market factors. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? It is calculated using a weighted average of factors including volatility (25%), trading volume (25%), social media mentions (15%), Bitcoin’s market cap dominance (10%), and Google search volume (10%). What does a ‘Neutral’ reading on the index signify? A ‘Neutral’ reading, like the current 53, indicates that market sentiment is balanced, without significant dominance of either fear or greed. Investors are likely exercising caution and awaiting clearer market signals. Should I buy or sell when the index is neutral? A neutral reading does not provide a direct buy or sell signal. Instead, it suggests a time for careful analysis, portfolio re-evaluation, and strategic planning like dollar-cost averaging, rather than making impulsive decisions. How often does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index update? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is updated daily by Alternative.me, providing a fresh snapshot of market sentiment.

While crypto markets often move to their own beat, they are not immune to the gravitational pull of traditional finance. This week brings a series of crucial global macroeconomic events that could significantly influence investor sentiment and market trends, directly impacting your digital asset portfolio. Why Crucial Global Macroeconomic Events Matter for Crypto Many crypto investors focus solely on on-chain metrics and technological advancements. However, ignoring traditional finance indicators is a mistake. The decisions made by central banks and the health of major economies have a profound effect on liquidity, risk appetite, and the overall flow of capital into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Understanding these global macroeconomic events helps you anticipate potential market shifts. Factors like interest rates, inflation, and employment data directly influence how investors perceive risk and allocate their funds. When traditional markets experience volatility due to economic news, crypto often follows suit, either amplifying gains or exacerbating losses. Staying informed allows you to make more strategic decisions. Monday, Sept. 17: The FOMC’s Pivotal Decision on Global Macroeconomic Events The week kicks off with a heavyweight: the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decision and statement at 6:00 p.m. UTC. This is arguably one of the most anticipated global macroeconomic events of the month. What to Watch For: Interest Rate Hike/Hold/Cut: A hike typically strengthens the U.S. dollar, making risk assets like crypto less attractive. A hold or cut can signal a more dovish stance, potentially boosting crypto prices. Forward Guidance: The accompanying statement and press conference will offer insights into the Fed’s future monetary policy path. Any hints of prolonged high rates or upcoming cuts will send ripples through all markets. The FOMC’s actions directly influence global liquidity and investor appetite for risk. A hawkish stance could lead to a ‘risk-off’ environment, potentially putting downward pressure on Bitcoin and altcoins. Tuesday, Sept. 18: UK Rates and US Jobless Claims – A Dual Impact Tuesday brings another layer of crucial global macroeconomic events with significant implications: 11:00 a.m. UTC: UK Interest Rate Decision The Bank of England’s (BoE) decision will reflect the UK’s economic health and inflation battle. While regional, the BoE’s stance contributes to the overall global sentiment regarding monetary policy. A surprise move could cause broader market jitters. 12:30 p.m. UTC: U.S. Initial Jobless Claims This weekly data point provides a real-time snapshot of the U.S. labor market’s health. Higher-than-expected claims suggest a weakening economy, which might prompt the Fed to consider easing monetary policy in the future – often seen as positive for crypto. Conversely, lower claims indicate a strong labor market, potentially giving the Fed more room to maintain higher rates for longer, which can be a headwind for risk assets. These two data points, though different in nature, offer crucial insights into economic stability and central bank reactions, which are key drivers of investor behavior in crypto. Wednesday, Sept. 19: Japan’s Monetary Policy and Global Ripples from Global Macroeconomic Events The final key event of the week comes from Asia: 3:00 a.m. UTC: Japan Interest Rate Decision The Bank of Japan (BoJ) has historically maintained an ultra-loose monetary policy, making it an outlier among major central banks. Any hint of a shift away from this stance, such as tightening policy or adjusting yield curve control, would be a monumental event. Such a change could trigger significant volatility in currency markets (especially the Yen) and potentially lead to a repatriation of capital, affecting global liquidity. Japan’s decision adds another significant dimension to global macroeconomic events , as its policies have long-reaching implications for global financial stability and investment flows. Navigating the Week: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the lineup of crucial global macroeconomic events , how should crypto investors approach the week? Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on economic news and official statements. Understand the market’s initial reaction, but avoid impulsive decisions. Manage Risk: Volatility is often heightened around these announcements. Consider reducing leverage or setting tighter stop-loss orders if you are actively trading. Long-Term Perspective: For long-term holders, these events are often temporary blips. Focus on the underlying fundamentals of your chosen assets. Diversify: A diversified portfolio can help mitigate the impact of adverse market movements stemming from these events. Conclusion: The Unmissable Impact of Global Macroeconomic Events This week serves as a powerful reminder that the crypto market does not exist in a vacuum. The decisions made by central banks and the health of the global economy are deeply intertwined with the performance of digital assets. By paying attention to these crucial global macroeconomic events , crypto investors can gain a significant edge, making more informed decisions and navigating potential market turbulence with greater confidence. Staying ahead of the curve means understanding not just crypto-specific news, but also the broader economic currents that shape the entire financial world. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are global macroeconomic events? A1: Global macroeconomic events are significant economic announcements, policy decisions, or data releases from major countries or international bodies that have the potential to influence financial markets worldwide. Examples include central bank interest rate decisions, inflation reports, and employment data. Q2: How do interest rate decisions affect cryptocurrency prices? A2: Interest rate decisions impact the cost of borrowing and the attractiveness of ‘risk-off’ assets like government bonds versus ‘risk-on’ assets like cryptocurrencies. Higher rates typically strengthen traditional currencies and can reduce investor appetite for speculative assets, potentially leading to lower crypto prices. Lower rates can have the opposite effect. Q3: Why are U.S. jobless claims important for crypto investors? A3: U.S. initial jobless claims provide an early indication of the health of the U.S. labor market. A strong labor market might lead the Federal Reserve to maintain higher interest rates, which can be bearish for crypto. Conversely, a weakening labor market could prompt the Fed to consider easing monetary policy, potentially boosting risk assets like crypto. Q4: Should I make trading decisions solely based on these events? A4: While these events are significant drivers of market volatility, it’s generally not advisable to make trading decisions solely based on them. They should be considered as part of a broader analysis, including technical indicators, on-chain data, and your overall investment strategy. Market reactions can be unpredictable. Q5: What is ‘forward guidance’ from a central bank? A5: Forward guidance refers to communication from a central bank about the likely future path of monetary policy. It helps market participants anticipate future interest rate changes or other policy shifts, influencing their current investment decisions and market expectations.

SOL is rising drastically, and BNB is creating new ATHs. But even with all of the rush and energy in Solana and BNB, the best crypto to buy now isn’t SOL or BNB, but the newcomer Layer Brett. Layer Brett isn’t just riding the wave; it’s building its own, fusing viral meme culture with genuine blockchain utility. Currently in crypto presale for $0.0058 , $LBRETT offers early participants access to staking rewards and a scalable ecosystem, distinguishing it from older meme tokens. What Makes Layer Brett Gain Attention? While Solana and BNB have seen impressive rallies, boasting all-time highs and robust ecosystems, Layer Brett emerges with a different story. This new meme coin isn’t burdened by the utility-free origins of some peers or the congestion of traditional chains. It’s fast. Unlike the original Brett on Base, Layer Brett is purpose-built on an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, designed for performance, speed, and user rewards. It aims to outpace legacy chains like Solana by compressing fees and unlocking throughput. Layer Brett isn’t just another meme token, but it has a mission. The project is built for speed, rewards, and a whole lot of character. Leveraging Ethereum Layer 2 technology, $LBRETT processes transactions off-chain, securing them on Ethereum. This unlocks throughput, compressing fees (coverage $0.0001 per transaction) and shrinking wait times. Its evolving ecosystem includes staking and token rewards. The market is keenly observing Layer Brett’s community-first approach. Early backers in the crypto presale are positioned for potential gains, with $LBRETT available at $0.0058 . Holders can immediately stake their tokens for high-yield, Layer 2-powered rewards—over 700% APY now, but decreasing as more stake. This strong incentive, plus a $1 million giveaway, drives significant FOMO. Layer Brett aims for dominance in the burgeoning Layer 2 space. Solana Flexing Muscles Solana is no longer an “Ethereum killer” but a powerhouse in its own right, backed by institutional interest and a thriving ecosystem of DeFi and gaming projects. Technical analysis points to continued bullish moves. Institutional demand is rising, and a cup-and-handle pattern breakout says it will rise even more. BNB: A New High for a Powerhouse BNB is not just a cryptocurrency; it’s the lifeblood of the world’s largest crypto ecosystem. A recent partnership with a major global asset firm has reignited market momentum, propelling BNB to a new all-time high. But the recent ATH is just the beginning. Experts say BNB is now in “uncharted territory,” with no historical resistance to hold it back. The MACD indicator is signaling a strong bullish momentum, and the RSI is still well below overbought levels. As more institutional capital and retail investors enter the market, BNB is exceptionally positioned to not only consolidate at its new high but also initiate a powerful breakout toward the $1,000 psychological milestone and beyond. Layer Brett: Best Crypto To Buy Now Even while SOL and BNB make waves, $LBRETT is having a bigger pull. Currently priced at $0.0058 in its ongoing crypto presale, its Layer 2 tech, meme power, NFT integrations, and cross-chain interoperability via bridges show it may rival both SOL and BNB soon. Layer Brett’s approach, paired with the high APY and a $1 million giveaway position $LBRETT as the best crypto to buy now over SOL and BNB. For Layer Brett, the presale is just the beginning.

This unexpected dip has caught the attention of investors and analysts alike, prompting questions about market stability and future trajectories. According to real-time market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $114,995.29 on the Binance USDT market, signaling a moment of caution for many. What’s Driving the Current Bitcoin Price Fall? The recent confirmation that the Bitcoin price fall below $115,000 has undoubtedly sent ripples through the digital asset landscape. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it represents a notable shift from recent highs, prompting many to ask: what exactly is fueling this downturn? While a single definitive cause is often elusive in the volatile crypto market, several potential factors are currently under discussion. Market analysts are closely examining a confluence of elements. Firstly, broader macroeconomic concerns, such as inflation data or interest rate decisions, can influence investor sentiment across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Secondly, regulatory uncertainties in key regions might lead to cautious trading behavior. Moreover, significant whale movements – large transactions by individual holders – can sometimes trigger cascading sell-offs, especially in a sensitive market, further contributing to a noticeable Bitcoin price fall . Navigating Volatility: What Does This BTC Price Dip Mean for Investors? For many in the crypto community, a significant Bitcoin price fall naturally raises concerns. However, it also presents different perspectives depending on an investor’s strategy. Short-term traders might view this as an opportunity for quick gains, attempting to ‘buy the dip’ in anticipation of a swift rebound. Conversely, long-term holders, often referred to as HODLers, typically remain unfazed, focusing on Bitcoin’s fundamental value and its potential over extended periods. Understanding the broader market sentiment is crucial here. While a dip, indicative of a Bitcoin price fall , can signal fear, it can also be a healthy market correction, flushing out speculative positions. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon. It is important to avoid emotional decisions during periods of heightened volatility. Instead, focusing on a well-researched investment plan remains paramount. Actionable Strategies During a Bitcoin Price Fall When faced with a sudden Bitcoin price fall , having a clear strategy can make all the difference. Panic selling is rarely the best approach. Instead, consider these actionable insights to navigate the current market conditions effectively: Reassess Your Portfolio: Take this opportunity to review your overall cryptocurrency holdings. Is your portfolio diversified enough, or is it heavily concentrated in a few assets? Diversification can help mitigate risks during market downturns. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Rather than attempting to time the market, DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price. This strategy can reduce the impact of volatility and potentially lower your average purchase price over time. Stay Informed, Avoid FUD: Be wary of fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) circulating on social media. Rely on reputable news sources and fundamental analysis rather than reacting to every market rumor. Set Stop-Loss Orders: For active traders, setting stop-loss orders can help limit potential losses if the price continues to decline, protecting against further Bitcoin price fall . Remember, market corrections are a natural part of any financial cycle. A disciplined approach is key. The recent Bitcoin price fall below $115,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility within the cryptocurrency market. While such dips can be unsettling, they also offer valuable lessons and opportunities for those prepared to act strategically. By understanding market dynamics, maintaining a long-term perspective, and employing sound investment principles, investors can navigate these turbulent times with greater confidence. The resilience of Bitcoin has been tested many times before, and each challenge contributes to its ongoing evolution. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What caused the recent Bitcoin price fall below $115,000? A1: The recent Bitcoin price fall is likely influenced by a combination of factors, including broader macroeconomic concerns, potential regulatory uncertainties, and significant whale movements in the market. No single cause is usually responsible for such market shifts. Q2: Is it a good time to buy Bitcoin after this dip? A2: Whether it’s a good time to buy depends on your individual investment strategy, risk tolerance, and research. Some investors see dips as ‘buy the dip’ opportunities, while others prefer to wait for signs of market recovery. Consider strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging. Q3: How does this dip affect long-term Bitcoin investors? A3: Long-term Bitcoin investors, often called HODLers, typically focus on Bitcoin’s fundamental value and its potential over extended periods. Short-term price fluctuations, including this Bitcoin price fall , usually have less impact on their overall strategy, as they are prepared for volatility. Q4: What is Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)? A4: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy where you invest a fixed amount of money into an asset at regular intervals, regardless of its price. This method helps to reduce the impact of volatility and can potentially lower your average purchase price over time. Q5: Will Bitcoin recover from this price fall? A5: Historically, Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience, recovering from numerous price corrections and downturns. While past performance does not guarantee future results, many analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. Recovery depends on market sentiment, adoption, and broader economic conditions. Did you find this analysis of the recent Bitcoin price fall helpful?

The Altcoin Season Index has just reached a remarkable 73, marking its highest point in 90 days. This isn’t just a number; it’s a crucial indicator that we might be on the cusp of an official “altcoin season,” a period where alternative cryptocurrencies truly shine. For anyone invested in or watching the crypto markets, understanding this metric is key to navigating potential opportunities. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? Before diving into the implications of the current score, let’s clarify what the Altcoin Season Index truly represents. It’s a metric developed by CoinMarketCap that provides a snapshot of the broader altcoin market’s performance relative to Bitcoin. Here’s how it works: The index tracks the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Stablecoins and wrapped coins are excluded to ensure a true representation of market sentiment towards volatile assets. It compares how these altcoins have performed against Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. An “altcoin season” is officially declared when 75% of these top altcoins outperform Bitcoin during that 90-day period. A score closer to 100 signifies even stronger, more widespread altcoin performance, indicating a robust market shift. Why is the Altcoin Season Index at 73 So Significant? Reaching 73 is not just another number; it’s a powerful signal. This metric’s 90-day high tells us that a significant portion of the altcoin market is currently showing impressive strength against Bitcoin. We are now just shy of the 75-point threshold, which means the market is teetering on the edge of what many investors eagerly anticipate: a full-fledged altcoin season. This proximity to the threshold suggests growing investor confidence in altcoins. It often indicates a rotation of capital from Bitcoin, which might have seen recent gains, into promising alternative projects. Such periods can offer substantial opportunities for those who understand the dynamics at play and have done their research. What Drives Altcoin Performance During Such Periods? The rise in the Altcoin Season Index doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Several factors typically contribute to altcoins outperforming Bitcoin: Bitcoin Dominance Shifts: Often, when Bitcoin’s dominance (its share of the total crypto market cap) begins to decline, capital tends to flow into altcoins, driving their prices up. Innovation and Development: New technologies, groundbreaking partnerships, and significant protocol upgrades within various altcoin ecosystems can attract fresh investment. Market Sentiment: A general bullish sentiment in the broader crypto market, coupled with positive news or hype around specific sectors like DeFi, NFTs, or Layer 2 solutions, can fuel altcoin rallies. Retail Investor Interest: Altcoin seasons often coincide with increased interest from retail investors, who might be looking for higher-growth opportunities beyond Bitcoin. Understanding these underlying drivers can help investors anticipate and react to market movements more effectively, especially when the Altcoin Season Index signals a shift. Navigating a Potential Altcoin Season: Actionable Insights With the Altcoin Season Index flashing green, many are wondering how to best prepare. While no investment is without risk, here are some actionable insights to consider: Do Your Research: Focus on projects with strong fundamentals, clear utility, active development teams, and robust communities. Don’t just follow the hype. Diversify Your Portfolio: Instead of putting all your eggs in one basket, spread your investments across several promising altcoins to mitigate risk. Understand Risk Management: Set clear entry and exit strategies. Consider using stop-loss orders to protect against sudden downturns and take profits strategically. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, project updates, and broader economic trends that could impact the crypto space. Remember, the goal is to make informed decisions, not impulsive ones, especially when indicators like the Altcoin Season Index suggest a potentially lucrative period. Challenges and Considerations in an Altcoin-Focused Market While the prospect of an altcoin season is exciting, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent challenges and risks. The altcoin market is notoriously volatile, and prices can fluctuate dramatically in short periods. Not all altcoins will perform equally, and some may even decline despite a rising Altcoin Season Index. Furthermore, the space is not immune to scams, “rug pulls,” and projects that fail to deliver on their promises. Therefore, due diligence is paramount. The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable macro indicator, but it does not guarantee individual project success. Always be skeptical, verify information, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. In conclusion, the current rise of the Altcoin Season Index to a 90-day high of 73 is a compelling signal for the cryptocurrency market. It indicates a period of heightened interest and performance for altcoins, bringing us tantalizingly close to an official altcoin season. While opportunities may abound, a cautious, well-researched approach remains essential for navigating this dynamic landscape successfully. Staying informed and making strategic decisions based on sound analysis will be key to harnessing the potential of this exciting market phase.

An altcoin season is a period when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? The index compares the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) against Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. A higher score indicates stronger altcoin performance. What does an Altcoin Season Index of 73 mean? A score of 73 means that 73% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. It signifies that the market is very close to an official “altcoin season” threshold of 75. Should I invest in altcoins when the index is high? While a high Altcoin Season Index suggests potential opportunities, it’s crucial to conduct thorough research, understand the risks, and diversify your portfolio. It’s an indicator, not a guarantee of individual project success. What are the main risks during an altcoin season? Key risks include high volatility, potential for significant price drops, scams (like rug pulls), and the possibility that not all altcoins will perform well. Diligence and risk management are essential. Did you find this analysis of the Altcoin Season Index insightful?

Meanwhile, bigger momentum is shifting to the up-and-coming DeFi project, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which most investors think will see much higher returns throughout the next bull run. Mutuum Finance has already completed five rounds of presales with the sixth round still ongoing at a token price of $0.035. Those investors who buy tokens now will experience an immense ROI when the coin enters the open markets. Presale has 16280 supporters and has already garnered more than 15.68 million funds. While Cardano (ADA) is perpetrating its presence as one of the top layer-1 blockchains, Mutuum Finance is gaining momentum with its novel attitude to decentralized lending and capital productivity, providing investors an alternative perspective in the marketplace. Cardano Price Analysis and September Forecast ADA is currently trading at a price of $0.90 and analysts have predicted that it can rise by 15 percent in September due to the existing market strength. The blockchain is still oriented towards the development and adoption of the wider ecosystem, and its performance is directly dependent on the overall situation on the crypto market. Simultaneously, focus in the market is also being put on emergent DeFi projects like Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance and CertiK Introduce $50,000 Bug bounty A partnership with CertiK has been announced by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to implement a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program in order to invite developers, security experts, and ethical hackers to the project. The participants are rewarded when they find and report weaknesses that might affect the security of the protocol. The amount of the payout depends on the nature of the problem (minor bugs to critical threats), and the maximum payout is $50,000 in USDT. This will make the protocol more resilient, secure users, and enhance investor trust in the platform. Besides the bounty program, Mutuum Finance has introduced another program, a community giveaway of $100,000 to incentivize early adoption and user participation. Ten winners will receive $10,000 MUTM tokens, which is a reflection of the desire by the project to reward those who are joining the community. Liquidity Management, Volatility, and Market Risk Mutuum Finance incorporates an advanced model to reduce market risk, volatility, and the stability of their systems even in times of liquidity pressure. Liquidity thresholds and Loan to Value (LTV) changes according to the market conditions. Creating a Secure, Scalable and Community-Driven Ecosystem In addition to technical protection, Mutuum Finance is aimed at creating a community-oriented DeFi. Its sales performance in presale, along with its consistent security trainings and user-reward programs, emphasizes the duality of the project i.e. stability in the long term and active participation of the community. Mutuum Finance is becoming a reliable and scalable DeFi platform of tomorrow by combining a solid security architecture with incentivized participation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming one of the leading DeFi altcoins, and it is expected to be more attractive to investors aiming for greater gains during a bull-run than Cardano (ADA). Phase 6 presale tokens cost $0.035, attracting 16,280 backers and raising 15.68M, while promising early adopters the potential of huge ROI. The project has a CertiK bug bounty of $50K, community giveaway of $100K, and innovative risk and liquidity management through dynamic LTV ration and reserve funds. MUTM can be a strong competitor to the investors aiming to earn as much as possible this bull season due to its focus on the secure, scalable, and community-driven DeFi.

Mark Casey, a portfolio manager with 25 years at the firm, led the strategy. According to a Sunday report by The Wall Street Journal, Casey, who credits Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett as key influences on his investment philosophy, has become a vocal advocate for Bitcoin. “I just love Bitcoin, I just think it is so interesting,” Casey said during a podcast interview with venture firm Andreessen Horowitz. He called Bitcoin “one of the coolest things that has ever been created by people,” per the WSJ report. Over the past four years, Capital Group has expanded its exposure mainly through investments in Bitcoin treasury companies, public firms that accumulate and hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. US fund house Capital Group has appointed Henry Chan to lead financial intermediaries in Hong Kong. In his new position, Chan will manage the city’s team of financial intermediaries, focus on expanding distribution, and enhance existing working relationships with clients. He will be based in Hong Kong and will report to Toby Chan, the head of the Greater China client group. With 20 years of industry experience, Chan has considerable expertise from time spent in distribution roles at large asset managers, including seven years with Capital Group. This appointment reinstates Capital Group’s strong commitment to Hong Kong as a key market and its emphasis on delivering high-quality service through deep client relationships and thought leadership. Capital Group turns $500M Bitcoin Bet into $6.2B payday Capital Group’s most prominent Bitcoin-linked investment is in Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), the software company turned Bitcoin vehicle under founder Michael Saylor. In 2021, the firm purchased a 12.3% stake in Strategy for more than $500 million. That holding, now diluted to 7.89% through share issuance and modest trimming, is valued at roughly $6.2 billion after Strategy’s stock skyrocketed more than 2,200% over the past five years. Beyond Strategy, Capital Group also holds a 5% stake in Japan-based Metaplanet, a hotel operator that pivoted to Bitcoin, and shares in mining company Mara Holdings. Public firms hit 1M BTC milestone as buying spree slows Public companies’ Bitcoin holdings crossed the 1 million BTC milestone in August, yet overall accumulation slowed compared to July—a pause that coincided with Bitcoin’s bull market losing momentum. According to the latest Bitcoin Treasuries Adoption Report, tracked treasury entities added 47,718 BTC ($5.2 billion) last month, less than half of July’s 100,000+ BTC haul. That brought total holdings across public companies, private firms, governments, and ETFs to 3.68 million BTC, valued at around $400 billion month-end. The 1.2% monthly increase marked a sharp slowdown from July’s 4.6%. The relaxation in corporate purchases of BTC may explain why the surge higher towards $123,000 was not sustained. In mid-August, bitcoin reached an all-time high but plummeted by more than 11.5% by the month’s end to less than $109,000. The slowdown happened despite aggressive fundraising announcements. Treasury stocks would see more than $15 billion in new equity raised, including Strategy (MSTR), KindlyMD (NAKA), and Metaplanet (3350). Those commitments have not yet translated into immediate purchases, creating a split between fundraising headlines and actual market reality. MicroStrategy, rebranded as Strategy, remains the largest corporate holder with 636,505 BTC . MARA Holdings follows with more than 52,000 BTC. New entrants such as XXI and Bitcoin Standard Treasury are rapidly climbing the leaderboard, while firms including Metaplanet, Bullish, and Coinbase round out the top 10. Get seen where it counts.

Conduct Your Own Research: Never solely rely on institutional actions. Understand Solana’s fundamentals, risks, and your own investment goals. Consider Long-Term Potential: Institutional investments often indicate a long-term outlook. Evaluate SOL’s potential beyond short-term price fluctuations.

51739144,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=204348,1757899211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/51739144.jpeg,Monero Block Reorganization: Alarming Incident Sparks Hack Fears,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/monero-block-reorganization-fears/,"BitcoinWorld Monero Block Reorganization: Alarming Incident Sparks Hack Fears The Monero (XMR) network recently faced a significant and somewhat unsettling event: an alarming Monero block reorganization . On September 14th, around 9:00 a.m. UTC, the network experienced a reorganization of 18 blocks. This incident, which led to the invalidation of 118 transactions, immediately sent ripples of concern through the cryptocurrency community. Consequently, intense speculation about a potential hack quickly emerged, raising crucial questions about network stability and the robust security Monero is known for. This event served as a stark reminder of the complexities inherent in maintaining decentralized blockchain integrity. What Exactly Happened During the Alarming Monero Block Reorganization? A Monero block reorganization occurs when a temporary fork in the blockchain is resolved, and the network ultimately agrees on a single, longest chain as the canonical history. In this specific event, 18 blocks that were previously thought to be confirmed were effectively “undone” and replaced by a new, longer chain. This process, while a normal and intended part of decentralized network operation, is usually much smaller in scale, often involving only one or two blocks. The fact that 18 blocks were reorganized simultaneously is quite significant and unusual for Monero. This means that any transactions included in those 18 invalidated blocks were effectively reversed or never confirmed on the finally accepted chain. As Bitcoin.com News reported , 118 transactions were affected by this sudden shift. For users, this could translate into their sent or received Monero not having gone through as expected, potentially requiring them to resend funds or carefully verify their transaction status. Understanding the mechanism behind such an event is crucial for grasping its implications. Why Did This Monero Block Reorganization Spark Intense Hack Suspicions? The immediate community reaction to the Monero block reorganization was one of profound suspicion, largely due to the potential for a double-spend attack. In essence, a double-spend attack is an attempt to spend the same cryptocurrency twice. While Monero’s robust privacy features, such as Ring Signatures and Stealth Addresses, typically make such tracking incredibly difficult, the large-scale reorganization fueled fears that a malicious actor might have exploited a vulnerability to execute such an attack. Moreover, Monero’s inherent privacy, while a core benefit for its users, also means that tracing the invalidated transactions or identifying any potential perpetrators becomes extremely challenging. This limited transparency into the “why” of the event can heighten anxiety during unusual network occurrences. Community discussions across various forums, including Reddit and Twitter, quickly erupted, with users trying to piece together the events, analyze the implications, and seek reassurance from developers and fellow enthusiasts. The lack of immediate clear answers amplified the initial concerns. Understanding the Implications of a Monero Block Reorganization for Users For everyday Monero users, a large-scale Monero block reorganization can be both confusing and inconvenient. If your transaction was among the 118 invalidated ones, it means your funds were not confirmed on the final, accepted blockchain. You would then need to resend those transactions once the network had stabilized and your wallet was fully synchronized. Key takeaways and actionable insights for users: Always Verify Transactions: It is paramount to always verify that your Monero transactions have received sufficient confirmations, especially during periods of reported network instability or unusual activity. Maintain Wallet Synchronization: Ensure your Monero wallet is consistently and fully synchronized with the latest blockchain. This ensures that your balance and transaction history accurately reflect the current state of the network.

This significant milestone, highlighted by data from Token Terminal, is not just a number; it is a powerful indicator of the growing maturity, utility, and confidence within the digital asset ecosystem. It signals a pivotal moment for stablecoins and their foundational role in the broader crypto economy. What Drives This Remarkable Growth in Ethereum-based Stablecoins? To truly appreciate this surge, it helps to understand what Ethereum-based stablecoins are. Essentially, these are digital currencies built on the Ethereum blockchain that maintain a stable value, usually pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ether, stablecoins offer a reliable store of value and a medium of exchange. Several factors contribute to their remarkable ascent: Market Stability: In an often-volatile crypto market, stablecoins provide a crucial haven. Traders use them to lock in profits or avoid downturns without converting back to traditional fiat currency. DeFi Dominance: Ethereum hosts the largest and most vibrant Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Ethereum-based stablecoins are the lifeblood of DeFi, serving as collateral for lending, borrowing, and liquidity provision on decentralized exchanges. Global Utility: They facilitate fast, low-cost international remittances and payments, bypassing traditional banking hurdles. This utility is particularly attractive for users seeking efficient cross-border transactions. The $168 billion figure underscores their widespread adoption and essential function across various crypto applications. It confirms their status as a cornerstone of the digital financial world. The Impact of Surging Ethereum-based Stablecoins on DeFi and Beyond The immense growth of Ethereum-based stablecoins carries profound implications for both the DeFi sector and the wider financial landscape. Their increased supply provides deeper liquidity, which is vital for the smooth functioning of decentralized applications. Consider the benefits: Enhanced Liquidity: A larger supply means more capital is available for trading, lending, and other financial activities within DeFi protocols. This leads to better price execution and reduced slippage for users. Increased Accessibility: Stablecoins lower the barrier to entry for individuals worldwide to participate in financial services, regardless of their geographical location or access to traditional banking. Innovation Catalyst: The reliability of stablecoins fosters innovation, enabling developers to build more complex and robust financial products and services on Ethereum.

This kind of explosive rally makes many wonder: Is it the best crypto to buy now, or are there alternative opportunities emerging? While MYX shows what’s possible, the Layer Brett presale offers a distinct path, combining meme appeal with tangible Layer 2 utility and high staking rewards. It’s a compelling alternative. MYX Finance’s Explosive Rally and Its Market Context The recent performance of MYX has been nothing short of spectacular. This decentralized derivatives exchange has seen its price climb from an all-time low in June to nearly $19 in September, marking a gain of over 40,000%. MYX boasts a market capitalization of approximately $1.88 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of about $209 million. Its all-time high of $18.92 was reached just days ago, on September 11, 2025. This rapid ascent, however, comes with extreme volatility, including intraday swings that can exceed 200%. For some investors, the question becomes: how sustainable is this momentum?

Business executives greatly attributed Trump’s threatening tariff policies to be the root cause of the situation, resulting in higher costs and a barrier to expansion plans. Among the industries affected were manufacturing, wholesale and retail, and the energy sector . Julie Robbins, the CEO and co-owner of EarthQuaker Devices, a guitar pedal manufacturer based in Akron, Ohio, commented on the topic of discussion. According to Robbins, these tariff policies have dragged behind the process of manufacturing industries and reduced the advantages manufacturers like her enjoyed earlier. She referred to the tariffs as unexpected taxes and obstacles to the industry’s hiring and growth. The US job market declines amid Trump’s threatening tariff policies Robbins described her business strategy before the imposition of Trump’s tariff policies. According to her, she would normally want to hire around three to four more workers for her work group of 35 members; however, since Trump’s tariff policies took effect, Robbins’ company is now operating effectively on a hiring freeze. In a statement, the manufacturer mentioned that they cannot hire more workers or expand their businesses unless stability in policy and predictability in costs are ensured. She added that they were currently forced to operate in an unpredictable, tough environment. This decline in the job market has prompted economists to anticipate that the US Federal Reserve will reduce interest rates for the first time in 2025 next week. Concerning this situation, Jerome Powell, the United States Federal Reserve Chairman, pointed out that slowing job growth might lessen the inflationary impacts of Trump’s tariff policies. Meanwhile, reliable sources reveal that August’s poor job reports resulted from the effects of Trump’s tariffs on the production sector. Based on the report, the US economy’s hiring drastically decreased with the addition of only 22,000 jobs. To break down the losses encountered in the job market in 2025, the manufacturing sector was significantly hit with a loss of 12,000 jobs, accounting for 78,000 of the total losses, and the mining sector, which includes gas and oil, faced a loss of 6,000 jobs. Additionally, the wholesale trade sector’s employment rate decreased by 32,000. In August, industrial executive John Deere complained that these tariffs had cost them $300 million and were likely to double by the end of the year. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has stated that the job market decrease was observed earlier, even before Trump took office. Based on their data, there were one million fewer jobs available than in March last year. Despite the ongoing challenges, the Trump administration claims these tariffs encourage US firms to invest more in their operations to bring back production. According to their argument, this will soon lead to a significant boost in employment. Industry leaders encounter hardship in their operations amid economic uncertainties Scott Bessent, a United States Secretary of the Treasury, also commented on the topic of discussion. According to Bessent, “For every John Deere, we have companies telling us, ‘The tariffs have benefited our business, we’re boosting our capital expenditures and planning to hire more workers.” His statement contradicts the reports from some industry leaders. According to them, they fear hiring more workers because of economic uncertainties affecting their operations. An example of these industry leaders is Traci Tapani, the CEO of Wyoming Machine, a metal fabrication firm. Tapani stated that she has encountered hardship in operating her company due to the fast changes in tariffs and the back-and-forth nature of things. She further highlighted that this situation has triggered them to apply a strategy whereby they do not replace workers who leave the company. Notably, most of the industries affected are those that US President Donald Trump pledged to revive during his campaign. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

This week brings a significant event for several digital assets: major token unlocks . According to detailed analytics from Tokenomist, investors and enthusiasts alike should be aware of a substantial release of tokens, including a whopping $90.5 million in OP tokens. These scheduled releases can sometimes introduce notable volatility, making it crucial to understand their implications for your portfolio and overall market dynamics. What Exactly Are Token Unlocks and Why Do They Matter? In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, token unlocks refer to the process where previously restricted digital tokens are released into the circulating supply. These tokens are often held by early investors, project team members, or advisors, typically under vesting schedules. Vesting is a mechanism designed to prevent a massive sell-off immediately after a project’s launch, ensuring long-term commitment. While essential for a project’s sustained health and decentralized distribution, these unlocks can significantly increase the available supply of a token on exchanges. Consequently, the market impact can be quite varied: Increased Supply: More tokens becoming available can, theoretically, put downward pressure on prices if market demand doesn’t keep pace with the new influx. Investor Sentiment: The anticipation of large unlocks often creates FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) among existing holders, potentially leading to pre-emptive selling as they brace for a price dip. However, it’s not always a negative outcome. Sometimes, the market has already factored in the unlock event, or strong buying pressure absorbs the new supply without significant price changes. Therefore, understanding the specifics of each unlock, including the project’s fundamentals, is absolutely key. Key Token Unlocks to Watch This Week (Sept. 15-21) This particular week is poised to be quite active, featuring several notable token unlocks that warrant investor attention. Here’s a detailed breakdown of what’s scheduled: Sept. 15, 12:00 p.m. UTC: SEI will unlock 55.56 million tokens, valued at approximately $18.42 million. This release represents 1.18% of its current circulating supply. Sept. 16, 1:00 p.m. UTC: ARB is set to unlock 92.65 million tokens, worth about $47.83 million, accounting for 2.03% of its circulating supply. Sept. 17, 8:00 a.m. UTC: ZK will see 173 million tokens unlocked, valued at $10.32 million, which is 3.61% of its circulating supply. Sept. 17, 12:30 p.m. UTC: APE has 15.60 million tokens scheduled for release, totaling $9.35 million, or 1.72% of its circulating supply. Sept. 18, 12:00 a.m. UTC: FTM will unlock 20 million tokens, an impressive $89.80 million, making up 2.08% of its circulating supply. Sept. 20, 12:00 a.m. UTC: VELO is preparing for a substantial release of three billion tokens, valued at $47.73 million, which is a significant 13.63% of its circulating supply. Sept. 21, 12:00 a.m. UTC: OP will experience the largest unlock this week, with 116 million tokens valued at $90.49 million, representing 6.89% of its circulating supply. These figures clearly highlight the sheer volume of assets poised to enter the market. Investors should pay close attention to the percentages relative to the circulating supply, as larger percentages can sometimes lead to more pronounced price effects. How Can Savvy Investors Prepare for Upcoming Token Unlocks ? Proactive preparation for these events is paramount for minimizing potential risks and, conversely, maximizing opportunities. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Research Thoroughly: Always delve into the project’s fundamentals. Is there strong, ongoing development activity? What is the community sentiment like? A robust project with clear utility might absorb unlocks more easily. Monitor Market Sentiment: Keep a close eye on social media discussions, crypto news outlets, and on-chain data. Is there significant chatter around a particular unlock? This can offer valuable clues about potential short-term price action. Evaluate Your Position: If you currently hold any of the tokens facing unlocks, it’s wise to evaluate your personal risk tolerance. You might consider hedging strategies or adjusting your position if you are concerned about immediate volatility. Look for Entry Points: For some astute investors, unlocks can paradoxically present compelling opportunities. If a token’s price dips post-unlock due to the increased supply, it could be an attractive entry point for long-term holders who possess strong conviction in the project’s future potential. Remember, the cryptocurrency market is inherently dynamic and often unpredictable. While token unlocks are a known and scheduled factor, their precise impact can vary significantly depending on overall market conditions, broader economic trends, and project-specific developments. Staying well-informed and adaptable is your best strategy. A Deeper Dive: The Long-Term View on Token Unlocks While short-term price movements often capture the immediate attention, it’s equally important to consider the long-term implications of token unlocks . For many legitimate projects, these unlocks are a natural and planned component of their economic model. They are designed to reward early contributors, incentivize ongoing development, and ensure a more decentralized distribution of tokens over time. Therefore, they are not inherently negative; rather, they often signify the maturation of a project and the systematic execution of its planned tokenomics. Successful projects typically navigate these unlock phases by maintaining strong community engagement, consistently delivering on their roadmaps, and demonstrating tangible, real-world utility for their tokens. This consistent progress helps to build investor confidence and sustained demand, which can effectively offset the increased supply. Consequently, looking beyond the immediate price action and focusing on the project’s underlying fundamentals remains a prudent strategy for long-term investors. Key Takeaways: Navigating This Week’s Major Token Unlocks This week certainly presents a series of significant token unlocks , with OP, FTM, and VELO experiencing particularly substantial releases. While these events inherently carry the potential for short-term market volatility, they are also an integral, planned part of a cryptocurrency project’s lifecycle. By remaining informed, conducting thorough due diligence, and understanding the broader market context, you can navigate these releases more effectively. Ultimately, successful investing in the fast-paced crypto space demands a proactive and well-researched approach to understanding market dynamics. Keep a close watch on these critical dates and carefully assess how they might influence your current holdings and future investment decisions. Indeed, knowledge is power, especially when it comes to anticipating and reacting to shifts in the crypto market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Token Unlocks Q1: What is a token unlock? A token unlock is when a predetermined amount of cryptocurrency tokens, previously held in a locked state (often by founders, team members, or early investors), are released into the circulating supply. These tokens are typically subject to a vesting schedule. Q2: Why do projects implement token unlocks? Projects use vesting schedules and token unlocks to ensure long-term commitment from team members and early investors. It also helps to prevent a large supply of tokens from flooding the market immediately after launch, promoting more stable growth. Q3: How do token unlocks affect the market price? Token unlocks can increase the circulating supply of a token. If demand doesn’t rise proportionally, this increased supply can potentially lead to downward pressure on the token’s price. However, the actual impact varies greatly depending on market sentiment, the project’s fundamentals, and overall market conditions. Q4: Should I sell my tokens before an unlock? Whether to sell before an unlock depends on your personal investment strategy, risk tolerance, and belief in the project’s long-term potential. Some investors might sell to avoid potential short-term dips, while others might hold or even buy more if they see a dip as a buying opportunity. Always do your own research. Q5: Are all token unlocks negative for price? Not necessarily. While they can introduce volatility, many unlocks are anticipated and already priced into the market. Strong projects with active development and community support can often absorb unlocks without significant negative impact. Sometimes, a post-unlock dip can even be seen as a healthy market correction or a chance for new investors to enter. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

Security Audits: Conducting thorough security checks to protect user assets. Regulatory Compliance: Adapting to new or evolving regulatory requirements. Technical Issues: Addressing unforeseen technical challenges related to the specific asset. Users should remain patient and monitor Bithumb’s official communication channels for further updates regarding the exact reasons or the expected duration of the suspension. Immediate Actions for ZETA Holders If you hold ZETA deposits on Bithumb or plan to interact with the asset, taking immediate action is paramount. Here’s what you should consider: Review Your Holdings: Check your ZETA balance on Bithumb before the deadline. Plan Ahead: If you need to deposit or withdraw ZETA, ensure these transactions are completed well before 9:00 a.m. UTC on September 16. Stay Informed: Regularly check Bithumb’s official announcements page or their social media channels for any new information. Consider Alternatives (if necessary): For those needing to transact ZETA during the suspension period, exploring other reputable exchanges that support ZETA might be an option, though always exercise caution.

Understanding the Impact on Your ZETA Deposits A temporary suspension of ZETA deposits and withdrawals means that during the specified period, you will not be able to move ZETA tokens into or out of your Bithumb account. Your existing ZETA holdings within the exchange will remain secure, but their liquidity will be temporarily restricted. This situation highlights the importance of understanding exchange policies and being prepared for such operational adjustments. While inconvenient, these measures are often in place to safeguard the integrity of the trading environment and protect users from potential issues during critical operational periods. What Happens After the Suspension of ZETA Deposits? Typically, once the underlying reason for the suspension is resolved, Bithumb will announce the resumption of ZETA deposits and withdrawals. This process usually involves another official communication detailing the exact time and any new procedures. It’s rare for such suspensions to be permanent unless there are significant underlying issues with the asset itself or regulatory mandates. Therefore, while the immediate impact is a temporary halt, the expectation is that services will eventually resume. Keeping an eye on Bithumb’s official news will be key to knowing when you can once again freely manage your ZETA tokens on the platform.

The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) behind Polkadot has made a monumental decision, approving a proposal to cap the total Polkadot DOT supply at 2.1 billion. This isn’t just a technical tweak; it’s a strategic move with significant implications for the future of one of the blockchain world’s most ambitious projects. If you’re invested in DOT or simply curious about the evolution of crypto economics, this development is certainly worth your attention. What Does This Historic Polkadot DOT Supply Cap Mean? Imagine a world where the total number of something valuable is fixed. That’s essentially what the Polkadot community has decided for its native token, DOT. The proposal, which garnered an impressive 81% approval from the DAO, sets a hard limit on the total supply of DOT tokens. This means no more than 2.1 billion DOT will ever exist. This isn’t an overnight change. The plan involves a gradual reduction in the issuance of new DOT tokens, which will occur every two years. Think of it as a pre-scheduled, controlled deflationary mechanism. The aim is to introduce scarcity and predictability into Polkadot’s economic model, potentially enhancing its long-term value proposition. How Will the Polkadot DOT Supply Cap Be Implemented? Understanding the ‘how’ behind this decision is key. Polkadot operates with a robust governance model, where its community members, through the DAO, vote on crucial network upgrades and policy changes. The overwhelming support for the Polkadot DOT supply cap underscores a strong consensus within the community for this direction. The phased reduction in DOT issuance is designed to be smooth and predictable. It aims to avoid sudden shocks to the ecosystem while steadily moving towards the 2.1 billion cap. This approach reflects a thoughtful consideration of network stability and participant incentives. It’s a bit like Bitcoin’s halving events, but with a different schedule and mechanism, specifically tailored for Polkadot’s unique architecture. The Potential Benefits and Challenges of Limiting DOT Every major economic shift brings both opportunities and considerations. For Polkadot, capping the DOT supply could unlock several benefits: Increased Scarcity: A finite supply often leads to a perception of higher value, especially as demand grows. Predictable Economics: Knowing the maximum supply provides clarity for investors and developers, aiding long-term planning. Inflation Control: It helps to combat potential inflation, making DOT a more attractive asset over time. However, there are also challenges to consider: Flexibility Concerns: A hard cap might limit the network’s ability to issue new tokens for specific future needs, such as incentivizing new parachains or securing the network during unforeseen circumstances. Ecosystem Growth: Balancing token scarcity with the need to fund and incentivize a growing ecosystem will be an ongoing task for the DAO. What’s Next for Polkadot After This Supply Decision? This historic decision sets a new trajectory for Polkadot. It signals a mature approach to economic management within a decentralized framework. For existing DOT holders, this move could reinforce confidence in the asset’s long-term potential, as scarcity often drives value. Developers building on Polkadot’s parachain ecosystem might also see this as a positive signal, indicating a commitment to a stable and valuable underlying asset. It encourages deeper engagement and investment in the network’s future. The focus will now shift to how Polkadot continues to innovate and attract users within this new supply framework. The approval of the Polkadot DOT supply cap at 2.1 billion marks a pivotal moment for the project. It reflects a strong community vision for a more stable, predictable, and potentially more valuable token economy. As Polkadot continues to evolve its multi-chain architecture, this decision positions DOT for a future where scarcity and decentralized governance play an even more central role. It’s a bold step, and the crypto world will be watching closely to see its full impact unfold. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the new cap for Polkadot (DOT) supply? The Polkadot DAO has approved a proposal to cap the total supply of DOT tokens at 2.1 billion. 2. Why did the Polkadot DAO approve this supply cap?

At the time of the chart, XRP was trading near $3.11. The chart included several technical indicators and annotations that outlined why the analyst expects such a move. The most notable feature was the use of Fibonacci extensions, with the 1.618 level marked around $4.45, the 2.618 level near $6.16, and the 3.618 level positioned at approximately $8.52. Papa highlighted these levels as part of the technical case for the projection, with the highest extension coinciding with the stated target. A breakout structure was also illustrated, showing a descending trendline being broken to the upside, with a large arrow indicating a projected strong advance toward the target zone. system says 8.50 $XRP by november pic.twitter.com/0CuHSXqGmR — papa (@mamagucci) September 13, 2025 An RSI reading was included on the chart, showing values in the low 60s, specifically around 60.94 and 62.17. This placement suggests momentum is leaning positive without yet entering an overbought range on the two-week chart, which supports the analyst’s bullish stance. Papa’s annotations explain the alignment between Fibonacci extensions, the breakout structure, and the RSI positioning, pointing toward a system-based signal for continuation higher. Community’s Reactions The post received replies ranging from skepticism to outright dismissal. A user named Word Noise wrote , “*december *january *february *whenever we feel like flipping the switch,” indicating doubt over the strict timeline presented by Papa. Another user, CerealKiller, countered the bullish outlook by stating , “System says XRP top will be JackSparrow added a sarcastic comment, writing , “Yes. By November 2090,” to highlight disbelief in the November 2025 target. The framing of the projection Papa’s tweet definitively delivers the forecast, presenting the $8.50 target as a system-driven conclusion rather than a speculative scenario. The chart itself is presented with technical precision, incorporating Fibonacci levels and breakout geometry to back the claim.

Considerations for the forecast The projection outlines a clear bullish scenario and demonstrates the technical basis for the target. At the same time, it is a forecast based on technical analysis tools that does not factor in market conditions such as regulatory developments , liquidity shifts, or macroeconomic changes that could affect XRP’s trajectory . Papa’s post sets out a specific timeframe and price level, marking a bold forecast in line with the system referenced.

There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $4,660 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).

In his post, he compared two charts labeled “Before” and “After,” illustrating the development of the price action. He stated that his earlier four-hour prediction was accurate, with the move now unfolding in line with the analysis he provided previously. #XRP : Breaking Out of the Descending Channel (UPDATE): Before: After: https://t.co/MfECqhPoOY pic.twitter.com/7XxVM0tqlX — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) September 13, 2025 Technical Levels Highlighted In the “Before” chart, XRP was still trading within the descending channel. The chart displayed both the 21-period and 100-period exponential moving averages, with an inset illustration of an ascending triangle formation showing potential entry and target points. In the “After” chart, XRP’s price is shown above the upper boundary of the channel, signaling the breakout Egrag Crypto highlighted. The updated chart shows XRP testing and breaking through the 3.03000 level, which is marked as a significant point of resistance. Above this level, the next target identified is 3.12122. On the downside, Egrag marked 2.99053 as an important support area to watch, with a lower support zone highlighted at 2.85500. The 21 EMA is positioned directly beneath recent candles in the updated chart, with the analyst emphasizing its role as a dynamic support level in this move. Implications of the Update Egrag Crypto’s update presents the breakout as confirmation of the anticipated measured move. His focus on the 21 EMA suggests that it is a key reference point for judging whether the breakout sustains. Maintaining price action above 3.03000 strengthens the case for continuation toward 3.12122, while a breakdown below the 2.99053 support would put pressure back on the structure and shift focus to 2.85500.

The agreement will draw in investment for new plants and reactors in the country. U.S. President Donald Trump lands in Britain on Tuesday for a 2-day state visit. During the trip, Trump and Starmer are due to set out the nuclear partnership and the various projects lined up for development. The plan is to speed up the investments and funding for nuclear development. Among the steps expected is an announcement by US-based X-energy and British-based Centrica to pursue the development of over 12 modular reactors in areas of northeast England. The move would add to efforts to grow a fleet of next-generation nuclear units that can be built faster than traditional plants. Another package being lined up is an £11 billion ($15 billion) plan for the development of advanced data centres that run on small modular reactors at Cottam coal power site in central England. US-based Holtec International is expected to announce the project in collaboration with France’s EDF and property partner Tritax. Starmer and Trump discussed closer work on small modular reactors earlier during their meeting at the U.S. president’s Scotland resort in July. “These major commitments set us well on course to a golden age of nuclear that will drive down household bills in the long run,” Starmer said on Monday. In a government statement, Chris Wright, US Energy Secretary said, “Today’s commercial deals set up a framework to unleash commercial access in both the U.S. and UK.” The UK government has also pledged £14 billion ($19 billion) for a new power plant at Sizewell C and is advancing plans for a Rolls-Royce unit to deliver the country’s first small modular reactors. Officials argue that a bigger nuclear fleet will strengthen energy security and help cut exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices. The Sizewell C is plant will add over £200,000 per year to energy bills The growing pipeline also comes with costs. Analysis by Cornwall Insight shows the development cost for Sizewell C will result in the addition of over £200,000 a year to the energy bills of major businesses that haven’t received exemptions. These companies will face levies of about £221,000 in 2026 to help fund Sizewell C. Separate funds to upgrade and extend electricity cables will separately add around £100,000 for large users who haven’t received exemptions, from April 2026, rising to £250,000 by 2030. This means that a rough increase of 5% is expected on the energy bills of these affected companies. Currently, steelmakers are among the top 500 largest electricity consumers. They receive a discount of 60% on network charges, which is set to increase to 90% by 2026. Centrica to support £10 billion modular nuclear reactors plan Centrica is also deepening its nuclear race as part of a £10 billion plan with U.S. partner X-energy to bring advanced modular reactors to the UK. The companies said they have signed am agreement for the deployment of X-energy’s Xe-100 reactors in Britain. The first step is to 12 80-megawatt units at a site in Hartlepool, with output claimed to be enough to power 1.5 million homes. The plan follows Centrica’s £1.3 billion investment for a 15 per cent stake in the 3.2GW Sizewell C project. Advanced nuclear modular reactors tend to be smaller and a lot more flexible compared with conventional plants, allowing them to be added in stages. X-energy says the Xe-100 design has been completed, and its first plant is being developed in Texas. Downing Street says the transatlantic deal is designed to line up private capital and speed delivery of new stations. Ministers link the programme to lower long-term bills, even as near-term charges for heavy power users continue to rise under existing levies already.

A significant announcement from Binance is making waves across the crypto community. The platform has revealed a temporary Binance OM suspension for both deposits and withdrawals, a crucial update that requires immediate attention from users. This move, while temporary, has important implications for those holding or planning to transact with OM. What’s Happening with OM on Binance? Binance has confirmed it will temporarily halt deposits and withdrawals for OM. This specific Binance OM suspension is scheduled to begin promptly at 3:00 a.m. UTC on September 26. It is important for users to mark this date and time. Deposits Affected: OM deposits will be suspended on the Ethereum network.

It underscores the importance of staying informed about exchange announcements and planning your crypto activities accordingly. Actionable Steps for OM Investors Given the upcoming Binance OM suspension , it is crucial for OM holders to take proactive steps. Timely action can help mitigate any potential disruptions to your crypto management strategy. Here are some immediate actions you should consider: Review Your Holdings: Check your Binance account to ascertain your current OM balance. Plan Transfers Now: If you intend to deposit or withdraw OM, ensure these transactions are completed well before the 3:00 a.m. UTC deadline on September 26. Stay Updated: Regularly monitor official Binance announcement channels for any further updates regarding the suspension, including its duration and resumption of services. Being prepared and acting swiftly will ensure that you are not caught off guard by the temporary halt in services. Looking Ahead: The Importance of Staying Informed The temporary Binance OM suspension serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market and the platforms that facilitate its trading. While such suspensions can be inconvenient, they are often a necessary part of maintaining a robust and secure digital asset ecosystem. Always prioritize staying informed through official channels. This practice not only helps you navigate temporary service changes but also empowers you to make well-informed decisions regarding your digital assets. Your vigilance is your best asset in the fast-paced world of crypto. Summary: Binance is implementing a temporary suspension of OM deposits and withdrawals starting September 26, 3:00 a.m. UTC, affecting Ethereum and BSC networks.

James, the insightful co-founder and a core developer of MAP Protocol (MAPO), recently made waves with a bold declaration: he will no longer be selling his personal holdings of MAPO. Even more compelling, he plans to channel his daily profits directly into consistent MAPO buybacks . This strategic move is poised to strengthen the token’s foundation and bolster community confidence. What’s Driving the MAPO Buybacks Initiative? James shared his groundbreaking intentions on X, outlining a personal commitment to the MAP Protocol’s long-term success. His decision to cease selling his holdings is a powerful statement, demonstrating unwavering faith in the project. Furthermore, his pledge to utilize daily profits for MAPO buybacks signals a proactive approach to supporting the token’s value. This isn’t just a personal endeavor; James is also actively engaging the ButterSwap team, encouraging them to dedicate their profits to this same buyback initiative. Such concerted efforts can create a substantial impact on the token’s ecosystem. This latest development builds upon an earlier indication from last month, where James first hinted at plans for a MAPO buyback. The recent announcement provides more concrete details and a clear path forward, transforming an idea into an actionable strategy. Understanding Token Buybacks and Their Benefits For those new to the concept, a token buyback occurs when a project, or a significant holder like James, repurchases its own tokens from the open market. This action typically has several positive implications: Reduced Supply: By buying back tokens, the circulating supply is effectively decreased. According to basic economic principles, a reduced supply, assuming constant or increasing demand, can lead to an increase in the token’s value. Increased Demand: The act of buying itself creates demand for the token, which can further support its price. Investor Confidence: A consistent buyback program signals strong belief from core developers and the project team in the token’s future. This can significantly boost investor confidence and attract new holders. Price Stability: Regular buybacks can help absorb selling pressure, potentially leading to greater price stability for the token. The commitment to daily MAPO buybacks , especially from a co-founder, demonstrates a dedication that resonates deeply within the crypto community. It reflects a tangible investment in the project’s future, beyond just development work. The Potential Impact of ButterSwap Joining the MAPO Buybacks James’s efforts to persuade the ButterSwap team to join the MAPO buybacks initiative are particularly noteworthy. ButterSwap, as a decentralized exchange (DEX) within the ecosystem, generates its own profits from trading fees. If ButterSwap allocates a portion of these profits towards repurchasing MAPO tokens, the scale of the buyback program could significantly expand. This collaboration would: Amplify Market Impact: Combining personal and protocol-level profits for buybacks would create a more substantial and consistent buying force in the market. Strengthen Ecosystem Synergy: It showcases a unified vision across different components of the MAP Protocol ecosystem, reinforcing trust and cohesion. Sustainable Growth: Utilizing operational profits for buybacks creates a self-sustaining mechanism for supporting the token’s value, independent of external capital injections. Such a multi-faceted approach to MAPO buybacks could set a precedent for how projects engage with their native tokens, prioritizing long-term value and community benefit. What Does This Mean for MAP Protocol’s Future? This initiative underscores a robust commitment to the MAP Protocol’s long-term vision. MAP Protocol aims to be a leading Web3 infrastructure for omnichain interoperability, enabling seamless communication and asset transfer across various blockchains. A strong, stable native token like MAPO is crucial for fueling this vision, incentivizing network participants, and securing the protocol. While buybacks are generally positive, it’s always important for investors to conduct their own research and understand that market dynamics are influenced by many factors. However, the transparent and proactive stance taken by James, particularly regarding MAPO buybacks , provides a compelling narrative for the project’s future. In conclusion, James’s announcement of daily MAPO buybacks, coupled with his efforts to involve ButterSwap, marks a pivotal moment for MAP Protocol. This strategic move demonstrates a deep commitment from leadership, aiming to foster greater token stability, enhance investor confidence, and ultimately contribute to the sustained growth and success of the MAP Protocol ecosystem. It’s a testament to the belief in the project’s mission to build a truly interoperable Web3 future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is MAP Protocol (MAPO)? MAP Protocol is a leading Web3 infrastructure focused on omnichain interoperability, enabling seamless and secure communication and asset transfer across different blockchain networks. Its native token is MAPO. What are token buybacks in cryptocurrency? Token buybacks involve a project or a significant holder repurchasing its own tokens from the open market. This action aims to reduce the circulating supply, increase demand, and potentially stabilize or increase the token’s value. How do these MAPO buybacks benefit token holders? MAPO buybacks can benefit holders by potentially reducing the token’s circulating supply, which can lead to increased scarcity and upward price pressure. They also signal strong confidence from the project’s leadership, boosting overall investor trust. Who is James from MAP Protocol? James is the co-founder and a core developer of MAP Protocol. He recently announced his personal commitment to daily MAPO buybacks using his profits and is encouraging ButterSwap to join the initiative. What is ButterSwap’s role in this initiative? ButterSwap is a decentralized exchange within the MAP Protocol ecosystem. James is persuading the ButterSwap team to use its operational profits to participate in the MAPO buybacks, which would significantly amplify the initiative’s impact. Do MAPO buybacks guarantee a price increase? While MAPO buybacks are generally a positive indicator and can support token value, they do not guarantee a price increase.

Following a recent security breach, the Sui (SUI)-based trading platform is taking decisive action to support its community. Nemo Protocol has announced an innovative plan to issue temporary NEOM debt tokens as a core component of its compensation strategy for those affected by the hack. This move highlights a proactive approach to restoring trust and ensuring victim recovery. What Exactly Are NEOM Debt Tokens? Nemo Protocol, a decentralized trading platform operating on the Sui blockchain, recently experienced a significant security incident. This unfortunate event led to losses for many users, prompting an immediate response from the protocol’s team. To address the situation, Nemo Protocol is introducing NEOM debt tokens , a unique solution designed to provide flexible and stable compensation. These tokens are not just any digital asset; they are specifically designed to represent a debt owed by the protocol to its users. Crucially, each NEOM debt token will be backed by the U.S. dollar, ensuring a stable value for victims. This backing is a key feature, aiming to mitigate further volatility for those who have already experienced losses. Why Are NEOM Debt Tokens a Preferred Option for Compensation? The decision to issue NEOM debt tokens offers several compelling advantages for victims. Instead of immediate direct dollar payments, which might not suit everyone’s preferences or regional financial regulations, these tokens provide an alternative. Victims who prefer not to receive direct dollar payments will have the option to receive NEOM debt tokens. Stability: Being backed by the U.S. dollar, the NEOM debt tokens offer a stable value, protecting recipients from further market fluctuations. Flexibility: This approach provides choice.

Transparency: The issuance of these tokens provides a clear, auditable record of compensation, enhancing trust and accountability. This strategy demonstrates Nemo Protocol’s commitment to finding a fair and user-centric solution during a challenging time. It acknowledges the diverse needs of its user base, offering a tailored recovery path. How Will the NEOM Debt Tokens Be Distributed and Redeemed? The exact mechanics of distribution and redemption for the NEOM debt tokens are crucial for victims. Nemo Protocol plans to distribute these tokens to eligible users based on their verified losses from the hack. The process will likely involve a claims portal or a direct airdrop to affected wallet addresses. While the tokens are temporary, their redemption mechanism will be clearly outlined. Users will have the option to convert their NEOM debt tokens back into U.S. dollars at a later, specified date, or potentially use them for other purposes within the Nemo Protocol ecosystem. Details regarding the redemption timeline and any associated procedures will be communicated transparently by the Nemo Protocol team. The implementation of this system requires careful planning and execution to ensure fairness and efficiency. Nemo Protocol is expected to provide comprehensive guidelines to all affected users, ensuring they understand their options and the steps involved in claiming and utilizing their compensation. What Does This Mean for Nemo Protocol’s Future? The introduction of NEOM debt tokens is more than just a compensation mechanism; it’s a critical step in Nemo Protocol’s journey to rebuild trust and fortify its platform. By addressing the hack’s aftermath proactively and transparently, the protocol aims to demonstrate resilience and a strong commitment to its community. Moving forward, Nemo Protocol will undoubtedly focus on enhancing its security infrastructure, implementing more robust auditing processes, and fostering a stronger, more secure environment for its users. This incident, while unfortunate, presents an opportunity for the protocol to emerge stronger and more reliable. Conclusion: A Resilient Path Forward with NEOM Debt Tokens Nemo Protocol’s decision to issue NEOM debt tokens represents a thoughtful and user-centric approach to hack compensation. By offering a dollar-backed, stable alternative to direct payments, the protocol is empowering victims with choice and stability during a difficult period. This innovative solution not only addresses immediate losses but also lays a foundation for rebuilding trust and reinforcing the platform’s commitment to security and user welfare. As Nemo Protocol navigates this challenging phase, its proactive measures with NEOM debt tokens set a precedent for resilience in the decentralized finance space.

Recently, a significant event sent ripples across the digital asset landscape: a massive crypto futures liquidation totaling an astonishing $95 million in just 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH) found itself at the forefront of this market upheaval, highlighting the inherent volatility and risks associated with leveraged trading. What is a Crypto Futures Liquidation, and Why Does it Matter? For those new to the intricacies of crypto trading, understanding what a crypto futures liquidation entails is crucial. Essentially, it occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange due to a sudden and substantial price movement against their bet. This happens because the trader’s margin balance falls below the maintenance margin requirement, meaning they no longer have enough collateral to cover potential losses. It’s an automated process designed to prevent traders from incurring further debt than their initial margin. The past 24 hours witnessed a dramatic display of this mechanism, with substantial volumes being liquidated across major cryptocurrencies: ETH: A staggering $56.70 million was liquidated, with long positions (bets on price increase) accounting for a dominant 66.29% of these forced closures. DOGE: This meme coin saw $20.33 million liquidated, with an even higher percentage of long positions at 83.17%. BTC: The market’s largest cryptocurrency experienced $18.03 million in liquidations, with long positions making up 81.54%. These figures underscore a prevailing sentiment among many traders who were betting on upward price movements, only to be caught off guard by a sudden downturn or sideways consolidation that triggered their stop-loss levels or margin calls. The prevalence of long liquidations suggests that market participants were largely bullish, making them vulnerable to any negative price action. Why Did This Massive Crypto Futures Liquidation Occur? Several factors can contribute to such a significant crypto futures liquidation event. Market volatility is, without a doubt, the primary culprit. Cryptocurrencies are known for their rapid price swings, and when traders utilize high leverage, even small market movements can have outsized impacts on their positions. A sudden dip, perhaps triggered by macroeconomic news, regulatory FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt), or even a large sell-off by whales, can quickly push leveraged positions into unprofitable territory. In this particular instance, ETH leading the charge suggests that Ethereum-specific news, network developments, or broader sentiment around its ecosystem might have played a role. However, the widespread impact across DOGE and BTC indicates a broader market correction or a shift in investor confidence. When one asset experiences significant selling pressure, it often creates a ripple effect, prompting other traders to close positions or triggering automated liquidations across the board. Navigating the Risks: Lessons from the Crypto Futures Liquidation For traders, especially those engaging in futures and leveraged trading, events like this serve as a powerful reminder of the inherent risks. While leverage can amplify gains, it equally magnifies losses, leading to swift account depletion if not managed meticulously. The forced closure of positions, or a crypto futures liquidation , is a painful lesson for many who over-leveraged their trades or failed to implement robust risk management strategies. Key takeaways for traders include: Understanding Leverage: Use leverage cautiously and only when fully comprehending its implications. Implementing Stop-Losses: Always set stop-loss orders to limit potential losses on a trade. Diversification: Avoid putting all your capital into highly leveraged positions on a single asset. Market Awareness: Stay informed about market news, technical indicators, and overall sentiment. This event underscores that even established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin are not immune to sharp corrections, and Dogecoin’s higher long liquidation ratio points to its often speculative nature. What’s Next for the Crypto Market? While a $95 million crypto futures liquidation is substantial, it’s also a relatively common occurrence in the fast-paced world of digital assets. Such events often serve to ‘cleanse’ the market of over-leveraged positions, potentially setting the stage for more sustainable price movements in the future. However, they also highlight that market participants should remain vigilant and prepared for continued volatility. The recent liquidations, particularly those involving ETH, remind us that the crypto market is a dynamic environment where fortunes can change in an instant. Prudent risk management, continuous learning, and a clear understanding of market mechanics are paramount for anyone looking to navigate these exciting yet challenging waters successfully. Always prioritize capital preservation over aggressive speculation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a crypto futures liquidation? A crypto futures liquidation is the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange when their margin balance falls below the required level, preventing further losses and debt. Q2: Why did Ethereum (ETH) lead this liquidation event? While specific reasons can vary, ETH leading the liquidation suggests that a significant number of traders had highly leveraged long positions on Ethereum, making them particularly vulnerable to recent price downturns or market corrections. Q3: What does it mean for long positions to account for a high percentage of liquidations? When long positions account for a high percentage of liquidations, it means that a majority of traders who were betting on price increases (going ‘long’) were caught off guard by a price drop, leading to their positions being forcibly closed. Q4: How can traders protect themselves from crypto futures liquidation? Traders can protect themselves by using lower leverage, setting strict stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin, and practicing sound risk management strategies, including diversifying their portfolio and staying informed about market conditions. Q5: Is a crypto futures liquidation a rare event? No, significant crypto futures liquidation events are not uncommon in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market. They occur periodically as a natural consequence of leveraged trading and market price swings. Did you find this analysis helpful?

While dollar stablecoins often appear as a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto realm, the BOK’s recent assessment suggests they could pose a surprising threat to the U.S. dollar’s long-standing status as a safe-haven asset. This analysis, part of a detailed report on dollar hegemony, urges a closer look at these digital assets. What Are Dollar Stablecoins and Why Are They Under Scrutiny? Simply put, dollar stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. They achieve this stability by holding reserves in dollars or dollar-denominated assets. Many see them as a crucial component of the crypto ecosystem, facilitating trading and international remittances. However, the BOK’s report, released on September 15th, highlights a nuanced perspective. While their widespread adoption in international trade could initially strengthen the dollar’s global footprint, the central bank identifies potential pitfalls that could undermine its stability. The Double-Edged Nature of Digital Dominance for Dollar Stablecoins On one hand, the BOK acknowledges that if dollar stablecoins become a primary medium for cross-border transactions, they could indeed reinforce the U.S. dollar’s global dominance. This scenario would mean more demand for dollar-backed assets, further cementing the greenback’s role in the international financial system. Conversely, the BOK warns of a darker side. The very nature of these digital assets could inadvertently erode the dollar’s coveted safe-haven status. A safe-haven asset is typically a reliable store of value during times of market turbulence, like gold or the U.S. dollar itself. The central bank’s concern stems from the potential for sudden, large-scale movements within the stablecoin market. How Could Dollar Stablecoins Threaten Financial Stability? The BOK’s primary concern revolves around the potential for rapid, large-scale withdrawals from dollar stablecoins . Imagine a scenario where a significant portion of stablecoin holders suddenly decide to redeem their digital assets for physical dollars. This could trigger a cascade of effects: Mass Redemptions: Stablecoin issuers might be forced to liquidate their underlying dollar-denominated assets, such as U.S. Treasury bonds, very quickly. Market Volatility: Such large-scale, forced selling could create significant volatility in government bond markets, disrupting a critical component of global finance. Liquidity Crunch: This could lead to a liquidity crunch, where traditional financial institutions struggle to meet their short-term obligations, potentially spilling over into broader markets. These risks are not merely theoretical. The BOK’s analysis points to the interconnectedness of digital assets and traditional finance, suggesting that shocks originating in the stablecoin market could have far-reaching global ripple effects, echoing the report’s focus on U.S.-originated shocks. Navigating the Future: What Does This Mean for Investors and Policymakers? The BOK’s warning serves as a crucial reminder for both investors and policymakers. For investors, understanding the underlying reserves and regulatory frameworks of different dollar stablecoins becomes paramount. Diversification and careful risk assessment are always key. For policymakers, the report underscores the urgent need for comprehensive regulatory frameworks. Clear rules regarding stablecoin reserves, transparency, and redemption mechanisms are essential to mitigate these potential systemic risks. International cooperation among central banks will also be vital to address the cross-border nature of these digital assets and ensure global financial stability. The evolving landscape of digital currencies demands proactive and informed responses to safeguard the integrity of the traditional financial system. The Bank of Korea’s assessment presents a compelling paradox: while dollar stablecoins could bolster the U.S. dollar’s international standing, they also harbor the potential to destabilize its fundamental role as a safe-haven asset. The risk of large-scale withdrawals and subsequent market volatility highlights the intricate challenges posed by these innovative digital assets. As the digital economy continues to evolve, understanding and effectively managing these emerging risks will be paramount for maintaining global financial stability. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a safe-haven asset? A1: A safe-haven asset is an investment that is expected to retain or increase in value during times of market turbulence or economic uncertainty. The U.S. dollar, gold, and certain government bonds are traditionally considered safe havens. Q2: How could dollar stablecoins strengthen the USD’s dominance? A2: If dollar stablecoins become widely adopted for international trade and transactions, it would increase the demand for dollar-denominated assets held as reserves, thereby reinforcing the U.S. dollar’s global role. Q3: What specific risks did the BOK identify? A3: The Bank of Korea warned about the potential for large-scale withdrawals from dollar stablecoins , which could force issuers to liquidate underlying assets and create significant volatility in government bond prices. Q4: Are all stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar? A4: No, while dollar stablecoins are the most common, there are stablecoins pegged to other fiat currencies (like the Euro or Yen) or even to commodities like gold. Q5: What is the main takeaway for investors regarding dollar stablecoins? A5: Investors should be aware of the potential risks, including market volatility and the stability of underlying reserves. It’s crucial to research the regulatory compliance and transparency of any stablecoin before investing.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation as Binance, one of the largest exchanges globally, makes another significant announcement: the Binance AVNT listing . This move brings a new token into the spotlight, offering both exciting prospects and important considerations for traders. Are you ready to dive into what this means for the evolving digital asset landscape? What Does the Binance AVNT Listing Mean for Traders? Binance officially announced that it will list AVNT, opening trading pairs for users worldwide. This highly anticipated event is scheduled for 5:00 a.m. UTC on September 15th. For many, a Binance AVNT listing represents a gateway to new investment opportunities within the dynamic crypto market. Increased Accessibility: Listing on Binance provides AVNT with massive exposure to millions of users, significantly boosting its liquidity and trading volume. Market Validation: A listing on such a prominent exchange often lends credibility to a project, signaling its potential to a broader audience. New Trading Pairs: Users will gain access to specific trading pairs, allowing them to buy and sell AVNT against established cryptocurrencies. However, it’s essential to remember that while listings can be exciting, they also introduce new dynamics into the market. Navigating the Seed Tag: Understanding AVNT’s Volatility A crucial aspect of this announcement is that Binance will apply its Seed Tag to the AVNT token. What exactly does this mean for potential investors and the future of the Binance AVNT listing ? The Seed Tag is a special designation Binance uses for projects that may exhibit higher volatility and risk compared to other established tokens. It serves as a warning, prompting traders to exercise extra caution. Higher Risk: Tokens with a Seed Tag can experience rapid and significant price fluctuations, both upwards and downwards. Innovation Focus: These projects are often newer, highly innovative, and still in their early development stages, carrying inherent uncertainties. Enhanced Due Diligence: Binance encourages users to conduct thorough research and understand the project’s fundamentals before engaging with Seed Tag tokens. Understanding the implications of the Seed Tag is paramount for anyone considering participating in the Binance AVNT listing . It’s not just about the potential gains; it’s also about managing the potential downsides. Preparing for the Binance AVNT Listing: Key Considerations As the date for the Binance AVNT listing approaches, what actionable insights can traders adopt to navigate this new opportunity effectively? Prudent preparation is key to making informed decisions in such a fast-paced environment. Firstly, thorough research is non-negotiable. Dive deep into the AVNT project’s whitepaper, team, technology, and use cases. Understand its market position and what problem it aims to solve. This foundational knowledge will help you assess its long-term viability. Secondly, consider your risk tolerance. Given the Seed Tag, AVNT is expected to be volatile. Only invest what you can comfortably afford to lose. Setting stop-loss orders can be a valuable strategy to mitigate potential losses during sharp price movements. Moreover, diversifying your portfolio is always a wise approach. Avoid putting all your capital into a single new listing, especially one with a Seed Tag. A balanced portfolio helps spread risk and can protect you from significant impacts if one asset underperforms. Finally, stay informed. Follow official Binance announcements and AVNT project updates. The crypto market evolves rapidly, and timely information can make a significant difference in your trading strategy. Seizing the Moment: A Strategic Approach to AVNT The upcoming Binance AVNT listing presents an exciting, albeit high-risk, opportunity for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. While the potential for significant gains exists, the presence of Binance’s Seed Tag underscores the importance of a cautious and well-researched approach. Traders should prioritize understanding the project’s fundamentals, managing their risk exposure, and staying updated with market developments. Ultimately, navigating new listings successfully comes down to informed decision-making and a disciplined strategy. Are you ready to embrace the potential of AVNT while safeguarding your investments? Frequently Asked Questions About the Binance AVNT Listing Here are some common questions regarding the upcoming AVNT listing on Binance: What is the exact time of the Binance AVNT listing? Binance will list AVNT at 5:00 a.m. UTC on September 15th. Always confirm the exact time zone conversion for your local region. What does the “Seed Tag” on AVNT mean? The Seed Tag is a label Binance applies to projects that may carry higher volatility and risk compared to other tokens. It’s a reminder for users to conduct extra due diligence.

In his post and accompanying video, Hilton noted that XRP had risen more than four percent in a single day and was up roughly eight to nine percent over the past few days. He explained that XRP had been consolidating for several weeks around the $2.80 level but has recently moved upward by nearly ten percent in just two days. Hilton linked this movement to broader developments in the cryptocurrency space. He said the total cryptocurrency market capitalization had returned to above $4 trillion, with Bitcoin taking approximately 60% of that value. He emphasized that institutional interest is starting to re-emerge, with cash and liquidity returning to the market, which he believes is contributing to XRP’s recent performance. Fellow XRP Holders! It's Happening… pic.twitter.com/lMP7c9Dt01 — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) September 13, 2025 Federal Reserve Decision and Speculation A key point raised in Hilton’s analysis was the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting scheduled for September 17 . He mentioned that the market is anticipating a potential interest rate cut of either 25 or 50 basis points. According to Hilton, speculation surrounding this decision is already influencing market sentiment, with traders and institutions positioning ahead of the announcement. He noted that there could be a “buy the rumor, sell the news” effect depending on the outcome, explaining that a smaller 25 basis point reduction might lead to short-term selling if investors had hoped for a larger cut. However, he stressed that two additional interest rate meetings remain before the end of the year, making the fourth quarter of 2025 a critical period for crypto markets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Long-Term Outlook and Investment Approach Hilton reinforced his belief that the crypto community often underestimates the long-term potential of the market. He recalled his earlier commentary on a Fidelity report suggesting that Bitcoin could reach $1 billion by 2038, highlighting the credibility of the source. Based on his outlook, he shared that he personally intends to increase his own XRP holdings, even at current levels, and also plans to buy more Ethereum and Bitcoin. He suggested that investors consider strategies such as small, regular purchases through automated drafts on exchanges, which allow consistent accumulation without waiting for larger capital reserves. Hilton framed this as a practical way to remain engaged in the market and avoid missing opportunities during periods of price growth. Hilton concluded by restating his optimism about XRP and the broader crypto market in the months ahead, stressing the importance of preparing for potential volatility around the Federal Reserve’s decision and looking toward the final quarter of the year as a significant period for digital assets.

Both have been worked on and integrated for years, so many investors rely on them. However, their huge market caps and present network saturation have limited their short-term development potential. As a result, traders and retail investors are looking into smaller, utility-driven projects that have more room to expand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming a strong option among these. MUTM was just $0.035 during its presale, but it offers similar innovation in decentralized finance, stablecoin issuance, and liquidity management—all at a much lower cost, making it a good option for investors looking for new opportunities while other networks are stuck. MUTM is a good alternative for people who want to keep up with crypto collapse news, look at how crypto ETFs are doing, or figure out why crypto is down. Presale momentum and urgency for new investors The presale for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now in Phase 6, and the price is $0.035. So far, $15.66 million has been raised. More than 16,250 people are taking part, and 38% of this allocation has been taken. The next phase is likely to cause the price to go up by 15% to $0.040, which will make investors want to get in early before the token goes up even more. People who own AVAX and TRX and want to make money quickly would like MUTM because it is cheaper and has a lot of room for growth based on adoption. MUTM makes sure that there is both demand and opportunity for new participants by offering a well-structured presale with clear boundaries. This makes it possible to buy a token for less than 4 cents, which is very rare for a token that is developed for utility and scalability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has strong decentralized stablecoin mechanisms that only mint the stablecoin when users borrow against overcollateralized assets like ETH and burn it when they pay it back or sell it. Interest rates set by the governance keep the stablecoin fixed to $1, and arbitrage opportunities naturally help keep the peg. This approach makes both lenders and borrowers feel safe since it keeps the system safe while allowing money to flow freely. Borrowing interest rates change based on how much money is available. They are low when there is a lot of liquidity to encourage borrowing and high when there is not enough capital to encourage repayments and attract new deposits from lenders looking for better returns. For instance, a user who locks up $12,000 in LINK will get mtLINK rewards and steady returns, while another user who uses $8,000 in XRP as collateral can unlock liquidity without having to sell during times of high volatility. Price discovery, roadmap, and security assurance Price discovery at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) depends on a mix of Chainlink oracles, fallback oracles, aggregated feeds, and time-weighted average price (TWAP) measures. These steps guarantee that collateralized assets are valued correctly, even if the main data sources are slow or down. This framework gives customers trust and makes borrowing and lending activities more stable. This makes MUTM an infrastructure-ready project before it is listed on the main market. The four-phase roadmap shows even more how serious MUTM is about structured growth. Phase 1 includes presale execution, marketing campaigns, completing an external audit, giving things away, and listing on tracking platforms. Most of the big activities are almost done. In Phase 2, the main focus will be on developing core smart contracts and dApps, building back-end infrastructure, using advanced analytics, and integrating risk parameters. In Phase 3, the focus is on beta testing on testnet, launching functional demos, getting ready for exchange listings, and doing final audits. Phase 4 will bring the live platform, make it possible to claim tokens, set up collaborations with institutions, and add other blockchains to the network, making sure that it can grow and be used for a long time. MUTM puts a lot of emphasis on safety and getting people involved in their community. The platform got CertiK scores of 95 on Token Scan and 78 on Skynet. Also, a $100,000 incentive encourages people to sign up early, and a $50,000 USDT bug bounty program compensates bugs based on how serious they are: critical issues get up to $2,000, major issues get up to $1,000, medium issues get up to $500, and low-risk issues get up to $200. These steps protect the integrity of smart contracts and encourage a vibrant, engaged community. Final words Investors looking for both stability and growth are turning their attention to new utility tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as AVAX and TRX continue to develop and offer limited near-term multiples. MUTM has a good case for being the next altcoin that can make big profits. It has a stablecoin ecosystem, a dynamic borrow and liquidity strategy, presale momentum, and a safe architecture. For investors who are keeping an eye on crypto ETFs or trying to figure out why crypto prices are going down, MUTM offers a chance to get in on a project that is created for acceptance, scalability, and measurable benefit.

The Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA), created under the Virtual Assets Ordinance 2025, reportedly issued a call for Expressions of Interest this Saturday from firms already operating in other major jurisdictions. With over 40m users and an estimated $300b in annual trading volume, Pakistan’s virtual asset market shows rapid growth, but until now it has remained largely unregulated. Authorities say the licensing drive aims to curb illicit finance while also providing a stable framework for fintech innovation. Pakistan Targets Trusted International Firms for Its New Crypto Regime PVARA wants applicant companies to already hold licenses from prominent regulators such as the US SEC, the UK Financial Conduct Authority, the EU’s VASP framework, the UAE’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority, or the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Bilal bin Saqib, CEO of Pakistan Crypto Council, told Cryptonews in an earlier interview that the cost of doing business in the country is much cheaper than elsewhere. “We have access to amazing talent. We are in a very strategic location. For blockchain and crypto, what you need is great human resource,” he said. Pakistan is consulting with global regulators to build a “Pakistan-first” crypto framework, Crypto Council CEO @Bilalbinsaqib told Cryptonews. #Pakistan #CryptoCouncil https://t.co/GZ9vkwUTo5 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 1, 2025 Submissions must include detailed company profiles, licensing information from other jurisdictions, track records in compliance – especially on anti-money laundering, counter-terrorism financing, and know-your-customer standards. Applicants must also define their proposed business model for operating in Pakistan. Applications Accepted on Rolling Basis for Greater Flexibility The licensing framework also includes regulatory sandboxes to foster innovation, including products compliant with Shariah law. PVARA said these measures will align Pakistan’s virtual asset sector with international norms set by institutions like the Financial Action Task Force, IMF, and World Bank. Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis via email, giving eligible firms flexibility to submit when ready. The Virtual Assets Ordinance came into force on July 8, 2025, establishing PVARA with the power to license, regulate and supervise virtual asset service providers across Pakistan. PVARA’s governing board includes heads of key institutions such as the State Bank of Pakistan, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Federal Board of Revenue. It must ensure strong cybersecurity frameworks and consumer protection alongside preventing illicit financial flows. Policy Support and Infrastructure Development Gain Momentum Officials describe this as a pivotal step toward integrating Pakistan’s digital-asset economy with global financial practices while offering legal clarity to investors and consumers. Earlier this year, Pakistan boosted its commitment to crypto regulation by launching the Pakistan Crypto Council, appointing Binance founder Changpeng Zhao as a strategic adviser and working to build infrastructure and policy support. As the regulatory framework settles, the government hopes that this licensing regime will signal stability to foreign investors while providing Pakistani users with safer, regulated options.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency avoided sharp volatility but remained on watch for signals that could shape its near-term direction. Cautious Market Moves Data from TradingView showed Bitcoin dropping toward $115,000 after peaking at $116,800 during Friday’s Wall Street session — its highest level since late August. “Pretty clear price is being walked down here yet again going into a new week,” trader Skew wrote on X, adding that there was “some pretty decent bid depth & liquidity just below $115K.” “Time to pay attention,” he concluded. Other analysts emphasized that Bitcoin’s short-term goal was not a breakout, but rather regaining stability at key support levels. Traders Focus on $114K Support Popular analyst Rekt Capital explained that the immediate task was for Bitcoin to reclaim $114,000 as a firm base. “The goal isn’t for Bitcoin to break $117k in the short-term,” he wrote. “The goal is for Bitcoin to reclaim $114k into support first. Because that’s what would enable the premium-buying necessary to get price above $117k later on.” Despite short-term uncertainty, Rekt Capital maintained that Bitcoin’s bull market remained intact and that fresh all-time highs were likely still ahead. He added that a weekly close above $114,000 would be considered “bullish.” Fed Rate Cut Expectations Dominate Beyond Bitcoin, the spotlight was firmly on the Federal Reserve’s upcoming policy decision. Markets were near-unanimous in predicting a 0.25% rate cut, a move that could further support risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Analysts argued that improving U.S. economic data, looser financial conditions, and broad participation from cyclical industries all point to continued economic expansion. In a recent update, trading firm Mosaic Asset Company struck an optimistic tone. “The combination of improving leading indicators, ongoing loose financial conditions, and strong market breadth that includes participation by cyclical industries favors an ongoing economic expansion in my opinion,” its author wrote. “That supports the earnings outlook which is ultimately good for stock prices at the same time the Fed is set to resume rate cuts. That could make for an excellent trading environment into next year.”",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-09-15 04:50:18

BTC and ETH price spikes have made the news, but a lot of new investors are wondering where they can put their money to make big profits without having to wait years. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming a platform that offers just that: overcollateralized lending, stablecoin minting, and staking-based rewards. MUTM is a great alternative to storing ETH passively since it has new mechanisms and institutional-level security. It also lets regular investors take part in faster growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to protect investors’ money while also providing a steady return. Borrowers have to overcollateralize, which makes a buffer that keeps the protocol safe from abrupt drops in asset values. Liquidation processes make sure that positions that drop below safety levels are dealt with right away, and liquidators are given bonuses to keep the system healthy. The stable interest rate model gives borrowers predictable repayment schedules and lets the protocol adjust rates when the market is very unstable. This combination makes sure that people may confidently earn yield, lend money, or stake mtTokens, even when crypto values go up and down or the market as a whole corrects itself. ETH treasury firm BitMine scoops $200M of ETH On September 12, 2025, BitMine, a big treasury corporation, bought $200 million worth of Ethereum (ETH). This raised the price of ETH to about $4,400, with a trading volume of $37.07 billion in 24 hours. The purchase is part of a larger trend of companies building up their treasuries, which shows that institutions have a lot of faith in Ethereum’s DeFi and layer-2 ecosystems. Technical indications reveal that ETH is testing the $4,150 support level, with the RSI at 48 and the resistance level at $4,500. People on social media are excited about BitMine’s shift and the planned Pectra upgrade, but there are concerns about things like US tariffs and $346.46 million in liquidations. If $4,500 clears, analysts say the aim is $4,868. But if it drops below $4,150, it might drop to $3,950. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): presale momentum and retail window The presale for Phase 6 of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now open, and each token costs $0.035. There are more than 16,300 holders taking part, and $15.66 million has been raised so far. 38% of the 170 million token supply has already been sold. The price will go up to $0.040 in the following phase, which means this is the last chance to get tokens at a discount before launch. Investors who bought in Phase 1 at $0.010 are already seeing gains of more than 250%. When MUTM lists at $0.20, investors who bought in Phase 6 will be able to get 500% returns. The platform’s restricted quantity of 4 billion tokens, staking incentives, and protocol buybacks all work together to keep the token’s price going up. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lets regular investors actively make money while whales keep a lot of ETH. Lending yields, stablecoin minting, and staking programs all make money all the time. This makes a system that is always changing, like early DeFi successes like AAVE and UNI, which saw their prices go up 5–10X in their first few months. MUTM gives regular investors a way to get into this kind of high-growth environment that is easy to understand and offers both safety and predictable returns. The platform’s improved collateral efficiency makes it easier to borrow more money for linked assets. At the same time, carefully controlled deposit and borrow caps lower exposure to volatile tokens, which keeps the protocol stable. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is more trustworthy since it has a CertiK audit score of 95, an AI-powered helpdesk service, partnerships with institutional roadmaps, and a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. These protections provide investors even more confidence that the platform is intended to handle complex operational and security needs as well as large rewards. So, early participants are joining a system that balances development potential with strong risk management. This gives them an obvious edge over people who just keep crypto. Conclusion Investors who get in during Phase 6 are putting themselves in a position to make money like ETH did. The lack of tokens, along with early staking payouts and buyback programs, ensures that the price trend is maintained from many directions. The price will soon go up to $0.040, and 38% of the current phase has already been sold. This opportunity is closing fast. People who wait will miss the chance to own MUTM at a lower price, while people who act quickly will get positions in a protocol where smart money is making 500% gains by moving profits around. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is for investors who want to combine safety, yield, and the chance to grow. Institutional ETH accumulation gets a lot of attention, but MUTM gives regular investors the ability to get involved in a fast-moving ecosystem with predictable payouts and significant upward momentum. Now is the time to get in, join early staking programs, and get in line with the next wave of attractive crypto investments before listing increases yields.

Binance, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, is set to launch the highly anticipated AVNT/USDT margin trading pair. This significant announcement means traders can now access cross and isolated margin trading for AVNT/USDT starting today, 5:00 a.m. UTC. This new listing opens up exciting avenues for amplifying potential gains and diversifying trading strategies within the dynamic crypto market. What Does AVNT/USDT Margin Trading Mean for You? For those new to the concept, margin trading allows you to trade with borrowed funds, effectively increasing your exposure to a particular asset. When Binance lists the AVNT/USDT margin trading pair, it means you can now borrow either AVNT or USDT to open larger positions than your initial capital would normally permit. This approach can lead to significantly higher profits if the market moves in your favor. Cross Margin: Your entire margin account balance is used as collateral, shared across all your open positions. This offers greater flexibility but also higher risk if one position goes south. Isolated Margin: A specific amount of capital is allocated as collateral for a single position. If the market moves against you, only that isolated margin is at risk of liquidation, protecting the rest of your funds. Understanding these two types is crucial before diving into AVNT/USDT margin trading , as they dictate your risk exposure and strategy. Why is This AVNT/USDT Listing a Game-Changer? The addition of the AVNT/USDT margin trading pair on Binance is more than just another listing; it’s a strategic move that enhances market liquidity and offers advanced trading tools. Increased liquidity for AVNT/USDT means smoother transactions and potentially tighter spreads, benefiting all traders. Moreover, margin trading allows traders to capitalize on both rising and falling markets. You can go ‘long’ if you expect AVNT’s price to increase, or ‘short’ if you anticipate a decrease. This flexibility provides sophisticated strategies for experienced traders looking to maximize their returns in various market conditions. It also signifies growing interest and confidence in the AVNT token within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Navigating the Risks of AVNT/USDT Margin Trading While the allure of amplified profits is strong, it’s vital to acknowledge the inherent risks associated with AVNT/USDT margin trading . Trading with borrowed funds can magnify losses just as easily as it can amplify gains. A sudden market downturn or high volatility could lead to rapid liquidation of your position, meaning you lose your collateral. Therefore, prudent risk management is paramount. Consider these points: Start Small: Begin with a small portion of your portfolio to understand the mechanics and market behavior. Set Stop-Loss Orders: These automatically close your position if the price hits a predetermined level, limiting potential losses. Monitor Constantly: The crypto market is fast-paced. Stay updated on market news and AVNT-specific developments. Educate Yourself: Fully grasp how margin calls and liquidation work before committing significant capital. Approaching AVNT/USDT margin trading with caution and a well-defined strategy is the key to sustainable success. Getting Started with AVNT/USDT Margin Trading on Binance Ready to explore the opportunities with the AVNT/USDT margin trading pair? Here’s a quick guide to help you begin: Fund Your Account: Ensure you have sufficient USDT or AVNT in your Binance spot wallet. Transfer to Margin Wallet: Move funds from your spot wallet to your cross or isolated margin wallet. Borrow Funds: Based on your collateral, you can borrow additional funds for trading. Place Your Order: Select the AVNT/USDT pair, choose your margin type (cross or isolated), and place your buy (long) or sell (short) order. Always remember that thorough research and a clear understanding of market dynamics are your best allies. Binance provides various educational resources to help users navigate these advanced trading options safely. Conclusion The listing of the AVNT/USDT margin trading pair on Binance marks a significant development for the AVNT community and the broader crypto market. It introduces enhanced liquidity and advanced trading opportunities for those looking to leverage their positions. While the potential for amplified returns is appealing, it’s crucial to approach margin trading with a clear understanding of its risks and implement robust risk management strategies. By doing so, traders can potentially capitalize on this new offering and navigate the exciting world of cryptocurrency with greater confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

Currently, the spotlight is firmly on Asia FX , where currencies are exhibiting a muted response, heavily influenced by a confluence of factors that signal potential shifts across the entire financial landscape. From the bustling trading floors of Tokyo to the economic powerhouses of Beijing, a quiet tension is building, driven by underwhelming data from the Chinese economy and the looming shadow of a critical Federal Reserve meeting. This complex interplay of regional challenges and global policy anticipation is creating a fascinating, albeit cautious, environment for investors worldwide. Asia FX: Decoding the Muted Response – What’s Happening? The Asian foreign exchange markets are currently characterized by a distinct lack of significant movement, a phenomenon often described as ‘muted.’ This isn’t necessarily a sign of stability, but rather a reflection of underlying caution and uncertainty that permeates investor sentiment. Participants are treading carefully, digesting a mix of regional economic signals and bracing for global policy shifts that could dramatically alter market dynamics. The performance of Asia FX is intrinsically linked to the economic health of its largest player, China. When the engine of the Chinese economy sputters, the reverberations are felt across the continent, impacting trade flows, investment, and ultimately, currency valuations. Several key factors contribute to this subdued activity: Interdependence with China: Many Asian economies are heavily reliant on trade with China. Weak demand from China directly translates to lower export revenues and slower economic growth for its neighbors, putting downward pressure on their currencies. Risk Aversion: Global uncertainties, including geopolitical tensions and inflation concerns, often lead investors to seek safer assets, drawing capital away from emerging Asian markets and their currencies. Central Bank Policies: While some Asian central banks have tightened monetary policy, their actions are often constrained by the need to support economic growth, especially when facing external headwinds. This can limit their ability to strengthen their respective currencies significantly. Dollar Dominance: The sustained strength of the US Dollar, driven by higher interest rates and its safe-haven appeal, makes it challenging for Asian currencies to gain significant ground. Currencies like the Japanese Yen, South Korean Won, and the Malaysian Ringgit have all experienced periods of weakness or limited upside, struggling against the backdrop of a stronger dollar and regional economic concerns. The muted response in Asia FX thus hides significant underlying pressures and a delicate balance of forces at play. What’s Driving the Weakness in the Chinese Economy? Recent economic indicators from China have painted a less-than-rosy picture, sending ripples of concern through global markets and significantly influencing Asia FX . Data points across several key sectors reveal a slowdown that is more pronounced than many analysts had anticipated. This weakness in the Chinese economy is not a singular event but a complex interplay of internal structural issues and external pressures. Key areas of concern include: Property Market Crisis: The prolonged downturn in China’s vast property sector remains a major drag. Defaults by major developers, unfinished projects, and falling housing prices have eroded consumer confidence and posed systemic risks to the financial system. Weak Consumer Spending: Despite initial hopes for a post-pandemic rebound, consumer spending has remained subdued. Factors such as high youth unemployment, property market uncertainties, and a cautious outlook on future income have led households to save rather than spend. Retail sales growth has often fallen short of expectations. Deflationary Pressures: China has been battling persistent deflation, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) sometimes dipping into negative territory. While this might sound good for consumers, sustained deflation can signal weak demand, discourage investment, and make debt burdens heavier. Industrial Output and Exports: Industrial production has shown signs of softening, reflecting weaker domestic and international demand. Export figures, once a cornerstone of China’s growth, have also faced headwinds due to slowing global trade and geopolitical tensions. Local Government Debt: Many local governments are burdened with substantial debt, limiting their capacity for infrastructure spending and economic stimulus, which historically played a crucial role in driving growth. The challenges facing the Chinese economy are multifaceted, requiring careful navigation by policymakers. The spillover effects of this slowdown are profound, impacting commodity prices, global supply chains, and investment flows into Asia, directly contributing to the cautious sentiment in Asia FX markets. Is US Dollar Strength Sustainable? A Look at its Safe Haven Appeal While Asian currencies grapple with local and regional headwinds, the US Dollar Strength continues to be a dominant narrative in the global currency arena. The dollar has remained remarkably steady, often gaining ground against major peers, as investors flock to its perceived safety. This steadfast performance isn’t accidental; it’s a testament to several underlying factors that position the U.S. economy and its currency as a preferred destination during times of global uncertainty. Reasons underpinning the dollar’s resilience: Interest Rate Differential: The Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary tightening cycle in response to inflation has resulted in significantly higher interest rates compared to many other developed economies. This yield advantage makes dollar-denominated assets more attractive to international investors. Relative Economic Resilience: Despite global slowdown concerns, the U.S. economy has shown a degree of resilience, particularly in its labor market. This relative strength compared to other major economies enhances the dollar’s appeal. Safe-Haven Status: In periods of geopolitical instability, economic uncertainty, or financial market stress, the U.S. dollar traditionally serves as the ultimate safe-haven currency. Its deep and liquid financial markets, coupled with the perceived stability of the U.S. government, make it a preferred store of value. Global Reserve Currency Role: The dollar’s status as the world’s primary reserve currency means it is widely used in international trade, finance, and central bank reserves, creating constant demand. The sustained US Dollar Strength has significant implications. For emerging markets, it can make dollar-denominated debt more expensive to service and can draw capital away from their economies. For global trade, a strong dollar makes U.S. exports more expensive but reduces the cost of imports for U.S. consumers and businesses. Understanding this dynamic is crucial for anyone monitoring Global Macro Trends . How Will the Fed Meeting Impact Global Markets and Your Portfolio? All eyes are now fixed on the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting. The decisions made by the U.S. central bank have a profound and immediate Fed Meeting Impact that extends far beyond American borders, influencing everything from bond yields to global equity markets and, crucially, currency valuations. The market is keenly awaiting signals regarding future interest rate policy, specifically whether the Fed will maintain its hawkish stance, signal a pivot towards easing, or adopt a wait-and-see approach. Potential scenarios and their broad implications: Scenario Potential Fed Action Market Impact Hawkish Stance (Rate Hike/Strong Signal) Another rate hike or strong rhetoric indicating future hikes. Further US Dollar Strength , potentially higher bond yields, pressure on equities, capital outflow from emerging markets and Asia FX . Dovish Pivot (Rate Cut/Easing Signal) A rate cut or clear signal of impending cuts. Potential dollar weakening, bond yields may fall, boost for equities and risk assets (including cryptocurrencies), potential capital inflow to emerging markets and Asia FX . Hold and Wait (Status Quo) Rates remain unchanged, but future guidance is ambiguous or data-dependent. Market volatility, continued focus on economic data, investors seeking clarity, moderate impact on US Dollar Strength , and continued cautiousness in Asia FX . The precise Fed Meeting Impact hinges on the nuances of the statement and the subsequent press conference. Investors will scrutinize every word for clues about the trajectory of monetary policy, which will, in turn, influence global liquidity and risk appetite, directly affecting the performance of currencies and other asset classes, including digital ones. Navigating Global Macro Trends: Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor The current environment is a complex tapestry of interconnected Global Macro Trends . From geopolitical shifts to evolving monetary policies and the economic performance of major powers, understanding these dynamics is essential for informed decision-making. Investors, particularly those in the crypto space, must recognize how these traditional market forces can directly or indirectly influence digital asset valuations and liquidity. Here are some actionable insights for navigating these turbulent waters: Diversification is Key: Do not put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify across different asset classes, geographies, and even within the crypto market itself to mitigate risks associated with specific regional downturns or currency fluctuations. Monitor Economic Indicators Closely: Keep a keen eye on key economic data points, especially from major economies like China and the U.S. (e.g., inflation rates, GDP growth, employment figures, retail sales). These provide early signals of shifts in Global Macro Trends . Understand Central Bank Communication: Pay close attention to statements and speeches from central bank officials, particularly the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the People’s Bank of China. Their forward guidance is a powerful tool in shaping market expectations. Consider Hedging Strategies: For those with significant exposure to specific currencies or regions, exploring hedging strategies (e.g., currency forwards, options) can help protect against adverse movements. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility can be unsettling, maintaining a long-term investment perspective often helps weather temporary storms. Focus on fundamental value rather than reacting impulsively to daily market noise. Assess Risk Appetite: Regularly reassess your personal risk tolerance. In an environment of heightened uncertainty, it may be prudent to adjust portfolio allocations to align with a more conservative stance if necessary.

Traders welcomed the move as proof of resilience in a shaky market. Yet behind the celebrations, analysts are questioning XRP’s long-term growth potential. That has led many investors to look elsewhere for bigger upside, with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi project, emerging as a contender for 2025’s breakout token. Ripple (XRP) September breakout XRP jumped 4.15% to $3.02, shattering the psychological resistance level that had restrained its performance this year. Optimism around a potential Fed rate cut and news of an expanded custody partnership with Spain’s BBVA provided the momentum. For market participants, XRP’s break above $3 served as vindication following an extended consolidation phase. Still, many analysts caution against overstating the move. XRP carries a massive market capitalization, meaning that while it can deliver steady gains, the explosive returns of its early surges are far less likely to repeat. This is why some investors are gradually shifting their focus toward lower-cost utility tokens with greater room to scale. Adding to the cautious outlook, on-chain metrics reveal potential pressure points. Exchange reserves are swelling, signaling that more XRP is being parked on trading platforms, which could translate into selling pressure. Meanwhile, Total Value Locked (TVL) on the XRP Ledger is declining, a worrying sign for DeFi traction. Even Google search interest has dropped, suggesting retail enthusiasm is fading just as the token pushes past resistance. The takeaway? XRP’s September rally is impressive, but questions remain about its ability to sustain momentum in the long run. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) While XRP wrestles with growth limitations, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting investors with its early-stage entry. The token launched its presale at just $0.01 and has since surged to $0.035, a 350% gain. With the confirmed official launch price of $0.06, buyers at today’s level are still looking at nearly 2x upside before open-market trading begins. Momentum has been clear: the project has already raised more than $15.65 million and welcomed over 16,250 holders into its community. Each presale stage increases the price, and the next phase is set to climb to $0.04, almost a 20% jump from current levels. For investors, this creates urgency: secure a position now, or pay a higher entry cost in the next round. Analysts call MUTM the best cryptocurrency to invest in now What’s separating Mutuum Finance from other presale tokens is its utility-first model. Instead of leaning on meme-driven cycles, MUTM is structured as a lending and borrowing protocol. The platform supports both peer-to-contract (P2C) lending, where users deposit assets like ETH, BNB, or MATIC into liquidity pools and receive mtTokens in return, and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, where agreements can be struck directly between participants with flexible terms. Borrowers can choose variable or stable rates, balancing predictability with cost-efficiency. The roadmap also sets Mutuum Finance apart. The beta platform will debut with the token listing, enabling users to access borrowing, lending, and staking immediately. Long-term, the protocol plans to integrate Layer-2 scaling to lower fees and improve transaction speeds, and deploy a robust oracle system using Chainlink feeds with fallback options to protect against outages or manipulation. Security is another cornerstone. Mutuum Finance has already completed a CertiK audit with a 95/100 Token score, launched a $50,000 bug bounty program, and announced a $100,000 community giveaway to build trust and broaden adoption. Together, these factors create both near-term catalysts and long-term sustainability, two ingredients analysts say are often missing in new projects. XRP’s rally above $3 this September underscores its resilience, but also exposes its limitations. Swelling exchange reserves, declining TVL, and fading retail enthusiasm highlight the challenges of driving exponential growth in such a high-cap asset. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still at the beginning of its journey, but momentum is already building fast. Presale gains have climbed past 350%, and the roadmap lays out clear milestones like a live beta platform, stablecoin integration, and L2 scaling. Together, these steps position MUTM to grow into a serious force within DeFi lending.

The offering may be structured across multiple maturities and currencies, adding to the company’s $17.75 billion in outstanding notes. Its sale also coincides with a record-setting year for dim sum bonds, with Chinese issuers securing $46.2 billion year-to-date on the back of favorable financing conditions and robust investor interest. So far, Tencent has tapped JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Securities, and Morgan Stanley to arrange the program. Tencent has upcoming obligations, including a $500 million maturing in April 2026 Tencent deal’s timing will hinge on market conditions, internal capital requirements, and investor appetite, in compliance with the applicable regulation s. The company has yet to reveal how much it intends to raise, but the move seems driven by both necessity and market opportunity. With the September issuance window wide open, many issuers are hurrying to lock in financing before conditions potentially turn less favorable. Tencent already faces a squeezing debt schedule, with a $500 million note maturing in April 2026 and another $1 billion bond due in January 2026. Although the company had long floated the prospect of dollar- and yuan-denominated issuance, the deal only came to market this year. However, with rates in Asia’s currency markets that are friendly to the company, this window may enable Tencent to deal with its upcoming debt maturities effectively. On the earnings side, the company reported strong June-quarter results with sales rising 15% to $25.7 billion, about 3% ahead of its guidance. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , the company posted a 17% rise in net income, driven largely by the firm’s stronger margins across advertising and gaming segments. Among the contributors cited by the company for its results were AI-powered advertisements and the growth of gaming and social media efforts. Besides, Tencent is ramping up its investments in artificial intelligence R&D. The company has even added Yao Shunyu, an artificial intelligence expert who formerly worked at OpenAI, to its team. According to people familiar with the matter, Yao will work from Tencent’s main offices in Shenzhen, helping integrate AI across its products. Tencent has been a leader in pushing forward AI research. It chose to weave AI software into all its offerings rather than introducing new AI platforms. DeepSeek’s R1 fuels its gaming and social media applications, together with its proprietary Hunyuan model. The company’s cloud platform offers computing capacity to customers building AI systems. Rivals, including Alibaba and ByteDance, have also introduced their models in the process of an AI arms race. Alibaba Group Holdings revealed its $3.2 billion pricing of its note offering Alibaba Group Holdings also disclosed the $3.2 billion pricing of its convertible note sale, making it the biggest offering so far in 2025. The offering is scheduled to close on September 16, 2025, pending standard closing conditions. The company estimates earning about $3.13 billion from the net offering. Toughly 80% of which will be used to strengthen its cloud infrastructure, including scaling data centers, upgrading systems, and enhancing service quality. Around 20% of the balance will be invested in international commerce operations, emphasizing operational improvements to boost the global market presence. Upon issuance, the notes will be senior unsecured obligations of Alibaba and will mature on September 15, 2032, unless they are redeemed or repurchased, or converted before that time. These investors cannot convert the notes during the 40 days following issuance, referred to as a “distribution compliance period.” After that, and until the business day before March 15, 2032, holders may convert their notes in $1,000 increments as long as certain conditions are met. In other words, if Alibaba decides to settle conversions, it can pay in cash, ADSs, or a combination of both, providing the company with flexibility to address dilution. Investors who wish to receive ordinary shares instead of ADSs will be required to complete a separate process outside the DTC system and follow applicable deadlines.

Recently, a mysterious Ethereum whale made headlines by acquiring a substantial amount of ETH, stirring curiosity and speculation across the market. This latest move highlights the continuous, dynamic nature of digital asset investments and the powerful influence of major players. Unveiling the Ethereum Whale’s Latest Moves In a fascinating turn of events, an anonymous address recently received a staggering 13,322 ETH, valued at approximately $61.92 million, directly from the institutional trading platform FalconX. This transaction, reported by Onchainlens, occurred just an hour ago, catching the attention of on-chain analysts and investors alike. This isn’t an isolated incident. The same address has been actively accumulating Ethereum, bringing its total haul to an impressive 22,556 ETH, worth around $104.87 million, all sourced through FalconX within the last four days. Such rapid and large-scale accumulation by an Ethereum whale often signals a strategic long-term outlook or a calculated market play. What exactly defines an Ethereum whale ? Significant Holdings: An individual or entity holding a substantial amount of ETH. Market Influence: Their buying or selling actions can significantly impact market sentiment and price. Anonymity: Often, these large holders remain anonymous, known only by their wallet addresses. Why Does an Ethereum Whale’s Activity Matter? The movements of an Ethereum whale are closely watched for several crucial reasons. When a whale makes such a substantial purchase, it can send ripples throughout the market, affecting both investor psychology and the actual supply-demand dynamics of ETH. Consider the potential implications: Bullish Signal: Large-scale accumulation can be interpreted as a strong vote of confidence in Ethereum’s future, potentially encouraging other investors to buy. Supply Shock: Removing a significant amount of ETH from the circulating supply can create scarcity, which, if demand remains constant or increases, could lead to price appreciation. Market Stability: Consistent accumulation by large holders might also indicate a belief in Ethereum’s long-term stability and growth trajectory. Conversely, a sudden sell-off by a whale could trigger panic and significant price drops. Therefore, understanding these patterns is a vital part of cryptocurrency market analysis. Tracking the Mysterious Ethereum Whale: What Can We Learn? While the identity of this particular Ethereum whale remains unknown, the transparent nature of blockchain technology allows anyone to observe their transactions. On-chain data platforms like Onchainlens provide invaluable insights into these movements, offering a window into the strategies of major market participants. Observing whale activity can provide: Trend Indicators: Early signs of potential market shifts or emerging trends. Liquidity Insights: An understanding of where large amounts of capital are moving. Behavioral Patterns: Clues about institutional or sophisticated investor strategies. However, it’s crucial to remember that while on-chain data is transparent, the intentions behind these large transactions are not always clear. An accumulation could be for various reasons, from long-term holding to preparing for a major staking event or even an OTC (over-the-counter) deal. Navigating the Waters: Actionable Insights for Investors For individual investors, the actions of an Ethereum whale can be both fascinating and a source of guidance. However, it’s important not to blindly follow these large movements without conducting your own thorough research. Here are some actionable insights: Diversify Your Portfolio: Never put all your eggs in one basket, regardless of whale activity. Conduct Due Diligence: Always research Ethereum’s fundamentals, technological advancements, and ecosystem growth. Use Whale Data as One Metric: Incorporate whale tracking into a broader analysis strategy, alongside technical and fundamental analysis. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Crypto markets are volatile; invest only what you can afford to lose. The significant accumulation by this anonymous Ethereum whale serves as a potent reminder of the dynamic forces at play in the crypto market. While such large transactions can spark excitement and speculation, they also underscore the importance of informed decision-making and a balanced approach to investing. This latest move from a significant Ethereum whale is certainly one to watch. Whether it signals an imminent market shift or simply a strategic long-term play, it undeniably adds another layer of intrigue to the ever-evolving narrative of the cryptocurrency space. Keeping an eye on these powerful players, while maintaining a clear investment strategy, remains key for navigating the digital asset landscape successfully. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an Ethereum whale? An Ethereum whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Ethereum (ETH). Their holdings are significant enough that their buying or selling activities can notably influence the market price and sentiment of ETH. Why do Ethereum whale movements matter to the market? Whale movements matter because their large transactions can signal potential market trends. Significant buying (accumulation) can indicate bullish sentiment and potentially lead to price increases due to reduced supply, while large selling can signal bearish sentiment and potential price drops. How can I track Ethereum whale activity? You can track Ethereum whale activity using on-chain analytics platforms like Onchainlens, Etherscan, or Whale Alert. These tools monitor large transactions on the Ethereum blockchain and often report them, though the identities of the whales typically remain anonymous. Should I invest based solely on an Ethereum whale’s actions? No, it is not advisable to invest solely based on an Ethereum whale’s actions. While whale movements can provide interesting insights, they should be just one factor in a comprehensive investment strategy. Always conduct your own research, understand market fundamentals, and consider your personal risk tolerance. What is FalconX? FalconX is a cryptocurrency prime brokerage platform that provides institutional investors with a suite of services, including trading, credit, and clearing. It facilitates large-volume transactions for institutions, making it a common platform for significant crypto movements like those seen from this Ethereum whale.

In early 2025, that spotlight is shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . With a presale already delivering 350% gains for its earliest backers, whales contributing six-figure allocations, and momentum building with every stage, MUTM is quietly breaking records, and analysts believe it could be one of the most important DeFi launches of the year. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance’s presale metrics have already set it apart from the crowd. To date, the project has raised more than $15.65 million and attracted 16,250 holders, a milestone rarely seen this early in a token’s lifecycle. The presale is currently in Stage 6, priced at $0.035, and is selling out quickly. Once this stage closes, the price will climb to $0.04, a nearly 20% increase — before the token officially launches at $0.06. For investors entering today, that means locking in early exposure before broader market adoption. Early participants at $0.01 have already seen 350% gains, while even today’s buyers can expect close to 100% upside at launch. To put the numbers into perspective, a $900 investment in MUTM at the current phase stage would be worth $1,550 at the confirmed launch price of $0.06. When MUTM reaches $0.30 post-launch, the stake could surge to $7,750, and at a long-term target of $1.25, that same $900 could be worth over $32,000. Why records matter, the XRP comparison Breaking presale records is more than just a headline; it can be an indicator of what comes next. To see why, look back at XRP’s early growth. Ripple (XRP) started as a relatively obscure project before quickly amassing significant investor interest. That momentum propelled XRP into the top tier of cryptocurrencies, where it remains today. Like XRP in its early days, Mutuum Finance is demonstrating its ability to attract both retail buyers and whales before listing. The presale isn’t just raising funds; it’s building a base of engaged holders who will carry momentum into launch. Analysts argue that this kind of foundation is often the difference between a token that fizzles out and one that becomes a long-term success story. If history is any guide, record-breaking presales can foreshadow explosive adoption once the token is live. Dual lending, borrow rates, and mtTokens Mutuum Finance’s appeal isn’t just about presale numbers; it’s about utility. At its core, the project is a lending and borrowing protocol built to connect lenders and borrowers through two models: In peer-to-contract (P2C) lending, users supply assets such as ETH, BNB, or MATIC into liquidity pools managed by smart contracts. Borrowers can instantly access these funds, while lenders receive mtTokens that represent their deposits and accrue rewards. Interest rates adjust automatically depending on liquidity, creating a balance between supply and demand. In peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, users negotiate directly, making this model ideal for assets that don’t fit neatly into broad pools. Meme coins like DOGE or PEPE, for example, can be loaned or borrowed under custom agreements. The terms are flexible, but smart contracts enforce them transparently, reducing counterparty risk. Mutuum Finance also offers both variable and stable borrowing rates. Variable rates rise or fall with liquidity, while stable rates give borrowers predictable repayment terms even in volatile markets. Combined with the redistribution model — where protocol fees buy MUTM tokens on the open market and redistribute them to mtToken stakers — this system ties token demand directly to platform usage. It’s a structure designed to ensure long-term sustainability, not just presale excitement. Why analysts say MUTM is built to last The presale records are impressive, but analysts say the roadmap is what could make Mutuum Finance truly game-changing. The first major milestone is the beta platform launch, which is scheduled to go live on the same day MUTM lists. That means from day one, users will be able to borrow, lend, and stake — a stark contrast to presale projects that launch without utility. A working platform at listing not only builds immediate trust with investors but also increases the likelihood of top-tier exchange listings. Looking further ahead, the roadmap includes Layer-2 (L2) integration, which will help Mutuum Finance scale as adoption grows. By offloading transactions from congested Layer-1 chains, the protocol can keep fees low and transaction speeds high, even during periods of heavy market activity. This scalability is key to ensuring that Mutuum can support both retail participants and institutional flows without bottlenecks. Taken together, the beta platform and L2 integration are more than just features — they’re proof that MUTM’s growth targets are grounded in planned catalysts, not guesswork. Mutuum Finance is proving it can raise millions, onboard tens of thousands of holders, and deliver triple-digit gains before even hitting exchanges. But what makes it stand out is the combination of record-breaking presale numbers with real fundamentals and a roadmap designed for adoption. With $15.65M raised, whales going all in, a 90/100 CertiK audit, and catalysts like the beta platform launch and L2 scalability, MUTM is positioned for both short-term momentum and long-term impact. Add in future plans such as an over-collateralized stablecoin, and the message becomes clear: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a DeFi protocol structured to last.

It’s not Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana—but rather Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi project priced at just $0.035 that has already soared 350% since its earliest phase. With whale activity, a strong roadmap, and top-tier security measures, many are now comparing MUTM to the early days of some of crypto’s biggest success stories. Analysts’ track record When analysts highlight a new project, it pays to listen. In the past, experts who followed the right signals correctly identified early winners like Solana and Aave. Solana started trading under $5 before exploding past $200 in its peak cycle. At the time, analysts focused on its fast transaction speeds and growing ecosystem as proof that it wasn’t just another blockchain; it was a legitimate competitor to Ethereum. Their calls proved accurate, delivering some of the most dramatic returns in crypto history. Similarly, Aave began as a relatively unknown lending platform but gained traction as analysts pointed to its utility-driven model. It later became one of the leading DeFi protocols, with its token price multiplying rapidly as adoption grew. In both cases, analysts spotted the key indicators: low entry price, strong utility, and a roadmap that was delivered. These same signals are now being connected to Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) After launching at just $0.01, Mutuum Finance’s presale price has already risen to $0.035. That marks a 350% surge for early backers and demonstrates the project’s ability to attract sustained interest. The presale is structured to reward those who enter early. Each new stage lifts the price, with the next phase set at $0.04, almost a 20% increase from where it stands today. The token will officially launch at $0.06, offering today’s buyers significant upside before the market even opens. This steady progression is why analysts say MUTM isn’t just enjoying a one-off spike, but rather building momentum that could carry into its post-launch trading. At its core, Mutuum Finance connects lenders and borrowers through peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending models. In P2C, assets like XRP, USDC, and MATIC are supplied into smart contract pools where borrowers can access liquidity instantly, while lenders earn returns through mtTokens. In P2P, borrowers and lenders negotiate directly, making it possible to use riskier assets such as DOGE or PEPE with customized loan terms. What makes MUTM different Backing these dual lending models is a carefully designed buy-and-redistribute system, one of the protocol’s strongest long-term catalysts. A fraction of every fee generated within Mutuum Finance, whether from lending, borrowing, or repayments, is used to purchase MUTM tokens directly from the open market. These tokens are then redistributed to users who stake their mtTokens, which are received when they deposit assets into the protocol. This mechanism creates a self-sustaining cycle of demand: platform activity funds token buybacks, buybacks fuel staking rewards, and staking encourages users to remain engaged. Over time, this positive feedback loop provides continuous organic buy pressure, something that meme-driven tokens simply cannot replicate since their value often depends solely on social sentiment rather than structural mechanics. Perhaps even more importantly, Mutuum Finance has confirmed that its beta platform will go live on the same day as the token listing, giving it an immediate edge in adoption. Instead of entering the market as a token without real functionality, a common occurrence in the presale space, MUTM will debut with a live platform where users can borrow, lend, and stake from day one. This means the utility that underpins the token will be visible and usable right at launch, which analysts believe is a major catalyst for attracting both retail users and institutional participants. Having a working product also increases the likelihood of early Tier-1 exchange listings, since exchanges tend to prioritize tokens that demonstrate functionality and active ecosystems. For investors, this alignment between launch and utility signals that MUTM is positioned not as a short-term hype-driven play, but as a protocol engineered for fast-tracked adoption. Short-term vs long-term targets With its fundamentals, presale momentum, and whale backing, analysts are setting bold predictions for MUTM’s future. In the short term, once the token lists at $0.06 and the beta platform is live, expectations point to a 300–400% increase from the launch price, driven by exchange listings and immediate utility. Looking into 2025 and beyond, projections become even stronger. Analysts who once identified Solana and Aave early are now suggesting that MUTM could deliver 50x returns over the long term. That would imply a price north of $1.50, turning today’s presale entries into potentially life-changing gains. These targets aren’t based on guesswork but on MUTM’s roadmap. With stablecoin integration, Layer-2 compatibility, and a clear focus on scalability, the protocol is structured for steady growth rather than hype-driven spikes. Analysts have been right before. They spotted Solana when it was trading under $5 and Aave when it was a niche lending platform. Both went on to become giants. Now, those same signals—low cost, utility-driven design, whale confidence, and a strong roadmap—are being tied to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With a presale surge of 350%, over $15.65 million raised, and a beta platform launching at listing, MUTM is already showing signs of strength that many presale projects lack. Add in its CertiK audit score of 90/100 and its ambitious roadmap, and analysts argue it may indeed be the next crypto to explode.

When It Starts, It Will Be Fast and Violent",https://timestabloid.com/analyst-xrp-bull-market-hasnt-started-yet-when-it-starts-it-will-be-fast-and-violent/,"Crypto enthusiast CryptoBull shared a strong view on the current state of XRP, stating that the digital asset’s bull market has not yet begun. In his post, he wrote that the start of the bull run is imminent and emphasized that when it happens, it will be fast and violent. His outlook suggests that the current price action is still in a preparatory stage for a significant move upward. Chart Analysis The chart attached to his post highlights XRP/USD on the one-week timeframe. The chart shows XRP’s historical price behavior divided into bull and bear zones, with the asset currently positioned at the edge of the bear territory and nearing a transition into the bull region. The setup mirrors a past movement where XRP broke out from a bear phase into a strong upward rally. The diagram points to the potential for a similar shift in the near term, indicating that XRP is close to completing the bear cycle and entering the bull phase once again. #XRP Bull market hasn’t even started yet. It will soon. It will be fast and violent pic.twitter.com/zCmgzwv2ZJ — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) September 13, 2025 Community Responses Several community members shared their views in response to CryptoBull’s statement. A user with the name TulipDreamer commented that perhaps the bull market has already arrived, adding that when news of an official interest rate cut is confirmed, the cryptocurrency market could grow rapidly. This comment connects macroeconomic factors , particularly monetary policy decisions, with the possible momentum behind cryptocurrency price action. Another user, identified as TUBombAk47YU, contributed additional information by sharing his perspective on CryptoBull’s price targets. He stated that CryptoBull’s targets remain the same, and while they were not mentioned in the original post, he shared them directly. This user also attached a detailed chart that illustrated a long-term view of XRP. Additional Chart Insights The chart shared by TUBombAk47YU shows XRP breaking out of an eight-year trend, completing what is described as the “cup top level.” The chart also references an earlier breakout from a four-year trend in XRP’s past. It highlights the significance of the current phase, noting that the green circle represents a period of nine months in which XRP has broken the eight-year trend, retested, and is continuing forward. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Projections on the chart display Fibonacci extension levels, with targets at approximately $5.86, $18.22, and $36.76. These levels suggest the possibility of major long-term price appreciation if the breakout structure continues as anticipated. CryptoBull’s post and the supporting chart from another community member emphasize the view that XRP is on the verge of entering a new bull market phase. The analysis ties together past breakout structures, macroeconomic conditions, and technical indicators to present a case for accelerated growth. While CryptoBull did not provide explicit price targets, the shared community chart filled in those details, pointing toward a broad range of potential price levels. Overall, the message delivered is that XRP’s most significant upward movement may still lie ahead, with its official bull market phase yet to begin.

However, the pace of the next upward move in these cryptocurrencies will largely hinge on the magnitude of the anticipated Fed rate cut scheduled for Sept. 17. BTC's seven-day call/put skew, which measures how implied volatility is distributed across calls versus puts expiring in a week, has recovered to nearly zero from the bearish 4% a week ago, according to data source Amberdata. The 30- and 60-day option skews, though still slightly negative, have rebounded from last week’s lows, signaling a notable easing of downside fears. Ether’s options skew is exhibiting a similar pattern at the time of writing. The skew shows the market's directional bias, or the extent to which traders are more concerned about prices rising or falling. A positive skew suggests a bias towards calls or bullish option plays, while a negative reading indicates relatively higher demand for put options or downside protection. The reset in options comes as bitcoin and ether prices see a renewed upswing in the lead-up to Wednesday's Fed rate decision, where the central bank is widely expected to cut rates and lay the groundwork for additional easing over the coming months. BTC has gained over 4% to over $116,000 in seven days, with ether rising nearly 8% to $4,650, according to CoinDesk data. What happens next largely depends on the size of the impending Fed rate cut. According to CME's Fed funds futures, traders have priced in over 90% probability that the central bank will cut rates by 25 basis points (bps) to 4%-4.25%. But there is also a slight possibility of a jumbo 50 bps move. BTC could go berserk in case the Fed delivers the surprise 50 bps move. ""A surprise 50 bps rate cut would be a massive +gamma BUY signal for ETH, SOL and BTC,"" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said in an email. ""Gold will go absolutely nuts as well."" Note that the Deribit-listed SOL options already exhibit a strong bullish sentiment, with calls trading at 4-5 volatility premium to puts. Magadini explained that if the decision comes in line with expectations for a 25 bps cut, then a continued calm ""grind higher"" for BTC looks likely. ETH, meanwhile, may take another week or so to retest all-time highs and convincingly trade above $5,000, he added.",Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|Solana|Options|Markets|market analysis|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|BTC|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-15 05:29:55

While the decision is a big step for Hyperliquid, it also drew some criticism from the crypto community. Some people in the industry called the process unfair and suggested it favored Native Markets from the start. At the same time, Yala’s Bitcoin-backed stablecoin YU came under pressure after an attempted exploit led to a sharp depeg, dropping as low as $0.2046 before partially recovering. Despite assurances that all funds are still safe, YU still trades below its intended $1 peg at about $0.8667. Native Markets Wins USDH Stablecoin Bid Native Markets officially secured the USDH ticker for Hyperliquid’s upcoming dollar-pegged stablecoin. The decision followed a community vote, where Native Markets emerged as the clear frontrunner after prediction market odds spiked to nearly 100% on Polymarket when Ethena, another major contender, withdrew from the race late last week. The result sets the stage for Hyperliquid’s first-ever Improvement Proposal (HIP), through which Native Markets will soon launch USDH alongside an ERC-20 token on Ethereum. According to Native Markets founder Max Fiege , the rollout will begin with a testing phase, where minting and redeeming transactions of up to $800 will be allowed for an initial group of users. After this limited trial, the USDH/USDC spot order book will open, followed by the full launch of uncapped mints and redeems. The main goal of the carefully staged rollout is to ensure stability and security as the new stablecoin enters the market. On the other hand, the process that led to Native Markets’ victory caused a lot of debate in the crypto community. People in the industry criticized the selection process by suggesting it may have been less open than advertised. Dragonfly managing partner Haseeb Qureshi called the request-for-proposal process “a farce,” and claimed that validators showed little to no willingness to consider any bidders other than Native Markets. His comments fed into speculation that the outcome was actually predetermined, with even some framing it as evidence of behind-the-scenes dealmaking. Others used the controversy to shed some light on the broader trends in the stablecoin sector. Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Helius, said that the competition proved how commoditized stablecoins have become. He predicted that in the future, exchanges may streamline the user experience by removing stablecoin tickers altogether, simply displaying “USD” on the front end while managing the backend swaps between stablecoins themselves. Despite the heated competition and subsequent debate around USDH, the launch of the Hyperliquid’s stablecoin is a big step forward in its bid to establish a robust stablecoin presence in the market. Yala’s Bitcoin Stablecoin YU Struggles In other stablecoin news, Yala’s Bitcoin-backed stablecoin YU struggled to recover its dollar peg after an incident on Sunday that sent its value tumbling to $0.2046. The team described the event as an “attempted attack” and assured users that all funds remain safe, with Bitcoin reserves held either self-custodially or in vaults. Yala confirmed that no user assets were lost, though some product features have been paused as a precaution while the team investigates with security firm SlowMist and other partners. In the meantime, the Convert and Bridge functions of the protocol have been disabled to prevent even more instability, while other operations remain unaffected. Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported that an attacker minted 120 million YU on Polygon, bridged a portion to Ethereum and Solana, and sold 7.71 million YU for 7.7 million USDC. The attacker then converted the funds into 1,501 ETH and dispersed them across multiple wallets. There are still large amounts of YU on Polygon, Ethereum, and Solana, which raised concerns about potential further disruptions. YU is designed to maintain a $1 peg using overcollateralized Bitcoin reserves and grew to a $119 million market cap before the incident. However, its liquidity remains shallow, with only $340,000 in USDC available in its Ethereum pool. After crashing below $0.21, YU briefly rebounded as high as $0.917 but has since struggled to hold its value. At press time, the token was trading around $0.8667, still far from its intended peg. YU’s price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The turmoil came as the broader stablecoin market edged toward a historic $300 billion milestone. According to market data, Tether’s USDT, Circle’s USDC, and Ethena Labs’ yield-bearing USDe are still the main drivers of growth, and Yala’s setback proved the challenges newer entrants face when it comes to securing trust and liquidity.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|ETH|BTC|ENA,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-15 05:30:00
51749254,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=808603,1757914232,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51749254.jpeg,China’s economy lost momentum in August,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/chinas-economy-lost-momentum-in-august/,"China’s economy lost momentum for another month in a row, with fresh data showing a deeper-than-expected slowdown and a sharp pullback in investment. The figures raise the odds that Beijing will add support to keep growth on course for its target, increasing the chance authorities will deploy extra steps to steady activity. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said that industrial output, covering mines and factories, rose 5.2% in August compared with the previous year. That was weaker than July’s 5.7% increase and below the 5.6% median forecast in a Bloomberg survey. Furthermore, China’s consumer prices fell 0.4% in August, according to an earlier report by Cryptopolitan . The NBS said “the economy was generally stable” in August, but added that “there are still plenty of instabilities and uncertainties with the external environment, and the economy still faces many risks and challenges.” Household demand also softened. Retail sales grew 3.4% year over year in August, missing expectations for a 3.8% gain and easing from 3.7% in July. Fixed-asset spending for January to August expanded by just 0.5%. The surveyed urban jobless rate edged up to 5.3%. “This confirms a sharp slowdown in the second half of 2025, especially on the investment side,” said Carlos Casanova, senior Asia economist at Union Bancaire Privée in Hong Kong. Economists expect the economy to slow down for the remaining year With an earlier surge in exports fading, many analysts and investors now expect growth to downshift in the closing months of 2025 after the Chinese economy expanded 5.3% in the first half. The scale of any cooling in China, set to remain the biggest driver of global growth from 2025 – 2030, matters for a world economy already under strain from Trump’s tariffs. Even so, the upbeat results in the first six months have left Chinese leaders confident they can still achieve the official goal of “around 5%,” even if momentum weakens later this year. So far, officials haven’t shown any serious signs of preparing a large stimulus package as exports continue to hold up amid Trump’s 2nd trade war. Yet pressures are building, judging by a run of disappointing numbers in recent weeks. A broad measure of credit growth slowed in August for the first time this year. Exports also came in below forecasts, with growth slipping to 4.4% last month. Labor-market signals have softened, too, according to purchasing managers’ indexes and private surveys. Another challenge is the government’s “anti-involution” drive, meant to curb overcapacity and cut back excessive competition among firms. The push, which ramped up in early July, may have contributed to July’s output declines in products from steel to copper. While stock prices have climbed on hopes that the measures will boost profitability, they also risk damping hiring and household spending unless matched by stronger demand-side support. How the campaign plays out remains uncertain, making it difficult to tell when China might break entrenched deflationary pressures. Housing prices in China fell in August Housing adds to the strain. Official figures show new-house prices decreased 0.3% in August from July, the same monthly drop as in July, extending a weak streak that began in May 2023. Compared with a year earlier, prices fell 2.5% in August, moderating from a 2.8% decline in July. The property downturn began in 2021, and multiple rounds of relief, including mortgage-rate cuts and a program to renovate urban villages, have yet to deliver a lasting turn. The sustained weakness in demand means the housing market remains a drag on growth. Price declines were widespread. Of the 70 cities surveyed by the NBS, 57 reported decreases month-on-month, and 65 saw year-on-year declines. Prices for existing homes also weakened. Tier-one cities posted a 3.5% drop from a year earlier, prices in tier-two cities fell 5.2%, and tier-three cities were down 6.0%. Separate figures highlighted the industry’s slump. Property investment tumbled 12.9% year over year in the January–August period, while property sales by floor area fell 4.7%. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Many investors stayed on the sidelines at first because they were skeptical, but they later saw SOL become one of the best performers in the last cycle. If you look at crypto prices today, it looks like history is about to repeat itself with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi startup that is now worth only $0.035 in its presale. Presale momentum meets innovative lending design Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already demonstrating the same underdog spirit that Solana (SOL) used to have. The token is in Phase 6 of its presale and has raised $15.75 million. More than 16,300 people bought it early. Forty percent of the current supply has already been sold, and the CertiK audit is making people feel more secure about it quickly. Investors are starting to link its climb to Solana (SOL)’s early ascent because of this momentum. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model is the most important part of Mutuum’s design. It will put deposits of assets like USDT, USDC, ETH, and ADA into certified smart contracts. Lenders will always get a return on their investment, while borrowers will be able to access cash without having to sell their possessions. If you deposit $8,000 worth of USDT, for instance, you will get mtUSDT tokens and make about $1,200 in a year at a 15% APY. Another user, on the other hand, will be able to borrow about $1,125 by putting up $1,500 worth of LINK as collateral. This way, they will still be exposed to LINK’s future performance while getting cash right away. This balance between making money and borrowing money will be what makes people want to buy MUTM tokens. And with a beta launch scheduled before the official listing, customers will be able to try out these features for themselves, which is expected to get more people interested. Risk controls and expanding market opportunities Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also offer a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending model for assets that are too volatile for pooled contracts. This will help keep the protocol safe and able to grow. In this arrangement, tokens like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE will be kept separate. Lenders and borrowers will talk openly about interest rates, loan terms, and how long they have to pay back the loan. This method will create more ways to make money without putting the primary liquidity pools’ stability in danger. Market volatility has always been an important part of how well DeFi platforms do. Mutuum is getting ready to deal with this by establishing Stability Factors, Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, and liquidation methods that are well thought out. Assets like ETH and stablecoins will have an LTV of up to 75% and a liquidation threshold of about 80%. Riskier tokens, on the other hand, will have an LTV of just 35–40% and a liquidation threshold of about 65%. Liquidators will also have reasons to settle troubled loans, which will keep the protocol solvent even when the market is very volatile. For investors who keep an eye on crypto charts or the movement of institutional money into new crypto ETFs, these protections show that Mutuum is more than simply another DeFi platform. It is being created to keep growing in both good and bad markets. It’s getting harder and harder to deny how similar this is to Solana (SOL) in its early days. Ignoring MUTM at $0.035 could be a move that investors regret later, just like SOL was ignored before it broke records. With a planned listing price of $0.06 already projected and major exchanges getting ready to add the tokens, this presale is your final chance to get them at this lower price. In the DeFi market, people who act before the crowd are always rewarded. With a strong presale, a buy-and-distribute mechanism, and an upcoming beta launch, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is on track to become the next token to tell the same success story as Solana (SOL)—but this time with even more momentum.

51749747,https://invezz.com/?p=2881217,1757914560,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Best cheap crypto to buy now is a DeFi token with real utility and 120x potential,https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/15/best-cheap-crypto-to-buy-now-is-a-defi-token-with-real-utility-and-120x-potential/,"In a market where retail investors are still unsure why crypto is down, even though more people are using it, the best long-term strategy will focus on ventures that offer both low prices and real usefulness. Tokens that are made to do more than just trade will do well in the next bull run. They will also help the economy grow. This is why analysts are looking into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi token that was only $0.035 in presale but is expected to rise to $4.20 in the future, giving early investors a chance to make 120 times their money. Utility that drives real demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a loan protocol that has two new parts: peer-to-contract (P2C) pools and peer-to-peer (P2P) lanes. This setup will let customers select between pooled liquidity and direct matching, which will work for both retail traders and institutions. The project will also release mtTokens, which are digital tokens that reflect deposits and staking claims inside the ecosystem. People who stake mtTokens will get MUTM incentives, which will keep the demand for the token going. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stablecoin is another important thing that is being worked on. When people borrow, it will be made, and when they pay it back, it will be burned. This links the circulation of stablecoins directly to borrowing. These mechanisms, along with a systematic repurchase program funded by protocol income, will keep MUTM in a state of utility and demand-driven. This blend of loan usefulness, stablecoin demand, and token staking gives crypto investors a solid base that many other speculative assets don’t have. Presale details and the urgency window The price of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is $0.035, and it is in Phase 6 of its presale. More than 16,300 people have already bought 40% of this phase, bringing in $15.75 million. CertiK gave the security a Token Scan score of 90.00 and a Skynet rating of 79.00. The community is still growing, with more than 12,000 Twitter followers. The next step will raise the price to $0.04, which is a 15% increase. This is the last chance to get in at this lower price before the value goes up. People who keep an eye on the crypto fear and greed index will see this as a unique chance to buy before big companies do. A customer in Phase 6 who pays $0.035 will see the price go up to $0.06 when the item is listed. This is a rise of 70% on paper. For instance, you can buy 71,400 tokens with a $2,500 allocation. That position will be worth $4,300 at $0.06, which means you will make almost $1,800 right away. If you increase today’s $0.035 by 120X, you get a confident long-term estimate of $4.20. If you pay $500 today, you will get 14,300 tokens. That investment will be worth $60,000 when the price hits $4.20, which is a whopping 120X what you put in. People who joined Phase 1 early and paid $0.01 will see $4.20 as a 420X gain, which means their $1,000 will become $420,000. These results show how much potential genuine utility tokens can have over time. Why the 120x path is credible Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE) will help stablecoin borrowers use correlated assets more efficiently, which will lead to bigger, more frequent borrowing flows. As the value of locked dollars grows, the amount of money made from fees will grow a lot. The utilization-based interest model will change rates in real time, raising them when there isn’t enough money and lowering them when there is. This design will keep deep liquidity and make sure that fee income is predictable so that it can be used for buybacks and staking incentives. The protocol treasury will get the money from liquidation fines. When an under-collateralized loan is paid off, the money will go into reserves that can be used to pay for incentives and buybacks later. Over time, this will lower the amount of money in circulation and help prices go up. These mechanisms, along with more people using them, will support the long-term 120× growth. At listing, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch its ecosystem on a Layer-2 chain. Compared to Layer-1 networks, this integration will lower transaction costs by a huge amount, making it possible to use borrowing and staking capabilities often. Along with this, the Beta version of the site will be available, allowing early users to use real features and start making money right away. This dual launch will soon produce network effects, which will speed up the rise of total value locked and boost demand for MUTM. Conclusion Security and incentives for the community make the market even more ready. The CertiK audit gives you a strong reason to trust it. A $50,000 bug bounty with tiered prizes up to $2,000 encourages outside testing, and a $100,000 giveaway will get more people involved and spread the word around the world. In Phase 6, 40% of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already been sold. Once this stage is over, Phase 7 will boost the price to $0.04, which means that new players won’t be able to make any money right away. This DeFi token has a 70% return on listing and a long-term path to $4.20. It is one of the best 120× possibilities on the market because it is cheap to buy and has practical uses. Now is the time for investors who want more than just speculation.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple all posted notable price action, supported by favourable macroeconomic indicators and increasing institutional activity. Traders now await the Federal Reserve’s rate decision later this week, with most analysts anticipating a 25 basis point cut on Wednesday. The outcome is expected to shape near-term momentum across the cryptocurrency market, which has seen renewed optimism despite ongoing volatility. Bitcoin above $116,000 but faces resistance Bitcoin recovered above the $116,000 threshold, helped by expectations of US Federal Reserve rate cuts and political shifts that could broaden institutional adoption of digital assets. The world’s largest cryptocurrency gained 3.72% last week but met resistance at the $116,000 daily level on Saturday before slipping slightly. By Monday, it traded at around $116,300. Market watchers suggest that a daily close above $116,000 could drive Bitcoin toward the psychological $120,000 level. However, selling pressure from long-term holders could weigh on momentum. Lookonchain reported that two Bitcoin wallets tied to an eight-year holder deposited 1,176 BTC—worth about $136 million—into trading platform Hyperliquid on Sunday and “started dumping.” Lookonchain @lookonchain · Follow After a two-week break, the #BitcoinOG who exchanged 35,991 $BTC ($4.04B) for 886,371 $ETH ($4.07B) is back to selling $BTC !2 wallets linked to this #BitcoinOG have deposited 1,176 $BTC ($136.2M) to Hyperliquid in the past 2 hours and started dumping. x.com/lookonchain/st… 6:54 pm · 14 Sept 2025 67 Reply Copy link Read 23 replies The same wallet had previously exchanged over $4 billion worth of Bitcoin for Ether in August. Ethereum strengthens on price breakout and ETF flows Ethereum continued its upward momentum, trading above $4,600 with a weekly gain of about 8%. The cryptocurrency broke through the $4,488 consolidation boundary on Friday, rallying 5.68% before pulling back 2.25% over the weekend. At Monday’s levels near $4,620, analysts suggest ETH could extend its rally toward the record high of $4,956 if it holds above $4,488. A drop below that level, however, could send prices lower toward $4,232. Institutional flows are reinforcing Ethereum’s rally. Spot Ether ETFs saw $405.55 million in net inflows on Friday, marking a fourth straight day of gains. BlackRock’s ETHA pulled in $165.56 million, while Fidelity’s FETH attracted $168.23 million. Total Ether ETF inflows have now reached $13.36 billion, with net assets at $30.35 billion. XRP holds momentum after technical breakout Ripple also posted gains after breaking out of a falling wedge pattern last week, a move that favours bullish sentiment. XRP rallied 2.5% through Friday and Saturday before easing slightly on Sunday. By Monday, it hovered around $3.03. If XRP sustains its upward momentum, analysts point to a potential move toward its $3.40 resistance level. A downside correction, however, could bring it back toward the 50-day EMA at $2.94.

People who saw its potential to disrupt things early on made life-changing profits, while those who waited had to pay higher costs to get in. People are having a similar discourse about Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a penny token that is currently in presale and is being compared to the early days of Bitcoin (BTC). MUTM is becoming one of the crypto coins that analysts are making bold predictions about since it is based on innovation and has a clear roadmap for the future. More and more, investors who are keeping an eye on what’s going on with crypto nowadays know that fresh tokens are where the best chances are. Early adoption has always been a big factor in making money with digital assets. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is putting itself at the center of decentralized finance innovation by introducing a new lending model, stablecoin mechanics, and a buyback-and-distribute framework that will reward people who stick around for a long time. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has captured attention Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is working on a decentralized loan and borrowing platform that will also have a built-in stablecoin system. The stablecoin will always try to stay at $1. It will only be created when people borrow against collateral like ETH, and it will be burned automatically when the loans are paid back or liquidated. Interest rates will not change depending only on market supply and demand, which is different from other procedures. Instead, the governance will change them to keep the stablecoin in balance. When the peg goes above $1, rates will go down to promote more borrowing. When the peg goes below $1, rates will go up. Arbitrage will make stability even stronger since traders will make money off of slight variations to bring the value back to its target. The project’s presale development shows that it is gaining speed. MUTM is currently in Phase 6 and costs $0.035. It has already raised more than $15.75 million and sold 40% of its supply to 16,300 investors. As Phase 7 gets near, the presale price will go up to $0.040, which will bring investors one step closer to the expected listing price of $0.06. This framework makes anyone who wants to get in on the ground floor of what many now see as a future blue-chip DeFi platform feel like they need to act quickly. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just a stablecoin; but it is also creating a sustainable way to borrow money. Interest rates will change according on how much each pool is used, keeping things fair between lenders and borrowers. When there is a lot of cash available, borrowing costs will stay low, which makes loans more appealing. When liquidity gets tighter, rates will go up, which will benefit lenders and encourage people to pay back their loans. This cycle will let Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stay efficient even when things are unstable, which will help both lenders and borrowers expand steadily. Roadmap, trust, and security There are four obvious steps in the vision for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Phase 1 has already included the launch of the presale, marketing efforts, giveaways, an audit of the smart contract, tracking platform listings, and the addition of an AI-powered helpdesk. The last tasks in Phase 1, such as developing teaching materials and putting together a compliance team, will be done soon. In Phase 2, the main focus will be on creating the core smart contracts, the DApp front-end and back-end systems, as well as code reviews and the introduction of risk parameters. The demo version, testnet beta, thorough audits, and end of the presale will all happen in Phase 3. Last but not least, Phase 4 will launch the live Mutuum Finance (MUTM) platform, add listings on exchanges, develop collaborations with institutions, and expand to multiple chains. Security safeguards make investors feel even more secure. CertiK has looked into the MUTM smart contract and given it a Token Scan Score of 90 and a Skynet score of 79. These numbers put it much above average for projects in their early stages and show how committed the team is to being open. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also giving a 50,000 USDT bug bounty program to encourage people in the community to help keep the platform safe. Rewards are based on how serious the problem is. Critical problems can earn up to $2,000, large problems can earn up to $1,000, medium-level finds can win up to $500, and low-level reports can earn up to $200. This method adds expert oversight to decentralized participation, which makes the platform stronger as it gets bigger. More and more, experts are comparing the early adoption curve of BTC to where MUTM is currently. Both are examples of revolutionary technologies that came out when many were skeptical. They both include mechanics that make them scalable over time, and they both reward people who see promise before the rest of the market does. With Phase 6 almost done and a price spike coming soon, the rationale for getting in early is greater than ever. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of the best prospects in the market for people looking for the next initiative to follow in Bitcoin’s (BTC) amazing path.

They have both become dominant by using smart contracts, staking ecosystems, and deep liquidity. This is why they are always seen on crypto charts and are often used as benchmarks for the whole market. However, with crypto prices today demonstrating a growing interest in fresh, high-yield DeFi solutions, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming a project that will not only be spoken about but is also expected to do better than both SOL and ETH in the next cycle. How Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will redefine DeFi lending beyond ETH and SOL With its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) approach, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is getting ready to change how decentralized lending and borrowing function. This mechanism will put together user deposits of stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and DAI, as well as major tokens like ETH, ADA, and BTC, into smart contracts that have been checked. Then, borrowers will be able to get these funds by putting up assets that are worth more than the loan amount. Lenders will keep making money as long as they are involved. Interest rates will change according on how much the pool is used, making sure that both capital efficiency and system solvency stay the same. For example, A lender puts $12,500 worth of USDC into the system and gets mtUSDC tokens in exchange. This investor will make $1,900 in passive income in a year with an average yearly percentage yield of 15%. On the other hand, a borrower locks up $3,000 worth of ADA as collateral and borrows $2,300 without having to sell their ADA. This way, you can get your money back without giving up your chance to invest in ADA’s future growth. The presale, which is now in Phase 6 and has tokens priced at $0.035, is at the heart of this development. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has now raised $15.75 million and sold 40% of this phase’s allocation. More than 16,300 people have joined, and a CertiK audit has made it more credible. This presale performance shows why MUTM is being studied attentively as one of the next breakout tokens. Investors who follow crypto ETF movements and know how institutions choose safe, income-generating assets will comprehend this. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s dual lending system and risk controls signal outperformance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will have both a pooled lending model and a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system, which is different from Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). This feature will let lenders and borrowers talk directly about interest rates, repayment terms, and loan amounts for tokens that are more risky or volatile, like DOGE, PEPE, or FLOKI. By keeping these assets separate from the P2C pools, the platform will keep its essential stability while also opening up other ways to make money. Managing volatility will also be an important part of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s structure. The Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios will change depending on the asset. For example, stablecoins and ETH will have LTVs of up to 75%, while higher-risk tokens would only have LTVs of 35–40%. Stable assets will have a liquidation barrier of 80%, and volatile tokens will have a threshold of 65%. This will provide liquidators room to settle undercollateralized positions at a lower price. Reserve factors of 10% to 40% will give an extra layer of protection, making sure the platform stays solvent even when prices change quickly. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be able to take advantage of both bullish and negative markets by being stable and flexible at the same time. Investors looking at crypto prices now know how volatility affects lending processes. This kind of multi-layered design will make MUTM stand out as a stable long-term performer. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is approaching the market at the appropriate time. There will be a beta launch before the official token release, and major exchanges are likely to offer the token after that. As the larger cycle picks up speed and institutional money flows into crypto ETFs because of Bitcoin’s impending halving, the need for new DeFi methods will grow.

The 81-year-old billionaire, Oracle’s co-founder and current CTO, became the richest person in the world for a day last week after Oracle shares exploded on the back of massive AI contracts. The key driver? A huge new partnership with OpenAI, plus over $455 billion in signed contracts tied to cloud and artificial intelligence. That earnings report triggered Oracle’s biggest single-day gain since 1992. Larry, who owns around 40% of the company, shot up to a net worth of $363 billion, briefly overtaking Elon Musk, as Cryptopolitan previously reported. And he’s doing it all with Donald Trump’s backing. At a White House event in January, Trump appeared with Larry to announce Stargate, a $500 billion AI data center venture between Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank. Larry stood on stage next to Trump, Sam Altman, and Masayoshi Son. Larry told former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair at a Dubai summit in February, “AI is a much bigger deal than the Industrial Revolution, electricity and everything that’s come before.” Larry moves into media, Trump wants him to buy TikTok Right after that Oracle earnings bombshell, The Wall Street Journal reported the Ellison family is now preparing a majority-cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery. That would combine Paramount Global, already taken over by Larry’s son David Ellison, with another entertainment giant, creating a new super-conglomerate controlling Paramount+, HBO Max, and two of Hollywood’s biggest studios. David is running Skydance Media, which merged with Paramount to form this new powerhouse. But it’s Larry who controls the entities that own it. The same week the Warner Bros. news leaked, it also came out that David is pursuing an acquisition of the Free Press, the digital news site founded by Bari Weiss. Talks are underway to give Bari a leading editorial role at CBS News, which Skydance now owns under its new setup. David has also installed Trump ally Kenneth Weinstein as CBS News ombudsman, tightening his grip on the editorial direction. Trump himself called David “a great man” after reaching a $16 million legal settlement with CBS over a “60 Minutes” episode. While Larry was once a supporter of Bill Clinton, he now sits comfortably in Trump’s orbit. In 2020, he even hosted a fundraiser for Trump at his estate, but didn’t show up personally. The TikTok angle is just as loud. Larry’s been circling TikTok since 2020, when Trump tried to force its Chinese parent ByteDance to sell off U.S. operations. Biden signed a TikTok ban in 2024, but Trump returned to office and paused enforcement while trade talks with China continued. At the White House event in January, Trump was asked about Elon buying TikTok. He said, “I’d be fine with that… I’d like Larry to buy it, too.” Larry stays in control at Oracle and builds his personal empire Even after handing over the CEO title, Larry’s still running things. People inside Oracle say he leads weekly development meetings and keeps a tight partnership with CEO Safra Catz. In 2024, it bought health-data company Cerner for $28.3 billion, and Larry used that to explain his long-term strategy. “Healthcare was the only big problem Elon left us,” he said at the Oracle Health Summit. Larry doesn’t hide his admiration for Elon Musk, often calling him an influence. When Elon needed investors for the $44 billion Twitter buyout, Larry texted him offering “a billion… or whatever you recommend.” His Ellison Institute of Technology is directly inspired by Elon’s company network. The institute is working with Oxford University researchers using Oracle tech to find profitable solutions for climate change, food security, and more. Larry’s obsession with control goes back decades, as Cryptopolitan detailed in an Op-ed by the same author. In 2000, during Microsoft’s antitrust scandal, he admitted to hiring investigators to dig into Microsoft’s ties to lobbyists and politicians. He called it his “civic duty.” In the early 2000s, Larry got sued by shareholders after dumping $900 million in Oracle stock before earnings missed. He didn’t admit guilt but settled and donated $100 million to charity. Larry started all this after dropping out of college twice, getting a job at Ampex, and working on a CIA database project named “Oracle.” He liked the name so much, he used it for his own startup in 1977. Oracle went public in 1986, and by the ’90s, he was a billionaire. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

He recently shared an astounding statistic on X: a staggering $625 billion in capital has flowed into Bitcoin’s network over just the last 1.5 years, from 2024 to 2025. This figure is not just significant; it absolutely dwarfs the cumulative $435 billion recorded over Bitcoin’s entire previous 15-year history, from 2009 to 2024. What does this massive surge in capital mean for the world’s leading cryptocurrency? Understanding the Monumental Bitcoin On-Chain Inflows When we talk about Bitcoin on-chain inflows , we are referring to the total value of Bitcoin moving onto exchanges or other known on-chain entities. This metric often indicates the amount of capital entering the Bitcoin ecosystem, either for trading, investment, or other purposes. A higher inflow suggests increased participation and liquidity within the market. Ju Ki-young’s data highlights an unprecedented shift: Recent Surge: $625 billion in capital inflows over the past 1.5 years (2024-2025). Historical Context: This surpasses the $435 billion accumulated over the previous 15 years (2009-2024). Magnitude: The recent period alone accounts for nearly 1.5 times the total inflows of the entire preceding era. This dramatic acceleration in capital entering the Bitcoin network underscores a profound change in investor behavior and market dynamics. What’s Fueling This Unprecedented Bitcoin On-Chain Surge? Several key factors are likely contributing to this monumental increase in Bitcoin on-chain inflows . Understanding these drivers helps us grasp the current market sentiment and future potential: Spot Bitcoin ETFs: The approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in major markets has opened the floodgates for institutional and traditional retail investors. These regulated products provide an easier, more familiar avenue for capital to enter the Bitcoin market without directly owning the underlying asset. Institutional Adoption: Beyond ETFs, more corporations and financial institutions are allocating capital to Bitcoin, either directly or through derivatives. They view Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, a hedge against inflation, or a strategic investment. Macroeconomic Climate: Global economic uncertainties, inflation concerns, and a search for alternative stores of value continue to push investors towards Bitcoin. Its decentralized nature and finite supply make it an attractive option during turbulent times. Retail Investor Interest: Renewed media attention, coupled with Bitcoin’s price appreciation, often sparks a ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO) among individual investors, driving more capital into the market. These combined forces create a powerful tailwind, propelling Bitcoin into a new era of capital influx. The Far-Reaching Implications of Growing Bitcoin On-Chain Inflows The implications of such significant Bitcoin on-chain inflows are vast and multifaceted. They signal a maturing market and could shape Bitcoin’s trajectory for years to come. Increased Liquidity and Stability: Higher capital inflows generally lead to greater market liquidity, potentially reducing price volatility over the long term as the market deepens. Validation of Bitcoin: The sheer volume of capital entering the ecosystem serves as a powerful validation of Bitcoin’s legitimacy and long-term viability as a global asset. Ecosystem Growth: More capital means more resources for development, innovation, and expansion within the broader crypto ecosystem, including layer-2 solutions and DeFi protocols. Potential for Price Appreciation: While not a direct predictor, sustained inflows often precede or accompany periods of significant price appreciation, reflecting strong demand. However, it is also important to consider that large inflows can sometimes be followed by outflows, particularly if market sentiment shifts or profit-taking occurs. Monitoring these metrics provides crucial insights. Navigating the Future of Bitcoin’s Capital Dynamics The data from CryptoQuant’s CEO, Ju Ki-young, paints a clear picture: Bitcoin is experiencing an unprecedented era of capital accumulation. This isn’t just a fleeting trend; it represents a fundamental shift in how the world views and invests in digital assets. The transition from niche technology to mainstream investment vehicle is accelerating, driven by robust institutional interest and evolving global economic landscapes. For investors, understanding these massive Bitcoin on-chain inflows means recognizing the growing mainstream acceptance and the potential for continued market expansion. While volatility remains a characteristic of the crypto market, the underlying capital commitment suggests a strong foundation for future growth. Staying informed about on-chain metrics and broader market trends will be key to navigating this exciting phase of Bitcoin’s journey. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What exactly are Bitcoin on-chain inflows? Bitcoin on-chain inflows refer to the total value of Bitcoin moving into wallets on exchanges or other known on-chain entities. This metric is typically measured in fiat currency (like USD) and indicates the amount of capital being deposited into the Bitcoin ecosystem, often for trading or investment purposes. 2. Why are the recent Bitcoin on-chain inflows so significant? The recent inflows are significant because, according to CryptoQuant CEO Ju Ki-young, $625 billion has entered the network in just the past 1.5 years (2024-2025). This figure dramatically surpasses the cumulative $435 billion recorded over Bitcoin’s entire previous 15-year history (2009-2024), highlighting an unprecedented acceleration of capital adoption. 3. What factors are contributing to this massive surge in Bitcoin capital? Key factors include the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have made Bitcoin more accessible to institutional and traditional investors, increasing institutional adoption, a favorable macroeconomic climate driving demand for alternative assets, and renewed interest from retail investors. 4. How do these large inflows impact Bitcoin’s price and market stability? While not a direct guarantee of price increases, significant inflows generally indicate strong demand and can contribute to price appreciation. They also tend to increase market liquidity, which can help stabilize prices over the long term as the market becomes deeper and more mature. 5. Is this trend of increasing Bitcoin on-chain inflows sustainable? Many analysts believe the trend is sustainable due to ongoing institutional adoption, the expanding utility of Bitcoin, and its role as a hedge in a volatile global economy. However, market dynamics can change, and continued monitoring of economic indicators and regulatory developments is essential.

It was expected that after the Bitcoin price hit multiple new all-time highs over the last two years, altcoins would follow. Bitcoin continued to outperform the top altcoins by a large margin, and this blocked the way for the altcoin season to begin. However, with the market recovery, there is now a chance that the altcoin season might begin again. Altcoin Season Index On The Rise The Altcoin Season index takes into account the performance of the top 100 altcoins versus the performance of the Bitcoin price. This comparison is then charted and plotted over a 90-day period to show how these large-cap altcoins have performed against the pioneer cryptocurrency. Depending on the number of altcoins that are outperforming Bitcoin in this 90-day period, the index deduces whether the market is headed into an altcoin season or not. Now, the higher the figure on the index, the higher the chances that an alt season might begin. When there are more than 75 altcoins outperforming the Bitcoin price in a 90-day period, then it is the needed signal that the alt season has begun. In 2025, the Altcoin Season Index has trended low, mostly below the 50% mark. However, with the recent market recovery over the weekend, the index has now achieved its highest level this year, suggesting that an altcoin season is drawing closer. According to data from the CoinMarketCap website, the Altcoin Season Index is sitting at a score of 67% at the time of this writing. With 75% being the target, it means that the market just needs another 8 of the top 100 altcoins to outperform Bitcoin to use in an alt season. What To Expect Previous market performances have shown altcoin seasons to be a period of explosive rallies for altcoins. The last alt season was categorized by notable rallies such as Dogecoin’s 36,000% rise and Shiba Inu’s legendary rally that saw it temporarily flip Dogecoin. There was also the DeFi summer during this time that ushered the likes of Fantom, Polygon, and Uniswap into the limelight. Given this, it is expected that the next altcoin season will send existing altcoins flying while giving new narratives a chance to outperform as well.",Altcoins|Altcoin|altcoin news|Altcoin season Altcoin season|Altcoin season news|altcoins|Altcoins news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-15 06:00:08

In the post, he addressed this pullback, framing it as a short-term development within a broader uptrend. His analysis suggested that while downside levels should be monitored, the overall trend remains positive. THIS IS WHY #XRP DUMPED! (watch within 24 hours) pic.twitter.com/idUlueKj8A — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 14, 2025 XRP’s Recent Pullback The video centered on recent chart behavior. He pointed out that XRP had broken out from a falling wedge pattern a few days ago, and initially moved higher, regaining the $3.1 level and showing signs of a continued climb. However, it has since encountered some resistance. On lower time frames, the token has been retreating, prompting questions about whether this downturn signals deeper weakness or a temporary correction. Support Levels in Focus The analyst applied a Fibonacci retracement to the latest upward move that began from the lowest point on September 1 . From this perspective, key support levels emerge at $2.98, $2.93, and the stronger $2.87 zone, which he described as the golden ratio. According to him, these areas represent important markers for traders considering entries in line with the prevailing trend. He argued that this pullback may offer opportunities rather than concern. “This could be a very interesting area to potentially open up new long positions,” he explained, linking short-term weakness to the potential for renewed upside now that the asset’s consolidation phase is over . Upside Targets Remain Intact Steph positioned the correction as a healthy part of market structure rather than a sign of trend reversal. Despite the immediate pullback, the analyst highlighted that the technical price target following the wedge breakout sits around $3.64, just below the recent peak of $3.65 . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He described this as a gain of more than 20% from current levels. Beyond that, he noted the next targets at $4, $4.5, $4.6, and potentially $5, while stressing the importance of approaching each step sequentially. He further pointed to the daily EMA ribbons, noting that XRP continues to trade above them. This, in his view, shows that “the trend is still up” despite short-term corrections. The daily RSI, he added, does not yet show bearish divergence, reinforcing the argument for continuation higher. He noted bearish divergence on XRP’s weekly chart, signaling a possible correction in a few months. Still, he framed the weekend dip as minor. From a risk-to-reward perspective, he concluded that the downside appears limited compared to the “absolutely massive” potential upside.

This will be Trump’s fourth extension since he started his second term in January. The law originally gave ByteDance until January 2025 to sell TikTok’s U.S. assets or face a ban. The extension comes as American and Chinese officials meet for a second day of trade talks in Spain on Monday amid a deadline this month for the Chinese owner of TikTok to find a buyer. The talks, led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, are the latest effort to defuse a trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Trump extends TikTok deadline again during talks “We may let it die, or we may, I don’t know, it depends, up to China. It doesn’t matter too much. I’d like to do it for the kids.” Those were Trump’s uncertain comments on Sunday when a reporter inquired about TikTok’s future. The president had already moved the deadline multiple times , first to April, then to June, and now to September. With each extension, he said that American buyers are ready to take over TikTok’s operations and wanted to give the talks more time, but he never settled on one clear path forward. The White House hasn’t confirmed the extension yet, but these repeated delays show that Trump isn’t entirely certain about shutting down the app for good. Over 170 million people across the country use TikTok, and cutting them off would cause frustration and risk their income sources. A ban could also trigger pushback from the younger Americans, which is risky for Trump, who wants to keep their support. At the same time, lawmakers in Washington remain strict about China and warn that TikTok gives Beijing access to personal information . With this, the country can influence what Americans see online and risk national security. Besides national security, Trump also wants to keep TikTok alive for political reasons. The app was one of his biggest campaign channels in 2024, as it allowed the president to reach the younger voters and give him the advantage he needed. With these delayed extensions, Trump is trying to buy more time to negotiate with ByteDance and possible U.S investors while avoiding direct confrontation with a generation of voters who may not take the ban as lightly or calmly. U.S.-China trade talks delay TikTok sale deal The fact that any transfer of TikTok’s prized algorithm cannot happen without approval from Beijing has slowed down efforts to close a deal. Officials and investors almost had a deal that would give a new company in the U.S. major ownership of TikTok’s U.S. operations, but China retracted the talks after Trump announced steep tariffs on Chinese goods. Negotiations started again on Sunday in Spain. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and top trade negotiator Li Chenggang. They included TikTok in the agenda for the first time, unlike the previous Geneva, London, and Stockholm meetings, where it was never mentioned. Still, people close to the talks said they don’t expect an agreement before the September 17 deadline. Adding TikTok to the public agenda in Spain is a strategic play by the Trump administration to extend the deadline again, since it can now argue that active talks with China are ongoing. But this move doesn’t come without political risks because both Republicans and Democrats in Congress supported the law that required ByteDance to sell TikTok’s U.S. operations or face a shutdown. Many lawmakers are now frustrated with the repeated extensions and may put a lot of pressure on Trump’s administration if he does it one more time.

Key Takeaways: Native Markets won the USDH stablecoin bid for Hyperliquid, defeating Paxos and other rivals. Paxos failed to gain traction despite a revised proposal offering deep PayPal integration, incentives, and capped revenue share. Native Markets plans a phased USDH rollout, backed by validator support and a reserve strategy involving BlackRock and Superstate. The decision, finalized Sunday , followed weeks of speculation and community debate, with Native Markets ultimately pulling ahead after validator commitments and prediction markets heavily favored the team. Ethena, once seen as a top contender, exited the race on Thursday , citing community concerns about its non-native infrastructure. Paxos Falls Short in USDH Bid Despite Midweek Proposal Revision Paxos remained in contention but failed to gain momentum despite revising its proposal midweek. Paxos’ Version 2 pitch included a deep integration of USDH into PayPal and Venmo, zero-cost on/off-ramps, and a $20 million incentive plan. It also commited all USDH revenue to Hyperliquid’s growth until $1 billion in total value locked (TVL) is reached, with Paxos capping its own share at 5% beyond $5 billion. Criticism emerged over the process itself. Some observers argued the compressed RFP timeline and validator links to Hyperliquid infrastructure may have given Native Markets an edge. Still, the vote concluded with broad validator backing and strong odds on prediction platform Myriad. Founder Max Fiege announced a phased rollout plan beginning with the submission of a Hyperliquid Improvement Proposal. The launch will include limited minting and redemption trials, capped at $800 per user, to test core functions before opening a USDH/USDC spot market and eventually unlocking full access. Native Markets has been awarded the USDH ticker on Hyperliquid. Thank you to all HYPE stakers and network validators for their time and effort in reviewing the proposals put forward. — max.hl (@fiege_max) September 14, 2025 Native Markets pitched a tightly integrated stablecoin strategy tailored to Hyperliquid. Reserves in cash and US Treasuries will be managed off-chain by BlackRock, while on-chain tokenized assets will be handled via Superstate and Stripe’s Bridge infrastructure. Notably, the team pledged to split all reserve yield between Hyperliquid’s Assistance Fund and broader ecosystem growth. The team’s credibility was bolstered by backers with experience at Uniswap Labs, Paradigm, and Polychain. Early endorsements from validator groups such as CMI Trading helped further solidify support. Trump-Backed GENIUS Act Boosts US Push for Dollar-Pegged Stablecoins The recent passage of the GENIUS Act , signed by President Trump, aims to cement the dollar’s dominance by backing dollar-pegged stablecoins in global markets. The Treasury Department expects the stablecoin market to exceed $2 trillion by 2028, a projection that places greater emphasis on liquidity, interoperability, and regulatory alignment across the ecosystem. Tether’s latest move underscores a pragmatic shift toward that future. As reported, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has said the stablecoin sector is poised for explosive growth, projecting the market could balloon from its current $250 billion capitalization to as much as $2 trillion in the near future. “Many people think it will reach $1 to $2 trillion in a handful of years,” Garlinghouse said, adding that Ripple is positioned to benefit from that trajectory. Meanwhile, Western Union is positioning itself for a new phase of digital transformation, signaling strong interest in using stablecoins to modernize its global remittance operations.

Nasdaq-listed Forward Industries (FORD) has revealed its intentions to invest directly in the burgeoning Solana-based decentralized finance sector. This isn’t just a rumor; it’s a confirmed strategic move that has caught the attention of both traditional finance and crypto enthusiasts alike. Why is Forward Industries Investing in the Solana DeFi Ecosystem? The news initially surfaced through a report by The Block, later solidified by Forward Industries’ CEO, Kyle Samani. The confirmation came in a direct reply to a post on X from Ansem, a prominent anonymous crypto analyst with nearly half a million followers. Ansem had provocatively suggested that an investment from a firm like Forward Industries would provide a much-needed boost to Solana’s DeFi sector, which he noted was lagging behind Ethereum’s. Samani, who is also the founder of the influential crypto investment firm Multicoin Capital, didn’t mince words. He stated unequivocally that this is precisely what the company plans to do. This endorsement from a figure deeply entrenched in both traditional and crypto finance adds significant weight to the announcement, highlighting a strategic alignment that could redefine perceptions of the Solana DeFi ecosystem . What Does This Mean for Solana DeFi? This investment is more than just capital injection; it’s a powerful vote of confidence from a publicly traded company. Here’s why it’s a big deal: Increased Legitimacy: A Nasdaq-listed company entering the space can attract other institutional investors, lending further credibility to the Solana DeFi ecosystem . Capital Inflow: New capital can fuel innovation, development, and expansion of existing DeFi protocols on Solana. Bridging TradFi and Crypto: It serves as a bridge, potentially encouraging more traditional financial entities to explore the benefits and opportunities within decentralized finance. Addressing Perceived Weaknesses: As Ansem pointed out, Solana’s DeFi has room to grow compared to Ethereum. This investment could be the catalyst needed to accelerate that growth. The move by Forward Industries underscores a growing trend of traditional businesses recognizing the disruptive potential of blockchain technology and decentralized finance. It’s a clear signal that the digital asset space is maturing and attracting serious players. Forward Industries’ Strategic Financial Backing It’s important to note that this isn’t Forward Industries’ first foray into significant capital raises. On September 8, the company successfully raised an impressive $1.65 billion in a private investment round. This round was led by a consortium of heavyweight firms, including Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital. The involvement of such prominent names, particularly Multicoin Capital with Kyle Samani at its helm, paints a picture of a well-orchestrated strategy to tap into high-growth areas within the crypto landscape. This prior fundraising provides Forward Industries with the financial muscle to execute its ambitious plans within the Solana DeFi ecosystem . The alignment of these major players suggests a shared vision for Solana’s potential, focusing on its speed, scalability, and lower transaction costs compared to some of its competitors. What’s Next for the Solana DeFi Ecosystem? The coming months will be crucial for observing the impact of this investment. We can anticipate several potential developments: Innovation Surge: Increased funding could lead to new protocols, dApps, and services launching on Solana. Enhanced User Experience: More capital might be directed towards improving user interfaces and overall accessibility within the ecosystem. Increased Liquidity: Greater institutional involvement often translates to deeper liquidity pools, benefiting all users of Solana DeFi. Market Competition: This could intensify competition among various blockchain ecosystems, pushing all players to innovate further. Ultimately, Forward Industries’ strategic pivot is a significant moment for Solana. It highlights the growing confidence in Solana’s underlying technology and its capacity to host a robust and scalable decentralized finance future. This investment could indeed be the catalyst that propels the Solana DeFi ecosystem into a new era of growth and adoption.

Key Takeaways: Jimmy Song argues Taproot introduced a social attack surface that enabled spam-like activity via Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens. He claims Taproot failed to deliver on privacy and usability promises, particularly in multi-signature setups. The divide over Bitcoin’s purpose deepens, as developers debate whether to support or limit nonfinancial transactions on the network. In a video posted on X , Song said developers underestimated the unintended consequences of enabling nonfinancial transactions at scale. “What they ignore is that Taproot had significant trolling value as the upgrade that Bitcoiners were placing their hopes in,” Song said. “The increase in the social attack surface of this upgrade wasn’t accounted for at all.” Taproot Aimed to Boost Bitcoin Privacy and Efficiency with Schnorr Signatures Taproot, activated in November 2021, was introduced to improve Bitcoin’s privacy, efficiency, and scripting capabilities through Schnorr signatures and Script Path Spend. However, Song argues the upgrade failed to deliver on its core promises. He pointed to poor user experience with multi-signature implementations, noting that Taproot made the process even more complex compared to traditional multisig. “Bad user experience basically made it a non-starter,” he added. Song’s comments reflect a broader ideological rift in the Bitcoin community. On one side are figures like Adam Back, Dennis Porter, and Luke Dashjr, who support Bitcoin’s role strictly as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. On the other hand are proponents of Ordinals and Runes, like pseudonymous developer Leonidas, who argue that all valid transactions, financial or otherwise, should be welcomed. That divide intensified earlier this year when Bitcoin Core developers voted to remove the 80-byte limit on OP_RETURN, opening the door for larger non-financial payloads like images, videos, and audio. While some saw this as progress, others feared a reversal. The uncertainty has led to an exodus to Bitcoin Knots, a competing implementation. Knots nodes now make up nearly 28% of the network, up from just 67 nodes in March. #vlog 27 Was Taproot A Wise Decision? pic.twitter.com/sUjtf8JA2z — Jimmy Song (송재준) (@jimmysong) September 13, 2025 Despite his criticism, Song hasn’t completely written off Taproot. “It can, of course, redeem itself,” he said, citing future applications like BitVM and Ark as possible ways to justify the upgrade’s cost. Meanwhile, Leonidas claims that Ordinals and Runes have contributed over $500 million in transaction fees, bolstering Bitcoin’s long-term security as the block subsidy diminishes. Still, Dune Analytics data shows fee revenues are inconsistent, ranging from just $3,000 to $537,000 per day in 2025, a far cry from the nearly $10 million peak seen in December 2023. Dev Threatens Bitcoin Core Fork Over v30 Upgrade and Ordinals Censorship Leonidas, a leading figure in the Ordinals ecosystem, has warned he will fund a Bitcoin Core fork if developers attempt to censor Ordinals or Runes transactions in the upcoming v30 upgrade. The open letter, backed by miners controlling over 50% of the network’s hash rate, signals a deepening divide over Bitcoin’s future utility as the network prepares to expand on-chain data capacity. The v30 upgrade, set for October 2025, will remove the 80-byte OP_RETURN limit and enable up to 4MB of data per transaction, fueling the rise of what critics call “JPEG spam.” Adam Back of Blockstream argues these data-heavy inscriptions are displacing legitimate transactions, while Leonidas counters that Ordinals have contributed over $500 million in fees since 2023. As tensions mount, the alternative Bitcoin Knots implementation, opposed to v30’s data policy changes, has grown to control 18% of the network.

The company purchased the digital assets from Binance, Coinbase, and Bybit across 13 transactions during the last 24 hours. The global leader in digital assets and data center infrastructure has recently acquired batches of Solana from exchanges. On Sunday, on-chain data showed that the company purchased around 6.5 million SOL in the past five days, worth $1.57 billion. At the same time, Arkham Intelligence showed that Galaxy moved millions of SOL to other addresses, mainly to custody wallets on Fireblocks. Galaxy provides capital investment to Forward Industries Last week, Galaxy Digital partnered with Jump Crypto and Multicoin Capital to launch a Solana-centered digital asset treasury strategy. The trio agreed to provide capital worth $1.65 billion in cash and stablecoin for a private investment in public equity offering to Forward Industries. The initiative aims to position Forward Industries as the Solana ecosystem’s leading publicly traded institutional participant. Forward Industry also aims to generate differentiated on-chain returns and build long-term shareholder value through active participation in the Solana ecosystem. “Solana has emerged as one of the most innovative and widely adopted blockchain ecosystems in the world.” – Michael Pruitt , CEO of Forward Industries. Galaxy’s CEO, Mike Novogratz, also said last week that the crypto market is entering the season of Solana. He acknowledged the recent $1.65 billion fundraise for FORD, saying that treasury companies focused on altcoins are bringing new energy and money into the space. Novogratz also noted a shifting regulatory backdrop as the U.S. SEC Chair Paul Atkins revealed efforts to modernize crypto rules and regulations. Atkins said the agency is working to modernize the securities rules and regulations to enable markets to move on-chain. Novogratz called the initiative a radical departure from prior regulations and a sign that institutional adoption is accelerating. Atkins also mentioned that entrepreneurs and investors should be able to raise capital on-chain without endless legal uncertainty. The SEC chair maintained that most crypto tokens are not securities and fall outside the agency’s remit. Galaxy’s CEO acknowledged Atkin’s comments, saying they are pushing things in the right direction. He also believes blockchains are now fast, safe, secure, and trusted, and they are ready for Wall Street adoption once regulatory frameworks are in place. Novogratz pointed out that Solana’s speed and high transaction capacity make it a tailor-made blockchain suited for financial markets. The tech executive also said digital assets represent healthy competition in rebuilding global financial infrastructure. Novogratz sees more capital flowing into Solana Novogratz is confident that capital will move into the ecosystem as the company starts moving from narrative to execution. Bitwise chief investment officer, Matt Hougan, also pointed to a potential emergence in the Solana season. He anticipates that ETF approvals, subsequent inflows, and corporate treasury purchases will fuel runs similar to Bitcoin and Ether’s. Hougan said several issuers, including Galaxy Digital, have filed for spot Solana ETFs in the U.S. He also said the SEC is expected to decide by October 10 on the SOL funds, which could potentially set up multiple launches in Q4. He also acknowledged this week’s capital pledge to Forward Industries, which mirrors what Michael Saylor has done for Bitcoin and Tom Lee for Ethereum. Due to its speed and low costs, Hougan believes Solana is a programmable blockchain built for stablecoins, tokenized assets, and DeFi. He noted that SOL offers transactions costing less than a cent and finalizes them in milliseconds after a pending upgrade, which is far faster than Ethereum. The tech executive also stated that Solana doesn’t rely on Layer 2s like Ethereum, which offers the digital asset a simpler user experience. He believes that a relatively small amount of flows into Solana could significantly impact prices. At the publication time, Solana is exchanging hands at around $243.15. The digital asset has surged by 17.42% in the past seven days and by more than 30% in the last 30 days.

Mutuum Finance is emerging as the most-touted opportunity for retail traders considering the potential to turn low stakes into massive gains. The venture has raised over $15.8 million from over 16,300 supporters during presale. Aside from Pepe (PEPE), Mutuum Finance stands out as one of the innovators with its new positioning in a crowded market, fueling rumination on whether it would be the next giant breakout story in the crypto economy. PEPE Trades Near $0.000012 as Meme-Token Activity Persists PEPE (PEPE) is trading at $0.00001214. The token has recorded a double-digit 24-hour advance and high volume relative to its recent averages, suggesting short-term buying interest. Because PEPE is a social meme token, the price remains sensitive to social and on-chain sentiment, which creates wild intraday whips within the range of the week. Market watchers are monitoring volume and resistance at the recent weekly highs for follow-through, while new DeFi opportunities such as Mutuum Finance are also receiving attention. Mutuum Finance Presale Speed up Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is performing well in presale phase six, securing tremendous traction as investors’ volumes keep soaring. The project has already hit over 16,300 recorded owners and has reached over $15.8 million in locked-up capital, with recent activities showing that the pace will continue to increase. Such a humongous boost is a clear indicator of growing investors’ confidence as the platform continues to inch closer to going live. Strategic Value for First Movers Not only are investors buying at the presale price exposing themselves to tokens at significantly lower cost, but they are also setting themselves up for astronomical short-term returns of up to 300% on launch day one, and even greater long-term opportunity as the ecosystem continues to expand. Early adopters are crowding towards a project on the basis of extremely future-centric dual lending model, longevity-long-term-conceived stablecoin, fully audited and open-source codebase, and tokenomics to generate scarcity and appreciation. Put them all together, and Mutuum Finance is an extremely well-capable player to revolutionize the next level of DeFi innovation. Bug Bounty Program Securing Security As part of another move towards ensuring security in its ecosystem, Mutuum Finance has partnered with CertiK to launch an official bug bounty program backed by a $50,000 USDT bounty pool. Reward is given at four levels of severity, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, so that all types of vulnerability can be discovered and eliminated. By making itself open to external developer and researcher scrutiny of its platform, Mutuum adopts cutting-edge security controls, further enhancing security and trust to its investing base. Risk Controls Embedded and Market Provisions Mutuum Tiered Loan-to-Value percentages and liquidation points fluctuate depending on the volatility of the underlying collateral. Less volatile assets support higher borrowing, while riskier tokens enjoy more restricted borrowing. The second stability is safeguarded by reserve multipliers, ranging from about 10% for low-volatility instruments to as much as 35% for riskier instruments. The system is extremely well-balanced between access and safety, making further market participation possible and reducing systemic risk. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Pepe (PEPE) rank among the most sought-after names among investors looking for outlier returns. Although PEPE is selling at $0.00001214 and is very community-driven, Mutuum Finance is going heavy with $15.8M in funding and 16,300+ holders already on the offer. Stage 6 presale tokens are currently available for sale at $0.035, with estimates to see up to 300% gains on day one of launch and long-term value many times greater. Backed by a $50K CertiK bug bounty, twin lending protocols, and strong risk management, MUTM is designed for scalability, security, and long-term growth. Lock up your tokens on Stage 6 today before the next price increase.

51753520,580925,1757921439,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51753520.jpeg,Cardano Founder Blasts Ghost Chain Critics: ‘Cavalry Is Coming’,https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-ghost-chain-critics-cavalry-coming/,"Broadcasting “from rough and rugged Wyoming” late on September 14, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson delivered a forceful rebuttal to what he called years of dismissive “ghost chain” narratives, arguing that the industry has “moved the goalposts” away from decentralization and toward VC-favored speed and token economics. “It sucks to go to cryptocurrency Reddit and no matter what you say or do, you’re criticized and demeaned and attacked,” he said, after reading a community post lamenting the “overwhelming negative sentiment outside of our community.” Hoskinson’s message: Cardano will stick to its original brief—resilience, censorship resistance, and self-governance—and the payoff is near. “Keep the faith and don’t give up hope. The cavalry is coming. We are moving exactly as we need to,” he said. Hoskinson Blasts Cardano Critics And ‘VC Chains’ The livestream ’s central theme was a clash of first principles. Hoskinson traced early crypto’s mission to “disintermediation and decentralization,” saying the sector has since rewarded throughput and speculative manias—NFTs, GameFi, memecoins, and now RWAs—over credible neutrality. “The goalpost moved from disintermediation and decentralization to, well, let’s build high-performance systems and we don’t particularly care if those systems are resilient or decentralized,” he argued. In his telling, Cardano’s refusal to compromise on those design goals explains both the network’s slower, research-driven cadence and its perceived under-appreciation in Web3 circles: “We’ve beat that drum and we’ve built protocol after protocol doing things the right way. Not the sexy way, not the VC-friendly way.” Hoskinson framed the project’s past decade as an exercise in building durable primitives: the extended UTXO model for deterministic smart contracts; “liquid non-custodial staking”; the Ouroboros family of protocols; the Hard Fork Combinator for “telescoping” upgrades; end-to-end on-chain governance and treasury; and newer concepts such as isomorphic state channels, a partner-chains paradigm, and “Bitcoin DeFi” to align with what he called a principles-first ecosystem. “Every year, Cardano continues to get more decentralized, more resilient,” he said. “We’re able to take the best of all the ideas in the space, but never once have we compromised on who we are.” On scalability, Hoskinson said Cardano is “on the dawn” of its next phase. He stated that “ Leios is now in a SIP,” describing it as “the last stage before implementation” and “the foundation of a scalability agenda that is endless,” language he linked to a co-evolution with Hydra and advances in zero-knowledge cryptography. Taken together, he said, these efforts aim at “infinite scale just in time to absorb the needs of the economic, political and social systems abroad and at home.” He pointed to Hydra’s maturation—from a “toy” to demonstrations including a “vending machine” and tests he described as “a million transactions a second”—as a key pillar of the network’s L2 posture. The founder set out a go-to-market plan that deliberately looks beyond crypto natives. “Less than 5% of the world is in the cryptocurrency space,” he said. “So why do we particularly care about a minority of a minority when there’s a big wide world out there?” He urged “physicalizing Cardano,” citing Hydra-backed point-of-sale and ATM integrations, and stressed “rational privacy for all” through Midnight . He also cast Cardano as “the best place to launch a new blockchain,” linking that claim to the partner-chains initiative and what he called the “best AVS experience in the space.” Bitcoin remains the critical ally in this strategy, he said: “We have to partner with ecosystems that are principles first like Bitcoin… And we’re doing this with Bitcoin DeFi.” Cavalry Coming? Geographically, Hoskinson highlighted Argentina and Africa. He said Input Output maintains the “largest cryptocurrency office” in Buenos Aires and hosts biweekly events, adding that Cardano “continues to grow throughout Latin America.” In Africa, he said the long-trailed identity push is “almost ready to roll out,” with 2026 targeted to “turn on the ability to bring economic identity to the millions eventually billions who don’t have it.” Throughout, he contrasted these efforts with what he characterized as short-lived hype cycles: “To be truly a visionary, you have to accept that you have to go alone sometimes into the wilderness… And we’ve done that for 10 years.” Governance milestones formed another through-line. Hoskinson declared the project’s “Voltaire” era “mission accomplished,” citing a community-elected constitutional committee, “hundreds of DReps,” a ratified on-chain constitution, and an annual budget. “We’re already talking about the next constitution and an incredible suite of governance tools,” he said, arguing that this collective machinery lets the ecosystem “speak with one voice,” ratify upgrades, and “converge to a budget” without compromising liveness or safety. “We are the only chain in the history of the cryptocurrency industry to do this,” he asserted. The address included rare self-critique. Hoskinson said he wished Cardano had “moved faster in certain areas,” made “slightly different decisions about the ordering of the roadmap,” and staffed partnerships more aggressively. He nonetheless credited the privacy-focused Midnight initiative with “more than a hundred partnerships,” positioning it as a commercial bridge that “will bring hundreds more, if not thousands.” He also revisited longstanding allegations from rival communities, saying he is “still inundated” with claims he “stole $600 million,” and added that a “128-page” forensic audit “gave complete exoneration,” a result he said received little attention from crypto media. “The asymmetries of information sting long, hard, and unfortunately take years or decades to undo,” he said. Hoskinson closed by returning to community morale, urging Cardano’s governance participants to “forget the past and… look to the future,” redirecting energy toward entrepreneurs who can “bring in the countless millions to tens of millions to hundreds of millions of users.” The core bet, he said, is unchanged: that decentralization, credible governance, and research-led engineering will ultimately outlast every hype cycle. “The next 24 to 36 months, Cardano will be in a position where it’s the fastest, most secure, and frankly speaking, best platform… to build anything at scale for anyone,” Hoskinson concluded, adding: “Cardano’s best days are ahead of it. I will always believe that. And that’s because Cardano has the best people.” At press time, ADA traded at $0.89.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|Cardano news|Cardano Price,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FORKS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-15 07:30:39

Even if there has been a lot of uncertainty and low real yield for years, retail traders are still betting on XRP. At the same time, institutions and experienced traders are getting ready for the next wave of decentralized finance, where safety, predictable income, and good token mechanisms will be more important than hype. This is why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming the name that big companies are interested in. Early investors are already being told that they may make 600% to 1,500% on their money. Why giants are watching Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being constructed as a dual lending marketplace. It will have both P2C (peer-to-contract) and P2P (peer-to-peer) models that will let both retail and institutional users lend and borrow money easily. When a user inputs assets, the system will generate mtTokens. These tokens will be a liquid receipt that will increase in value over time and can be staked in smart contracts to earn MUTM incentives. The protocol will also add a mint-and-burn mechanism for stablecoins, which will make the token more valuable as more people borrow it. Safeguards of institutional quality will be very important. There will be limits on how much you may deposit and borrow, which will keep lending pools balanced. There will also be limits on how much collateral you can use, which will stop people from using unstable assets in dangerous schemes. With Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE), users will be able to borrow more money against their deposits. This will make capital more efficient, which will raise the total value locked and, in turn, bring in more protocol revenue. The money will go into buybacks, which will keep the token in demand. The presale is already at Phase 6, with a price of $0.035. It has raised $15.75 million and sold 40% of the 170 million tokens available. The following step will raise the price to $0.04, which means that anyone who comes late will have to pay 15% more. Security is already a big deal, with a CertiK audit showing good results (90/79), a $50,000 bug bounty, and a $100,000 community giveaway to get people to join early. ROI scenarios that traders can measure Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has set up its presale in a way that traders can easily check the math. The expected listing price is $0.06, which sets a baseline for the upside. In a conservative example, purchasers entered at $0.015 in Phase 2. That entry will have given a 300% return on investment by listing on paper. Once institutions lift the token’s value to $0.09, the Phase 2 entrance will turn into a 600% return on investment (ROI), proving that predictable growth would benefit patient users. The aggressive scenario begins at Phase 3 and costs $0.02. The return on investment (ROI) will be 200% if you list at $0.06. The valuation will grow to $0.30, and the ROI will rise to 1,400% as institutional demand, buybacks, and total value locked expansion increase. The numbers are apparent for traders: A person who put $10,000 into Phase 3 at $0.02 got 500,000 MUTM tokens. Those tokens will be worth $30,000 when they go on sale, which is a 200% rise. The value will reach $150,000 at the $0.30 long-term prediction, which means a 1,400% return on investment. These sorts of performance won’t happen because of speculation; they will happen because institutions adopt Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s lending architecture and the steady income cycle that powers buybacks. Mechanics are made to draw in giants. Borrow limitations and limited collateralization make it harder for bad actors to manipulate liquidity pools, which means they won’t be destabilized. Reserve Factor rules and penalties for liquidation give lenders a safety net, which is the kind of assurance that institutions want. Buyback programs paid for by lending fees will keep demand rising, which will help the market price grow correctly without being hurt by too much selling pressure. Traders will also be able to make money straight via staking. For example, if a user locks $25,000 worth of mtTokens into smart contracts, they will get MUTM incentives on top of the interest that borrowers are already earning. At competitive reward rates, this can add up to thousands of dollars a year. Staking will also lower the amount of coins that are available and raise demand on the open market. Final words First and foremost are safety and trust. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is showing that it is ready to grow responsibly by getting good grades from a CertiK audit, offering bug bounties of up to $50,000, and giving away $100,000 to build the community. The strategy is focused on beta launch and exchange listings, which gives traders confidence that liquidity and adoption will follow. The market as a whole has been unstable, and a lot of retail investors are still confused about why crypto is down when more people are using it. Traders who know how the market works and keep an eye on the crypto fear and greed index know that the best time to make money is during presale phases and early re-ratings. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is meant to do well in both bullish and conservative markets because its concept is based on real revenue and institutional flows instead of just speculation. Phase 6 is already 40% sold, and if you wait, you’ll have to pay 15% more at Phase 7. For traders who want both short-term listing gains and the institutional upside that might raise ROI from 600% to 1,500%, this presale is the kind of move that big companies are already undertaking.

Analysts are now pointing to a new AI-powered altcoin, Ruvi AI (RUVI), as a prime candidate. With its presale gaining historic momentum and Phase 3 already nearing the 10% sold mark just days after launching, many are asking if this could be 2025’s fastest-growing altcoin. The excitement is backed by hard numbers that are difficult to ignore. The Ruvi AI presale is rapidly approaching the $3.6 million fundraising milestone, a testament to its powerful market appeal. A fast-growing global community of over 3,500 investors has already purchased more than 265 million RUVI tokens . This intense demand, especially at such an early stage, is a classic sign of a project set for a major breakout. A Modern Utility for Ethereum-Like Growth Ethereum’s initial explosion was driven by its revolutionary smart contract technology. Ruvi AI is built on a similar principle of game-changing utility, but it’s targeted at one of the most dynamic markets today: the $104 billion creator economy . This focus on a tangible, real-world application is what separates Ruvi AI from purely speculative projects and gives it a credible path to Ethereum-like growth. The project’s credibility is further enhanced by its commitment to security and transparency. Ruvi AI has successfully completed a comprehensive smart contract audit with CyberScope , assuring investors of the platform’s integrity. This crucial step, combined with a high-profile listing on CoinMarketCap , has established Ruvi AI as a legitimate, high-growth project attracting serious capital. The Super App Fueling the Forecast The engine behind the forecast of Ruvi AI becoming 2025’s fastest-growing altcoin is its revolutionary super app. This all-in-one ecosystem is engineered to become an essential tool for content creators, creating sustained, long-term demand for the RUVI token. Key features include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they become saturated, giving creators a crucial competitive edge. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, streamlining content production. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative process for maximum efficiency. Final Opportunity: A Guaranteed 40% Price Surge is Imminent The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token available at the highly attractive price of $0.020 . However, with the presale selling out at an astonishing rate, this ground-floor opportunity is vanishing quickly. According to the project’s official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to lock in a guaranteed paper gain. Strategic Partnership and High-Reward VIP Tiers Ruvi AI’s journey is further amplified by a strategic partnership with WEEX , a major cryptocurrency exchange. This collaboration will ensure deep liquidity and a seamless trading experience upon launch, paving the way for rapid price discovery and broad market adoption. For investors looking to position themselves for potentially life-changing returns, the project’s VIP program offers a clear path: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A competitive leaderboard giveaway also rewards top supporters, fostering a vibrant and engaged community that adds to the project’s unstoppable momentum. Is This the Next Ethereum? As the presale accelerates and a 40% price increase looms, the parallels to the early days of revolutionary projects are becoming clear. For investors seeking to get in on the ground floor of what could be 2025’s fastest-growing altcoin, all signs are pointing to Ruvi AI.

This plan, according to Financial Times, would make the UK the only major jurisdiction trying to lock users out of full access to stablecoins, at a time when both the US and EU are expanding regulatory clarity without placing hard limits. The move, if enforced, would set the UK apart in a way that critics say looks paranoid and counterproductive. Officials inside the BoE argue that caps are necessary to keep Britain’s banking system stable as crypto expands. They say too much money flowing into stablecoins could drain bank deposits, cut off credit, and cause a ripple effect across lending markets. Sasha Mills, who heads financial market infrastructure at the bank, said the idea is to prevent “large and rapid outflows of deposits” and limit the impact of new payment systems while they scale. But she also called the measure “transitional,” suggesting it might not be permanent, though there’s no actual timeline or plan to phase it out. Coinbase says caps are bad for savers and the City Tom Duff Gordon, Coinbase’s policy chief outside the US, said , “Imposing caps on stablecoins is bad for UK savers, bad for the City and bad for sterling.” He pointed out that no other major country, not even under Donald Trump’s renewed presidency, has tried anything like this. And it’s not just about ideology; crypto payments are already global, and Tom made it clear that these limits would slam the UK into a corner while the rest of the world moves on. Simon Jennings, who leads the UK Cryptoasset Business Council, added that enforcing the BoE’s idea would be a technical nightmare. “Limits simply don’t work in practice,” Simon said. “Stablecoin issuers don’t have sight of who holds their tokens at any given time, so enforcing caps would require a costly, complex new system, such as digital IDs or constant co-ordination between wallets.” He said it would be like trying to track who owns physical cash, and spending millions doing it. Riccardo Tordera-Ricchi, head of policy at The Payments Association, also rejected the proposal outright. “Just as there are no limits on cash, bank accounts, or e-money, there is no reason beyond scepticism to impose limits on stablecoin ownership,” Riccardo said. “This is a step in the wrong direction.” He said the plan would cause more harm than good, especially as stablecoins are already being used for fast, low-cost payments globally. UK Treasury pushes innovation, BoE resists The debate is triggering fresh tension between the BoE and the UK Treasury. Rachel Reeves, the UK’s new chancellor, wants to support the crypto industry and grow financial innovation. She said in her Mansion House speech that she would “drive forward developments in blockchain technology, including tokenised securities and stablecoins.” But Andrew Bailey, the BoE governor, blocked her from meeting regulators to push for a banking licence for Revolut, the country’s biggest fintech still waiting for approval. The BoE still plans to publish a formal consultation later this year to update its regulatory framework for stablecoins. But crypto groups say even calling for a cap already sends the wrong signal. It tells the global market that the UK sees crypto more as a threat than an opportunity. Meanwhile, the global stablecoin market has grown to $288 billion and counting. Most of that is US-dollar based. In July, the US Congress passed the Genius Act to regulate stablecoins and integrate them into the official financial system. Coinbase projects that market could reach $1.2 trillion by 2028. Gilles Chemla, professor at Imperial Business School and co-director of its financial tech research center, said stablecoins aren’t some early-stage tech anymore. “Stablecoins are no longer experimental technologies, they are becoming the foundation of the global digital economy.” Gilles warned that the UK is losing its advantage. “London has the talent, the markets, and the history to lead the digital economy, but the delay in implementing a regulatory framework for stablecoins is eroding that advantage.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",News|BOE|Coinbase|GPB,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-15 07:42:47

If traders continue buying tokens, the BNB price might see a further jump, and the next target could be above its ATH of $943.08. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $6,654.04 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data.

Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $1000 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2027, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $6,654.04 by 2031. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. Heading into September, BNB is trading at approximately $854.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-15 07:48:00

Avalanche (AVAX) just smashed through its $26 resistance level, surging to $30.44 and hitting seven-month highs that have analysts scrambling to update their price targets. But here’s what’s really interesting about this market cycle: While everyone celebrates AVAX’s 325% potential upside to $126 and Portal to Bitcoin’s revolutionary cross-chain capabilities keep gaining institutional attention, the smartest money is quietly positioning in something completely different. KIKICat sits at $0.0008 with a story that makes every other opportunity look ordinary by comparison. KIKI is built on 14 billion Giphy views and AI-powered content generation that creates engagement cycles most projects can only dream about. While others depend on external catalysts and celebrity endorsements, KIKI’s AI agents work around the clock building community and creating content autonomously. AVAX’s Technical Picture Couldn’t Be More Bullish The charts are screaming right now. Avalanche’s breakout above $26.50 resistance has triggered what technical analysts call a “continuation pattern,” the kind of setup that historically leads to explosive moves higher. Javon Marks is calling for $126.03, while other prominent traders see $34.50 as the immediate target before things get really interesting. The fundamentals are backing up the technicals perfectly. Avalanche processed 35.8 million C-Chain transactions in August alone, setting new records that prove this isn’t just speculation driving the price. $2.02 billion in Total Value Locked and $569.6 million in daily DEX volume show real economic activity happening on the network. Even better, regulatory clarity is accelerating adoption. $GUN became the first gaming token to receive EU MiCAR approval, proving that Avalanche can deliver both innovation and compliance. This opens doors to massive European markets that have been waiting for regulatory certainty before deploying serious capital. But here’s the mathematical reality that smart traders understand. AVAX needs to climb from $30 to $126 for that 325% gain. That requires billions in new institutional capital flowing into an already established ecosystem. Compare that to opportunities trading under $1M market cap where the same capital inflows create exponentially larger percentage returns. Portal to Bitcoin and SPX6900 Capture Different Audiences Portal to Bitcoin deserves serious respect for solving real problems in the cross-chain space. PTB’s mainnet launch on September 3rd enabled trust-minimized Bitcoin swaps across multiple Layer-2 networks, addressing the $1.3 billion Bitcoin DeFi market that’s been waiting for reliable infrastructure. Major exchanges like Binance and Kraken adding PTB support shows institutional confidence in the technology. SPX6900 is riding a completely different wave of momentum. Reddit communities are calling it “the meme coin with soul” because it distinguishes itself from typical pump-and-dump projects. Three consecutive days of trending on social media demonstrates the kind of organic community growth that creates lasting value rather than temporary hype. But neither project offers the unique combination of factors that creates life-changing wealth opportunities. PTB faces established DeFi competitors with deeper liquidity and longer track records. SPX6900 competes in an increasingly crowded meme coin space where differentiation becomes harder every day. KIKICat Represents Something Entirely Different KIKICat operates in a completely different paradigm that most traders haven’t fully grasped yet. Current price: $0.0007 with $800k market cap means you’re not competing with institutional whales or algorithmic trading systems. You’re getting ground-floor access to what could be the first truly successful AI-native meme coin before the concept becomes mainstream. The 14 billion Giphy view foundation isn’t just impressive numbers. It represents instant global brand recognition that most startups spend millions in marketing trying to achieve. Every smartphone user has encountered KIKI content without realizing they’re looking at the intellectual property backing a tradeable cryptocurrency. Here’s what makes KIKI genuinely revolutionary. Traditional meme coins require constant community management and external catalyst events to maintain engagement. KIKI’s AI agents process real-time community inputs to generate personalized content, evolving narratives, and collaborative experiences that keep users actively participating rather than passively holding. The timing convergence is perfect. AI content generation is becoming consumer expectation rather than novel feature. Community takeover narratives are accelerating across social platforms. Sub-$1M market caps with billion-view brand foundations represent maximum leverage opportunities before mainstream discovery. The window is closing faster than most realize. Missing this positioning phase means watching others capture the generational wealth as meme coin culture integrates with the ongoing AI narrative.

He pointed to the emergence of a strong parabolic curvature on the chart, which he described as an unprecedented structure with potentially historic implications for XRP. His chart highlighted the role of the nine-period exponential moving average and long-term trendlines that have supported the asset’s rise. In his assessment, Egrag stated that a close above $3.70 with a full-bodied candle on the two-month chart could serve as a decisive signal, indicating the beginning of a major upward phase for XRP. He also identified the $2.00 price level as a key benchmark. If the asset dips below that figure, he noted that it could resemble earlier phases of growth seen in other markets, comparing it to the time when Bitcoin was trading at $200. He suggested that those who accumulate at $2.00 could eventually be recognized as early adopters in a future valuation context. The chart he shared further included ranges labeled conservative, average, and optimistic, which outlined potential outcomes depending on how price action develops. These long-term targets were linked to the structural signals he sees in the market, with consecutive higher candles and a steep price curve reinforcing his thesis of a strong advance if the conditions he outlined are met. #XRP – Even The Most #Bullish #Bullls Are Not #Bullish Enough: Historical Patterns The two-month time frame chart shows five distinct body candles at new all-time highs (ATH).

He reiterated that his focus remains on a macro strategy, which he summarized as buying at low prices and selling at higher valuations. For those who are active traders, he suggested that it may be reasonable to allocate a smaller portion of holdings, such as 10 to 20 percent, for shorter-term trades. However, he emphasized that his own outlook centers on longer-term positioning rather than frequent trading. Egrag made clear that the price close above $3.70 is the condition he views as necessary for a significant new phase in XRP’s market performance . At the same time, he acknowledged the importance of the $2.00 level, presenting it as a threshold where risk and opportunity intersect.

Personal conviction and message to holders In his remarks, Egrag also reflected on his prior calls when XRP was trading under $1. He recalled that during that period, he consistently encouraged accumulation, despite facing criticism and dismissive responses from others in the market. He stated that his persistence comes from a determination to see his strategy through, regardless of the reactions of others. He concluded by addressing the XRP community directly, underscoring that trading success requires resilience and discipline. He encouraged holders to remain steady and committed to their strategies, while wishing them success in navigating the market. His overall message combined technical milestones, a clear long-term trading approach, and a personal account of persistence intended to reinforce confidence in his analysis.

Thị trường đang tràn đầy sự quan tâm khi nhiều tài sản kỹ thuật số cho thấy khả năng tăng trưởng đột phá. Các nhà đầu tư tập trung vào những token có tiềm năng mang lại lợi nhuận vượt trội, đặc biệt là những đồng coin đang được dự đoán sẽ có bước tiến mạnh mẽ. Nhiều người tin rằng đây có thể là cơ hội vàng tiếp theo trong thế giới crypto. Trong số những token đầy hứa hẹn này có Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), SEI, APT, XRP – một meme coin tiên phong kết nối người hâm mộ bóng đá, bóng rổ, MMA và nhiều môn thể thao khác trong một hệ sinh thái sôi động. Phân tích dưới đây cung cấp cái nhìn sâu hơn về những dự án này và lý giải vì sao chúng có thể tăng trưởng tới 5.000% trong những tháng tới. Bitcoin Hyper: Đưa Bitcoin lên tầm cao mới Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) không chỉ là một meme coin khác – đây là giải pháp Layer 2 mở rộng cho mạng Bitcoin được xây dựng trên Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Với tốc độ giao dịch cực nhanh, phí thấp và khả năng tương tác mạnh mẽ, HYPER hướng tới việc khai phá toàn bộ tiềm năng của Bitcoin như một blockchain hiệu suất cao. Dự án đã thu hút được sự quan tâm lớn ngay từ giai đoạn presale , huy động hàng triệu USD trong thời gian ngắn. Các nhà phân tích dự đoán vị thế độc đáo của HYPER – kết hợp sự bảo mật của Bitcoin với tốc độ của Solana – có thể giúp đồng coin này đạt mức tăng trưởng bùng nổ. Với kỳ vọng lợi nhuận lên tới 5.000% trong chu kỳ sắp tới, Bitcoin Hyper nổi bật như một trong những token đầy tham vọng và đổi mới nhất năm 2025. Làm chủ blockchain, mở rộng Bitcoin chưa từng có Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) đang nổi lên như một trong những dự án sáng tạo nhất trong thị trường crypto – một giải pháp Layer 2 mạnh mẽ kết hợp sự bảo mật của Bitcoin với tốc độ của Solana. Thay vì chỉ chạy theo xu hướng, HYPER mang đến giá trị thực: giao dịch siêu nhanh, phí thấp và khả năng tương tác liền mạch. Hãy nhớ lại cách Ethereum phát triển mạnh mẽ nhờ các Layer 2 rollup – Bitcoin Hyper đặt mục tiêu làm điều tương tự cho Bitcoin, nhưng với hiệu suất SVM có thể xử lý hàng nghìn giao dịch mỗi giây. Với tiềm năng hàng tỷ USD khối lượng giao dịch chảy qua hệ sinh thái Bitcoin, HYPER có cơ hội nắm bắt giá trị khổng lồ. Hiện tại, HYPER vẫn đang bị định giá thấp và ở giai đoạn presale, mang lại cho các nhà đầu tư sớm cơ hội hiếm có để tham gia trước khi được niêm yết trên các sàn lớn. Các nhà phân tích tin rằng khi mức độ chấp nhận tăng, những người mua trong presale có thể đạt được lợi nhuận thay đổi cuộc đời trong đợt bull run sắp tới. PEPE (PEPE) PEPE là một memecoin giảm phát đã trở thành hiện tượng toàn cầu trong thế giới tiền điện tử. Được ra mắt trên mạng Ethereum như một lời tri ân đến meme Pepe the Frog của Matt Furie, PEPE khai thác sự hài hước và tính lan truyền của văn hóa internet. Với chính sách không thuế và mô hình đơn giản, PEPE nhanh chóng thu hút sự chú ý của cả những người yêu thích meme và các nhà giao dịch. Vào tháng 4 và tháng 5 năm 2023, vốn hóa thị trường của PEPE đã bùng nổ lên 1,6 tỷ USD, biến nhiều nhà đầu tư ban đầu thành triệu phú. Sự tăng trưởng này đã khởi động một “mùa memecoin”, khi thị trường tràn ngập các loại tiền điện tử mới dựa trên meme tìm cách tận dụng làn sóng này. PEPE hiện đặt mục tiêu gia nhập hàng ngũ những đồng memecoin hàng đầu như Dogecoin và Shiba Inu. Lộ trình của nó bao gồm niêm yết trên các sàn giao dịch lớn và chiến dịch “meme takeover” táo bạo nhằm củng cố vị trí trong lịch sử crypto. Dù không có tính ứng dụng truyền thống, sức mạnh của PEPE nằm ở cộng đồng và khả năng lan truyền. Với kỳ vọng bull run sắp tới sau đợt halving của Bitcoin, PEPE vẫn là một lựa chọn hấp dẫn cho những ai chấp nhận rủi ro cao để tìm kiếm lợi nhuận lớn. Sei (SEI) Trong môi trường blockchain năng động, Sei nổi bật như một nhà đổi mới. Đây là blockchain Layer 1 đầu tiên được phát triển dành riêng cho giao dịch, mang lại lợi thế vượt trội cho các sàn giao dịch. Sei có khả năng xử lý khối lượng lệnh khổng lồ mỗi giây, với thời gian hoàn tất giao dịch chỉ 380 mili giây – gần như tức thì. Được hậu thuẫn bởi các tổ chức lớn và tập trung mạnh mẽ vào bảo mật, Sei mang đến sự kết hợp hoàn hảo giữa tốc độ và độ tin cậy. Trên thị trường hiện tại, tiềm năng tăng trưởng của Sei đang ngày càng thu hút sự chú ý. Theo ước tính, giá của nó có thể tăng tới 323,76% vào năm 2030. Không giống như nhiều blockchain nhắm tới ứng dụng chung, Sei được thiết kế đặc biệt để phục vụ nhu cầu giao dịch. Với sự phát triển của DeFi và nhu cầu ngày càng tăng đối với các giao dịch nhanh chóng, an toàn, công nghệ của Sei có thể biến nó thành một trong những lựa chọn nổi bật trong giai đoạn tiếp theo của thị trường crypto. Aptos (APT) Aptos, thường được gọi là “Solana Killer”, đã xuất hiện như một đối thủ mới trên sân khấu blockchain. Sứ mệnh của nó là cung cấp một blockchain nhanh hơn, rẻ hơn và đáng tin cậy hơn, giải quyết các vấn đề về phí giao dịch cao và tắc nghẽn mạng mà Ethereum và các dự án khác từng gặp phải. Đứng sau Aptos là Aptos Labs, được thành lập bởi những thành viên cũ của dự án Diem của Meta. Blockchain này sử dụng cơ chế proof-of-stake và giới thiệu ngôn ngữ lập trình mới mang tên Move, được thiết kế linh hoạt và an toàn cho việc phát triển hợp đồng thông minh và ứng dụng Web3. Điều khiến Aptos nổi bật trong thị trường crypto đông đúc là sự tập trung vào khả năng mở rộng và tốc độ. Chính những yếu tố này có thể giúp nó vượt qua Solana và Ethereum. Trong chu kỳ thị trường hiện tại, nơi đổi mới là chìa khóa thành công, Aptos mang đến một khởi đầu mới đầy hứa hẹn. Tuy nhiên, giống như bất kỳ đồng coin mới nào, hiệu suất dài hạn vẫn là yếu tố mà nhà đầu tư cần theo dõi chặt chẽ. XRP (XRP) XRP là một loại tiền kỹ thuật số được thiết kế để giúp thanh toán toàn cầu trở nên nhanh chóng và tiết kiệm hơn. Nó vận hành trên XRP Ledger – một hệ thống phi tập trung không có cơ quan trung ương, đảm bảo các giao dịch an toàn, không thể đảo ngược và không cần tài khoản ngân hàng. XRP được tạo ra bởi Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto và David Schwartz, với nguồn cung ban đầu 100 tỷ token, trong đó 80 tỷ được tặng cho Ripple để mở rộng mạng lưới. Ripple sử dụng XRP để tăng tính thanh khoản và quản lý việc phát hành thông qua cơ chế ký quỹ (escrow). Ngày nay, XRP có lợi thế rõ rệt so với Bitcoin và Ethereum nhờ tốc độ và chi phí giao dịch thấp. Sự tập trung vào thanh toán xuyên biên giới khiến nó trở thành lựa chọn hấp dẫn cho các giao dịch quốc tế. Với nhu cầu ngày càng tăng đối với các giải pháp thanh toán nhanh chóng và tiết kiệm, XRP có vị trí đặc biệt trong ngành crypto, mặc dù các yếu tố pháp lý sẽ có ảnh hưởng lớn đến tương lai của nó. Kết luận Trong khi Bitcoin vẫn đang tìm cách chinh phục mốc quan trọng 70.000 USD, PEPE, Sei, Aptos và XRP thu hút sự chú ý của các nhà đầu tư nhờ các giải pháp hiệu quả và cộng đồng mạnh mẽ. XYZVerse (XYZ) nổi bật như một memecoin đầy tham vọng với tiềm năng tăng trưởng bùng nổ, mang đến một hệ sinh thái thể thao – meme chưa từng có. Ngoài ra, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) xứng đáng có một vị trí đặc biệt trong phân tích – như một giải pháp Layer 2 kết hợp sự bảo mật của Bitcoin với tốc độ của Solana. Nhờ ứng dụng công nghệ Solana Virtual Machine tiên tiến, HYPER mang lại giao dịch nhanh, chi phí thấp và được định vị như một dự án có tiềm năng to lớn. Kết hợp với sự quan tâm ngày càng tăng trong giai đoạn presale và kỳ vọng niêm yết trên các sàn lớn, Bitcoin Hyper có thể trở thành một trong những người chiến thắng quan trọng nhất trong đợt bull run sắp tới.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|PEPE|XRP|APT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-15 07:56:14

This currency, originally created for entertainment, has now become the cornerstone of financial freedom for many. A Dogecoin ETF will be another significant breakthrough for crypto assets in traditional financial markets, following the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. GoldenMining , the best Dogecoin mining website for 2025, has launched an advanced AI-powered cloud mining system, providing users with a seamless way to earn daily cryptocurrency returns without owning hardware or managing technical infrastructure. This article will explore how to earn $15,000 per day using Dogecoin cloud mining. What is Dogecoin cloud mining? Dogecoin cloud mining refers to the process by which cloud mining providers earn new Dogecoin rewards by reviewing transactions on the Dogecoin blockchain. While seemingly simple, it’s actually quite complex! Cloud mining providers process the same batch of transactions simultaneously across multiple computers, but only one computer receives the new token reward. The way to obtain new tokens is that nodes add new transaction blocks to old blocks. This is achieved through complex mathematical equations. The node that solves the math problem first wins! It can then append its newly confirmed block of transactions to the rest of the blockchain. Most crypto mining works this way. However, Dogecoin mining differs from other currencies in some important ways. These include: Algorithm: Each crypto has a set of rules for mining new coins. These rules are called a mining algorithm or hashing algorithm. Block time: This is the average time it takes to check a new block of transactions and add it to the blockchain. Difficulty: This number indicates how difficult it is to mine each new block for that currency. Mining difficulty fluctuates based on the number of miners. The currency’s protocol also adjusts the difficulty to ensure that block time remains constant. Reward: This is the reward a miner receives for each new block they mine. How to Cloud Mine Dogecoin Step 1: Select a cloud mining service provider, GoldenMining . In rare cases, the platform has a professional analyst and IT team who analyze the hashrate generated by miners and replace them with the latest mining machines, ensuring higher returns from cloud mining. If you’re worried about missing out on investment opportunities, now is the perfect time to join cloud mining. Step 2: Choose a contract to purchase using Dogecoin or another cryptocurrency. New contracts are as follows: $100 Investment – 2 Days – Daily Profit $4 – Total Profit: $100 + $8 (Daily Sign-in Rewards) $1,500 Investment – 12 Days – Daily Profit $20.25 – Total Profit: $1,500 + $243 (AntminerL916G) $6,000 Investment – 30 Days – Daily Profit $87 – Total Profit: $6,000 + $2,610 (Elphapex DG Hydro1) $9,000 Investment – 30 Days – Daily Profit $139.5 – Total Profit: $9,000 + $4,185 (Elphapex DG2) $12,500 Investment – 38 Days – Daily Profit $212.5 – Total Profit: $12,500 + $8,075 (Elphapex DG2+) Investment: $33,000 – Duration: 43 days – Daily profit: $594 – Total profit: $33,000 + $25,542 (ANTSPACE MD5) $500,000 Investment – 50 Days – Daily Profit$15,000 – Total Profit:$500,000+$750,000 (Elphapex DG1+) (For more new contracts, please visit the GoldenMining platform official website: GoldenMining.cc ) After purchasing a contract, you’ll receive your earnings the next day.

51754370,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=821576,1757923257,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/51754370.jpeg,December 2024 Crypto Crash Signal Returns As Altcoins Go Wild,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/december-2024-crypto-crash-signal-returns/,"Crypto analyst Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) warned on September 14 that a familiar—and historically unfriendly—market pattern has reappeared: speculative leverage pouring into altcoins while Bitcoin’s derivatives positioning stays conspicuously muted. “History doesn’t repeat, but it often rhymes, and right now a major warning signal is flashing,” he said, stressing that his message is not to incite panic but to flag a shift in market climate that “any smart investor” should not ignore. At the core of Maartunn’s diagnosis is open interest, the notional value of active futures and perpetual positions across venues. “We keep throwing around this term, open interest. What is it? Well, to put it simply, it’s a way to measure the total amount of money and active bets in the market. When open interest rises, it means new money, often speculative money, is coming in,” he explained. Crypto’s ‘Musical Chairs’ Moment In his read, altcoin open interest is “through the roof,” while Bitcoin—“the anchor of the whole market”—is flat. The divergence, he argued, is precisely what preceded the late-2024 drawdown. “Altcoin speculation is heating up — the gap between BTC and Altcoin Open Interest just hit a new high,” Maartuun wrote via X. Maartunn anchored his warning in a recent analogue. “Back in December of 2024, the exact same story played out. Altcoin speculation was running wild, while Bitcoin was just stagnating. And the result? It wasn’t pretty.” The immediate aftermath, he recalled, was a sharp, broad-based markdown and then a tedious consolidation. Related Reading: Crypto Faces Liquidity Endgame—Debt And Inflation Risks Mount By 2026 “We’re talking [about] a 30% drop,” he said of Bitcoin’s move, adding that such declines “don’t happen in a vacuum.” Liquidity retreats to safety, correlations rise, and “those high-flying, speculative altcoins… get hit the hardest.” What followed was “three whole months” of rangebound “chop modus,” a period that historically bleeds momentum strategies and punishes late-cycle leverage. To illustrate how leverage-heavy phases can abruptly unravel, he leaned on a metaphor. “It’s a high-stakes game of musical chairs,” he said. As long as flows are positive, “the party’s in full swing, and everyone feels like a genius.” The structural risk emerges at the moment “the music stops”—an adverse headline, an exogenous macro shock, or simply fatigued bid depth. “Everyone makes a mad dash for a chair, for safety. But in a panic, there just aren’t enough chairs for everybody, and someone always gets left holding the bag.” In crypto’s derivatives-driven microstructure, that dash translates into forceful de-risking and liquidations that can cascade across thin order books. Related Reading: Kraken Co-CEO And Barry Silbert Warn Of Crypto Bubble; 99% Tokens Could Tank Crucially, Maartunn framed his assessment as situational risk—not a deterministic crash call. “This isn’t about predicting a crash or trying to cause a panic, not at all,” he said at the outset. The point, rather, is to recognize that the “growing split in the market” between exuberant altcoin leverage and a subdued Bitcoin base “can’t last forever.” “The level of risk in the market has clearly gone up,” he concluded. “The music is absolutely still playing, but it’s probably a good time to know where the emergency exits are.” The open question is the one he leaves viewers with: whether this is merely “the market… enjoying the music before another painful dip,” as in December 2024, or whether “this time really [is] different.” In either case, Maartunn’s thesis hinges on the same observable setup: a momentum-chasing build-up of altcoin derivatives exposure with no confirming expansion in Bitcoin’s positioning. If the past is a guide, the divergence is less a timing tool than a warning label on the current phase of the cycle—one that tends to end not when everyone expects it, but when liquidity blinks. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood $4.0 trillion.

After the token rallied, the whale started distributing tokens to other exchanges. Ahead of the weekend, a whale made one of the biggest consolidation purchases of PEPE through Kraken. The whale withdrew and stored 1.52T PEPE, sparking speculation of another price cycle and even an all-time peak for the meme. The whale wallet was later identified as Auros Global , following the initial speculations about institutional involvement. The whale injected $16M into the PEPE market, potentially reviving the coin just as the altcoin market was entering its hottest phase. Auros Global built one of the significant PEPE wallets, and started distributing tokens to multiple exchanges, also sending funds to Swiss Borg. | Source: Bubblemaps . Based on Bubblemaps data, Auros Global holds 0.78% of the PEPE supply, and is ranked 19th among top wallets. The Auros wallet also sent PEPE to the Swiss Borg hot wallet, despite the exchange suffering an exploit in the past week. Currently, PEPE is not showing any high-velocity trading, and the Auros wallet is not part of a cluster. PEPE whale buyer starts moving coins On Monday, the whale buyer started moving coins, some of them deposited back to Kraken. Deposits were made to Binance as well, and some of the coins were sent to intermediary addresses. Auros Global is an algorithmic trading firm, and the recent PEPE movements may be linked to its market-making activity. The spreading of PEPE to multiple exchanges may be in preparation for more active trading, suggesting a season of increased volatility for the meme. PEPE was trading at $0.000011, up over 16% in the past week. However, over the past days, the token saw some drawdowns. In 2025, PEPE mostly had short-lived rallies, and is yet to recover to its all-time peak from December 2024. As Cryptopolitan recently reported , altcoin season is in full swing, with the main index at 82. Demand for altcoins may affect all assets that are seen as undervalued. PEPE is still trading below its local highs, suggesting another rally may be coming. PEPE long and short positions relatively balanced PEPE’s open interest rose to $105M, a level not seen since December 2024. Most of the activity is happening on OKX, with 95% of the volumes concentrated on the exchange. On Hyperliquid, the PEPE market remains relatively small. A total of 20 whales have set up positions trading kPEPE, representing 1,000 tokens. The whale positions are balanced, with exactly 50% of the whales going long or short. The biggest PEPE short position is for $15.60M, while the most significant long position has a notional value of $16.8M. Historically, PEPE has performed the best in September, though the bull season at the end of 2024 was unique for crypto exuberance. Despite this, PEPE can still deliver 100% rallies and has short-term seasons within the span of a month. The recent movement of coins by a market maker may be a sign of increased trading activity across multiple markets. On DEX spot markets, sellers outnumber buyers, as even a small rally is seen as an opportunity to cash out. At the same time, whale purchases have been noticed, accumulating PEPE in the case of an eventual breakout.

Interest is rising around the question of whether Pepe Coin can match this level of excitement and investment. The answer could reshape what comes next for both projects, sparking new debates about which token might become the next big hit. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $15 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.005. At the next 14th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.01, meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell. Community-First Vibes In XYZVerse, the community runs the show. Active participants earn hefty rewards, and the team has allocated a massive 10% of the total token supply — around 10 billion $XYZ — for airdrops, making it one of the largest airdrops on record. Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits PEPE: The Frog Coin Hopping Toward Meme Crown PEPE is a frog-themed coin on Ethereum. It is deflationary, so the supply slowly shrinks. The token salutes Pepe the Frog, an online legend born in the early 2000s. In April 2023 its value shot to $1.6 billion, making early buyers rich and sparking a wave of copycat coins. Unlike Dogecoin or Shiba Inu, PEPE has no tax and no grand plan. That stark honesty attracts traders who just want a pure meme play. The roadmap is simple: trend on social media, win more exchange listings, then try a full “meme takeover.” If the market turns bullish after the next Bitcoin halving, a tight supply and a loud fan base could push PEPE higher. Yet memecoins move fast both up and down, so only time will tell if the frog lands on a lily pad or leaps even further. Conclusion PEPE shows strength, yet XYZVerse (XYZ), the first all-sport memecoin, blends memes with football, basketball and esports, offers community control, and eyes 20,000% gains, hinting at momentum this bull run.

51754660,581000,1757923758,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51754660.jpeg,Top 2 cổ phiếu crypto nên theo dõi trong năm 2025,https://bitcoinist.com/top-2-crypto-coins-to-watch-in-2025-vn/,"Bitcoin (BTC) gần đây đã tăng mạnh, đạt đỉnh ở mức 99.655 USD, đã khơi lại sự hứng khởi đối với các dự án liên quan đến tiền điện tử. Mặc dù chưa thể vượt qua cột mốc 100.000 USD, nhưng lập trường thân thiện với crypto của Tổng thống đắc cử Donald Trump sau cuộc tái đắc cử ngày 5/11 đã tạo ra tâm lý lạc quan trên thị trường. Các tập đoàn lớn tại Mỹ đã gia tăng đầu tư vào Bitcoin, thúc đẩy sự bùng nổ giá trị của các token liên quan đến tiền điện tử. Trong số những dự án nổi bật nhất là Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) và MaxiDoge ($MAXI) – cả hai đều mang đến cơ hội hấp dẫn cho nhà đầu tư muốn tận dụng sự tăng trưởng của Bitcoin. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): Đột phá Layer-2 Bitcoin Hyper là một trong những dự án mới đáng chú ý trong hệ sinh thái Bitcoin. Với vai trò là giải pháp Layer-2, dự án sử dụng Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) để mang lại giao dịch nhanh hơn, chi phí rẻ hơn, khả năng mở rộng và tích hợp DeFi. Hiện tại, Bitcoin Hyper đang trong giai đoạn presale , thu hút sự chú ý lớn từ giới đầu tư. Token $HYPER có giá bán khởi điểm khoảng 0,012375 USD, với tổng cung giới hạn ở mức 21 tỷ token – yếu tố mang lại tính khan hiếm. Chiến lược của dự án là xây dựng một hệ sinh thái tương thích với Bitcoin, nhưng có thêm chức năng smart contract và DeFi. Nếu Bitcoin tiếp tục tăng trưởng và các giải pháp Layer-2 được áp dụng rộng rãi, $HYPER có thể hưởng lợi như một “đòn bẩy” cho mạng lưới BTC. Một số dự báo cho rằng giá có thể đạt 0,05–0,06 USD vào cuối năm 2025 nếu roadmap được triển khai đúng tiến độ. MaxiDoge (MAXI): Meme token với tiềm năng bùng nổ MaxiDoge ($MAXI) kết hợp văn hóa meme với tokenomics rõ ràng hơn. Ra mắt trên mạng Ethereum, token này có giá bán presale khởi điểm ở mức 0,00025 USD với tổng cung 150,24 tỷ token. Presale diễn ra từ tháng 7 đến tháng 10/2025, thu hút nhà đầu tư nhờ các cuộc kiểm toán từ Coinsult và SolidProof, xác nhận không có chức năng “mint” ẩn hay blacklist. Mục tiêu của dự án là huy động hơn 15 triệu USD cho phát triển hệ sinh thái, marketing và phần thưởng staking. Không giống như mô hình khai thác hay tích trữ Bitcoin của các công ty truyền thống, MaxiDoge dựa vào cộng đồng và hiệu ứng lan truyền, tương tự như Dogecoin hay Shiba Inu thời kỳ đầu. Điều này khiến nó trở thành một khoản đầu tư rủi ro cao, nhưng cũng có thể mang lại lợi nhuận đột biến khi thị trường hưng phấn. Kết luận Khi Bitcoin tiến gần mốc 100.000 USD và bối cảnh pháp lý dần thuận lợi hơn, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) và MaxiDoge ($MAXI) trở thành hai cơ hội đầu tư khác biệt nhưng đầy hứa hẹn: Bitcoin Hyper mang đến giá trị công nghệ dài hạn nhờ Layer-2 và khả năng mở rộng. MaxiDoge tận dụng sức mạnh cộng đồng và văn hóa meme, tạo ra tiềm năng tăng trưởng nhanh. Cả hai đều tiềm ẩn rủi ro cao, nhưng đồng thời mở ra cơ hội sinh lời lớn cho nhà đầu tư sẵn sàng tham gia vào thị trường tài sản số đầy biến động trong năm 2025.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|SHIB|DOGE|ETH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-15 08:09:18

This innovative move signals a new era for how digital assets are managed and traded, promising enhanced efficiency and accessibility across the market. For anyone tracking the convergence of traditional finance and cutting-edge technology, this is a pivotal moment. What is the LSEG Blockchain Platform and How Does it Work? LSEG’s new venture is named the Digital Market Infrastructure (DMI). This sophisticated LSEG blockchain platform is specifically designed to revolutionize the entire lifecycle of private funds. It covers everything from the initial issuance of digital assets to their tokenization and eventual settlement. The DMI provides a comprehensive solution aimed at streamlining complex processes that have traditionally been manual, time-consuming, and often opaque. This ambitious initiative is built on a foundation of strong collaboration. Notably, LSEG partnered with tech giant Microsoft, which provides robust infrastructure support, ensuring scalability and security for the DMI. Furthermore, two key players in the digital asset space, UK-based cryptocurrency exchange Archax and asset manager MembersCap, have already joined as the platform’s inaugural clients. Their early adoption highlights the industry’s confidence in the transformative potential of the LSEG blockchain platform . Why is DMI a Game-Changer for Private Funds? So, what exactly does this mean for the private funds sector? The introduction of the Digital Market Infrastructure brings a host of compelling benefits that could fundamentally redefine how private investments are managed and accessed: Enhanced Efficiency: The platform automates many of the manual processes involved in private fund management. This drastically reduces operational overheads, minimizes human error, and accelerates processing times for transactions and record-keeping. Increased Transparency: Blockchain’s inherent immutability provides an unparalleled level of transparency. All participants gain access to a clear, verifiable, and tamper-proof record of transactions, fostering greater trust and accountability. Greater Accessibility: Tokenization, a core feature of the DMI, allows for the fractional ownership of traditionally large and illiquid assets. This innovation has the potential to open private funds to a much broader investor base, democratizing access to exclusive investment opportunities. Improved Liquidity: By creating digital representations of traditionally illiquid assets, the platform aims to enhance their tradability. This can lead to improved liquidity in secondary markets, offering investors more flexibility and exit strategies. This strategic shift towards digital infrastructure is not merely about adopting new technology; it’s about cultivating a more agile, transparent, and inclusive financial ecosystem for private investments globally. Navigating the Digital Future: Challenges and Opportunities for the LSEG Blockchain Platform While the prospects are undoubtedly exciting, the journey of any pioneering technology involves both significant opportunities and potential hurdles. The LSEG blockchain platform opens up immense avenues for financial innovation, enabling the creation of new types of investment products and more dynamic capital formation models. It could truly set a new global standard for how private capital is raised and managed. However, potential challenges include navigating the rapidly evolving regulatory landscapes across different jurisdictions. Ensuring widespread adoption among a diverse range of market participants, from institutional investors to smaller fund managers, will also be crucial. Building trust and educating the market about the robust benefits and stringent security protocols of blockchain technology will be paramount for the DMI’s long-term success. Furthermore, establishing clear legal frameworks and maintaining top-tier cybersecurity measures will be ongoing priorities. What’s Next for LSEG’s Digital Market Infrastructure? The launch of the Digital Market Infrastructure is just the initial step in a much larger vision. As more clients onboard and the platform continues to evolve, it possesses the potential to become a cornerstone of the global digital finance landscape. LSEG’s proactive move demonstrates a clear commitment to embracing technological innovation and strategically positioning London at the forefront of digital asset evolution. This significant initiative could inspire other traditional financial institutions to explore and implement similar blockchain-based solutions, thereby accelerating the digital transformation of finance on a global scale. Summary: A New Horizon for Private Investments The London Stock Exchange Group’s launch of its LSEG blockchain platform marks a truly pivotal moment for private funds. By skillfully leveraging blockchain technology for digital asset issuance, tokenization, and settlement, LSEG is actively paving the way for a more efficient, transparent, and accessible future for private investments. With strong collaborations and enthusiastic early client adoption, the DMI is poised to revolutionize how capital is managed in this exciting new digital age. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Digital Market Infrastructure (DMI)? The Digital Market Infrastructure (DMI) is LSEG’s new blockchain platform designed to facilitate digital asset issuance, tokenization, and settlement specifically for private funds. It aims to streamline and enhance the efficiency of private market transactions. 2. How does blockchain technology benefit private funds through DMI?

The new model introduces a two-year token inflation schedule, abandoning the current unlimited supply model. The previous system produced approximately 120 million DOT annually and had no supply cap. According to Polkadot's post, supply will be around 1.91 billion DOT by 2040 under the new model. Had the old model continued, that figure was expected to reach 3.4 billion DOT. Thanks to the OpenGov system, which Polkadot DAO launched in 2023, token holders can directly submit suggestions, vote, or delegate their voting rights.

Multiple dormant Bitcoin addresses from 2011-2012 have awakened recently, creating selling pressure that contributed to Bitcoin’s struggle to maintain momentum above previous highs. The whale’s ETH-BTC arbitrage position currently faces losses of approximately 460 BTC worth $53 million if reversed, as the ETH/BTC ratio has remained below 0.05 since July 2024. Despite Ethereum’s 155% rally since July and new all-time highs near $4,957, the ratio peaked at 0.14 in 2017 and currently sits around 0.0401 – 0.0403.

Lookonchain data reveals the whale still controls 49,634 BTC worth $5.43 billion distributed across four separate addresses following the latest $136 million deposit.

The sudden liquidation occurred during weekend trading, when thinner volumes amplify the price impacts of large transactions. Another early adopter rotated 400 BTC in August, worth approximately $45.5 million, into leveraged Ethereum positions using 3x and 10x leverage across four wallets. The whale opened combined long positions totaling 68,130 ETH worth $295 million, bridging funds back to the Ethereum mainnet after executing spot market swaps. Dormant wallet activations accelerated throughout September, with addresses inactive since 2011-2013 transferring Bitcoin to exchanges, including Kraken. One wallet holding 445 BTC made its first transaction in nearly 13 years, while another containing 480 BTC moved funds for the first time since 2012. David Bailey’s whale elimination theory suggests coordinated selling at specific price levels, with “one for 80k bitcoin and the other for 120k bitcoin.” Market analysis indicates the first whale completed massive liquidations while the second continues rotating substantial positions into altcoins. @DavidFBailey says Bitcoin needs to slay two massive whales before $150K as mystery holders dump billions. #Bitcoin #Whales https://t.co/bmtfWK4EUZ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 2, 2025 Technical Breakdown Indicates Deeper Correction Risks Bitcoin faces mounting technical challenges as whale selling coincides with bearish momentum indicators across multiple timeframes. The 50-day exponential moving average at 113,465 now acts as resistance, while MACD signals turned negative with bearish crossovers confirming trend deterioration. Source: TradingView September saw US spot Bitcoin ETFs record their first weekly outflows since June, with $126.64 million in net redemptions during August compared to $6 billion inflows in July. The reversal ended a six-week streak of consistent institutional accumulation as momentum shifted toward Ethereum products. Ethereum ETFs significantly outperformed Bitcoin funds, attracting nearly $4 billion in August inflows while Bitcoin products recorded $622.5 million in net outflows. September historically represents Bitcoin’s weakest month, delivering average losses of 3.77% during bull market years and earning the “Rektember” nickname among traders. Bitcoin closed August at $109,000, marking a 6% monthly decline despite reaching all-time highs above $124,000 earlier in the cycle. So far, after rising from $111,000 last week to above $115,000, Bitcoin has not been able to break the $116,000 resistance, and this whale activity can impact sentiment even more negatively. According to the last Bitfinex Alpha , Bitcoin is holding precisely steady between $108,000 and $112,000, with buyers actively defending key support zones while filling the gap created by July’s sharp rally. However, the exchange acknowledged that the risk of a deeper correction remains, and consolidation appears to be the more likely outcome. September has historically marked a cyclical low for Bitcoin, setting the stage for a stronger Q4 performance. Amid all these, institutional accumulation persists despite retail liquidations, as corporate Bitcoin holdings have surged above $200 billion across 190 entities. In fact, according to a Cryptonew report covered earlier this month, businesses across major industries have purchased 1,755 Bitcoin daily (worth $195.2 million), contributing over $1.3 trillion to Bitcoin’s market cap during the past 20 months alone.

The allegation came from China’s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), which said a preliminary probe had found that Nvidia didn’t follow the rules tied to its 2020 acquisition of Israeli chipmaker Mellanox Technologies. According to SAMR, Nvidia may have violated the conditions that China imposed when it approved the Mellanox deal. The agency didn’t stop there. Officials said the investigation is still active and would continue. As of Monday, Nvidia has not issued a response. Regulators accuse Nvidia of breaking its 2020 commitments Back in 2020, Nvidia secured China’s approval to acquire Mellanox — a company that builds networking hardware for data centers and servers — but with strings attached. The deal got greenlit only after Nvidia made specific promises to China’s regulators. Now, SAMR claims those promises were broken. SAMR said the U.S. chipmaker is suspected of ignoring obligations it agreed to under the deal’s terms. The agency’s preliminary report said Nvidia’s conduct breached China’s Anti-Monopoly Law, and the regulator confirmed the case is still open. The announcement sent Nvidia stock tumbling in U.S. premarket trading. Under China’s antitrust law, a company found guilty of anti-competitive behavior can be hit with fines ranging from 1% to 10% of its prior year’s sales. Nvidia made $17 billion in revenue from China in its last fiscal year, ending January 26. That accounted for 13% of Nvidia’s total sales, based on the company’s most recent annual report. Any penalty could be massive. This is all happening while U.S. and Chinese officials meet in Madrid to discuss trade. Reports say semiconductors are at the top of the agenda, and Nvidia’s name is on the list. With the U.S. placing restrictions on advanced chip exports to China, and Beijing tightening its own rules, tensions are already sky-high. China opens anti-dumping probe into U.S. chip imports Two days before the SAMR announcement, China’s Ministry of Commerce hit back with another move: it opened an anti-dumping investigation into analog integrated circuits coming from the United States. In a public statement released Saturday, a ministry spokesperson said, “The U.S. government has recently overstretched the concept of national security, abused export controls and long-arm jurisdiction, and maliciously blocked and suppressed China’s chip products and the artificial intelligence industry.” They added that these actions “seriously violated WTO rules” and hurt Chinese companies. The probe follows a complaint by a provincial semiconductor industry association representing Chinese chipmakers. The ministry said the investigation will focus on interface IC chips and gate driver IC chips produced with 40-nanometer or larger process technologies. The dumping complaint argues that from 2022 to 2024, U.S. imports of these chips into China surged by 37%, while prices fell by 52%. That drop in pricing, they claim, damaged local chip production. The Commerce Ministry confirmed the case was filed under Chinese law and WTO rules, saying the anti-dumping investigation would be conducted fairly and by the book. The process is expected to finish by September 13, 2026, but could stretch another six months if “special circumstances” arise. The ministry said Chinese authorities will follow statutory procedures, protect the rights of all involved parties, and issue a final ruling based on evidence. The investigation, they said, was not politically motivated, but driven by the interests of local industry. As the U.S. and China face off over chip policy, trade routes, and global supply chains, the pressure on Nvidia is growing fast. The company’s silence won’t hold forever, and the risk of a massive fine from Beijing is now very real.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $11.14. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $27.9 and $33.66, with an average value of $28.88. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2025 – 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.7902 Market Cap $1.405B Trading Volume $161.05M Circulating Supply 1.778B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.4005 (Jun 18, 2022) 24-hour High $0.8083 24-hour Low $0.772 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.88% 50-Day SMA $0.7288 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 53 (Neutral) Green Days 18/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $0.7559 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: The daily chart shows cooling momentum after rejection at $0.82. Momentum is weakening, making a short-term pullback more likely unless $0.808 is broken. Optimism 1-day price chart On the daily timeframe for September 15, OP is trading around $0.788, consolidating after a run that pushed price close to $0.84. Yesterday’s red candle signaled selling pressure as the price got rejected near the upper Bollinger Band at $0.8223. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The RSI has cooled to 54, reflecting a shift from overbought momentum into neutral territory, while the MACD still shows bullish momentum but with narrowing histogram bars, suggesting the uptrend may be losing strength. Support sits at the mid-Bollinger band around $0.737, and losing that level could bring price back towards $0.65. For now, bulls are defending the $0.78–$0.80 zone, but upside momentum is clearly slowing. Optimism 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour chart, OP is struggling to reclaim $0.808, which is now acting as a strong resistance. Price is trading under the 21-period SMA at $0.797, showing bearish pressure in the short term. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView OP’s support is visible at $0.768, and a breakdown below this level would expose OP to a sharper decline towards $0.74. On the upside, breaking $0.808 would allow another retest of the recent peak at $0.835, but volume remains muted compared to the rally days, which weakens bullish conviction. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.7759 BUY SMA 5 $0.7809 BUY SMA 10 $0.7767 BUY SMA 21 $0.7383 BUY SMA 50 $0.7288 BUY SMA 100 $0.6764 BUY SMA 200 $0.7559 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7306 BUY EMA 5 $0.7219 BUY EMA 10 $0.7205 BUY EMA 21 $0.7242 BUY EMA 50 $0.7126 BUY EMA 100 $0.7206 BUY EMA 200 $0.8597 SELL What to expect from Optimism? Optimism (OP) looks to be entering a consolidation or corrective phase after a strong run. If bulls fail to break above $0.808, expect sideways to downward action toward $0.768–$0.74 before the next major attempt higher. Only a decisive break above $0.835 would reignite bullish continuation. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up to $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

A recent development from Bithumb, one of South Korea’s leading digital asset exchanges, directly impacts holders of Zilliqa (ZIL). The exchange has officially announced a temporary Zilliqa ZIL suspension for both deposits and withdrawals. This move, while potentially disruptive for some, is a standard and necessary procedure to support an upcoming network upgrade for the Zilliqa blockchain. Why the Zilliqa ZIL Suspension is Happening Many cryptocurrency enthusiasts might wonder why exchanges halt operations for specific assets. In essence, a blockchain network upgrade is a significant event, similar to a software update for your computer or phone, but on a much larger, decentralized scale. These upgrades are vital for the health, security, and functionality of the blockchain. Enhancing Performance: Upgrades often introduce improvements that make the network faster and more efficient. Boosting Security: They can patch vulnerabilities and strengthen the network’s defenses against potential threats. Adding New Features: New functionalities or protocol changes might be implemented to expand the blockchain’s capabilities. Bithumb’s decision to implement a Zilliqa ZIL suspension ensures that all transactions are processed correctly before, during, and after the upgrade. This proactive measure prevents any potential loss of funds or transaction errors that could occur if deposits and withdrawals were allowed during the transition period. What Does This Zilliqa ZIL Suspension Mean for Traders? The temporary halt for Zilliqa ZIL suspension on Bithumb is scheduled to begin at 9:00 a.m. UTC on September 24 . If you are a ZIL holder or a trader on Bithumb, understanding the implications is key to managing your assets effectively. No Deposits or Withdrawals: From the specified time, you will not be able to send ZIL into your Bithumb wallet or withdraw it to an external address. Trading Might Continue: It is important to note that while deposits and withdrawals are suspended, trading of ZIL pairs on Bithumb may still be active. Always check Bithumb’s official announcement for precise details regarding trading activities during the upgrade period. Plan Ahead: If you need to move your ZIL assets, ensure you do so well before the suspension deadline. Initiating transfers close to the cut-off time could result in delays or complications. This measure is temporary. Once the Zilliqa network upgrade is successfully completed and Bithumb has verified the stability of the upgraded chain, deposits and withdrawals for ZIL will resume. Keep an eye on Bithumb’s official communication channels for updates on when these services will be restored. Navigating Crypto Exchange Updates: Beyond the Zilliqa ZIL Suspension The Bithumb Zilliqa ZIL suspension serves as a valuable reminder for all cryptocurrency users to remain vigilant and informed about developments on their preferred exchanges. Being proactive can save you from potential headaches and ensure the security of your digital assets. Here are some actionable insights: Always Read Official Announcements: Exchange websites, blogs, and official social media channels are your primary sources for accurate information. Understand the ‘Why’: Take a moment to grasp the reason behind such suspensions. Network upgrades are usually beneficial in the long run. Diversify and Decentralize: While exchanges offer convenience, consider holding a portion of your assets in a hardware wallet for greater control and security, especially during periods of network instability or exchange maintenance. In conclusion, the temporary Zilliqa ZIL suspension by Bithumb is a necessary step to ensure a smooth transition for the Zilliqa network upgrade. While it might require a brief adjustment for users, these upgrades are fundamental to the continuous evolution and improvement of the blockchain ecosystem. Staying informed and planning your transactions accordingly will allow you to navigate such events with confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Zilliqa network upgrade? A Zilliqa network upgrade refers to a significant update to the Zilliqa blockchain’s underlying software protocol. These upgrades introduce new features, improve performance, enhance security, or fix existing issues, ensuring the network remains robust and efficient. When will ZIL deposits and withdrawals resume on Bithumb? Bithumb has announced that the Zilliqa ZIL suspension for deposits and withdrawals will begin at 9:00 a.m. UTC on September 24. The exact resumption time will be announced by Bithumb once the network upgrade is successfully completed and verified for stability. Can I still trade ZIL on Bithumb during the suspension? Typically, an exchange might allow trading to continue even during a deposit and withdrawal suspension. However, it is crucial to check Bithumb’s official announcement directly for the most accurate information regarding ZIL trading during this specific period. Why do crypto exchanges suspend deposits and withdrawals for network upgrades? Exchanges suspend these services to protect user funds and prevent transaction errors. During an upgrade, the blockchain’s state can be in flux, and allowing deposits or withdrawals could lead to lost funds, incorrect balances, or other technical issues. The suspension ensures a clean transition to the new network version. What should I do if I need to move my ZIL during the suspension? If you anticipate needing to move your ZIL assets, it is highly recommended to complete any deposits or withdrawals well before the 9:00 a.m. UTC, September 24 deadline. Once the suspension is active, you will need to wait until services are restored by Bithumb. Was this article helpful?

Accordingly, Arthur Hayes, who reiterated his bold $200,000 prediction for Bitcoin, said that Bitcoin's 4-year bull market cycle is no longer valid. Hayes stated that he does not believe in the four-year cycle in Bitcoin and that the price will exceed the $200,000 level. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes discussed the impact of macro liquidity on Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market in an interview with Kyle Chasse. Hayes stated that the general market view is that the Fed, the US Treasury Department and the central banks of various countries will provide liquidity to the market by printing money and purchasing bonds. “The US Federal Reserve (FED), the Treasury Department, and each country's central banks will provide liquidity through bond purchases and currency issuances. In such an environment, cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, could outperform traditional assets like the S&P 500. Additionally, Bitcoin is no longer tied to a four-year cycle, as its growth is now more closely tied to macroeconomic changes than mining. At this point, thanks to macroeconomic factors, Bitcoin could rise to $150,000-200,000 by the end of 2025.” *This is not investment advice.

In spite of long-term holders taking some profits, the strong institutional demand has helped to keep Bitcoin within striking distance of its all-time high. What’s next for the king of cryptocurrencies? Institutions still believe in Bitcoin Net inflows into the US Spot Bitcoin ETFs last week amounted to a total of 20.5K BTC. This was equivalent to around $2.3 billion, and gives an idea of the mindset of the institutions in regard to expectations for Bitcoin going forward. $BTC price stays in tight range Source: TradingView The $BTC price traded in a tight range over the weekend with only the odd tiny spike in one direction or the other. The price generally kept to the $115,700 horizontal support level and on Monday morning it’s still there. All this sideways price action has had an impact though, and that is to allow the short-term Stochastic RSI momentum indicators to start coming back to the bottom of their ranges, as can be seen with the 4-hour indicator lines above, which are now heading back to the upside. Is this a $BTC local top? Source: TradingView The daily chart reveals that the $BTC price is still holding the $115,700 horizontal level as resistance. Were the candle to close like it is at the end of the day it might suggest that the price could be heading back to retest the bottom of the ascending channel and the $113,500 horizontal support. The Stochastic RSI indicators for this time frame are just now beginning to roll over. This rather suggests that the swing high for this upward impulse might have been reached, and that the next downward impulse is about to start. At the bottom of the chart is the RSI. The indicator here is close to the blue descending trendline. If it rejects it, the downward thesis just mentioned could play out. If the indicator line breaks through the trendline, the opposite could happen, with Bitcoin breaking the resistances and heading higher. Weekly chart in the balance Source: TradingView The weekly chart shows that the last weekly candle closed underneath the $115,700 resistance. While this week’s candle was initially growing nicely above this resistance, it has now dipped back below. Changing back to a bullish scenario, the Stochastic RSI indicators have confirmed in a cross up. If both indicators are above the 20.00 level at the end of this week this would signal strong upside price momentum. The RSI right at the bottom of the chart illustrates that the indicator line has crossed above the downtrend. Once again, if it continues upward this would be bullish for the Bitcoin price . Conversely, if the indicator line crosses back below the trendline and rejects from it, this would confirm a reversal. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Key Takeaways: LSEG has launched a blockchain-based platform for private funds, developed with Microsoft and running on Azure. MembersCap’s tokenized MCM Fund 1 marks the first live deployment, with Archax acting as nominee. The platform aims to improve access, efficiency, and transparency in private markets through tokenization. The new platform, called Digital Markets Infrastructure (DMI), was developed in collaboration with Microsoft and runs on Microsoft Azure, according to a Monday announcement . It supports the full lifecycle of digital assets, from issuance and tokenization to post-trade settlement, and is designed to bridge traditional capital markets with blockchain networks. MembersCap Launches Tokenized Fund on LSEG’s New Blockchain Platform LSEG’s first deployment of the platform saw capital management firm MembersCap raise funds for its tokenized MCM Fund 1, with Archax, a Financial Conduct Authority-regulated digital exchange in London, acting as nominee. The transaction marked the first real-world use of the infrastructure, which the exchange says will soon support more asset classes beyond private funds. Initially focused on private markets, the platform allows general partners and professional investors to discover and interact with fund opportunities through LSEG’s Workspace system. The exchange believes tokenization could help unlock access to private investments that have historically been opaque and illiquid. “Today’s private market processes are ripe for innovation,” said Darko Hajdukovic, LSEG’s Head of Digital Markets Infrastructure. “There’s a growing appetite for an end-to-end, interoperable, regulated financial markets DLT infrastructure.” JUST IN: London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) launches its blockchain platform Digital Markets Infrastructure, starting with private funds – Bloomberg. pic.twitter.com/msqdQ8pABk — Whale Insider (@WhaleInsider) September 15, 2025 Tokenization, which refers to the process of turning real-world financial assets into blockchain-based tokens, is gaining momentum among banks, asset managers, and infrastructure providers. Proponents argue it offers faster settlement, broader investor access via fractional ownership, and improved transparency. However, the market is still in its early stages, with tokenized assets representing a fraction of the trillions managed in traditional funds. Microsoft’s Bill Borden, VP of Worldwide Financial Services, said the collaboration “reshapes the future of global finance,” citing the potential to unlock new client opportunities. Archax and MembersCap are among the first to pilot the platform, alongside the Cardano Foundation. LSEG joins a growing list of major financial institutions turning to blockchain infrastructure to modernize financial markets. As traditional exchanges explore decentralized frameworks, the line between TradFi and DeFi continues to blur. Tokenized Real-World Assets May Unlock $400T TradFi Market In a recent research, Web3 digital property firm Animoca Brands said that tokenization of RWAs could unlock a $400 trillion traditional finance market. Animoca researchers Andrew Ho and Ming Ruan said the global market for private credit, treasury debt, commodities, stocks, alternative funds, and bonds represents a vast runway for growth. “The estimated $400 trillion addressable TradFi market underscores the potential growth runway for RWA tokenization,” they wrote. Meanwhile, according to the 2025 Skynet RWA Security Report, the market for tokenized RWAs could grow to $16 trillion by 2030 . Tokenized U.S. Treasuries alone are projected to reach $4.2 billion this year, with short-term government bonds driving most of the activity. Institutional interest is accelerating, with major banks, asset managers, and blockchain-native firms exploring tokenization for yield and liquidity management.

The protocol will issue one NEOM token for every dollar lost, allowing users to claim debt tokens while migrating remaining assets to secure multi-audited contracts. The hack originated from a rogue developer who secretly deployed unaudited code containing critical vulnerabilities, bypassing internal review processes through single-signature deployment. The attacker exploited flash loan functions incorrectly exposed as public and query functions that could modify contract state without authorization. Nemo’s total value locked collapsed from $6.3 million to $1.57 million as users withdrew over $3.8 million worth of USDC and SUI tokens following the breach. The exploit occurred during one of crypto’s worst security days in 2025, coinciding with SwissBorg’s $41.5 million SOL hack and the Yala stablecoin depeg attack. Official Update: Following the September 8 security incident, Nemo Protocol has finalized a comprehensive compensation plan. We remain committed to transparency and accountability. We are deeply grateful to our community and partners for their trust and support, and we will… pic.twitter.com/OWDIG5PSyA — Nemo (@nemoprotocol) September 15, 2025 Rogue Developer’s Secret Code Deployment Triggers Security Catastrophe The post-mortem investigation revealed systematic security failures dating to January 2025 when the unnamed developer submitted code containing unaudited features to MoveBit auditors. The developer failed to highlight new additions while mixing previously audited fixes with unreviewed functionality, creating a compromised foundation. MoveBit issued its final audit report based on incomplete information, as the developer used unauthorized smart contract versions. The team deployed contract version 0xcf34 using a single-signature address 0xf55c, rather than audit-confirmed hashes, thereby circumventing established review protocols entirely. Asymptotic team identified the critical C-2 vulnerability in August, warning that functions could modify code without permission. The developer dismissed severity concerns and failed to implement necessary fixes despite available support from security partners. Attack execution began at 16:00 UTC on September 7 with hackers leveraging the flash loan function and a known query vulnerability. Detection occurred thirty minutes later when YT yields displayed over 30x returns, indicating system compromise. @nemoprotocol blames $2.6M exploit on rogue developer who deployed unaudited code with flash loan vulnerabilities, bypassing reviews. #Sui #Crypto #hack https://t.co/lZctUh16tY — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 11, 2025 The developer drew inspiration from Aave and Uniswap protocols to maximize composability through flash loan capabilities, but critically underestimated security risks. Functions designed for read-only purposes contained write capabilities, creating the primary attack vector that enabled the devastating breach. NEOM Recovery Program Offers Market-Based Exit Strategy The three-step recovery program begins with asset migration, allowing users to transfer residual value from compromised pools to new secure contracts through one-click actions. Users simultaneously receive NEOM debt tokens pegged 1:1 to their USD losses determined by pre-hack snapshots. Nemo will inject value into NEOM through a multi-tiered redemption waterfall model, with recovered hacker funds forming the primary source for proportional claims. External capital injections, such as liquidity loans and strategic investments, will provide secondary support as confidence anchors. The protocol established immediate AMM liquidity pools with significant depth on major Sui DEXs, creating instant market-based exit paths for users prioritizing liquidity over long-term recovery. The NEOM/USDC trading pair enables market pricing based on perceived recovery timelines and protocol success probability. The hack contributes to 2025’s devastating DeFi security crisis, with over $2.37 billion lost across 121 incidents during the first half alone. September emerged as particularly destructive with SwissBorg’s SOL compromise, npm supply chain attacks affecting billions of downloads , and the Yala stablecoin losing its dollar peg. The Yala stablecoin ($YU), a Bitcoin-native over-collateralized stablecoin backed by Polychain, lost its dollar peg after a protocol attack sent $YU crashing to $0.2074. #Stablecoin #Bitcoin https://t.co/RxbGVEG6Ba — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 14, 2025 Particularly, the Yala stablecoin (YU) attack , which happened this weekend, saw YU lose its dollar peg following a protocol attack that sent the Bitcoin-native over-collateralized stablecoin crashing to $0.2074 before recovering to $0.917. The suspected attacker minted 120 million YU tokens on Polygon and sold 7.71 million across Ethereum and Solana for 7.7 million USDC. For Nemo Protocol, stolen assets totaling $2.59 million moved through sophisticated laundering operations via Wormhole CCTP before final aggregation on Ethereum. Security teams established monitoring protocols for holding addresses while coordinating with centralized exchanges on potential asset freezing measures. The protocol implemented emergency incremental audits with Asymptotic while planning additional independent security firm reviews.

However, the real buzz this month circles around a new entity on the block – Layer Brett. Unlike the more traditional cryptocurrencies, Layer Brett introduces a dynamic combination of memecoin vitality with robust Layer 2 solutions, catching the eye of forward-thinking investors. Why Layer Brett Is Capturing Investor Interest The cryptocurrency sector constantly evolves, and September has unveiled a fresh player that is drawing significant attention. Layer Brett , a Layer 2 memecoin, is not just another digital currency but a promising investment opportunity that blends the solid infrastructure of Ethereum with the dazzling potential of memecoins. Advantages of Investing in Layer Brett Investors are particularly excited about Layer Brett for several reasons. Firstly, the coin has amassed over $3.61 million in its presale phase, illustrating robust investor confidence and market demand. Furthermore, it offers an impressive 715% APY on staking, a rate that is hard to ignore. Such features position Layer Brett as a lucrative choice for those looking to maximize returns in a short period. Comparative Analysis: Cardano vs. Layer Brett While Cardano has been a staple in the crypto market, known for its scientific approach and robust community, it faces growth limitations due to its mature market capitalization. On the other hand, Layer Brett's introduction to the market at a presale price of just $0.0058 and its strategic Layer 2 placement allow it to bypass traditional growth boundaries faced by established cryptocurrencies like ADA. The Future Outlook of Layer Brett As September progresses, the strategic position of Layer Brett continues to solidify. Its agile framework and community-focused incentives not only promise substantial immediate returns but also position it for sustainable long-term growth. This dual appeal makes Layer Brett an astute choice for both seasoned and new cryptocurrency investors. Final Thoughts For investors seeking a blend of innovation and potential high-yield returns, Layer Brett stands out this September. With its strong presale performance and high staking rewards, it represents not just a memecoin but a strategic investment in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency terrain.

Although Cardano maintains its $0.87 support level and Charles Hoskinson expands into $200 million healthcare blockchain initiatives, a revolutionary Layer 2 memecoin called Layer Brett has quietly become favorite for explosive September gains. With over $3.61 million raised in presale and more than 715% in staking APY on offer, $LBRETT represents the synthesis of Cardano's institutional credibility with memecoin explosiveness that September buyers are seeking. Established blockchain veterans reveal constraints despite leadership Cardano's recent performance showcases exactly why established cryptocurrencies face mathematical limitations during high-growth periods. Despite Charles Hoskinson's ambitious $200 million investment in Wyoming's blockchain healthcare infrastructure and ADA's impressive ability to shrug off ETF regulatory setbacks with positive momentum, the token's $0.87 price point represents a mature market cap that limits exponential growth potential. The bullish whale activity capitalizing on retail pessimism demonstrates sophisticated institutional recognition of Cardano's long-term value proposition. However, these same institutional flows create price stability that inherently caps the explosive September gains that aggressive investors seek. While ADA's 2% gains during adverse market conditions prove network resilience, they also highlight the mathematical reality that established ecosystems require exponentially larger capital inflows to generate life-changing returns. Next-generation Layer 2 infrastructure captures memecoin energy Layer Brett comes forth as the mathematical evolution beyond traditional Cardano limitations by combining proven Layer 2 infrastructure with memecoin explosiveness. Unlike ADA's academic approach requiring lengthy development timelines, $LBRETT leverages Ethereum's battle-tested security while delivering the lightning-fast transactions and low gas fees that September buyers demand for maximum trading flexibility. The project's more than 715% staking rewards create immediate utility that Cardano's more conservative yield mechanisms cannot match. While ADA holders wait for ecosystem developments to translate into price appreciation, Layer Brett stakers earn mathematical returns that compound daily. This fundamental difference explains why over $3.61 million in presale funding has flowed toward $LBRETT despite Cardano's superior brand recognition and institutional backing. The $1 million giveaway further demonstrates Layer Brett's community-first approach that transforms traditional memecoin speculation into sustainable ecosystem building. Where Cardano focuses on academic rigor and healthcare applications, Layer Brett delivers immediate rewards and engagement that create viral growth dynamics. Timing favors hybrid solutions over traditional September cryptocurrency strategies September's optimal cryptocurrency buying strategy demands recognition that neither pure utility tokens like Cardano nor traditional memecoins provide the complete solution modern investors require. ADA's solid fundamentals and Hoskinson's innovation leadership create an excellent foundation, but the token's established market cap limits the 10x-100x potential that aggressive September positioning demands. Layer Brett's presale pricing at $0.0058 combined with immediate staking access creates the mathematical entry point that Cardano simply cannot offer at current valuations. While whale accumulation of ADA signals long-term confidence, Layer Brett's early-stage positioning allows September buyers to capture the entire growth trajectory from ecosystem launch through mainstream adoption. Community-first Layer 2 opportunities win out over established crypto September's cryptocurrency landscape definitively favors Layer Brett's community-first Layer 2 approach over Cardano's institutional development strategy. While ADA's resilience and Hoskinson's healthcare innovations prove long-term viability, the mathematical advantage belongs to $LBRETT's combination of memecoin energy, Layer 2 utility, and excellent presale timing that creates optimal conditions for explosive September gains this year.

Of those, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are quickly becoming one of the best coins to be on the next bullrun. Though Shiba Inu (SHIB) retains its performance, the future-oriented nature of Mutuum Finance is creating serious interest from investors after the next step of ETH-fueled growth. Shiba Inu Stays Close to $0.0000142 During Low-Key Market Activity Shiba Inu (SHIB) is at $0.00001421, as the current price has ranged from $0.00001322 to $0.00001424. The token appears to be consolidating, as it registers little volatility and retains recent support and resistance levels. Volume is reasonably steady, and no clear breakout can be identified on short-term charts. Traders are considering SHIB’s behavior in the context of Ethereum’s growing DeFi ecosystem, especially as new initiatives create traction. Attention to emerging tokens such as Mutuum Finance is also part of the larger context. Mutuum Finance: Risk Mechanisms and Protocol Security Mutuum Finance has strong protection protocols for any asset that is collateralized to ensure the security of the protocol and the users. These are target collateral rates, deposit caps, and lending caps. To offer systemic stability, liquidators are encouraged to close undercollateralized positions, initiate penalties and enforce liquidation guarantee remediation on time. Collateral effectiveness is optimized in correlated assets, i.e., lending capacity increases proportionally with Loan-to-Value (LTV) levels in heavily secured lending. Reserve factors are provided as insurance during exceptional market conditions, and higher reserves are levied on risky assets to offset volatility. Phase 6 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Token Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has already recorded more than 16,300 investors and $15.8 million with massive demand. On its quest for increased security and transparency, the project is launching a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK. Through the program, developers and researchers are incentivized to report vulnerabilities, the reward being placed on four levels of severity: critical, major, minor, and low. Dynamic Interest Rate Adjustments Mutuum Finance is premised upon a floating rate of interest mechanism, which changes with liquidity level. Borrowing becomes cheap when liquidity is high and enables increased usage. Borrowing is expensive when liquidity is in short supply, enabling repayment of the loan alongside increased deposits. This helps in maintaining balance in the system as well as curbing excessive borrowing. Increased Security by Borrowing Constraints The protocol derives extremely comparable collateral sizes, borrowing, and supply to mitigate risk. Overcollateralization and liquidator incentives cause undercollateralized positions to resolve rapidly in order to maintain insolvency risk exposure within bounds. Risky assets have greater collateral efficiency, whereas riskier tokens have reduced borrowing limits, striking a balance between risk mitigation and liquidity provision. Keeping Market Volatility in Check and Liquidity Preservation Mutuum Finance is highly sensitive to having the correct on-chain liquidity in order not to liquidate low-slippage, low-quality positions. Liquidation thresholds and LTV ratios are very sensitive to the underlying asset’s volatility. Less volatile, more stable tokens may have larger borrowing sizes and lower liquidation thresholds, while higher risk, more volatile tokens have stricter settings. Along with other protection mechanisms, liquidators are compensated with a premium during periods of lower liquidity, securing risk management even in distressed market conditions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the most robust Ethereum-based DeFi projects to put on your radar as ETH approaches $5,000. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly positioning itself as one of the best Ethereum projects to benefit from the next ETH bull run, overtaking meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB).

On Sep. 15, the London Stock Exchange Group became the first major stock exchange to roll out a blockchain-powered infrastructure specifically designed for private funds. According to the announcement , the new system, called the Digital Markets Infrastructure (DMI) platform, supports the full asset lifecycle, covering everything from issuance and tokenisation to post-trade settlement and servicing. Initially, the platform will focus on private funds before gradually expanding its offering to include other asset classes. As part of the first transaction, U.S.-based MembersCap used the DMI to execute a primary fundraise, with regulated crypto exchange Archax acting as a nominee for the Cardano Foundation. London Stock Exchange partners with Microsoft DMI was developed in close collaboration with Microsoft and runs on Azure’s cloud infrastructure. LSEG says the system is designed to be fully interoperable with both existing distributed ledger technologies and traditional finance systems so that it can ensure seamless integration for institutions operating across both domains. “There are many processes in private markets today that can be improved. At LSEG, we are committed to significantly improving access to private markets by streamlining workflows, enhancing distribution, and enabling liquidity,” Dr. Darko Hajdukovic, Head of Digital Markets Infrastructure at LSEG, said in an accompanying statement. Hajdukovic said the platform was launched in response to growing demand for an “end-to-end, interoperable, regulated financial markets DLT infrastructure” that can service both native crypto assets and traditional ones. So far, MembersCap, Archax, and EJF Capital have been onboarded to the DMI, with EJF expected to bring a selection of its funds to the platform soon. Private funds listed on the DMI will show up directly within LSEG’s Workspace platform, giving general partners a direct line to professional investors, right inside the tools they already use every day. LSEG’s crypto engagement Initial reports that the Long Stock Exchange Group was mulling developing an “end‑to‑end digital market ecosystem” to raise and transfer capital across asset classes first emerged in 2023. At the time, LSEG made it clear that the focus wasn’t on cryptocurrencies, but rather on using distributed ledger technology (DLT) to enhance how traditional financial instruments are issued, traded, and settled. However, even as the LSEG distanced itself from cryptocurrencies at the time, by early 2024, the group’s openness to crypto-based products had become visible. In March, the LSE announced it would begin accepting applications for Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded notes (ETNs), with access restricted to institutional investors, and soon after, ETF provider WisdomTree became one of the first to list physically-backed Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs on the exchange following regulatory approval from the FCA.

If so, there is a crucial announcement you need to be aware of. Binance has confirmed a temporary Binance RIF suspension for all deposits and withdrawals. This is a vital step to support an upcoming Rootstock network upgrade and hard fork, ensuring the stability and security of your assets. What is This Binance RIF Suspension All About? Binance recently announced that it will temporarily halt deposits and withdrawals for RIF tokens. This temporary Binance RIF suspension is scheduled to begin promptly at 4:00 p.m. UTC on October 1st.

They help in addressing potential vulnerabilities, improving transaction speeds, and ensuring the network remains competitive and robust. Think of it like software updates for your computer or phone; they are necessary to keep everything running smoothly and securely. By supporting this hard fork, Binance ensures that once the upgrade is complete, RIF token services will resume on an improved and more efficient network. This proactive approach helps maintain the integrity of the RIF ecosystem for all users. How Does the Binance RIF Suspension Affect You?

However, it is important to understand that your RIF tokens will remain safe and secure within your Binance wallet. Trading of RIF on Binance will also continue unaffected during this period. Users who hold RIF on Binance do not need to take any specific action regarding the network upgrade itself. Binance handles all the technical requirements for its users. If you have any pending RIF transactions, it is advisable to complete them before the specified suspension time, or wait until services resume. What Happens After the Rootstock Hard Fork? Once the Rootstock network upgrade and hard fork are successfully completed, Binance will thoroughly assess the stability of the upgraded network. Following this assessment, the exchange will promptly resume deposits and withdrawals for RIF tokens. Binance will issue a separate announcement to inform users about the exact timing for the resumption of these services. Users are encouraged to monitor Binance’s official announcements for the latest updates. This careful approach ensures that when the services are restored, they are operating optimally on the newly upgraded Rootstock blockchain, providing a better experience for everyone involved with RIF tokens. The temporary Binance RIF suspension is a routine yet crucial step to support the Rootstock network’s evolution. It underscores the ongoing development and maintenance efforts within the crypto space to enhance security, efficiency, and functionality. By staying informed and understanding these processes, you can navigate the dynamic world of cryptocurrency with greater confidence.

Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Out With A 32% Surge: Time To Buy Or Too Late To Chase? According to Ali Martinez, the meme token could head as high as $0.45, a level last seen at the end of 2021. DOGE was trading at around $0.29, more than 5% higher than it was yesterday, and traders are watching whether now-support at $0.27 holds. Technical Breakout And Volume Spike Trading activity around the breakout caught attention. Based on reports, DOGE pushed above the $0.27 zone that had capped rallies through the summer and then consolidated above it, a pattern traders view as healthy. Dogecoin $DOGE may consolidate for a bit, then expect the next leg up toward $0.45! pic.twitter.com/uynq9IF4wd — Ali (@ali_charts) September 14, 2025 The weekly chart showed a breakout from a multimonth symmetrical triangle, and trading volumes during that move more than tripled — a sign that momentum gained backing from buyers. Shorter term targets being watched include $0.39 and the $0.43–$0.45 band cited by some analysts. Triangle Target Paints A Bigger Picture Chart-based targets diverge. Using the triangle’s maximum height, some calculations put a breakout objective near $0.60, which would be about a 95% rise from current levels if reached by October. $DOGE breakout Symmetrical triangle resolved upwards! Price rising after breakout, eyeing $0.45 target! Is meme season back? pic.twitter.com/rptobViUoO — Crypto King (@CryptoKing4Ever) September 13, 2025 Other chartists have lower targets clustered around $0.45, matching the upper line of a wider multi-year triangle. These different readings mean the path higher is not universally agreed, but the technical case for a move is clear on several timeframes. Short-Term Risks And Support Levels The key risk is holding the new floor. Reports note that past Dogecoin rallies stalled when gains could not be kept above freshly conquered levels. If DOGE falls back under $0.27, momentum would likely fade and price could slide toward the prior base around $0.20–$0.25. Retail Demand And Recent Gains Retail interest has returned, helped in part by the launch of a new Dogecoin ETF, which drew fresh attention to the token. DOGE has already rallied by nearly 40% over the past seven days, outpacing the broader crypto market that rose by about 8% over the same span. Related Reading: Dogecoin Hits Multi-Month High, Veteran Trader Says It’s A Critical Progress Trading desks say the bias is tilted higher for now, but many traders are treating September as a make-or-break month for the next major move. Chart Targets Diverge But Bias Is Up Meanwhile, as momentum indicators and volume favor further upside, cautious traders point to the mixed targets and the need for clear support. Some models project $0.45 as the immediate ceiling; others place a loftier objective near $0.60. If the breakout is sustained, gains could be swift. If not, losses could be sharp.

The special investment tool offers individuals and corporations to build self-curated portfolios. As Cryptopolitan reported earlier, OKX, along with Coinbase, is among the first crypto companies to offer pension fund investments. OKX also created a purpose-built platform for SMSF, including secure buying infrastructure, management, and reports on digital assets. This would allow trustees to acquire crypto coins with extra safety. The OKX platform includes detailed dashboards on transactions and portfolio monitoring, exportable annual reports and AUSTRAC-licensed exchange services. The SMSF covers major assets like BTC and ETH. The platform also has dedicated onboarding and local customer support, with a newly hired Australian team. The service offers a guided setup, verification, documentation checks, and links to bank accounts. Customers can find support via phone, email, or live chat. Digital asset adoption grows in Australia Australia has always shown early adoption for crypto. Lately, adoption has accelerated, becoming one of the fastest-growing investment segments. Based on the Chainalysis crypto adoption index, Australia is among growth regions, with an index of 38 in 2025. SMSF are also one of the in-demand savings tools, with 28% of retirement funds flowing into self-selected investments. SMSF draws in around $4T from Australian investors, and even a fraction of those inflows could boost crypto demand. “ Trustees have been crying out for institutional-grade infrastructure that doesn’t compromise on compliance or security. That’s exactly what we’ve built,” said Kate Cooper , CEO of OKX Australia. “ The stats show a significant increase in digital asset allocations, which is why OKX has decided to launch an SMSF platform with infrastructure and reporting tools that trustees can use.” Cooper added that OKX consulted trustees and pension industry professionals while developing the products, identifying uncertainty about crypto and operational complexity as barriers to adoption. Crypto allocation into SMSF is just around $1.11B, but OKX believes the sector has the ability to grow. In the summer of 2025, Australia also admitted BTC as a potential mortgage collateral asset. Younger investors may boost crypto SMSF The OKX offer arrives at a time of generational changes in investment. Currently, SMSF are mostly used by older investors. However, the ability to self-select a portfolio coincides with Millennial trends of actively picking assets. The 25-35 year cohort of Australian investors have more widespread crypto ownership, with 53% holding at least some crypto. While not formally part of retirement portfolios, crypto has been used for its significant upside. However, in the past year, the share of crypto in SMSF fell by around 4%. OKX aims to boost convenience and reporting, allowing SMSF to tap the rapid crypto expansion. SMSF creation has been touted by Australian influencers, though the process was shown to be complicated, requiring special knowledge. OKX aims to bring all everything into one app, for a simplified tool to acquire and track crypto assets. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

With almost $3.6 million raised and over 265 million tokens sold through explosive presale momentum, this revolutionary AI project is capturing institutional attention as the breakthrough opportunity that deserves a place in every serious crypto portfolio. As sophisticated investors recognize the transformative potential within the creator economy, Ruvi AI stands positioned to deliver the kind of sustained growth that makes it an essential complement to traditional blockchain investments. Expert Consensus: Ruvi AI Deserves Portfolio Inclusion What makes experts so confident about Ruvi AI’s must-have status alongside Cardano is the project’s strategic approach to building institutional credibility while targeting explosive market opportunities. The foundation was established through a comprehensive security audit conducted by CyberScope , a respected third-party auditing firm that thoroughly examined smart contracts and eliminated technical vulnerabilities, providing the institutional-grade security validation that sophisticated investors demand. This professional credibility proved crucial when Ruvi AI secured its strategic listing on CoinMarketCap , the world’s most trusted cryptocurrency data platform. The listing triggered unprecedented recognition across the crypto community, generating remarkable metrics that explain why experts view it as a portfolio essential: Almost $3.6M raised demonstrating serious institutional backing and investor confidence Over 265M tokens sold showcasing unprecedented demand across global markets A holder base surpassing 3,500 investors with exponential growth patterns that signal mainstream adoption potential These figures represent organic institutional adoption that cryptocurrency veterans recognize as the foundation for sustained appreciation, establishing clear pathways to the $1 valuation target through genuine technological innovation rather than speculative hype. Revolutionary Creator Economy Focus Sets New Standard The must-have status stems from Ruvi AI’s strategic positioning within the explosive $104 billion creator economy through its comprehensive super app ecosystem. While traditional cryptocurrencies like Cardano focus on blockchain infrastructure, Ruvi AI addresses immediate market needs by revolutionizing how millions of content creators produce and monetize their work. Advanced Trend Research capabilities identify viral topics before mainstream adoption, giving content creators competitive advantages where timing directly impacts earnings potential. AI-Powered Script Generation creates platform-optimized content for YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram that maximizes audience retention while boosting creator revenues exponentially. Native Media Creation tools generate professional-quality images and videos directly within the app, eliminating expensive third-party costs that typically consume creator budgets. Streamlined Workflows centralize planning, editing, and scheduling processes for maximum productivity gains across all major content platforms. This utility-first approach creates immediate value for millions of users worldwide, establishing fundamental demand drivers that support sustained appreciation toward the $1 target while distinguishing Ruvi AI as a must-have investment that complements traditional blockchain projects through real-world application. Phase 3 Launch Creates Strategic Entry Point Following expert endorsements and trending status that validate must-have investment potential, Ruvi AI has entered Phase 3 with unprecedented demand driving tokens at $0.020 . This represents optimal positioning for investors building portfolios alongside established projects like Cardano before automatic price mechanisms advance toward the $1 evaluation target. Phase 4 will bring an automatic 40% price increment , raising the token price to $0.028 . This guaranteed increase creates immediate catalysts that provide substantial returns before broader market recognition drives additional appreciation that experts confidently predict will continue progressing toward the $1 valuation milestone. Strategic Exchange Partnership Validates Growth Trajectory The most significant catalyst supporting the $1 evaluation prediction is Ruvi AI’s strategic partnership with WEEX , a major cryptocurrency exchange. This partnership ensures deep liquidity and professional trading infrastructure while providing institutional-grade market access that accelerates appreciation timelines necessary for reaching ambitious valuation targets. Exchange partnerships create the trading accessibility and institutional validation necessary for sustained growth toward premium valuations, providing market infrastructure that supports the kind of appreciation patterns that justify must-have portfolio inclusion alongside established cryptocurrencies. VIP Program Creates Mathematical Pathways to $1 Target The $1 evaluation potential gains mathematical precision through Ruvi AI’s structured VIP program, demonstrating clear pathways to extraordinary returns that justify must-have status: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment) : Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment) : Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment) : Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . Beyond structured returns, the competitive leaderboard giveaway system rewards active community members with additional tokens and exclusive benefits, creating viral engagement that amplifies momentum while building the foundation for sustained appreciation toward the $1 target. The Must-Have Addition to Crypto Portfolios The convergence of expert endorsements, trending status, almost $3.6 million raised, over 265 million tokens sold, professional audit validation, and major exchange partnership creates conditions where Ruvi AI emerges as a must-have investment alongside established projects like Cardano. With institutional backing through the WEEX partnership and a rapidly expanding holder base surpassing 3,500 investors, this AI project exhibits the characteristics that justify confident expert predictions of reaching the $1 evaluation milestone.

Upbit has officially announced the highly anticipated Upbit ZKC listing , opening up new trading avenues for investors. This significant development allows traders to access ZKC against the South Korean Won (KRW), Bitcoin (BTC), and Tether (USDT, a stablecoin), starting today at 2:00 p.m. UTC. What is ZKC and Why is the Upbit ZKC Listing Important? ZKC, often associated with Zero-Knowledge Cryptography, represents a new frontier in blockchain technology, focusing on privacy and scalability. While specific details about this particular ZKC project are emerging, its core appeal typically lies in enhancing transaction security and efficiency without revealing underlying data. The Upbit ZKC listing is a monumental event for several reasons. Upbit is one of the largest and most influential exchanges in South Korea, a country with a highly active and sophisticated crypto trading community. A listing on such a prominent platform instantly boosts a token’s visibility, liquidity, and perceived legitimacy. This move by Upbit signifies a growing interest in privacy-focused or advanced cryptographic projects within mainstream markets. Navigating the New Trading Pairs on Upbit Traders now have three distinct options for engaging with ZKC on Upbit, catering to different strategies and preferences: ZKC/KRW: This pair offers direct access for South Korean investors, simplifying transactions without needing an intermediate cryptocurrency. It is often the most liquid pair on Korean exchanges. ZKC/BTC: For those who primarily hold Bitcoin, this pair allows for direct exchange, linking ZKC’s performance to the broader crypto market’s benchmark asset. ZKC/USDT: Trading against USDT provides a stable benchmark, as USDT is pegged to the US Dollar. This pair is popular for managing volatility and locking in profits or losses without converting back to fiat immediately. Understanding these pairs is crucial for strategic trading. Each offers unique advantages depending on market conditions and individual investment goals. The availability of multiple pairs broadens the appeal and accessibility of ZKC to a wider range of participants. Potential Market Impact and Investor Outlook Historically, new listings on major exchanges like Upbit can lead to significant price volatility for the newly listed asset.

Despite recent macro headlines and an altcoin rally that has stolen some spotlight, price action suggests the number one cryptocurrency is stuck in a distribution phase rather than building momentum for another push up the charts. Whale Sell-Off and Market Dynamics On September 14, pseudonymous market watcher Doctor Profit published a detailed analysis on X showing that the current price band between $115,000 and $125,000 represents a critical profit-taking zone for major holders. According to him, in the last 30 days, big holders had offloaded as much as 116,000 BTC, worth around $13 billion, marking the largest whale sell-off since July 2022. His analysis also showed that spot Bitcoin ETF inflows have cooled to just 500 BTC per day, a sharp drop from peak levels recorded in late July and early August. This dip in demand, coupled with the increased selling pressure from big holders, explains the OG cryptocurrency’s inability to break out decisively. Without steady institutional absorption, the supply glut has weighed on momentum, causing BTC’s value to mostly move laterally. Doctor Profit’s assessment comes even as geopolitical noise failed to rattle markets. Over the weekend, Bitcoin held firm around $116,000 despite U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats of steep tariffs on China and calls for harsher sanctions on Russia. Historically, such remarks have jolted markets, yet this time BTC barely flinched, suggesting traders could be more focused on liquidity zones than politics. September Trends and Price Outlook Despite its stagnation, Bitcoin is up over 8% in the last two weeks, per CoinGecko, trading at $116,514 as of this writing. If that performance continues deeper into the month, it could extend a rare three-year streak of positive Septembers, breaking away from a long-standing seasonal pattern where seven of the previous eleven Septembers ended in the red. The asset has also climbed 5% in the last week and maintains a 93.7% superiority in its price from a year ago. However, it is slightly down 1.1% across the past 30 days, and only gained 0.4% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, trading has stayed range-bound between $110,870 and $116,705 over the past seven days, with $115,000 acting as a pivot point. Its market capitalization stands at $2.32 trillion, but funds seem to be shifting into altcoins, with meme coins such as PEPE and DOGE posting double-digit weekend gains, to help drive down Bitcoin’s dominance to 55.7%.

Is Ethereum Classic A Good Investment? Ethereum Classic has long been a more affordable alternative to ETH. With Ether transitioning to a Proof-of-Stake model, those favoring Proof-of-Work networks could shift their interest to Ethereum Classic. Despite an increase in value in 2023, Ethereum Classic did not meet market expectations, signaling potential concerns. However, Ethereum Classic is not viewed as an unregistered security, which is positive for its market standing. As a result, ETC is a good investment option in the long term. Why is the ETC Price down today? Following the overall selling pressure in the market, ETC price triggered strong decline and dropped toward $20. Will ETC Recover? If buyers defend the immediate support at $20, we might see a strong recovery toward $30. Will ETC Price Reach $100? ETC price might soon reach the $100 mark in 2028 if the buying demand continues to surge and Ethereum Classic attracts altcoin investors. Will ETC Price Reach $1000? Due to the effort of the Ethereum community, Ethereum Classic Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is currently no indication that the Ethereum Classic (ETC) Coin will reach $1000 in the near future, which is a long-term target. Is ETC a Good Long-Term Investment? ETC has gained popularity thanks to strong community support. However, it’s crucial to conduct thorough research into their long-term potential to determine if it represents a viable long-term investment. Recent ETC News/Opinions The ETC hashrate has more than doubled, skyrocketing from 127TH to over 259TH, and peaking at over 300 Terrahashes in April of this year.

In a blog post published Sunday on Notion, Nemo revealed a three-step recovery plan based on the issuance of NEOM debt tokens. The program is meant to return value to victims over time through a dedicated redemption pool funded by recovered assets, liquidity loans, and investments. Users will receive NEOM tokens pegged 1:1 to the value of their losses in USD terms, based on an onchain snapshot taken when the protocol was paused. “ While we would have preferred to reimburse everyone directly in USD, we do not have sufficient funds or capital raised to do so, which is why we adopted the debt token strategy as the most viable path forward ,” the yield trading protocol team wrote. Nemo protocol issues three-step recovery path The first phase of the recovery plan will see users reclaim the residual value left in compromised pools through a one-click function. The assets will be transferred into new, multi-audited smart contracts managed jointly by Nemo and its partners. The second phase is the distribution of NEOM tokens, where, after completing the migration process, victims will simultaneously receive debt tokens equivalent to their losses. For example, a $1 loss translates to one NEOM token. The last phase gives them choices of how to handle their NEOM. Those affected by the hack can immediately exit through automated market makers or hodl the tokens while awaiting recovery from frozen or reclaimed funds. Nemo has also launched a dedicated portal to support affected users, a one-stop module with three main features, including eligibility and loss display. Once a user connects their wallet, the system automatically identifies positions on all affected pools and displays three figures: original asset value, residual value, and total loss. Another is a one-click claim tool, where users can transfer all residual liquidity provider tokens and yield tokens into secure contract pools with a single confirmation. Last but not least is the NEOM claim module, which shows the exact number of debt tokens allocated to each user based on their total loss and an option to “claim NEOM.” Nemo exploiter took advantage of flawed smart contract According to a post-mortem report from Nemo, a malicious actor used a flaw in Nemo’s smart contract design to execute the hack. Blockchain security company PeckShield reported that the attacker stole Circle’s USDC stablecoin, bridging the tokens from Arbitrum to Ether before dispersing them through several laundering addresses. On the protocol’s smart contract lies a flaw lay function which helps the trading platform reduce slippage. The code, called “get_sy_amount_in_for_exact_py_out,” was added onchain in January without the necessary audit from smart contract firm Asymptotic. Even when an upgrade was installed in April to tighten deployment checks, the vulnerable code had already been embedded in production. The attacker initiated cross-chain transfers at 16:10 UTC on September 7 via Wormhole’s Circle cross-chain transfer protocol (CCTP). In total, $2.59 million of Nemo’s funds was rapidly siphoned using flash loans from pools including sUSDC, sbUSDT, and sSUI. Asymptotic’s team identified the vulnerability in a preliminary report delivered to Nemo on August 11. However, the platform conceded that it failed to address the issue in time before attackers found the loophole. After releasing a full prognosis of the exploit, Nemo has been coordinating with blockchain security teams and centralized exchanges (CEXs) to freeze stolen assets. Get seen where it counts.

This move, involving millions of dollars, naturally sparks curiosity and speculation across the market. What does such a large sale mean for the future of Bitcoin, and how might it impact other investors? What Does an Early Bitcoin Holder ‘s Massive Sale Entail? In a move that has captured the attention of market watchers, an anonymous early-era Bitcoin holder recently liquidated a substantial portion of their holdings. According to insights shared by crypto market analyst Maartunn, this individual sold 1,175 BTC. The total value of this transaction stood at approximately $135 million, all within a 24-hour window. Despite this massive sale, it is important to note the sheer scale of this investor’s portfolio. The analyst’s report highlights that this particular Bitcoin holder still maintains a significant balance of 49,674 BTC. This indicates that while the sale was large, it represents only a fraction of their overall assets. Why Do These Large Bitcoin Holder Movements Grab Attention? Such substantial transactions from early Bitcoin holders , often referred to as ‘whales,’ are always closely watched. Their movements can influence market sentiment and price action due to the sheer volume of assets they control. When a whale sells a large amount of Bitcoin, it can increase supply on exchanges, potentially leading to downward price pressure. Conversely, when whales accumulate, it can signal confidence and potentially drive prices higher. The market often interprets these actions as indicators of broader trends or shifts in investor confidence. Understanding the motives behind these sales is crucial for other investors. Potential reasons for such a significant sale by an early Bitcoin holder include: Profit-Taking: After years of holding, cashing out a portion of gains is a common strategy. Portfolio Rebalancing: Shifting assets into other cryptocurrencies or traditional investments. Liquidity Needs: Covering large personal or business expenses. Market Outlook: A belief that the market might face a downturn, prompting a strategic exit. What Are the Potential Market Implications for Bitcoin Holders ? A sale of this magnitude can indeed create short-term volatility. When such a large amount of Bitcoin enters the market, it can trigger a supply shock, causing a temporary dip in price. However, it’s also important to consider the broader context. Bitcoin’s market capitalization is enormous, and while $135 million is a substantial sum, the market often absorbs such sales without long-term damage. For individual Bitcoin holders , this event serves as a reminder of market dynamics. It underscores the importance of not reacting impulsively to single news events. Instead, a well-researched, long-term strategy often proves more resilient. Here are some actionable insights for navigating such news: Stay Informed: Understand the source and context of the news. Avoid Panic Selling: Large sales don’t always signify a market collapse. Review Your Strategy: Ensure your investment plan aligns with your risk tolerance and goals. Look at On-Chain Data: Tools and analysts often provide deeper insights into whale movements. The Enduring Saga of the Early Bitcoin Holder This recent sale by an early Bitcoin holder is another chapter in the ongoing narrative of the cryptocurrency market. It highlights the immense wealth created by Bitcoin and the significant influence that long-term, large-scale investors can wield. While the immediate impact might lead to some market jitters, it also showcases Bitcoin’s liquidity and its ability to facilitate such massive transfers. For those deeply invested in the crypto space, observing these ‘whale’ movements remains a critical part of understanding market sentiment and potential future trends. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is this early Bitcoin holder? A: The identity of the early Bitcoin holder remains anonymous. Crypto market analysts track wallet movements to identify such large transactions without revealing personal details. Q2: What is the significance of this $135M Bitcoin sale? A: The significance lies in its size and the potential impact on market sentiment. Large sales from early holders can sometimes signal profit-taking or a shift in market outlook, leading to short-term price volatility. Q3: How does whale activity affect Bitcoin’s price? A: Whale activity can affect Bitcoin’s price by increasing or decreasing the available supply on exchanges. Large sales can exert downward pressure, while significant purchases can drive prices up, often influencing broader market sentiment. Q4: Should I be concerned as a Bitcoin holder about such sales? A: While large sales can cause temporary market fluctuations, it’s generally advisable for individual Bitcoin holders to focus on their long-term investment strategy rather than reacting to every single whale movement. Bitcoin’s market is robust enough to absorb such transactions. Q5: What are common reasons for large BTC sales by early investors? A: Common reasons include profit-taking after significant gains, portfolio diversification or rebalancing, fulfilling large personal or business liquidity needs, or a strategic decision based on their market outlook.

In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $100K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Click to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its goal – to bring Bitcoin’s blockchain to modern standards. This means compatibility with dApps, smart contracts, and seamless DeFi programmability for developers. The L2 will run on a Canonical Bridge, combined with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), for native compatibility with Solana. You’ll be able to build token programs, LP logic, oracles, games, NFT infrastructure, DAOs, and much more. All without reinventing the wheel. To engage with the L2, you’ll deposit $BTC to a designated address monitored by the Canonical Bridge. The Relay Program verifies the details, and then mints an equivalent number of wrapped $BTC on the L2. You can also withdraw your original $BTC at any time.

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis We highlighted last week how Bitcoin’s latest rally is coming after an important breakout from the $113K level. And now, the token is doing what many experts believe sets it up nicely for its next leg up – $BTC is now giving a healthy pullback. Alt text: $BTC taking a potential breather after its recent 5%+ rally On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin has pulled back to the 20 EMA. It’s worth noting, though, that the token has already tried to use the 20 EMA as support once, but it failed to do so. That’s why we believe this breather could be even deeper, with Bitcoin reaching for at least the 10 EMA ($114K) on the daily chart. The other thing to watch out for is that the $117K level is also an important resistance. But given crypto’s current momentum, Bitcoin should be able to breeze past it, following which it’ll have the opportunity to reclaim its ATH. Institutions Now Hold 12.3% of All Bitcoin as Bitcoin Hyper Presale Nears $16M Raised September 15, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Bitcoin macro strategy firm Ecoinometrics said that funds and public companies now hold 12.3% of the total Bitcoin ($BTC) supply . With the number of $BTC capped at 21M coins, institutional holdings translate to roughly 2.6M $BTC. Among Bitcoin treasuries, Michael Saylor’s Strategy leads the pack with 638,460 $BTC, mainly due to its consistent purchases. In September alone, the company acquired 6,003 $BTC . Metaplanet also owns 20,136 $BTC , which allowed it to overtake Riot Platforms Inc as number six in the top Bitcoin treasuries. Institutional demand has helped push Bitcoin’s price, helping it reach a new $124K ATH in August. $BTC’s continued dominance in the market should help boost related projects such as Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , which aims to develop a Bitcoin Layer 2. When launched, the L2 will make Bitcoin transactions faster and cheaper while expanding $BTC’s utility with staking, dApps, and smart contracts. The presale has over $16M, with whales rushing to buy in. You can learn more about the project in our ‘What is Bitcoin Hyper ’ page. Michael Saylor Says Bitcoin is More Interesting Than Mag 7, Bitcoin Hyper’s Presale Jumps $16M September 15, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Michael Saylor believes Bitcoin is more interesting than the Magnificent 7. His X post garnered a lot of attention, so he followed it up with another post, this time highlighting Strategy’s annualized returns , putting things into perspective. At 91% annualized returns, MSTR demolished the Mag 7 competition. Alt text – Strategy’s annualized returns compared to the Mag 7 Strategy is the largest Bitcoin holder in the world with 636,460 $BTC, valued at over $74B. Saylor’s posts come just as Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) presale broke $16M, following a sustained growth since the very beginning.

51759115,https://timestabloid.com/?p=83174,1757930448,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Next Big Cryptocurrency? Analysts Say Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Could Outperform Pepe (PEPE) This Year,https://timestabloid.com/next-big-cryptocurrency-analysts-say-mutuum-finance-mutm/,"In crypto, two very different categories of tokens compete for investor attention: meme coins and utility-driven DeFi protocols. On the meme side, Pepe (PEPE) has captured headlines with massive community-driven rallies and a valuation that now places it firmly among the top meme assets. On the other side, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , priced at just $0.035, yet analysts say it could be the breakout DeFi project of 2025. The contrast between the two highlights an important investor choice: chase hype and volatility, or position early in a project with real structural demand. What PEPE Has Delivered & Where It Hits Limits Pepe (PEPE) has been one of the more successful meme coins to emerge in recent cycles. Currently trading around $0.0000106, with a market cap in the range of $4.3–$4.5 billion, it has attracted an enormous following. Trading volume has consistently ranked high among meme coins, and its appeal lies in the simplicity of the brand: a cultural icon turned speculative asset. However, the same factors that drove PEPE’s meteoric rise now impose limits. The supply is astronomical, over 420 trillion tokens are in circulation, which means price appreciation is capped by sheer token volume. While sharp rallies are possible when meme sentiment returns, the absence of utility makes sustained growth harder to justify. With competitors like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu still commanding larger communities, PEPE must continuously rely on market mood rather than functional adoption. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is building a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol with features tailored for sustainability, and investors are taking notice. Currently in Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035, the project has already raised more than $15.75 million, attracted over 16,280 holders, and sold more than 710 million tokens. MUTM will debut with its beta platform live from day one, allowing users to lend, borrow, and act as liquidators immediately. This instant utility means adoption begins the moment trading opens. The platform’s dual-lending markets mix protocol-to-contract (P2C) liquidity with pooled peer-to-peer (P2P) dynamics. Interest rates adjust based on utilization: when capital is abundant, borrowing costs drop, encouraging activity; when liquidity is scarce, rates rise, attracting deposits and repayments. For borrowers seeking predictability, stable-rate options provide repayment certainty, with rebalance safeguards to keep the protocol solvent. Depositors are rewarded with mtTokens, yield-bearing assets that accrue interest in real time while remaining liquid and transferable. This design keeps liquidity active across DeFi and allows users to earn passive income without locking up funds. On top of that, a buy-and-distribute mechanism channels a portion of protocol fees into purchasing MUTM on the open market, embedding structural buy pressure into the token’s very design. What a Return Could Look Like For investors, the difference between PEPE and MUTM becomes clearer when looking at potential outcomes. A $675 investment in PEPE at its current price of $0.0000106 would secure a massive number of tokens. If PEPE were to climb by just 25%, a more realistic assumption given its multi-billion-dollar market cap, that position would be worth about $844. While respectable, it reflects the difficulty high-cap meme assets face in delivering transformative gains, as even modest growth requires billions in fresh capital inflows. Now compare that to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). A $675 investment in MUTM at $0.035 would already grow to about $1,160 at launch when the token lists at $0.06. When adoption pushes it into the $0.25–$0.50 range within its first months, a target analysts view as reasonable given presale momentum and the beta platform going live, the same stake could climb to between $4,800 and $9,600. This stark contrast illustrates why analysts argue MUTM offers the kind of early-stage asymmetry that meme coins like PEPE, constrained by their size, can no longer replicate. Feature-Driven Growth Paths These mechanics paint a very different picture from PEPE. While PEPE depends almost entirely on cultural momentum and community memes, Mutuum Finance ties token demand to functional activity. Every loan, deposit, and repayment creates flow within the system. Every transaction helps generate demand for MUTM. This is why analysts believe that, while PEPE may continue to thrive as a speculative trade during meme coin cycles, its growth ceiling is limited. Mutuum Finance, on the other hand, is still priced in cents with utility that directly supports expansion. Its roadmap includes a stablecoin, designed to deepen liquidity and anchor borrowing flows, as well as Layer-2 integration, which will reduce costs and scale adoption. Each of these milestones directly increases demand for MUTM, creating a roadmap-driven growth curve that meme coins cannot match. Meme vs. Mechanics Pepe (PEPE) has shown what meme-driven communities can achieve, but its lack of utility and massive supply make future exponential gains far more difficult. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), on the other hand, is still in presale with structural mechanics designed to support demand from the very beginning. With a live beta platform at launch, dual-lending markets, mtTokens, and buy-and-distribute dynamics, MUTM is set up not just to list, but to grow. For investors weighing where to allocate capital this year, the comparison is clear. PEPE may provide entertainment and short bursts of volatility, but MUTM offers a chance to enter early in a protocol where every feature is tied to demand. With presale tokens moving quickly at $0.035 and the next phase set to raise the price by nearly 20%, the question for investors is simple: buy now at a discount, or pay a premium later when adoption and whale inflows push the token higher?

BALE’s statement adds to ongoing discussions around XRP’s potential trajectory in the evolving digital asset market, where both technical analysis and institutional involvement remain central themes. $XRP is going to print the largest green candle in the crypto history, hands down. pic.twitter.com/GEhvSQSeys — BALE (@AltcoinBale) September 14, 2025 Reactions from the Community Following BALE’s post, several members of the XRP community offered their perspectives. Vincent expressed skepticism, stating that such a surge would not be achievable with the current retail investor base. He argued that major institutional money and sustained buying pressure would be required, adding that retail investors tend to sell too early, creating what he described as a cycle of “penny flipping” that limits market momentum. According to Vincent, retail participation alone does not move markets on the scale suggested by BALE. Another response came from X Finance Bull, who took a more measured stance. He remarked , “Let’s see how the fundamentals line up, price follows conviction.” His statement highlighted the importance of underlying factors such as adoption , utility, and market structure, suggesting that any major price surge must be supported by fundamentals rather than speculation alone. GC offered a more philosophical response, disagreeing with BALE’s outlook by suggesting that two green candles, rather than one, would be necessary to reach such historic gains. He emphasized liquidity and market dynamics as the critical drivers of price movement, stating, “Liquidity + market = price. Without that, there’s no moonshot.” GC then expanded with a more lighthearted comment, equating patience to enjoying wine, and noting that the eventual breakthrough for XRP will come when the right conditions align. Adding a different perspective, RM Irish XRP pointed to short-term volatility. He noted that XRP had recently dropped from $3.18, which it had touched the previous day, to $3.02 at the time of his comment. This remark highlighted the immediate challenges facing XRP in maintaining upward momentum, even as broader discussions focused on long-term potential.

However, responses from other enthusiasts emphasized the necessity of institutional participation, strong fundamentals, and liquidity. While some expressed optimism tempered with patience, others highlighted the immediate realities of price fluctuations. XRP remains a central subject of debate in the digital asset sector, with its market trajectory influenced by institutional adoption, regulatory developments, and global financial integration. Predictions such as BALE’s capture attention, but the varied responses demonstrate the wide range of views held within the community. Whether XRP achieves such a record-breaking movement will depend on how these market factors develop in the months ahead.

Whale Alert, a prominent blockchain tracking service, reported a monumental crypto whale transaction involving 700,000,000 USDT. This staggering sum, valued at approximately $701 million, was transferred from the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Aave to the centralized exchange HTX. Such a significant shift in capital often sparks questions and speculation among investors and market watchers alike. What Exactly Happened in This Crypto Whale Transaction? On a recent day, the blockchain registered an enormous transfer that sent ripples through the crypto community. A single address initiated the movement of 700 million Tether (USDT), a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, from Aave to HTX. This isn’t just a large transfer; it represents a substantial repositioning of funds by a major player, commonly referred to as a ‘whale’ in crypto circles. Aave: A leading decentralized lending and borrowing protocol, where users can deposit crypto to earn interest or borrow against their holdings. HTX (formerly Huobi): A well-established centralized cryptocurrency exchange, offering a wide range of trading services. The sheer volume of this particular crypto whale transaction makes it noteworthy, suggesting a strategic move rather than a routine operation. Why Do Such Massive Transfers Occur? Understanding the motivation behind such a significant transfer is key to interpreting its potential impact. Whales move large sums for various reasons, and each move can signal different intentions. When funds leave a DeFi protocol like Aave for a centralized exchange like HTX, several possibilities emerge: Profit-Taking or De-Risking: The whale might be looking to cash out some of their holdings, convert them to fiat currency, or reduce their exposure to DeFi risks. Arbitrage Opportunities: They could be preparing to capitalize on price discrepancies for other assets between HTX and other platforms. Increased Trading Activity: Moving funds to an exchange often precedes a period of active trading, either buying or selling other cryptocurrencies. Strategic Rebalancing: The whale might be rebalancing their portfolio, shifting capital from one investment strategy to another. Each crypto whale transaction is unique, and its true purpose can only be inferred from subsequent market actions. Understanding the Implications of This Crypto Whale Transaction A transfer of this magnitude can have several implications for the broader crypto market. While it doesn’t automatically mean a market crash or pump, it’s a data point that analysts carefully consider. The shift from a DeFi protocol to a CEX highlights the ongoing interplay between these two fundamental pillars of the crypto ecosystem. DeFi Liquidity Impact: While 700M USDT is significant, Aave’s total value locked (TVL) is substantial, so this transfer might not drastically impact its overall liquidity. However, it’s a withdrawal from the DeFi ecosystem. Exchange Activity: The influx of such a large amount of USDT into HTX could potentially increase liquidity on the exchange, making it easier for large trades to execute. Market Sentiment: Depending on subsequent actions, this crypto whale transaction could influence market sentiment, especially if it leads to significant buying or selling pressure for other assets. It underscores the power of large holders to influence market dynamics, even with stablecoins. What Does This Mean for You as an Investor? For the average investor, tracking such massive movements can offer valuable insights, though it’s crucial not to overreact to single events. Whale movements are just one piece of the complex market puzzle. Here are some actionable takeaways: Stay Informed: Services like Whale Alert provide transparency into large transactions. Monitoring these can help you understand potential shifts in market sentiment. Diversify Your Portfolio: Relying too heavily on a single asset or strategy can be risky. Diversification helps mitigate the impact of individual large transactions. Understand the Fundamentals: Always research the underlying technology and use cases of the cryptocurrencies you invest in, rather than solely relying on whale movements. Exercise Caution: While exciting, these large transfers don’t always predict market direction. Always conduct your own research before making investment decisions. Observing a crypto whale transaction should be part of a broader, well-informed investment strategy. The transfer of 700 million USDT from Aave to HTX is a powerful reminder of the dynamic and often opaque nature of the cryptocurrency markets. It highlights the significant capital held by whales and their potential influence on liquidity and sentiment across both decentralized and centralized platforms. While the immediate implications of this specific move remain to unfold, it undoubtedly serves as a key indicator for market participants to watch closely. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a crypto whale transaction? A crypto whale transaction refers to the movement of an exceptionally large amount of cryptocurrency by a single individual or entity, often termed a ‘whale.’ These transactions are significant enough to potentially impact market prices or liquidity. Q2: Why is the transfer of USDT important? USDT (Tether) is a stablecoin, meaning its value is pegged to the US dollar. Large transfers of USDT often indicate a whale preparing to enter or exit positions in other cryptocurrencies, or seeking to consolidate funds for various strategic reasons, as it acts as a primary trading pair on exchanges. Q3: What is the difference between Aave and HTX in this context? Aave is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol where users can lend, borrow, and earn interest on crypto assets without intermediaries. HTX (formerly Huobi) is a centralized exchange (CEX) where users trade cryptocurrencies through a trusted third party. Moving funds from Aave to HTX typically means shifting from a DeFi lending position to an exchange for trading or withdrawal. Q4: Does this massive transfer mean the market will crash? Not necessarily. While a large crypto whale transaction can signal potential market shifts, it does not automatically guarantee a crash or a pump. Whales move funds for many reasons, including rebalancing portfolios, seeking arbitrage, or preparing for new investments. It’s one data point among many. Q5: How can I track crypto whale transactions? You can track crypto whale transactions using blockchain explorers and specialized services like Whale Alert, which monitor and report large movements of cryptocurrencies across various networks and platforms. These services provide real-time updates on significant transfers. Did you find this analysis of the massive crypto whale transaction insightful?

This saw the project raise over $16M on its ongoing fundraiser. As a Layer 2 project, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has the potential to transform the Bitcoin ecosystem and make transactions faster and cheaper, while expanding $BTC’s utility. Bitcoin’s Need for Speed, Low-Cost and Flexibility Bitcoin ($BTC) has been changing the world of finance ever since its launch in 2009. While initially seen as a highly speculative and risky investment, it has gained legitimacy among institutions. In fact, funds and public companies now own roughly 12.3% of all bitcoins . With the amount of $BTC capped at 21M, that translates to about 2.5M owned by these organizations. Yet, despite all the buzz, Bitcoin has a few drawbacks. The chain’s simplified script makes Bitcoin one of the most secure cryptocurrencies. However, it limits Bitcoin from being used in more advanced applications, such as smart contracts, dApps, DeFi protocols, and NFTs. What’s more, the chain can only handle up to seven transactions per second (TPS) . In contrast, popular chains like Ethereum and Solana can handle up to 119.1 TPS and 65K TPS, respectively. This leads to congestion, which in turn makes Bitcoin transactions expensive. Bitcoin Hyper to the Rescue While updating Bitcoin’s code could make it faster and more scalable, this would come at the cost of its security. This reluctance to fiddle with Bitcoin’s base layer may be why investors are looking to Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) for an alternative solution. Bitcoin Hyper aims to create a Bitcoin Layer 2. This will serve as a fast lane to Bitcoin’s congested highway. By bringing your $BTC over to the L2, you’ll be able to enjoy faster and cheaper transactions, and use your sats for staking, interacting with dApps, and other applications. Here’s how the L2 will work once launched: For a complete lowdown on the project, be sure to check out our ‘What is Bitcoin Hyper?’ page. Here, we’ll cover everything from its tokenomics to community sentiment to help you decide if this is the presale for you. Unlocking Bitcoin Hyper’s Benefits with the $HYPER Token Powering Bitcoin Hyper is its native $HYPER tokens. Investor interest in this presale is rising, with whale buys worth over $64K pouring in this weekend, sending the total raise to over $16M. When the L2 launches, holders can use $HYPER for gas fees. They’ll also enjoy exclusive features and governance rights. At the moment, you can buy tokens at the official Bitcoin Hyper presale page or via the Best Wallet app . If you’re on the website, simply connect your crypto wallet to the presale widget, and then buy $HYPER using your credit/debit card or crypto. There’s less than two days left until the next price increase, though, so it’s best to act quickly. Staking your tokens is another option if you want to earn passive rewards. In return, you’ll receive 71% p.a. in staking rewards. For more information on joining the presale, check out our page on how to buy Bitcoin Hyper . If you feel like you’ve missed your chance with Bitcoin, the good news is that Bitcoin Hyper could be the next best thing. According to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction , $HYPER has the potential to reach as much as $1.50 by 2030. Things can get even better when Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) launches, as its Layer 2 can potentially turbocharge the Bitcoin ecosystem just as adoption swells to new highs.

New data from CoinShares reveals that digital asset funds experienced an astounding $3.3 billion in net inflows last week. This significant surge signals a robust and undeniable institutional interest in the crypto market, pushing total assets under management (AUM) closer to an all-time high. What does this mean for the future of digital finance? Let’s dive in. What’s Driving This Unprecedented Surge in Digital Asset Funds? Last week’s impressive inflows into digital asset funds underscore a powerful shift in investor sentiment. The figures, announced by leading digital asset manager CoinShares, highlight a clear preference for established cryptocurrencies, demonstrating sustained confidence in the sector. Here’s a breakdown of the key figures that caught everyone’s attention: Total Net Inflows: A colossal $3.3 billion flowed into various digital asset investment products. Bitcoin’s Dominance: Bitcoin-related investment products alone attracted a staggering $2.4 billion. This highlights its enduring appeal as the foundational digital asset and a preferred choice for large-scale institutional allocation. Ethereum’s Strong Showing: Ethereum-related products weren’t far behind, securing a substantial $650 million in inflows. This indicates growing confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem and its potential beyond just a store of value. Near All-Time High AUM: The total assets under management (AUM) across all digital asset investment products reached an impressive $239 billion. This figure is remarkably close to the previous peak of $244 billion, which was recorded in early August, signaling a strong market recovery and investor belief. These numbers paint a clear and compelling picture: institutional capital is flowing steadily and confidently into the digital asset space, particularly into major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Why Are Institutional Investors Confidently Choosing Digital Asset Funds? The consistent influx into digital asset funds suggests several powerful underlying factors at play. Investors, ranging from large institutions to sophisticated individual wealth managers, are increasingly recognizing the long-term potential and strategic importance of cryptocurrencies in a diversified portfolio. Several key reasons contribute to this growing confidence and allocation: Maturing Market Structure: The crypto market is evolving rapidly. We are seeing clearer regulatory frameworks emerging in various jurisdictions, which significantly reduces perceived risks for larger, more conservative investors. This regulatory clarity provides a safer environment for institutional engagement. Inflation Hedge Potential: In an era of economic uncertainty and persistent inflation concerns, Bitcoin and other digital assets are increasingly viewed as potential hedges. They offer an alternative to traditional assets, providing a store of value that isn’t directly tied to fiat currency fluctuations. Diversification Benefits: Adding digital assets to a traditional investment portfolio can offer valuable diversification benefits. Their low correlation with traditional asset classes can potentially enhance overall portfolio returns and provide better risk management. Enhanced Accessibility: The proliferation of investment products like Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and trusts makes it considerably easier for institutions to gain exposure to crypto without the complexities of directly holding, securing, or managing the underlying assets. This simplification aids compliance and operational efficiency. This growing acceptance and integration is a powerful testament to the digital asset sector’s journey towards mainstream financial legitimacy and broader adoption. Navigating the Future: Opportunities and Considerations for Digital Asset Funds While the recent, significant inflows into digital asset funds are overwhelmingly positive and indicative of a robust market, it’s crucial to consider the broader landscape. The market, though maturing rapidly, still presents unique dynamics and considerations for all participants. For those looking to engage with digital asset investments or simply understand the market better, here are some actionable insights and considerations: Stay Informed with Reputable Sources: Regularly follow comprehensive reports from trusted entities like CoinShares to understand current market sentiment, capital flow trends, and emerging opportunities. Understand Inherent Volatility: Despite increasing institutional adoption, cryptocurrencies can still exhibit significant price volatility. A well-researched and balanced approach to investment, aligned with individual risk tolerance, is always paramount. Explore Diversification Beyond the Big Two: While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate, the broader digital asset ecosystem offers a wealth of innovation. Consider exploring a diversified portfolio within digital assets to capture growth from various sectors. Monitor Regulatory Developments Closely: Keep a keen eye on global regulatory changes. These developments can significantly impact the accessibility, operational structure, and overall perception of digital asset funds and the underlying assets. The journey of digital assets into the mainstream financial system is dynamic and ongoing, marked by both exciting opportunities and necessary, continuous considerations for prudent investors. The remarkable $3.3 billion net inflow into digital asset funds last week is an undeniable and powerful indicator of the growing confidence among institutional investors. With Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the charge, and total AUM nearing historic highs, the digital asset market continues its impressive ascent. This trend highlights not just the increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class, but also their evolving and crucial role in modern investment portfolios. As the market matures and integrates further, digital asset funds are becoming an indispensable part of the global financial landscape, offering compelling and transformative prospects for the future of finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are digital asset funds? A: Digital asset funds are investment vehicles that allow individuals and institutions to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies and other digital assets without directly purchasing and holding them. They are managed by professional firms and often invest in a diversified portfolio of digital assets. Q2: Which cryptocurrencies saw the most significant inflows last week? A: According to CoinShares, Bitcoin-related investment products attracted the largest share, with $2.4 billion in inflows. Ethereum-related products also saw substantial interest, bringing in $650 million. Q3: What does this surge in inflows mean for the broader crypto market? A: A significant surge in inflows, especially from institutional investors, typically indicates growing confidence and a positive market sentiment. It suggests that major players are increasingly integrating digital assets into their portfolios, potentially signaling long-term growth and stability for the crypto market. Q4: Is now a good time to invest in digital asset funds? A: While recent inflows are positive, investment decisions should always align with individual financial goals and risk tolerance. The crypto market can be volatile. It is advisable to conduct thorough research and consider consulting a financial advisor before making any investment. Q5: How do digital asset funds differ from directly buying cryptocurrencies? A: Digital asset funds offer a more regulated and often simpler way to invest, as they handle the complexities of custody, security, and compliance. Directly buying cryptocurrencies gives you direct ownership and control but requires managing your own wallets and security, which can be more complex for some investors.

But the structural backdrop – falling rates, institutional positioning, and bullish derivatives markets – suggests there’s still substantial upside ahead. This is likely not the cycle top.” 1/ I’ve seen a lot of FUD that “the music is about to stop”. It is true, some nasty drawdowns may us in the next few weeks. However, I believe the market is bright for the rest of Q4. This is, by no means, “it” for the bull cycle; there’s plenty of gas left in the tank. — Sean | Derive (@SeanNotShorn) September 14, 2025 On average, BTC returns -2.9% in September. This is largely due to natural selling pressure around the US financial year-end, Dawson explains. “We’re already seeing signs of that pressure in the data. I’d argue we’re only halfway through what could be a very powerful Q4 rally.” 3/ ii) Slowing DAT accumulation means a reduction in price momentum for ETH and BTC.

As mNAV has been sliced in the last few weeks, the potential to drive prices has fallen as well. pic.twitter.com/ZOGNwzdDNX — Sean | Derive (@SeanNotShorn) September 14, 2025 Meanwhile, options markets are showing sustained bullish sentiment, Dawson continues. For BTC, open interest is stacked around $140,000, $150,000, $160,000. and $200,000 strikes for the 26 December expiry. Call open interest outnumbers puts nearly 2.5 to 1 (64K vs. 26K). For ETH, there’s a broad spread of bullish strikes from $4,000 to $7,000. “That positioning matters – option boards let us derive the market’s consensus probability of price outcomes,” Dawson writes. “And right now, they’re saying there’s a 40% chance ETH closes above $5,000 by year-end, and 20% chance it settles above $6,000. For BTC, the market gives a 37% probability of $125,000 or higher by the same time.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Friday morning, BTC trades at $116,309. The price moved from the intraday low of $114,915 to the high of $116,689, before slightly correcting to the current point. Looking at the weekly prices, the range from $110,870 to $116,705, meaning that the coin is not far from the intraweek high. The price has been moving to test the $117,500 level. Clearing that would potentially lead it to $119,500, followed by $122,200 and $124,500. However, as the market has turned red, if BTC falls below $114,800, it could move towards the $110,856 level, which is its critical structural floor. Bitcoin Price Chart.

CRCL's business model relies heavily on reserve income from USDC circulation, which is highly vulnerable to declining interest rates. Valuation remains stretched at 58x forward EBITDA and 1.1x reserves. The stock trades more on momentum than fundamentals, with limited upside and significant risks. I upgrade CRCL to 'Hold' for risk-tolerant investors, but caution against entry until valuation multiples become far lower. Shares of Circle Internet Group, Inc. ( CRCL ) are in the midst of a sharp, yet predictable , 46% drawdown. After the maker of the USDC stablecoin has seen its shares surging based on momentum, fundamentals are slowly becoming a bigger part of the story. I argue that the downside has narrowed substantially and that the business is progressing well. However, all valuation angles still point to the downside, and I believe that there's still a misunderstanding of the company's business. Let's dive in. Circle's Perfect 'Memefication' Storm Circle Internet Group, Inc. ( CRCL ), provid er of the USDC stablecoin, went public in early June. This was right when stablecoins became the hottest topic in town, as the GENIUS Act was being passed through Congress. Appealing to the type of investors who follow momentum, the combination of an IPO, positive regulatory developments, and bullish headlines was really the perfect formula for a non-fundamental stock surge. Data by YCharts Indeed, Circle stock surpassed the $240 mark at some point, more than doubling its initial trading price in the span of a few weeks. At the time, I published an article seeking to simplify the company's business model for investors so they can understand there's at least 50% downside to any reasonable valuation metric. Data by YCharts The stock is now down almost 50% since, though still up over 18% from the first trading price, after a 10% recovery from its lows. So, with my downside prediction almost fully exhausted, this would be a good time for an update. First, let's give a quick overview of the business. Please, Learn The Business Model, And Listen To What Circle's Management Is Saying I cannot stress this enough. Investors who buy a stock without understanding how the company generates revenue and what its costs are will almost always lose money. They might get lucky with one investment, but this is not a winning formula in the long term. By investing in companies solely based on momentum, you are likely to be the last one dancing when the music stops. In Circle's case, the business model isn't that complicated either. The company went as far as dedicating a slide in its earnings presentation to explain it: Circle Q2'25 Presentation I wrote in my last article : Over 95% of the company's revenue comes from reserve income. That reserve income is generated from interest paid on its short-term T-bills and other cash-equivalent assets that Circle holds and buys in accordance with USDC creations. The cycle goes in three steps. The customer converts fiat or other forms of cryptocurrency to USDC. Then, Circle or one of its authorized mint partners mints a USDC. Then, Circle purchases a T-bill at the corresponding value to meet the 1:1 reserve needs. Typically, Circle holds a small, non-material surplus. On that reserve income, Circle pays distribution costs to companies like Coinbase ( COIN ) and others, with a calculation that's a bit of a mouthful, but it comes down to roughly 58%-62% of reserve income. They define that as the RLDC margin, or revenue less distribution costs margin. The rest of the revenue is coming from services that rely on USDC. Those include, for example, payment acceptance by companies like Shopify ( SHOP ). Those revenues are similar to those of most fintech businesses. Below the revenue and gross profit lines, Circle has operating expenses like any other company. Let's dive into each of the business metrics in Q2. Business Progressing Well In Q2, As Investors Get More Insight With every new company, it takes time for investors to gain more understanding of the company's business, grow accustomed to its reporting, and familiarize themselves with management. Circle Q2'25 Presentation In Q2, total revenue and reserve income grew 53% Y/Y to $658 revenue, with RLDC margins dropping to 38% as they continue to focus on expanding the network. Other revenue was $24 million, still minuscule relative to reserve income, but growing rapidly. Circle Q2'25 Presentation USDC in circulation reached $61.3 billion as of the end of Q2, up 90% Y/Y, and it's at $72.4 billion as of September 11th. Circle's share of circulation in Q2 reached a record 10%, while Coinbase and others represented 21% and 69%, respectively. The reserve return rate dropped to 4.14% as expectations for rate cuts rise and yields drop. Circle Q2'25 Presentation Looking at profitability, gross profit was $251 million, while operating loss was $325 million, the first on record, as compensation expenses jumped sharply due to vesting RSUs in connection with the IPO. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes these expenses, was $126 million, 19% of total revenue and 50% of gross profit. Circle Q2'25 Presentation Looking ahead, management expects USDC in circulation to continue growing at a 40% CAGR. For 2025, they see other revenue of $75-$85 million, RLDC margins of 36%-38%, and adjusted operating expenses of $475-$490 million. Overall, this was a very good quarter when it comes to growth, with continued strength in circulation growth and the addition of 0.8 million meaningful wallets. Investors will have to remain patient in finding out the company's profitability trajectory, especially as the reserve rate is dropping. Circle Continues To Trade On Momentum Rather Than Fundamentals After learning the business model, I think it's clear that the primary fundamental drivers for Circle's valuation are USDC circulation growth, reserve rates, and Circle's share of circulation. The main driver for circulation growth remains crypto adoption, while the main driver for reserve rates is interest rates. Data by YCharts Right now, it seems clear to me that Circle, like many other crypto-related stocks, is trading in correlation with Bitcoin. With that in mind, I personally think it makes much more sense to just buy Bitcoin if all you're looking for is capitalizing on momentum. If you're looking to make an investment based on fundamentals, then let's get to valuation. Valuation In my last article, I outlined three ways to evaluate Circle. Bearish Scenario: Valuation Based On Equity I explained: Circle, in some sense, operates like a bank. It has the 'deposits' of users who are buying USDC, which it then uses to provide 'loans' in the form of T-bills. Banks are generally valued based on P/B. On that metric, Circle is hugely overvalued at 12 times book value (JPMorgan, for reference, is at 2.4). However, I wrote: Unlike a bank, Circle isn't bound by its equity to grow its 'loan book', which means there isn't a direct relationship between profits and book. As such, I don't think it's an accurate way to evaluate the company. Base Scenario: Tech Company Valuation From the Circle's shareholder perspective, what matters at the end of the day is the net income or free cash flow the company generates. The problem is that net income was negative, and free cash flow came almost entirely from stock-based compensation adjustments. So, we'll have to go with the next best thing, which is adjusted EBITDA. In Q2, adjusted EBITDA was $126 million, run-rating at roughly $500 million. Data by YCharts This places them at 58 times forward EBITDA, which is very, very high. Coinbase, for instance, is trading at half that valuation. That said, you can make the argument that Circle's adjusted EBITDA is growing much faster, at 52% Y/Y. The problem I have with that argument is that this growth came due to a 90% increase in USDC circulation, offset by a 1-point drop in reserve return rate. With circulation growth slowing materially and reserve rates continuing to fall, investors shouldn't expect a continuation of this adj. EBITDA growth rate, which means the 58 times multiple is tough to swallow. Bullish Scenario: Valuation Based On Reserves On Circle's balance sheet, below the cash and cash equivalents line, there's the reserves account. This metric is also updated on an ongoing basis on the company's website . As of September 11th, reserves stood at $72.4 billion. Those reserves primarily include short-term T-bills, which, for most companies, are accounted as cash equivalents. Circle's case is different because those reserves are pegged to USDC circulation. In simple words, if all USDC holders woke up tomorrow and decided to convert into regular Dollars or Bitcoin, then Circle would need to liquidate all its reserve assets. In that event, if you evaluated the company based on reserves, its valuation would drop to zero. However, if you're looking to invest in Circle, your baseline assumption is that USDC circulation not only wouldn't go to zero, but it would grow substantially. Importantly, you shouldn't take the entirety of reserves but rather only those that Circle has the entitlement to generate reserve income from. Meaning, you should take Circle's RLDC margin and apply it to reserves. Created and calculated by the author based on Circle data. As we can see, that calculation brings us to a 1.1 price/reserves multiple based on current reserves, which reflects about 10% downside. Conclusion All in all, I really like what Circle is doing, and I think they are making significant progress with their business. However, I believe the actual use cases for stablecoins are much smaller than what bullish investors are estimating. I also find the company's valuation still rich, and I find that the stock continues to trade almost entirely based on momentum. The downside is no longer big enough to justify my previous 'Strong Sell' rating, but I still view Circle as a very risky investment. I upgrade the stock to 'Hold' for risk-seeking investors, but I, personally, wouldn't let my hard-earned money get exposed to such inflated risks. I would wait for a much lower EBITDA multiple before considering entering a position or a price/reserves ratio that leaves room for market share losses.",CRCL,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|FIAT|TRADING|USDC,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-15 11:30:00

While XRP holds its ground, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a brand-new coin, is taking the market by storm. This cheap altcoin at just $0.035 has been supported by more than 16,300 investors. Placing itself at the intersection of DeFi innovation and tokenomics scalability, Mutuum Finance is ready to emerge as a market leading player in a saturated niche. XRP Holds Ground as Market Regains $4 Trillion XRP trades above $3, showing intraday price action at $3.02 to $3.18 as the whole cryptocurrency market exceeds the $4 trillion threshold. The token continues to hold its spot in the market discussion of cross-border payment and institutional adoption, with traders waiting to see if increased liquidity across the entire market cycle can drive its next action. While XRP holds firm in this position, other initiatives such as Mutuum Finance are also attracting investor attention. Mutuum Finance Stage 6 Momentum Investors are freely buying MUTM tokens at $0.035 in Stage 6 of the presale. Stage 7, which is the close-up, is approaching, and demand is still growing. More than 16,300 investors have accumulated tokens to this point, and the project has raised more than $15.8 million, a definite indicator that market demand is great and launch expectations are growing. Accuracy in Price Discovery For borrow, lend, and liquidation security, Mutuum Finance utilizes Chainlink oracles for token prices for tokens such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracle parameters, composite data feeds, and time-weighted averages of decentralized exchanges are backed up for higher accuracy. The multi-layer process ensures that price information will be as uniform as possible regardless of highly stressful market conditions. Market volatility directly affects collateral management in the protocol. Liquidation and LTV levels are distinguished based on asset stability. Riskier assets or tokens carry lower borrowing limits, while safer assets are handled with more generous limits. Reserve multipliers are used proportionally, 10% for less risky, and 35% for riskiest assets, to create a buffer without inhibiting diversification. Shaping the Future of DeFi Mutuum Finance is building a protocol for actively deploying capital in the form of passive lending and borrowing, which can enable users to borrow against securitized stacks of assets. The protocol is driven by a stability algorithm and an interest rate optimization algorithm, both designed to be optimal and long-term sustainable in terms of capital utilization. The pivot around which Mutuum Finance turns is lending protocol consisting of Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending. In Peer-to-Contract, liquidity pools are managed by smart contracts and the interest is calculated dynamically, and in Peer-to-Peer, borrowers and lenders agree with the facility use of fixed or variable rates. It is distinguished from the majority of its peers by flexibility. Risk and Liquidity Safeguards The protocol manages risk and liquidity dynamically to enable efficient liquidation of illiquid positions. Risk exposures are rigorously capped, with liquidation levels specified. Collateral assets such as stablecoins and ETH are utilized to supply ancillary LTV levels in order to make riskier assets collateralizable using safer ones. Reserve factors are allocated proportionally across asset classes, optimizing opportunity and risk, and reinforcing protocol reserve protection. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the top cryptos to monitor as market cap regains $4 trillion. Stage 6 tokens are priced at $0.035, with Stage 7 increasing by 14.29%, offering obvious upside for those on the ground floor. Already it has seen $15.8M+ raised and has 16,300+ investors committed, showing meteoric demand pre-launch. As XRP hovers steady at $3.17, MUTM is a high-growth opportunity under a dollar.

The bank’s analysts argued that roughly $115 billion is uncounted in official growth statistics. The analysts calculated that AI technology has contributed about $160 billion in real U.S. economic activity since 2022, representing 0.7% of GDP. Only around $45 billion (0.2% of GDP) of AI-led growth has been recorded. Goldman Sachs believes the impact of AI on GDP was smaller Goldman Sachs analysts revealed that the uncounted $115B indicates the difference between what companies report and what the government measures. They also said it’s the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis method of calculating growth. The analysts argued that the measured impact of AI on GDP was smaller because BEA’s methodology for estimating growth considers semiconductors as intermediate inputs. They revealed that semiconductors are only counted towards final demand when the products, such as consumer laptops, that they enable are sold. The observers stated that the AI chips developed in recent years are being used for training and supporting AI models. They believe that the semiconductors build an intangible asset whose final output value has not been fully capitalized or measured in growth statistics. The analysts also said that new import policies disrupted the impact of AI technology on GDP. They noted that business investment in AI equipment surged in the first half of 2025 because companies rushed to import servers and networking gear ahead of President Donald Trump’s import levies. The analysts acknowledged that the trend reflects one-time frontloading ahead of tariffs , thus exaggerating normal AI investment demand. They believe the AI investment boost was partly offset because imports are subtracted from GDP. AI propels the S&P 500 to all-time highs According to a separate note from Goldman Sachs earlier this month, AI’s impact on economic growth is hard to pin down since companies are also struggling to show it in their bottom lines. They said that the shares of S&P 500 companies quantifying the impact of AI on earnings today remain limited despite most firms mentioning AI on earnings calls in the second quarter of the year. Artificial intelligence has propelled the S&P 500 to all-time highs, while data from Slickcharts shows that Nvidia makes up approximately 7% of the index. The S&P 500’s top eight publicly traded companies are also heavily invested in artificial intelligence. Those firms make up more than 36% of the S&P 500 and are ramping up their AI spending to release products and services that use the technology. Other companies in the S&P 500 are also heavily invested in AI, including Oracle, Palantir, and Cisco. The trio makes up more than 2% of the S&P 500 combined, and their continued increase in AI investments could cause the stock market to continue to grow. The financial institution recently warned that the stock market could drop by 20% once AI spending slows down. Goldman Sachs Analyst Ryan Hammond said there’s the danger of hyperscalers inevitably cutting back on AI expenditures. “A revision of long-term growth estimates back to early 2023 levels would imply 15% to 20% downside to the current valuation multiple of the S&P 500.” -Ryan Hammond, Analyst at Goldman Sachs. AI spending has surged in the first half of 2025, but Hammond wrote that a few analysts expect a sharp deceleration in Q4 2025 through to 2026. However, tech giant Meta Platforms revealed last week that the company will spend $600 billion on AI over the next three years. The firm’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, also highlighted that there’s a possibility the company will invest more than $600 billion during the specified period. He added that a significantly high number was possible through the end of the decade. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

A value above 75 points to altcoins leading strongly in the short term, while a value under 25 shows Bitcoin holding the advantage. On the daily timeframe, the 82 reading would normally confirm heavy strength from the altcoin market. However, on the longer one-year perspective, the picture is less favorable. The same index shows altcoins have not held an advantage for more than 1,300 days. Average periods labeled as Altcoin Year have historically lasted just 18 days, compared to 19 days for Bitcoin’s. The longest stretch on record for altcoins holding dominance was 91 days, still significantly shorter than Bitcoin’s 297-day maximum. EGRAG CRYPTO’s Message to Traders EGRAG CRYPTO cautioned traders against following narratives from large accounts without examining the details for themselves. He argued that many market participants are being misled into believing a full altcoin rally is underway, when in reality the yearly perspective tells a different story than the daily timeframe. While short-term charts may suggest strength in altcoins, the market can shift quickly, and the longer-term data does not yet support the idea of altcoin dominance. EGRAG CRYPTO is well-known for supporting XRP, and the asset’s recent performance suggests that the altseason rally has not begun. Reducing Bitcoin dominance often leaves room for XRP to grow . While the asset has performed remarkably in 2025, it is still below the high expectations of many analysts, including EGRAG CRYPTO . By comparing these two measurements, his central argument is that traders should not expect altcoins to deliver sustained gains just because the daily index has moved into altcoin season territory, as the longer-term trend shows Bitcoin’s dominance.

A new AI-powered project, Ruvi AI (RUVI), is now capturing the industry’s spotlight with a presale performance that is drawing strong comparisons to Shiba Inu’s legendary initial run. Just days after launching Phase 3 of its presale, the project is already approaching the 10% sold-out mark for the stage, signaling a level of demand that could fuel a historic rally. This incredible velocity is built upon an already explosive presale foundation. Ruvi AI has officially raised over $3.6 million , with a dedicated global community of more than 3,500 investors securing over 265 million RUVI tokens . This intense buying pressure indicates that the market sees Ruvi AI not just as another altcoin, but as a utility token with the fundamental strength and viral momentum to follow in the footsteps of a giant like Shiba Inu. The Shiba Inu Formula, Enhanced with Utility Shiba Inu’s success was a testament to the power of community hype and viral marketing. Ruvi AI is capturing that same lightning in a bottle but is enhancing it with something the meme coin legend never had: powerful, real-world utility. By targeting the massive $104 billion creator economy , Ruvi AI has a clear and sustainable use case that anchors its value in tangible application. This dual-pronged approach, combining viral excitement with fundamental strength, is why analysts are forecasting a Shiba Inu-like rally. The project’s credibility is further solidified by a successful smart contract audit from CyberScope , which verifies its security and integrity. This, combined with a prominent listing on CoinMarketCap , has cemented its status as a top-tier utility token ready for the industry spotlight. The Super App Fueling the Market Frenzy The engine behind Ruvi AI’s sensational growth is its game-changing super app. This all-in-one platform is engineered to become an indispensable tool for content creators, creating a powerful cycle of user adoption and token demand. Its integrated features include: Advanced Trend Research: Identifies viral topics before they become saturated, giving creators a crucial competitive edge. AI-Powered Script Generation: Creates engaging, platform-optimized scripts for YouTube and TikTok in seconds. Native Media Creation: Generates professional-quality images and videos directly within the app. Streamlined Workflows: Centralizes the entire creative process for maximum efficiency. Final Call: A Guaranteed 40% Price Increase Is Imminent The presale is currently in Phase 3 , with the RUVI token available at the incredibly low price of $0.020 . However, with the stage selling out at an unprecedented rate, this ground-floor opportunity is vanishing quickly. According to the project’s official tokenomics, the start of Phase 4 will trigger an automatic and guaranteed 40% price increase to $0.028 . This imminent price jump is creating intense FOMO as investors rush to lock in a guaranteed paper gain. Ruvi AI’s journey is further amplified by a strategic partnership with WEEX , a major cryptocurrency exchange, ensuring deep liquidity upon launch. For investors aiming to capitalize on this opportunity, the project’s VIP program offers a clear path to significant wealth: VIP 5 ($10,000 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this reaches $1,000,000, achieving a 9,900% ROI . VIP 3 ($2,000 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this totals $160,000, delivering a 7,900% ROI . VIP 2 ($1,000 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At a $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 6,900% ROI . A competitive leaderboard giveaway also rewards top supporters, fostering a vibrant and engaged community that adds to the project’s unstoppable momentum. A Rally in the Making As Phase 3 accelerates toward a sell-out and a guaranteed price increase looms, the parallels to Shiba Inu’s early days are undeniable. For investors looking for a project with real utility, explosive momentum, and a clear path to a historic rally, all signs point to Ruvi AI.

51763024,581298,1757936342,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51763024.jpeg,Best Crypto to Buy as Arthur Hayes Says Crypto Cycle will Continue into 2026,https://bitcoinist.com/best-crypto-to-buy-as-arthur-hayes-says-crypto-cycle-continues-in-2026/,"BitMEX co-founder, Arthur Hayes, said that the crypto bull cycle is far from over, and that it might continue well into 2026. Arthur believes the US government spending program is not yet in motion and may only start mid-2026. This could mean the US may continue printing money , flooding the market with more liquidity. Amidst global instability, conflicts, and uncertainty, it’s not unusual for the government to cut interest rates or print money to keep markets calm. However, the point here is that this extra liquidity can be channeled into more risk-on assets, such as the best cryptos to buy now . While a long shot, Arthur believes the EU could follow suit. The French government is struggling with a pile of debt. This could put the Euro under pressure, compelling the ECB to step on the gas as far as money printing is concerned. In times like these, cryptocurrencies become way more attractive for investors, thanks to their high-risk, high-reward nature. Read on as we explore what Arthur forecasts for Bitcoin and other digital assets. Plus, we’ll also suggest the top altcoins to buy right now to make the most out of the 2026 cycle. Why Is Crypto a Better Bet? Arthur points out a key difference between TradFi and crypto investors. When the government cuts interest rates or prints more money, bonds usually become more expensive. Traditional investors then use this opportunity to borrow funds cheaply and channel them into bonds. However, crypto investors use the borrowed funds to buy Bitcoin instead, since it’s scarce and can’t be printed endlessly like fiat currency. Arthur says that Bitcoin ‘reacts more strongly’ than bonds, calling it a faster horse. For instance, if the US prints trillions of dollars, so bond yields may increase by a few percentage points. However, Bitcoin can double or even triple during the same time, owing to the huge liquidity pouring in. Arthur also draws an interesting comparison between stocks, real estate, gold, and Bitcoin. Stocks and real estate have done well in the past, but have lagged behind gold. However, Bitcoin is an asset that has outperformed each of these sectors, emerging as the biggest winner. This is probably why Arthur suggests investors should HODL Bitcoin, as it’s the most profitable in the long run. If you’re looking to cash in on this opportunity and build yourself a well-rounded crypto portfolio for outsized returns, here are our top three picks. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – New Telegram Trading Bot for Sniping Meme Coin Liquidity Snorter Token ($SNORT) is the official cryptocurrency of the Snorter Telegram Bot, which has been built from the ground up for everyday meme coin traders. The crypto market moves fast, and before you can even wrap your head around what’s going on, large institutions swipe away liquidity in popular assets using advanced trading algorithms, leaving you with peanuts. However, Snorter Bot is here to change all that. Using the bot, you can place limit/stop buy and sell orders in advance. Then, as soon as liquidity kicks in, your orders will be executed almost instantly. The best part about Snorter, though, is that it’s extremely easy to use – punching in orders is as straightforward as talking to someone on Telegram. What’s more, the bot lets you copy trades from popular and profitable blockchain traders. This ensures you can churn out consistent profits while you work on a strategy of your own. Security is another aspect Snorter Bot excels at. It uses MEV-resistant layers to protect you against scams such as honeypots and rug pulls. You even stay protected from sophisticated sandwich attacks since none of your pending transactions are sent to the mempool, which, simply put, keeps you invisible on the blockchain. Holders of the $SNORT token can also unlock special benefits. There’s no daily sniping limit for holders, plus they pay reduced trading fees (just 0.85%) compared to 1.5% paid by non-holders. What’s more, you also get access to generous staking rewards (currently yielding 119%) and advanced trading analytics – so you can make informed trading decisions. The $SNORT presale is currently live and has already raised $3.94M so far. Each token is priced at just $0.1045, and as per our $SNORT price prediction , it could hit $0.94 before this year ends, giving you a massive 800% profit from current levels. If you want to be a part of the project, here’s a detailed guide on how to buy $SNORT . Visit Snorter Token’s official website to learn more about this revolutionary Telegram trading bot. 2. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – A New Content Creation Platform Offering Cutting-Edge AI Tools & Low Fees SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is the lifeblood of the SUBBD content creation platform. This is a new-age crypto-powered ecosystem that’s changing the way creators and fans interact with each other. Currently, creators have to spend most of their time designing content and managing platforms, leaving them with little time for real interactions. However, thanks to SUBBD’s suite of AI tools, like text, audio, video, profile, and image generators, creators can automate and streamline their workflows. This gives them the opportunity to interact with fans organically and build a genuine community. Moreover, SUBBD saves creators money. As it stands, creators on traditional platforms can lose as much as 70% of their revenue to fees. SUBBD, by contrast, only charges a fraction of their revenue as fees, letting creators take home more of their well-deserved earnings. The $SUBBD token is at the core of this ecosystem. You can use it to unlock exclusive content, request customized content, and even tip your favorite creators. Hassle-free. No bank fees. You can also stake your $SUBBD tokens and earn a fixed 20% APY for the first year. This also unlocks exclusive behind-the-scenes (BTS) content and creator livestreams. Currently in presale, SUBBD Token has already gathered over $1.14M from early investors. Here’s how to buy $SUBBD for just $0.056425 apiece. According to our $SUBBD price prediction , the token could hit $0.301 by the end of the year, giving you a handsome 400% ROI if you invest now. Check out SUBBD’s official website to learn about all the benefits of buying and HODLing the token. 3. Ethereum ($ETH) – OG Cryptocurrency with Increasing Accumulation and Whale Activity Ethereum ($ETH) has been in a consolidation range for almost a month now, trading between $4,250 and $4,950. While retail investors might find this frustrating, savvy players know that this points to whales rapidly accumulating the digital silver before the next bull run kicks in. Exchange data shows that $ETH reserves are drying up pretty quickly , hitting new lows every day. $ETH available within exchanges is now at a record low. The $ETH exchange flux has also turned negative for the first time, meaning there are more $ETH withdrawals from exchanges than deposits. This signals aggressive buying. Recently, Yunfeng Financial Group, backed by Jack Ma, bought 10K $ETH worth $44M as part of its reserve strategy. Plus, a lot of ICO-era whales have woken up. For instance, a whale was spotted selling 4K $BTC and buying 96,859 $ETH instead . Another whale staked $645M worth of $ETH . This shows that large players view $ETH as an excellent long-term investment and a passive-income generating asset. Coming to technicals, once $ETH breaks past the psychological $5K mark, it should be quick to charge toward $6K and $7.5K targets. Interested? Buy $ETH on MEXC or any of the other major crypto exchanges . Recap : Crypto experts like Arthur Hayes believe that upcoming rate cuts could trigger a drawn-out bull run. Within a bullish context, low-cap coins like Snorter Token ($SNORT) and SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) could offer outsized returns. Disclaimer: Crypto investments are inherently risky.

The cryptocurrency market remains inherently volatile, subject to regulatory changes and macroeconomic shifts. Managing such a significant portfolio requires sophisticated strategies and a deep understanding of market dynamics. However, the long-term perspective of companies like Bitmain Immersion often outweighs short-term fluctuations. Their investments often reflect a conviction in the underlying technology and its potential to disrupt traditional finance. This trend of large corporate Ethereum holdings could also pave the way for more traditional financial institutions to enter the space, further legitimizing digital assets.

51763840,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=808786,1757936449,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51763840.jpeg,Thailand citizens find bank accounts frozen overnight,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/thailand-wake-up-to-frozen-bank-accounts/,"Millions of people in Thailand have been locked out of their bank funds after a state-backed crackdown on suspected scam-related accounts left ordinary citizens and businesses struggling to access their money. Over the weekend, reports from the Cyber Crime Investigation Bureau (CCIB) and local media said that up to three million accounts were temporarily suspended nationwide. The account freezing came against the backdrop of online fraud cases and money laundering by criminal groups. According to the Bangkok post, authorities insisted the operation targeted “mule accounts” used by scammers, but admitted many innocent vendors, small businesses, and families had also been caught up in the web of suspensions. Thailand commenced account freezing crackdown in August The bank crackdown on scammers began in August, when Thai banks, working with the Anti-Online Scam Operation Centre (AOC) and the Bank of Thailand (BoT), slapped accounts with stricter controls on transfers and daily limits, supposedly to prevent fraud. Daranee Saeju, assistant governor at the BoT in charge of consumer protection, confirmed that investigators were tracing financial routes to recover money stolen in scams. “Only accounts that received money from mule accounts have been frozen,” Daranee explained on Saturday. “The AOC and commercial banks are expanding their probe to return as much money as possible to victims.” In a briefing on Sunday, the CCIB said fraudsters had been using new tactics to launder money, and it was tougher to differentiate funds obtained from legitimate businesses and criminal activity. Commissioner Pol Lt Gen Trairong Phiwpan told the press that scammers are using more than mule accounts, opting to purchase goods from legitimate sellers before reselling them for cash, which unfortunately made suspicions fall on ordinary vendors. “Culprits are now using sophisticated methods, which leave innocent people trapped in money-laundering cases, ” Trairong said. He noted that some sellers may have knowingly cooperated with fraudsters for commissions, but most were deceived into participating. Thailand police recorded a case where scammers transferred 100,000 baht into a child’s account, then convinced the child to forward the money. The account was flagged and frozen, but the family was not charged because it did not have any prior involvement in fraud. Authorities open “war room” for complaints In response to public indignation, the Digital Economy and Society (DES) Ministry has launched a “war room” to manage the flood of complaints. Officials said the center was receiving hundreds of calls per morning from people whose money had been locked. “This is not an account freeze in the strict legal sense,” said Wisit Wisitsora-at, a DES official. “Other balances and transactions remain usable.” The DES mentioned that only court-backed police orders could permanently freeze accounts, and banks or the Anti-Money Laundering Office (AMLO) lockdowns were only temporary. Suspensions were reviewed through different criteria, including money flow patterns, transaction routes, and if account activity matched the holder’s usual behavior. Wisit said once evidence cleared an account, the suspension could be lifted “within minutes.” The BoT’s Daranee said a banking system error on September 1 prevented updates to end-of-day balances. This left accounts showing outdated amounts and caused confusion for many customers. Crime prevention at the expense of public trust? The central bank said it was working with the AOC and commercial banks to revise procedures. New measures are expected following discussions on Sunday. Daranee admitted the turmoil caused to legitimate citizens but said the crackdown was necessary to restore confidence in the banking system. Hodder Law firm founder Sasha Hodder bashed the central bank for freezing the accounts, saying citizens were better off using crypto because they “can’t freeze Bitcoin.” Meanwhile, the CCIB deployed more officers to police stations and call centers to speed up the review process. Victims were instructed to contact their local police or call hotline numbers.

As of September 14th at 6:00pm ET, the Company’s crypto holdings are comprised of 2,151,676 ETH at $4,632 per ETH (Bloomberg), 192 Bitcoin (BTC), $214 million stake in Eightco (NASDAQ-ORBS) (“moonshots”) and unencumbered cash of $569 million. BitMine crypto holdings reigns as the #1 Ethereum treasury and #2 global treasury, behind Strategy Inc (MSTR), which owns 638,460 BTC valued at $74 billion. BitMine remains the largest ETH treasury in the world. “BitMine has nearly $11 billion in total crypto holdings, surpassing the 2 million ETH milestone. As we mentioned in our August Chairman’s message, the convergence of both Wall Street moving onto the blockchain and AI/ agentic-AI creating a token economy is creating a supercycle for ethereum. And the power law benefits large holders of ETH, hence, we pursue the ‘alchemy of 5%’ of ETH,” said Thomas “Tom” Lee of Fundstrat, Chairman of BitMine. “At BitMine, we are leading our crypto treasury peers by both the velocity of raising crypto NAV per share and by the high trading liquidity of our stock.” The GENIUS Act and SEC’s Project Crypto are as transformational to financial services in 2025 as US action on August 15, 1971 ending Bretton Woods and the USD on the gold standard 54 years ago. This 1971 event was the catalyst for the modernization of Wall Street, creating the iconic Wall Street titans and financial and payment rails of today. These proved to be better investments than gold. “We continue to believe Ethereum is one of the biggest macro trades over the next 10-15 years,” continued Lee. “Wall Street and AI moving onto the blockchain should lead to a greater transformation of today’s financial system. And the majority of this is taking place on Ethereum.” BitMine is now one of the most widely traded stocks in the US. According to data from Fundstrat, the stock has traded average daily dollar volume of $2.0 billion (5-day average, as of September 12, 2025), ranking #28 in the US, behind Eli Lilly (rank #27) and ahead of Arista Networks (rank #29)) among 5,704 US-listed stocks ( statista.com and Fundstrat research).

The legal battle intensifies as economists expect a 25 basis-point rate cut on September 17, with Trump demanding aggressive monetary easing and threatening “ major lawsuits ” against Fed leadership. The dispute stems from Trump’s August attempt to fire Cook over alleged false mortgage statements, which her lawyers called baseless. Source: CourtListener District Judge Jia Cobb issued a preliminary injunction on September 9 protecting Cook’s position, prompting Trump’s Justice Department to seek an immediate stay pending appeal. Trump’s broader campaign against Fed independence includes branding Chair Jerome Powell a “ numbskull ” and nominating Stephen Miran, a pro-crypto advocate, to the Federal Reserve Board. Earlier this month, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde warned that undermining Fed independence would create “ very serious danger ” for global economic stability. Trump Administration Escalates Constitutional Showdown Over Fed Control The Justice Department argues in its filing that presidential “ for cause ” determinations are unreviewable exercises of discretion, claiming courts cannot second-guess removal decisions involving core Article II responsibilities. The filing contends that Cook’s alleged financial misrepresentation constituted sufficient grounds for dismissal regardless of timing. Trump’s legal team disputes the district court’s “ in office ” limitation on removal power, arguing Congress intentionally omitted such restrictions from the Federal Reserve Act. The administration maintains that pre-confirmation misconduct can constitute cause if it relates to an officer’s fitness to serve. The constitutional battle extends beyond Cook’s case, with similar challenges pending in multiple circuits involving Trump’s removal of officials from independent agencies. The Supreme Court’s recent decisions have gradually eroded traditional “for cause” protections that independent agencies enjoyed for 85 years. Trump intensified pressure through coordinated attacks from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Vice President JD Vance, who labeled Fed policy “ monetary malpractice .” The president stopped short of threatening Powell’s termination but ominously suggested he “ may have to force something ” if rate cuts don’t materialize. Miran’s nomination to fill Adriana Kugler’s vacant seat adds a pro-crypto voice to the Fed board, with analysts viewing him as a potential “ shadow chair ” who could challenge Powell’s policy direction from within. His confirmation requires Senate approval, unlikely before September’s rate decision. Political Pressure Mounts as Rate Cut Expectations Reach Consensus The legal drama unfolds as 105 of 107 economists expect the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points on September 17, marking the first easing since January. 105 of 107 economists expect the Fed to cut rates 25 basis points on September 17 as Bitcoin surges above $116,000, targeting $140,000. #Bitcoin #RateCut #Fed https://t.co/iulmtuVc8z — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 12, 2025 Stalling job growth and downward revisions erasing 900,000 jobs from 12-month data drove the unanimous consensus shift. Producer Price Index unexpectedly declined 0.1% in August against forecasts for a 0.3% increase, while weekly jobless claims spiked to 263,000, the highest since October 2021. The combination of softer inflation and labor market weakness prompted the Fed to prioritize employment support over price stability concerns. Trump’s frustration stems from believing current rates unnecessarily burden federal borrowing costs, arguing that Europe implemented ten rate cuts while the Fed delivered none despite similar economic conditions. The president claims that lowering rates by one percentage point could save $300 billion annually. Powell acknowledged at Jackson Hole that employment risks may outweigh inflation concerns, signaling the central bank’s preparation to act. However, he stressed policy remains “ data-dependent ” and warned against assuming rapid easing sequences. Bitcoin surged above $116,000 following inflation data that reinforced rate cut expectations, with spot ETFs drawing $553 million in net inflows as investors positioned for monetary accommodation. Technical analysis reveals breakouts from descending channels, with potential targets of around $120,000. 8-year Bitcoin holder dumps another $136M following $4B ETH trade as whale still controls $5.43B across four addresses. #Bitcoin #ETH https://t.co/MpaMuDXboC — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 15, 2025 However, recent whale selling activity poses risks to bullish projections , with an eight-year Bitcoin holder resuming liquidations after offloading $4 billion worth of BTC for Ethereum since August. The renewed selling pressure could challenge technical targets, though a dovish Fed decision on September 17 may restore market optimism and institutional confidence. Looking forward, the constitutional crisis over Fed independence coincides with market expectations for aggressive easing, creating massive tensions between presidential authority and central bank autonomy. Trump is highly anticipating the May 2026 timeline for Powell’s term expiration.

The incident, which unfolded between block heights 3,499,659 and 3,499,678, lasted roughly 43 minutes and rewrote 36 minutes of chain history, according to blockchain explorer data. The reorg forced the network to discard 118 previously confirmed transactions, unsettling users and exchanges. Analysts described the event as unprecedented in Monero’s history and noted it followed recent reports that Qubic had seized control of more than 51% of the network’s hashrate , a position that could allow chain rewrites or double-spending at a cost of around $100,000 per day. $6B Privacy Coin Monero Was Just Hijacked for $100K/Day Monero, the $6 billion privacy coin long touted as one of crypto’s most censorship-resistant networks, has suffered a major setback. A single mining entity, the Layer-1 blockchain Qubic, claims it seized 51% of Monero’s… — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 18, 2025 Despite the disruption, Monero’s native coin, XMR, saw a price uptick. XMR rose 7% in the past day before retracing to the current price. As of this press time, XMR trades at $305, extending its weekly and monthly gains to 12% and 29%, respectively. XRM Weekly Price Chart Source: CoinMarketCap 118 Transactions Invalidated After Monero’s Deepest Chain Reorg Monero’s largest blockchain reorganization to date wiped out 118 previously confirmed transactions, creating visible disruption for users and exchanges. Blockchain researcher Andy Fitche confirmed that the competing chain invalidated confirmed payments, noting that wallets displayed alerts showing transactions marked in red as “invalid.” 19 Blocks as alternative Blockchain. Injected into #Monero . Right now. The consequence? The red text means that transactions, which were sent and already confirmed, are now invalid. And trust me, it takes a long scroll to reach the end of the red lines. @MoneroTalk … pic.twitter.com/p667UprbfU — Andy Fichte (@BerggoldDigital) September 14, 2025 Avdiu Sazan, another community analyst, said the competing blocks were linked to the mining pool Qubic. He described the event as “a casual 18 blocks reorg.” Providing possible reasons for the recent event, crypto podcaster Xenu suggested Qubic aimed to “stop the bleeding” of XMR’s price, sparking debate on the chain’s future. Reorganizations occur when two versions of a blockchain compete, and miners extend different ledgers. The longest valid chain ultimately becomes the accepted history, discarding blocks on shorter chains. While one- or two-block reorgs occasionally occur on proof-of-work chains due to latency or simultaneous block discovery, Monero’s 19-block reorg is highly unusual and points to concentrated mining power or instability. The episode has reignited discussion around Monero’s network security. The community has floated potential safeguards, including localized mining, merge mining, or Dash-style ChainLocks, to reduce the risk of deep reorgs and 51% attacks. None, however, have been adopted, leaving mining pools like Qubic with disproportionate influence. Notably, the latest reorg exceeded Monero’s built-in 10-block protection, underscoring ongoing vulnerabilities in the protocol. Monero Supporters Double Down on the Network Despite Security and Privacy Concerns Monero supporters rallied behind the privacy-focused cryptocurrency this week despite mounting scrutiny after its deepest blockchain reorganization to date. Advocates took to X, insisting that Monero remains the only asset offering “true freedom,” contrasting its privacy guarantees with Bitcoin’s traceability under know-your-customer (KYC) regimes. “Monero is the only safe haven,” one supporter posted , while another, Meta Ryuk, said the asset poses unique challenges for regulators. “Bitcoin is a haven for them. Monero is a challenge.” Ryuk dismissed claims of traceability, calling them “unfounded.” Critics, however, questioned the network’s reliability following the 43-minute chain rewrite that invalidated 118 confirmed transactions. Dash DAO’s Joel Valenzuela likened the disruption to “Visa going down for 40 minutes,” warning that such instability would be unacceptable for mainstream systems. When people say ""crypto is still a casino,"" people point to Solana memecoins. In reality, they should point to Monero. If the Visa network had 40 minutes of activity disrupted on a whim, and the company wasn't taking it seriously, the company would go to zero immediately.… https://t.co/vGeTQYjEUR — Joel Valenzuela (@TheDesertLynx) September 14, 2025 A crypto analyst said he would stop accepting XMR payments until the issue is resolved, calling the network “unreliable.” Meanwhile, Monero has been previously implicated in the criminal economy, particularly for laundering funds from CSAM sales , according to Chainalysis’s 2024 Crypto Crime Report. Vendors often convert Bitcoin into Monero via instant exchangers, taking advantage of its privacy features and lack of KYC to obscure transactions. Similarly, Finnish authorities traced Monero in the Julius Kivimäki case , where the hacker allegedly converted Bitcoin ransom payments into Monero via a non-KYC exchange to obscure the funds before transferring them to a dedicated wallet.

An anonymous entity, known in the crypto community as a ‘whale’ due to their substantial holdings, moved 6,010 ETH – valued at a staggering $27.25 million – to the popular exchange just an hour ago. This move, reported by AmberCN, is often seen as a precursor to selling and has sparked considerable discussion among traders and analysts alike. Understanding the Impact of an ETH Whale Deposit When a large holder, or ‘whale,’ makes an ETH whale deposit to an exchange, it typically catches the market’s attention. Why is this such a significant event? Because such deposits usually precede selling activity. Exchanges are platforms where cryptocurrencies are bought and sold, so moving assets onto them suggests an intention to liquidate positions. Potential Selling Pressure: A large influx of tokens can increase the supply available for sale, potentially driving down prices if demand does not match. Market Sentiment: These actions can influence broader market sentiment, leading other traders to adjust their strategies. Liquidity: While potentially negative for price, it also adds liquidity to the market, which can be beneficial for those looking to buy. This particular whale accumulated an impressive 86,000 ETH between June and August, making their current deposit a notable portion of their holdings. Their past accumulation suggests a strategic approach, and their recent move could indicate a shift in their market outlook. What Does This Specific ETH Whale Deposit Mean for Ethereum? The recent ETH whale deposit of 6,010 ETH to Binance is a concrete event that warrants close observation. For Ethereum, a large sell-off could introduce volatility, especially if the broader market is already sensitive to price movements. However, it is crucial to remember that a deposit is not a guaranteed sale. Whales might move funds for various reasons, including: Portfolio Rebalancing: Shifting assets to diversify or consolidate holdings. DeFi Opportunities: Preparing funds for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols that require assets on an exchange. Hedging: Setting up positions to hedge against potential market downturns. Nevertheless, the most common interpretation remains an intention to sell, especially given the significant amount involved. Traders are now keenly watching Ethereum’s price action to see how the market absorbs this potential selling pressure. The immediate reaction will be a test of market resilience. How Do Traders React to a Major ETH Whale Deposit? The cryptocurrency market thrives on information, and an ETH whale deposit of this magnitude provides a clear signal for many participants. Traders often employ several strategies in response to such news: Monitoring Order Books: Observing Binance’s order book for large sell orders that might follow the deposit. Setting Stop-Losses: Implementing protective measures to limit potential losses if prices drop. Short-Selling: Some aggressive traders might open short positions, betting on a price decline. Buying the Dip: Conversely, long-term investors might view a potential price drop as a buying opportunity. It is important for individual investors to conduct their own research and not solely rely on whale movements. While influential, whale actions are just one piece of the complex puzzle that is the crypto market. Market fundamentals, broader economic trends, and regulatory news also play significant roles. The Bigger Picture: Whale Activity and Market Dynamics Whale activity, including significant ETH whale deposit events, serves as a fascinating indicator of market sentiment among large players. These movements highlight the dynamic nature of the crypto space, where transparency of transactions often provides insights into potential future price action. While the immediate focus is on the potential impact of this $27.2 million deposit, it also reminds us of the power concentrated in the hands of a few large holders. This event underscores the importance of staying informed and understanding the various factors that drive cryptocurrency prices. Whether this whale’s move leads to a substantial sell-off or is absorbed without major disruption, it offers a valuable lesson in market analysis and risk management. To learn more about the latest crypto market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping Ethereum price action. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an ETH whale deposit? An ETH whale deposit refers to a large amount of Ethereum (ETH) being transferred by a significant holder (a ‘whale’) from their private wallet to a cryptocurrency exchange. This action often signals an intention to sell these assets. Q2: Why is this particular ETH whale deposit significant? This specific deposit is significant because it involves 6,010 ETH, worth $27.25 million, moved by a whale who had accumulated 86,000 ETH previously. The size of the deposit suggests a potential for notable selling pressure on the market. Q3: Does an ETH whale deposit always mean a sell-off? Not always, but it is the most common interpretation. While funds can be moved to exchanges for other reasons like rebalancing portfolios, participating in DeFi, or hedging, a large deposit typically indicates a preparation for selling activity. Q4: How might this ETH whale deposit affect Ethereum’s price? A large ETH whale deposit can introduce selling pressure, potentially leading to a temporary price decrease if the market demand doesn’t absorb the increased supply. It can also influence market sentiment, making other traders cautious. Q5: What should individual investors do in response to such news? Individual investors should conduct their own thorough research and consider various market factors beyond just whale movements. While whale activity is an indicator, it’s essential to analyze market fundamentals, technical indicators, and personal risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. Share Your Thoughts!

ETHA benefits from Ethereum's dominance in hosting stablecoins like USDC and the rise of tokenized real-world assets by major institutions. Risks include high volatility and potential competition from faster, lower-cost blockchains, but the fund's long-term growth case remains strong. Investing in ETHA is a bet on blockchain infrastructure adoption, not just cryptocurrency speculation, with institutional participation signaling a maturing opportunity. Introduction The topic of today's article is a change of pace from my usual diet of steady equities. The iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), as the name suggests, is a vehicle that tracks the performance of the cryptocurrency Ethereum, or more correctly, the native coin Ether . For clarity's sake, investors should understand that ETHA is tracking the price movement of Ether. The word cryptocurrency is a catch-all phrase that encompasses a universe of underlying coins ranging from stores of value such as Bitcoin technology layers such as Ethereum and a plethora of stuff that's either outright worthless or, worse, deliberate fraud . The risk is that investors fall victim to what's known in philosophy as a tautology . In this instance the tautological reasoning would go, Ethereum is a cryptocurrency, some cryptos are frauds, therefore Ethereum is a fraud. What I hope to lay out today is the perspective of somebody with a background in the investment world and traditional finance. As I see it, there is an opportunity from a technology perspective to overlay traditional finance with the technology layer that is blockchain. Given that Ethereum is the largest public blockchain and already hosts numerous decentralized finance, or DeFi, projects, I see it set to be a key beneficiary of the fusion of blockchain technology with traditional finance. We already see plenty of news and hype this summer regarding stablecoins , a sizable portion of which use Ethereum as their primary infrastructure layer. I am rating this ETF as a buy today. The price action has been very strong lately, and on account of that, I am issuing a buy rather than a strong buy. I would warn potential investors that Ethereum and crypto generally have exhibited very high historical volatility, and thus this is not one for the faint of heart. An investor in ETHA will need to be comfortable with the investment case and committed to holding through a downturn, provided the investment thesis remains intact, of course. The Investment Case So what is the investment case for Ethereum? The first thing I want to set out is that I view an investment in Ethereum as akin to investing directly in a technology. Think of the internet; it's a shared technological infrastructure. The mistake people often make when thinking of Ethereum or any other crypto is to assume an investment in it is an investment in a currency. The skeptics will say something like, what's the point in investing in this alternative currency? You are not going to purchase items at the store with it. They will also cite the large volatility level and note that in order for a currency to function effectively, it must have some level of stability. Within the fiat currency world, we can see real-world examples of what happens when volatility swamps a currency, such as in Argentina: its usefulness as a medium of exchange is destroyed. Ethereum is a public blockchain network technology, and it just so happens that the mechanism of maintaining that technology involves the payment of node validators in the native currency of the blockchain, in this case Ether. So we are not investing in a cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange, but rather we are investing in the underlying technology; the expression of that investment is through a native currency. Imagine if every time on the internet you opened a web page, an underlying operator of the network got paid a tiny amount of money in order to fulfill that request for you. I hope that explains the underlying mechanism. Next is why this mechanism is attractive from our perspective as investors. If I boil it right down, the investment case is a simple bet on continued adoption of Ethereum as the standard public blockchain to host traditional finance use cases, which are in the works. There are numerous examples that can be cited, many of which are still early stage or pilots, but the direction of travel seems clear. So let's give a few examples. The leading stablecoin issuer, Circle (CRCL), which offers the well-known USDC, utilizes Ethereum as its primary blockchain for hosting the USDC stablecoin. About 65% of USDC runs on Ethereum, and market forecasts for the growth of stablecoins alone are staggering . Ethereum, like any other network, think the internet or social media, has the advantage of scale. Being the largest allows the network to accrue advantages; users flock to the standard because it's where the majority of other users already are. The second major use case is the nascent use of tokenized assets, which is simply the creation of digital representations of real-world assets on the blockchain. An instinctive bearish reaction to this is to think of the NFT boom in recent years. A phenomenon that led to wild speculation in worthless tokens. The coming wave of tokenized assets could not be more different. Take, for instance, the announcement by Franklin Templeton that they will offer a tokenized version of their money market fund on Ethereum, or BlackRock (BLK) announcing a tokenized U.S. treasury fund. These are sophisticated entities that are adapting their product offerings to suit the new technological paradigm available. The use of blockchain-based assets is not just a novelty either; it can solve some very interesting real-world problems. For instance, in the payment world, many payments take several days to settle using traditional financial payment rails, such as wire payments or ACH . In particular, cross-border payments can cause significant cost and operational delay, which is an efficiency drain for large corporate entities. In the world of trading, the posting of collateral for a derivative trade involves a slow process of sending an asset such as a MM fund to the clearinghouse's bank account. The asset is held until the completion of the trade. The operational slowness can lead to enhanced risks, less optimized use of a firm's asset base, and greater costs associated with asset and money movement over traditional rails. The fund itself looks appealing vs. its peer set. It must be acknowledged that it carries a slightly higher fee load than alternative Ether tracking funds; however, given the magnitude of the higher fee is small, I am happy ETHA remains a good choice. Investors are paying a slight premium in this instance for the safety and operational reputation of BlackRock and the iShares brand. Seeking Alpha The fund's substantially larger AUM than alternatives means it offers investors much better liquidity, as daily traded volumes are much higher. This should minimize spreads paid by investors compared to other offerings. When we consider the bid-ask spread with the expense ratio, I believe ETHA is very attractive from a cost perspective. Seeking Alpha Large corporates are waking up to the benefits of blockchain technology. The implication of that for an investment in ETHA is as follows. More traffic looks destined to come onto the Ethereum network; more traffic will mean a greater volume of transactions requiring processing and competition for speed of processing on the network. The larger number of participants and transactions supports network volume, which in turn serves as a bid on the underlying currency that powers the network, Ether. There are competing blockchain solutions that will try to take share from Ethereum workloads, and indeed I do not see the market as a winner-takes-all dynamic; more likely, the market will settle into an oligopolist equilibrium. What seems clear to me, though, is the Ethereum network is set to continue to grow rapidly, and that growth in network traffic will naturally correspond with a rise in the underlying network currency, which is what ETHA is ultimately tracking. Over time, network transactions have continued to rise, and with them so has the native currency, Ether. The continued shift of new workloads, such as tokenized assets, underpins continued network growth into the future. The Block Performance A quick look at performance. Since early April, Ethereum has been on a stellar run and now sits up at all-time highs. Investing at all-time highs is always a leap of faith in any instrument. A sensible pushback to my buy thesis would be, why not wait for a pullback to get the entry point? This is a totally fair point, and my answer is simply that market timing is a tricky thing to do and get right. I, of course, expect we will have a pullback at some point; the problem is we have no idea when that is or what level it will ultimately pull back from and to. I think a meaningful pullback in the stock would warrant an upgrade to a strong buy. Given the investment case I have laid out, I think Ethereum would warrant a strong buy; the only thing holding me back is the fact it's at an ATH. I am happy to buy at an ATH given the strength of the secular investment case. If others wish to keep their powder dry for a better entry point, I see the sense in that; I just have no idea when they might get the chance to deploy that capital. TradingView Risks Two key risks I would call out for investors. The first one I have mentioned already, and that's the inherent volatility one can expect from this type of investment. Based on historical patterns, it's not unreasonable to expect investors might have to endure a drawdown of 50% or more in ETHA and keep their cool. The second risk is on the technology side; critics of Ethereum point out the slowness and high cost of the network compared to newer standards such as Solana. There is a possibility that newer blockchain standards eat away at Ethereum's market share, which will naturally lessen the underlying investment case in the currency. As with prior technologies, it is often not the early adopters that end up being the ultimate victors. A good example is in the smartphone world, the early success of BlackBerry (BB). Despite having an early lead in the smartphone technology space, BlackBerry ended up being a long-term loser as other players such as Apple (AAPL) availed themselves of a second-mover advantage. Ethereum is a leader in the public blockchain space today, but we must be aware that it could potentially be supplanted as newer blockchains come to market with simply a better product, having watched and learned from shortcomings in the current standards. Conclusion In conclusion, hopefully I have done a decent job of laying out why I think Ethereum in the form of ETHA represents a good investment opportunity for investors. Crypto has seen many waves of hype, mostly dominated by retail investors to this point. Now that we are meaningfully seeing big, respected institutions joining the fray, I, with my traditional financial background, have perked up to the opportunity. The benefits of overlaying traditional finance with a better technology layer make perfect sense to anyone who has worked in the industry and experienced the clunky nature of the technology standards. Much of the financial and investment industry still runs on stuff more suited to the 1970s; the onus for change is clear-cut. Ethereum stands to be a key winner of the tech infrastructure adoption of the industry.",ETHA,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-15 11:59:49

Despite a Nasdaq partnership and $50M investment, GEMI trades at over 30x sales, with revenue growth decelerating and persistent large losses. Given the disconnect between bullish pricing and poor fundamentals, I remain highly cautious and find GEMI an easy stock to avoid. Shares of Gemini Space Station ( GEMI ) have ""of course"" enjoyed a huge opening day gain, with crypto and blockchain being hugely in demand here, arguably being the second-hottest thing in town behind AI. While the business was established quite early in the crypto/blockchain wave over the past decade, I am not impressed with its fundamental performance. With growth rapidly slowing down and losses being very large, it is very hard to be upbeat, with this fundamental performance not corresponding with the bullish pricing action here. Totally not convinced about the quality of this business, and recognizing the disconnect described above, I find it very easy to be very cautious here, with Gemini being a very easy offering to pass on. Using Blockchain To Unlock Finance Gemini Space Station was founded by the Winklevoss brothers after they recognized the power of Bitcoin when they got familiar with the currency back in 2012. Bitcoin, based on blockchain technology, works 24/7, as the same does not apply to traditional financial markets, where weekends, banking holidays, and others create real costs, barriers, and delays in money transfers. With earlier exchanges and infrastructure lacking security and user experience, Gemini was going to be based on strong products, great security, licensing, and compliance, all required to make adoption of such platforms go mainstream. This is the basic foundation behind Gemini, which was founded in 2014 with the goal of connecting crypto with the mainland. Over a decade later, the company has become a platform that includes over half a million people, 10,000 institutions, covering 60 countries, and over $20 billion in assets. In fact, over $800 billion in transfers have been processed through the platform since its inception, also aided by a growing crypto market capitalization, standing at $3 trillion in 2024. Valuation and IPO Thoughts Gemini aimed to sell 16.7 million shares in a preliminary price range between $24 and $26 per share, which was up from levels in the high teens in recent weeks, with final pricing set at $28 per share, above the high end of the midpoint of the preliminary guidance. This means that the business has obtained gross proceeds from the IPO of $467 million, which excludes proceeds from the green shoe option. With nearly 119 million shares outstanding, the company is awarded a $3.3 million equity valuation at the offer price. It is a bit hard to read into the pro forma net cash or net debt position in between (related) third-party loans, convertible loans, also as the business holds nearly half a billion in crypto assets on the books itself, which makes the situation rather fluid. For the year 2023, the company generated just over $98 million in revenues, with the business posting a staggering $311 million operating loss, which, despite a modest crypto gain on assets held, did not prevent the business from posting a massive net loss that year. Revenues were up about 44% to $142 million in 2024 as operating losses narrowed substantially to $165 million, essentially cut in half from 2023, but still exceeding revenues reported for the year. Revenue growth slowed down to just 8% in the first half of the year, with revenues reported at just $74 million. Operating losses narrowed substantially, but at $85 million still exceeded reported revenues, indicating that, in between growth rapidly slowing down, losses are still very large by all accounts. However, somewhat comforting is recent news, which includes a partnership with Nasdaq ( NDAQ ). As part of the deal, Nasdaq will buy $50 million of Gemini's shares at the offering, but furthermore, cooperate on their respective platforms. With shares trading around the $40 mark soon after the public offering, the market value of the firm has risen to nearly $4.8 billion. This values the business at over 30 times sales, revenues which furthermore are not showing very strong growth and come with huge losses. Concluding Thoughts Frankly, I am very skeptical about this offering. While some recent crypto and blockchain businesses have real use cases, I am quite cautious here, given the platform function. Outside the valuation discussion is the simple observation that revenue growth has slowed down dramatically to non-appealing growth rates in recent times, but moreover, this is accompanied by operating losses that still exceed revenues. That observation is my key concern in relation to the valuation, as other risks include that of an unfavorable direction of travel of crypto assets at large, also given that the company holds inventory of such currencies. Other operational risks include potential technical and security issues, but the main observance of slower growth and high valuations stands at the basis of my caution here.",NDAQ|GEMI,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-09-15 12:00:00

Unlike traditional staking services, Rocket Pool allows users to pool their Ethereum (ETH) to run validator nodes on the Ethereum network. Thus, participants can participate in the staking process without requiring the full 32 ETH to run a validator node. Furthermore, Rocket Pool introduces the concept of “rETH” tokens, which are issued to users who stake ETH in the Rocket Pool network. These rETH tokens represent users’ stake in the pool and can be traded or transferred independently of the underlying ETH, providing liquidity and flexibility to participants. Overall, Rocket Pool aims to democratize Ethereum staking and contribute to the decentralization of the Ethereum network by providing a secure, efficient, and accessible platform for staking participation. As DeFi continues to gain traction, Rocket Pool stands out as a pioneering project at the forefront of innovation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. What can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? Can Rocket Pool’s price reach $50?

Reports show that millions of dollars in virtual asset laundering have already been tracked, and officials are intent on making the country less attractive to fraudsters. Global Partnerships To Tackle Crypto Abuse According to Gulf News , the UAE Ministry of Interior joined the International Cryptocurrency Security Action Week in Singapore, a forum supported by Mastercard and international police groups. The goal was to improve coordination with law enforcement agencies, exchanges, and tech experts worldwide. Workshops centered on fraud, money laundering, and dark-web misuse, as well as ways to build faster reporting channels between the public and private sectors. The Ministry of Interior, through its International Affairs Office, took part in the International Cryptocurrency Security Action Week workshop, hosted by the Secure Communities Forum in partnership with Mastercard in Singapore. The event brought together global leaders from law… pic.twitter.com/saqnyWA8mZ — وزارة الداخلية (@moiuae) September 13, 2025 The effort is not just symbolic. Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) has entered into new arrangements with the Ministry of Interior to strengthen monitoring of exchanges and custodians. Task forces and joint training programs are being formed to improve detection of illicit trades and suspicious accounts. Millions In Illicit Trades Under Scrutiny Investigations are already producing results. Dubai Police and the Dubai Economic Security Center examined crypto laundering operations worth $65.3 million between 2022 and 2024, according to reports. Several high-value cases have been disrupted, while local courts continue to handle proceedings against individuals accused of misusing digital assets for crime. Authorities say such operations are part of a wider clampdown that includes confiscations. Reports from the Ministry of Interior show more than AED 4 billion in assets were seized in money laundering cases, with offenders arrested and charged. Officials say these figures reflect not only the scale of abuse but also the reach of enforcement now in place. Stronger Laws And Technology Legal changes are underway to make sure virtual asset crime is addressed more clearly under UAE law. Regulations now give investigators more power to follow transactions across borders and freeze funds. Partnerships with bodies such as Interpol and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime have also been expanded to keep information flowing quickly. Technology is another part of the strategy. The Ministry of Interior is reportedly leaning on artificial intelligence and sophisticated data analysis software to monitor suspicious transactions and spot unusual patterns that human investigators may overlook.

The infrastructure, called Digital Markets Infrastructure, was used by MembersCap to raise capital for its tokenized MCM Fund 1, with Archax, a regulated crypto exchange based in London, acting as the nominee. The goal is to digitize private markets, an area full of outdated systems and paper trails, and speed up everything from settlement to investor access. Right now, the platform only supports private funds, but plans are already in motion to expand it to other assets. No fluff, no waiting. This is blockchain built for the actual financial system, not crypto hype. Trade groups demand blockchain inclusion in UK-US tech talks Twelve UK industry groups have formally called on the government to make sure blockchain is part of the upcoming tech partnership with the US. This came in a letter sent to Business Secretary Peter Kyle last Thursday. Bloomberg got hold of it ahead of President Donald Trump’s visit next week. The letter called distributed ledger technology “a core strand” of what the UK and US are building. The groups warned that if crypto is left out, it could push the UK out of future financial standards being written by others, especially in Asia and the Middle East. “Excluding digital assets from the UK-US Tech Bridge would be a missed opportunity,” the letter said. The same letter was sent to Lucy Rigby, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, who handles the UK’s crypto policy. And the concern wasn’t vague, as they named exactly what’s at stake: tokenization and stablecoins. The Financial Times reported a possible deal between the UK and US that would link their work on artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and cybersecurity. Trump is expected to land in London with a team that includes Sam Altman from OpenAI and Jensen Huang from Nvidia. When asked about the push, a UK government spokesperson said, “The UK and the United States are natural partners as the only allied countries with trillion-dollar tech sectors, and we already partner on a range of important technologies such as AI, Quantum, and cyber security.” No additional comment was offered on the letter. UK delays crypto regulation as US moves ahead The UK says it wants to lead in crypto, but it still hasn’t passed any real industry-wide rules. Rishi Sunak, the former Prime Minister, said back in 2022 that the UK would become a “global hub for cryptoasset technology.” But the European Union, the United States, and parts of Asia and the Middle East are all ahead on regulation. In their letter, the trade groups made it clear: tokenization (where assets like bonds or stocks are turned into digital tokens and stablecoins) is where the UK and US should align. Trump already signed US legislation in July to regulate fiat-backed stablecoins, pushing them closer to the banking system. Meanwhile, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority is still working on it. They’re consulting on new crypto rules and plan to start accepting license applications next year. These rules will cover stablecoins, tokenization, and crypto trading platforms. UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves met with Scott Bessent, the US Treasury Secretary, in March to align on crypto oversight. After those talks, the government said it would work with the US to coordinate its regulatory plans. The trade groups warned in the letter that without coordination, the UK could face “fragmented regulatory environments, reduced access to deep transatlantic markets, and increasing competitive pressures.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Ethereum Stablecoin Supply Reaches Record Level at $166 Billion The stablecoin supply on Ethereum reached a record high, rising from $149.5 billion a month ago. USDT, the market's most dominant stablecoin, holds the largest share at $87.8 billion, followed by USDC with $48 billion. “This record Ethereum stablecoin supply represents a shift from a speculative asset to the backbone of dollarization in the DeFi ecosystem. It also demonstrates that liquidity is now strong enough to absorb macroeconomic volatility,” said Vincent Liu, CIO of Kronos Research. Similarly, LVRG Research Director Nick Ruck emphasized that this record level signifies “a large increase in institutional liquidity and deepening confidence in Ethereum’s infrastructure.” Ruck stated that the growth is particularly driven by the expansion of USDT and USDC, which could trigger accelerated institutional adoption and an increase in DeFi activities, while the ETH price could also rise to meet ecosystem demand. Meanwhile, USDT's total market capitalization surpassed $170 billion over the weekend, reaching $170.3 billion. This development solidified the growing importance of the stablecoin market and Ethereum's position in DeFi. *This is not investment advice.

Starting from a $3 price and an estimated tradable float of only about 5 billion XRP, this framework tests how the market might respond when committed institutional capital exceeds the available liquid supply. Cunningham’s analysis sets a clear stage for understanding potential price dynamics. Price-Discovery Mechanics At $3 per XRP, $17 billion could purchase roughly 5.67 billion tokens—already exceeding the estimated 5 billion liquid float. This makes a higher clearing price inevitable. If every one of those 5 billion XRP were instantly liquid, a simple division suggests a $3.40 floor. Real markets, however, are far from that straightforward. Sellers are price-sensitive, large orders thin out order books, and each additional XRP becomes increasingly scarce as buying pressure builds. These factors mean prices would rise far more steeply than a basic calculation implies. First, I asked ChatGPT to forecast an XRP price target based solely on $17B in new ETF purchase demand (~$1B per ETF) over the next 12 mos. Secondly, I asked ChatGPT to add a FOMO Factor that considers regulated banks, stock brokers, registered investment advisors and retail… pic.twitter.com/6l7aJmrvOf — Rob Cunningham | KUWL.show (@KuwlShow) September 14, 2025 ETF-Only Equilibrium Ranges When tradable supply is treated as a fraction of the 5 billion float, clear outcome bands emerge. If a substantial share of the float remains willing to trade, heavy ETF buying could be absorbed at only a modest premium. But if just 10–30% of the float is truly available without severe slippage, the same $17 billion demand could drive prices well into the double digits. Cunningham’s elasticity estimates place conservative ETF-only targets in the low double digits, while moderate inelasticity supports mid-double-digit prices, and extreme scarcity could push valuations much higher. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Reflexive FOMO and Systemic Scale Cunningham’s key second-order insight is reflexive demand. ETFs establish a benchmark that can entice banks, registered investment advisors, and retail investors—groups with capital pools far larger than $17 billion. Even a fraction-of-a-percent allocation from these sources would dwarf the ETF inflows and rapidly outstrip the limited tradable float. In that scenario, a $17 billion spark could ignite a sustained repricing of XRP as new capital competes for a shrinking supply. In conclusion, Seventeen ETFs committing $17 billion in a single year would do more than shift short-term order flow; they would create a structural catalyst for broader institutional participation. Applying Cunningham’s framework to current on-chain liquidity and Ripple’s escrowed balances shows why double-digit XRP prices are a realistic outcome under ETF-driven pressure, with significant upside if reflexive demand follows. His analysis demonstrates how concentrated institutional buying, aimed at a constrained float, can propel an asset far beyond simple linear projections.

With this collaboration, Xpeng can use Magna’s plant in Graz, situated in southern Austria, to develop its vehicles. Meanwhile, in a recent announcement, the Chinese EV manufacturer made public that it had already produced the first group of G6 and G9 SUVs. By manufacturing cars locally, Xpeng intends to avoid the European Union’s tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles imposed in 2024. As for the extra fee for production from partnering manufacturers, it is set at 20.7%. This could go as high as 35.3% for some other manufacturers. Xpeng applies a smart business strategy in its operations to increase sales There is a growing trend among Chinese EV companies seeking to expand their operations internationally, mainly to find better profits and capture new customers. This move has been triggered by a lengthy price war and surplus supply in their home markets. However, they are still encountering more trade obstacles as they move forward. Manufacturing firms like Xpeng and BYD have decided to establish plants in leading markets such as Europe and Southeast Asia to avoid high tariffs. Apart from establishing plants in Europe, Xpeng has also developed its own research and development center in Munich . Interestingly, this center demonstrated the capability to host over a dozen Chinese automakers during the recent IAA Mobility show. The R&D center will also accelerate Xpeng’s model production at the Magna factory and broaden its reach in the European market. Considering its smart business strategy, the Chinese-based electric vehicle manufacturer, particularly in Guangzhou, has recently achieved a significant sales rise, with 271,615 electric vehicles delivered. That is in the first eight months of the year 2025. The rise is three times the sales figures recorded in 2024. The firm’s American depositary receipts have also increased by approximately 77% since January. Despite these exemplary results, it is worth noting that Xpeng encountered an issue in its operation when it needed to recall several of its P7+ models due to a steering problem last week. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan, this scenario sparked concerns about the safety and quality of its vehicles. The problem stems from a defect in the sensor wiring harness. Vehicles produced between August 20 of last year and April 27 of this year are affected, with some potentially showing a steering fault warning light before an actual steering failure. China intends to solidify its position as a global leader of car exports The surge in car exports from China is greatly transforming the entire car market globally. This influx of affordable automobiles has sparked a price war that affects dealerships from Mexico to Malaysia. Following the situation, tech analysts have highlighted that President Xi Jinping’s administration intends to withdraw from this stiff competition as it reduces profit. The People’s Daily, under the leadership of the Communist Party, also weighed in on the topic of discussion, stating that there are no winners in this competition. Even with this, China’s automotive sector, which encounters serious challenges due to the production of many cars, has revealed that it will be hard to reverse this trend. In the meantime, research from reliable sources has highlighted that Chinese vehicles are more noticeable on the streets of some areas in South America, while BYD’s affordable and high-quality EV brands are attracting European customers. Ron Zheng, a partner at global consulting firm Roland Berger GmbH, acknowledged that automobile manufacturers in China are seeking better profit margins abroad. He then concluded that, while the local market feels the impact, the price competition will not be as stiff as in China. Get seen where it counts.

The company recently announced a significant Strategy BTC purchase , adding another substantial amount of Bitcoin to its already impressive reserves. This move isn’t just a simple transaction; it’s a powerful statement about institutional conviction in the future of cryptocurrency. What Does Strategy’s Latest Move Mean for Its Holdings? Strategy has confirmed that it has acquired an additional 525 BTC. This latest acquisition was made at an average price of $114,562, showcasing their continued commitment to accumulating Bitcoin even at varying market prices. This proactive approach underscores their long-term vision for digital assets. This recent Strategy BTC purchase significantly bolsters their existing portfolio. For investors and market observers, these updates provide crucial insights into how major corporate entities are positioning themselves within the evolving financial landscape. It highlights a consistent strategy rather than opportunistic trading. Why Continuous Strategy BTC Purchases Matter Following this latest acquisition, Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings have reached an astounding 638,985 BTC. This massive treasury is currently valued at approximately $47.23 billion, based on current market prices. The average purchase price for their entire Bitcoin stash stands at $73,913. These figures are not just numbers; they represent one of the largest corporate commitments to Bitcoin globally. Strategy’s consistent accumulation demonstrates a belief in Bitcoin’s role as a store of value and a strategic asset. Their sustained Strategy BTC purchase activities often serve as a bellwether for broader institutional interest. The Strategic Rationale Behind This Bold Accumulation Why does a company like Strategy continue to make such significant investments in Bitcoin? Several factors likely influence their strategy: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin is often seen as a potential hedge against inflation, preserving purchasing power over time. Long-Term Value: A belief in Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential as a decentralized, global digital currency. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to their corporate treasury to diversify risks. Pioneering Position: Establishing themselves as a leader in digital asset adoption among public companies. However, it’s also important to acknowledge the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. While the potential for upside is significant, the value of such large holdings can fluctuate dramatically. This requires a strong conviction and a robust risk management framework, which Strategy appears to possess. What Can We Learn from This Institutional Play? Strategy’s consistent approach to its Strategy BTC purchase offers valuable lessons for individual investors: Long-Term Vision: They are not day trading; they are accumulating for the long haul. Conviction: Despite market fluctuations, they maintain their investment thesis. Dollar-Cost Averaging Principle: While not explicitly stated as DCA, their multiple purchases at different price points resemble this strategy, reducing the impact of volatility. Observing institutional moves like this can help shape a more informed perspective on digital asset investing. It underscores that for many, Bitcoin is evolving from a speculative asset to a foundational element of a modern treasury strategy. In conclusion, Strategy’s latest Strategy BTC purchase is more than just another transaction; it’s a testament to their unwavering belief in Bitcoin’s enduring value and its place in the global financial system. As they continue to expand their digital asset portfolio, they reinforce their position as a key player driving institutional adoption.

On-chain data shows cautious distribution, with no strong accumulation trend among major BTC holding groups. Realized cap rose $625B in 18 months, surpassing inflows from BTC’s first 15 years. Resistance Levels in Focus Bitcoin was trading near $115,000 at press time, just under the $117,500–$118,000 resistance zone. According to analyst Michaël van de Poppe, #Bitcoin faces the final resistance before we’re going to be seeing a new all-time high. Breaking through the $117.5K-118K and we’ll be going towards a new ATH. Important week, really looking forward to the volatility of this week! pic.twitter.com/4U9Gr0guS0 — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) September 15, 2025 He added that a breakout above this level could trigger a move toward $123,000, while this week’s Federal Reserve rate cut could add to volatility. Price action depicts higher lows and reinforces the trend since early September, underlining strength in the current movement. RSI is elevated, indicative of strong momentum , but it stands close to overbought territory. Should resistance prove too strong for Bitcoin’s bullish efforts, then the spotlight shifts to $114,800 for near-term support, followed by $112,000 for demand support, then deeper, farther down at $103,000. Weekly Close Above $114K Analyst Rekt Capital noted Bitcoin’s weekly close above $114,000, calling it a step toward reclaiming its Reaccumulation Range. They wrote , “Successful reclaim of $114k as support would not just enable upside but also confirm a likely end to the corrective phase.” Charts shared by Rekt Capital highlight a repeating pattern since 2023, where former resistance levels turned into support zones before the price continued higher. The current structure mirrors those earlier setups, with a successful retest of $114,000 potentially opening the path to $130,000. Source: Rekt Capital/X Distribution and Market Positioning On-chain firm Glassnode reported that distribution among Bitcoin holders has slowed but not fully reversed. “Most $BTC cohorts remain below the 0.5 threshold, indicating sell-side pressure persists. No group is showing strong accumulation (>0.8),” they stated. The market remains in a neutral-to-distribution range, with no clear signs of renewed accumulation among long-term holders. This suggests that while the price has held firm, supply dynamics remain cautious. Traders are watching closely to see if stronger inflows shift the balance toward accumulation. Analyst BitBull pointed to realized cap data showing record inflows. They wrote, More money entered Bitcoin in the last 18 months than in its first 15 years combined. That’s what Realized Cap shows: 2009–2024 (15y): $435B 2024–2025 (1.5y): $625B Realized Cap = the value of $BTC at the price they last moved on-chain → a direct measure of capital… pic.twitter.com/3vK0KVVtfg — BitBull (@AkaBull_) September 15, 2025 Data shows realized cap grew by $625 billion between 2024 and 2025, compared to $435 billion from 2009 to 2024. Realized cap measures Bitcoin at the price each coin last moved on-chain. This metric suggests BTC is not only holding value but is absorbing unprecedented levels of real capital in the current cycle. Outlook Bitcoin stands at a decisive level. Breaking above $118,000 with $114,000 reclaimed as support would signal the end of its corrective phase and pave the way for higher levels. Failure to hold could bring short-term pullbacks before another attempt higher. With Fed policy shifts ahead, volatility is expected to remain high across markets, keeping Bitcoin’s next move in sharp focus.

While BTC accumulation continues, Strategy’s stock issuance is limiting its purchasing power. Strategy acquired only 525 BTC during its latest acquisition round, reflecting the cooling hype for treasury companies. This time, after two weeks of MSTR issuance, Strategy relied on its STRK and STRD preferred stock. Following the latest purchase, MSTR still traded sideways at $331. BTC recovered to $116,000 over the weekend, but fell to $115,017 on Monday. Strategy bought BTC with preferred stock issuance The acquisitions were for an average price of $114,562 per BTC, for an average price still under $74,000 per BTC. As Cryptopolitan reported, the previous purchase was larger, at 1,955 BTC . Strategy has acquired 525 BTC for ~$60.2 million at ~$114,562 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 25.9% YTD 2025.

However, this time around, Strategy stopped reporting its total mNAV. For now, preferred stocks still have a healthy ratio with BTC owned at 9% mNAV. However, common stock holders have no such claim on BTC and are starting to look at significant dilution. After the recent purchase, Strategy retains over $20B from STRK preferred shares and over $16.1B from MSTR issuance. However, the exact purchasing schedule will depend on the price of BTC and the stock performance. After the purchase, STRK traded at $95.65, while STRD fell to $82.19. The preferred shares are considered safer, while offering a higher effective yield. STRD still has to pay out dividend as of September 30, putting pressure on Strategy to fulfill its obligations. Smaller companies keep buying BTC Strategy’s slower purchases are offset by ongoing demand for BTC from anonymous whales and smaller treasury companies. Outside of corporate buyers and miners, anonymous whales are also raising demand based on the activity of accumulation addresses. Accumulation addresses are showing robust demand for BTC, outside corporate treasuries. | Source: Cryptoquant The current week remains subdued, as Metaplanet is still in its silent period, as previously announced. The silent period is expected to end on September 17, but the company has no preset schedule for regular purchases. For now, Metaplanet holds over 20K BTC, double its goal for 2025, but also facing challenges as the MTPLF stock price is down around 60% since June. Smaller companies continue with sporadic buying.

This period holds significant implications not just for currency traders, but also for the broader sentiment across various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. When a major fiat currency like Sterling faces such critical tests, the ripples can be felt far and wide, influencing investor risk appetite and capital flows. Understanding the drivers behind Sterling’s movements this week is crucial for making informed decisions across your portfolio. Why is the Bank of England Meeting So Important for Sterling? The upcoming Bank of England (BoE) monetary policy committee meeting is arguably the centerpiece of Sterling’s week. The BoE, as the central bank of the United Kingdom, holds the reins of the nation’s monetary policy, primarily through its decisions on the official bank rate. These decisions directly impact the cost of borrowing and lending across the entire UK economy, influencing everything from mortgage rates to business investments. Traders and investors will be scrutinizing every word from the BoE’s statement, not just for the immediate rate decision, but more importantly, for any forward guidance on the future trajectory of interest rates . Currently, market expectations are largely for the BoE to hold its main interest rate steady. However, the accompanying commentary and the voting split among committee members will provide vital clues. A more hawkish tone, suggesting potential future rate hikes, could provide a boost to Sterling. Conversely, a dovish stance, hinting at rate cuts sooner than anticipated, would likely weigh heavily on the currency. The BoE’s assessment of inflation, economic growth, and the labor market will be key determinants of their communication. How Will Key UK Economic Data Shape the Sterling Forecast? Beyond the BoE meeting, a barrage of critical UK economic data releases will significantly influence the Sterling forecast . These data points provide a snapshot of the nation’s economic health and are instrumental in shaping both the BoE’s decisions and market sentiment. Understanding these indicators is essential for predicting Sterling’s short-term movements. Here are the key economic indicators to watch: Inflation Data (CPI): Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures are paramount. If inflation remains stubbornly high, it could pressure the BoE to maintain a tighter monetary policy for longer, potentially supporting Sterling. A significant drop in inflation, however, might signal to markets that rate cuts are closer, which could weaken the Pound. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Growth: GDP figures indicate the overall economic output. Stronger-than-expected growth suggests a resilient economy, which is generally positive for a currency. Weak growth, on the other hand, raises concerns about recessionary pressures and can lead to Sterling depreciation. Labor Market Statistics: Unemployment rates, wage growth, and employment change figures offer insights into the health of the job market. Robust wage growth can fuel inflation, making it a key metric for the BoE. A tightening labor market typically supports a currency, while loosening conditions can be detrimental. These data points don’t operate in isolation. Their combined narrative will paint a picture for investors, directly influencing the GBP outlook and providing the context for the BoE’s policy choices. Any significant deviation from market expectations in these releases could trigger sharp movements in Sterling. What is the Direct Impact of Interest Rates on Sterling’s Value? The relationship between interest rates and a currency’s value is fundamental in forex markets. Higher interest rates generally make a country’s currency more attractive to foreign investors. This is because higher rates offer a better return on savings and investments denominated in that currency. For instance, if the Bank of England raises rates, investors holding Sterling-denominated assets receive higher yields, making the Pound more desirable compared to currencies with lower rates. This dynamic is particularly evident in the ‘carry trade,’ where investors borrow in a low-interest-rate currency and invest in a high-interest-rate currency to profit from the interest rate differential. A perception that the BoE will keep rates higher for longer can therefore increase demand for Sterling, driving up its value. Conversely, expectations of rate cuts reduce the attractiveness of Sterling, leading to capital outflows and depreciation. The market’s anticipation of future rate moves often has a greater impact than the actual move itself, making the BoE’s forward guidance critical. Navigating the GBP Outlook: Bullish or Bearish Scenarios? The GBP outlook for the coming week is complex, with both bullish and bearish scenarios plausible depending on the outcomes of the BoE meeting and economic data. Investors need to consider various possibilities to position themselves effectively. Bullish Scenario for Sterling: Hawkish BoE: If the Bank of England delivers a surprisingly hawkish statement, perhaps signaling a greater reluctance to cut rates or even hinting at further hikes, Sterling could rally. Strong Economic Data: Better-than-expected inflation, GDP, or labor market figures would indicate a resilient UK economy , bolstering confidence in Sterling. Reduced Global Risk Aversion: A general improvement in global risk sentiment could also benefit Sterling, as it tends to perform better in ‘risk-on’ environments. Bearish Scenario for Sterling: Dovish BoE: A BoE statement that clearly signals an inclination towards earlier or more aggressive rate cuts would likely lead to Sterling depreciation. Weak Economic Data: Disappointing inflation, GDP, or labor market numbers would fuel concerns about a weakening UK economy , putting downward pressure on the Pound. Increased Global Risk Aversion: Escalating geopolitical tensions or a downturn in global economic prospects could lead investors to seek safe-haven assets, away from Sterling. Traders will also be watching key technical levels for GBP/USD and GBP/EUR pairs. Breaking through significant resistance levels could signal further upside, while falling below support levels could indicate a deeper decline. The market will be highly sensitive to headlines and unexpected shifts, making volatility a near certainty. Challenges and Opportunities for Sterling Traders This busy week presents both challenges and opportunities for those trading Sterling. The primary challenge is the heightened uncertainty. With multiple high-impact events clustered together, the potential for sudden and significant price swings is elevated. Traders must contend with: Event Risk: The specific outcomes of the BoE meeting and data releases are unpredictable. Market Overreaction: Initial market reactions can be exaggerated, potentially leading to ‘fake-outs’ before a more sustained trend emerges. Conflicting Signals: It’s possible for the BoE to be hawkish while economic data is weak, creating conflicting signals for the market. However, opportunities also abound. High volatility can lead to larger potential gains for those who correctly anticipate market movements. For experienced traders, this period offers a chance to capitalize on significant price action. Actionable insights include closely monitoring economic calendars, understanding the various scenarios for the BoE and data, and employing robust risk management strategies. Connecting the Dots: Sterling’s Ripple Effect on Global Markets While the focus is on Sterling, its movements don’t occur in a vacuum. As one of the world’s major reserve currencies, significant shifts in its value can have a ripple effect across global financial markets. For instance, a strong Sterling might indicate renewed confidence in the UK economy , which could spill over into broader European and even global equity markets. Conversely, a sharp decline could signal economic distress, contributing to a more risk-off environment globally. Even for cryptocurrency investors, who often view their assets as uncorrelated to traditional finance, major currency movements can indirectly influence sentiment. A flight to safety in traditional markets, triggered by uncertainty around a major currency like Sterling, can sometimes lead to capital moving out of riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a period of stability and strength in major fiat currencies might foster a more positive overall investment climate, potentially benefiting crypto assets as well. It’s a subtle but important connection to acknowledge. Actionable Insights for Investors: Preparing for Sterling’s Volatility Given the anticipated volatility, how can investors best prepare? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Continuously monitor real-time news feeds, economic calendars, and analyst commentary leading up to and during the events. Review Your Exposure: Assess any direct or indirect exposure you might have to Sterling, whether through investments in UK-based companies, currency pairs, or even global funds sensitive to currency fluctuations. Implement Robust Risk Management: This is paramount. Consider using stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, and avoid over-leveraging. Understand your maximum tolerable loss for any position. Consider Diversification: Ensure your portfolio is well-diversified across different asset classes and geographies to mitigate the impact of adverse movements in any single currency or market. Focus on the Long-Term Narrative: While short-term volatility is likely, try to understand the broader economic trends and the BoE’s long-term policy goals. These often provide a clearer picture than day-to-day price swings. By adopting a proactive and informed approach, investors can better navigate the challenging yet potentially rewarding landscape that this week’s Sterling events present. Summary: A Week of High Stakes for the British Pound This week marks a truly pivotal moment for Sterling, with the confluence of a critical Bank of England meeting and a slew of key UK economic data releases. The decisions and data will not only determine the immediate trajectory of the Pound but will also offer significant insights into the health of the UK economy and the future path of interest rates . From the BoE’s stance on monetary policy to the granular details of inflation and GDP, every piece of information will be scrutinized.

The company revealed that the initiative follows the approval of the referendum 1710 with 81% in favor. At the time of publication, only 1.6 billion DOT exist, accounting for only 76% of the eventual supply. The referendum 1710 replaced the current unlimited issuance model, which only minted 120 million DOT annually without a supply cap. Polkadot schedules a two-year inflation period for DOT tokens https://twitter.com/Polkadot/status/1967241017314115889 According to the new model. DOT tokens are scheduled for a two-year token inflation period. The firm also said new DOT issuances will step down every 2 years starting from Pi Day, March 14, 2026. The director of The Kus, the top news source for the Polkadot ecosystem, Jay Chrawnna, revealed that the date was important because it was near Bitcoin’s halving. He acknowledged that DOT will step down every two years and will be coordinated with Bitcoin’s halving every other step. Polkadot forecasts that there will be approximately 1.91 billion DOT by 2040 under Ref 1710’s model, compared to 3.4 billion under the current 120M per year model. The firm also expects to reach the 2.1B market cap around the year 2160. The company maintained that the model is focused on scarcity, enhancing predictability for investors, and strengthening long-term alignment across the ecosystem. Polkdadot’s OpenGrov framework enables referenda where token holders can submit proposals, cast votes, or delegate voting power. Under the new model, Polkadot proposes three schedules for reducing inflationary pressure, including one option to immediately cut emissions by more than half before easing off. The other options include applying sharper early reductions followed by a gradual decline through the next century. Polkadot Poland DAO OpenGov said the company is pleased to vote in favor, while simultaneously voting against other proposals regarding changes to the DOT economy. The company said it considers introducing a fixed supply as beneficial for Polkadot’s future and for setting it back on the right track. The firm added that it views the proposal positively because it will enforce a more prudent approach to spending DOT tokens. It also believes that the proposal makes the revenues DOT users can generate more realistic, thus making the DOT token significantly more valuable and robust in the long term. The initiative comes as co-founder Gavin Wood returns as CEO of Parity Technologies, the blockchain network’s development arm. Wood also framed the cap as part of a broader effort to prepare Polkadot for its 2.0 upgrade later this month. The initiative aims to reduce developer expenses while pushing throughput to new heights with creatures like Agile Coretime and Elastic Scaling. At the time of publication, DOT had dropped by nearly 5% to $4.18 following the announcement of capping the token’s supply. Despite the dip, the digital asset has surged by 4.12% in the last 7 days and increased by more than 6.65% in the past 30 days. Polkadot seeks to connect institutional investors using blockchain infrastructure As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, the company aims to strengthen its position against rivals like Ethereum through incentives such as Polkadot Capital Group. The firm launched the project on August 19, which is designed to connect institutional investors with Polkadot’s blockchain infrastructure. The initiative aims to help institutions explore crypto-related opportunities in areas like asset management, banking, venture capital, and exchanges. The crypto company said it created Polkadot Capital Group in response to rising institutional demand for digital assets and improving regulatory clarity. The project’s leader, David Sedacca, said the team is already pursuing partnerships with asset managers, brokers, and allocators. On-chain data shows that Polkadot’s trading volume over the past 24 hours is $235.3 million, representing a 51.5% decrease from the day before. Polkadot’s open interest has also dropped by 2.35% to $605 million, while its derivatives volume fell by 43% to $446.5 million.

James and his team have proven to be a dynamic and innovative partner for us, and we are extremely excited to support the Fight.ID ecosystem over the next several years,” said Grant Norris-Jones, Executive Vice President, Head of Global Partnerships at TKO. According to the company, the enhanced partnership reflects UFC’s commitment to evolving fan experiences in step with broader digital trends, especially as mixed martial arts continues to expand its global reach. “As our world continues to become more digitally enabled, there is no better time than now to invest in blockchain projects. There’s also no better time to become a UFC fan as MMA continues to capture our cultural zeitgeist,” said James Zhang, Co-Founder and CEO of Fight.ID. “As fight fans, we have long admired UFC’s grit and innovation. Over the past three years, our teams have developed incredible trust and collaboration behind building UFC’s official digital collectibles. It’s time now to expand our offerings to invite all fight fans to join the tribe of digital ownership.” The announcement marks a further step in integrating blockchain into mainstream sports, with Fight.ID positioning itself at the forefront of digital fan engagement in combat sports.

Helius, a prominent Solana infrastructure startup, has successfully raised an astounding $500 million to launch a dedicated Solana strategic investment firm. This significant capital injection, reportedly from crypto giants Pantera Capital and Summer Capital, marks a pivotal moment for the future growth and development of the Solana blockchain, as SolidIntel confirmed. What Does This Monumental Solana Strategic Investment Mean? This isn’t just another funding round; it’s a game-changer for the entire Solana network. By establishing its own investment firm, Helius is positioning itself to directly nurture and accelerate promising projects building on the Solana blockchain. This strategic move signals deep confidence in Solana’s potential and aims to foster a more robust and innovative ecosystem. Direct Ecosystem Support: The new firm will actively seek out and invest in promising Solana-based projects. Accelerated Development: Funding will help startups overcome financial hurdles, allowing them to focus on innovation and growth. Increased Adoption: A thriving ecosystem with more decentralized applications (dApps) and services naturally attracts more users to Solana. Who is Helius, and Why is Solana Strategic Investment So Crucial? Helius is a leading infrastructure provider for Solana, offering essential developer tools and APIs that simplify building on the blockchain. They possess an intimate understanding of the Solana ecosystem’s nuances and needs. Their decision to launch a dedicated Solana strategic investment firm underscores their unwavering commitment and belief in the platform’s long-term viability and scalability. Solana itself is renowned for its high transaction speeds and remarkably low costs, making it an attractive foundation for a wide array of decentralized applications, ranging from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and blockchain gaming. However, like any rapidly evolving technology, it requires continuous investment and development to fully realize its vast potential. Pantera Capital and Summer Capital: Fueling Solana’s Future The involvement of Pantera Capital and Summer Capital adds immense credibility and substantial financial muscle to this venture. Pantera Capital is a well-established and respected name in the blockchain investment space, with a proven history of backing highly successful crypto projects. Summer Capital, while perhaps less publicly visible, also brings significant resources and strategic insights to the table. Their combined commitment of half a billion dollars highlights a shared and ambitious vision for Solana’s future. This isn’t merely about achieving financial returns; it’s about strategically cultivating a vibrant developer community and fostering an innovative application landscape on Solana. How Will This Investment Shape Solana’s Landscape? The newly formed investment firm will likely focus on several key areas to bolster and expand the Solana ecosystem: Early-Stage Startups: Providing crucial seed funding and mentorship for groundbreaking ideas. Infrastructure Projects: Investing in foundational tools and services that enhance Solana’s core capabilities and reliability. User Experience Initiatives: Supporting projects that make Solana more accessible, intuitive, and user-friendly for a broader audience. Security Enhancements: Funding cutting-edge research and development into making the network even more robust and secure against threats. This proactive approach by Helius, backed by such significant capital, could lead to a rapid acceleration of development and adoption across the Solana network. It creates a powerful and positive feedback loop: more investment attracts top-tier talent, which in turn leads to the creation of better projects, ultimately attracting more users and further investment into the ecosystem. Challenges and the Road Ahead for Solana Strategic Investment While the outlook is overwhelmingly positive, launching and effectively managing a large investment firm, especially within the highly dynamic and often unpredictable crypto space, comes with its own unique set of challenges. Factors such as market volatility, evolving regulatory uncertainties, and the intensely competitive landscape will all play a significant role in its journey. However, with Helius’s deep technical understanding of Solana and the robust financial backing of experienced investors, the firm is exceptionally well-positioned to navigate these complexities. The overarching goal is clear: to identify and empower the next generation of Solana-based innovators, ensuring the network continues its impressive trajectory towards widespread adoption and innovation. In conclusion, Helius’s successful $500 million raise to establish a Solana strategic investment firm is a powerful testament to the growing confidence and belief in Solana’s ecosystem. This substantial capital, fueled by Pantera Capital and Summer Capital, is set to ignite a new wave of innovation and development, promising an exciting and prosperous future for the high-performance blockchain. It’s a clear signal that the institutional world is keenly watching and actively investing in Solana’s potential to redefine decentralized applications.

Despite warnings about high risk and volatility, some market observers predict the token could continue its upward move in the near future. The Perfect Setup Avantis (AVNT) – a cryptocurrency which saw the light of day earlier this month – made the headlines today due to its substantial price increase. It exploded by 50%, reaching a fresh peak above $1.50 and later retracing to the current $1.30 (per CoinGecko’s data). The market capitalization, which was hovering at around $170 million on September 14, skyrocketed beyond $300 million. AVNT Price, Source: CoinGecko The most likely catalyst driving the price up is the support from some of the biggest crypto exchanges. Earlier today, Binance listed AVNT with a seed tag, introducing the AVNT/USDT, AVNT/USDC, and AVNT/TRY spot trading pairs. It is important to note that this section comprises early-stage projects with high potential but also a bigger risk. That should serve as a warning to people willing to deal with such coins. “AVNT is a relatively new token that poses a higher than normal risk, and will likely be subject to high price volatility. Users must exercise sufficient risk management and DYOR (do your own research) to fully understand the project before opting to trade the token,” Binance alerted. Shortly after, the company added AVNT to its Binance Simple Earn, “Buy Crypto,” Binance Convert, and Binance Margin programs. Other popular exchanges embracing the cryptocurrency include the leading ones in South Korea – Upbit and Bithumb. The former introduced the AVNT/KRW, AVNT/BTC, and AVNT/USDT trading pairs, whereas the latter listed AVNT/KRW. The aforementioned platforms serve millions of clients, and their backing significantly enhances the token’s liquidity, accessibility, and visibility. It also strengthens its reputation, making the recent price rally anything but surprising. More Gains Ahead? Sometimes, price pumps caused by support from well-known exchanges are short-lived since a major bull run usually requires additional catalysts. However, some analysts believe AVNT can be among the exceptions, envisioning further spikes on the horizon. The X user Smith thinks the price may soon surpass $2. $AVNT repeating its cycle. +50% → +100% already delivered. Now eyeing the next +150% leg.

51768319,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=204604,1757944511,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/51768319.jpeg,Remarkable Stock Market Performance: What It Means for Crypto Investors,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/stock-market-performance-crypto/,"BitcoinWorld Remarkable Stock Market Performance: What It Means for Crypto Investors In the dynamic world of finance, where every market move sends ripples, the latest update from the U.S. stock indexes offers a fascinating insight. As a cryptocurrency investor, you might wonder, “Why should I care about traditional stocks?” The truth is, the overall Stock Market Performance often serves as a significant barometer for broader investor sentiment, which can, in turn, influence the volatile crypto landscape. Let’s dive into what these gains mean for you. Understanding the Positive Stock Market Performance Today, the three major U.S. stock indexes opened higher, signaling a robust start to the trading day. This positive momentum often reflects growing investor confidence and a ‘risk-on’ appetite, which can be a good sign for assets across the board, including cryptocurrencies. S&P 500: +0.34% – This broad market index, representing 500 of the largest U.S. publicly traded companies, is often seen as a bellwether for the overall economy. Its rise suggests widespread optimism. Nasdaq Composite: +0.45% – Heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks, a strong Nasdaq indicates investor enthusiasm for innovation and future earnings potential, areas often paralleled in the crypto space. Dow Jones Industrial Average: +0.03% – Comprising 30 significant U.S. companies, the Dow’s positive opening, while modest, contributes to the overall bullish sentiment. Such a collective uplift in Stock Market Performance usually points to favorable economic conditions or positive news driving market participants. How Does Strong Stock Market Performance Influence Crypto? While often seen as distinct, the cryptocurrency market doesn’t operate in a vacuum. It frequently correlates with traditional markets, especially during periods of significant macroeconomic shifts. When investors feel confident in traditional assets like stocks, they might be more willing to allocate capital to higher-risk, higher-reward assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. This phenomenon is often referred to as a ‘risk-on’ environment. In such times, investors are less inclined to hold onto safe-haven assets and more eager to seek growth. Conversely, a downturn in Stock Market Performance can lead to a ‘risk-off’ sentiment, prompting investors to pull funds from speculative assets, including crypto. For example, if tech stocks are performing well, it can sometimes spill over into excitement for blockchain technology and digital assets, as both sectors are perceived as future-oriented and innovative. Therefore, monitoring the traditional markets provides valuable context for your crypto investment strategy. Navigating the Nuances: Challenges and Opportunities from Stock Market Performance However, the relationship isn’t always straightforward. There are times when crypto markets might decouple from traditional stocks, driven by unique factors such as regulatory news, specific technological advancements, or major network upgrades within the crypto ecosystem. This divergence highlights the unique characteristics of digital assets. Despite potential decoupling, a consistently strong Stock Market Performance generally fosters a positive backdrop. It suggests that liquidity is ample and investors are generally in a buying mood. This can create opportunities for crypto investors to see renewed interest and capital inflows into their digital portfolios. It’s crucial to remember that while correlations exist, each market has its own drivers. Therefore, relying solely on stock market indicators for crypto decisions can be risky. A holistic approach, combining macro-economic analysis with crypto-specific fundamentals, is always recommended. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Amidst Positive Stock Market Performance So, what can you, as a crypto investor, take away from today’s positive stock market opening? Monitor Investor Sentiment: Use strong stock market days as an indicator of overall market optimism. This might signal a more favorable environment for crypto. Watch for Capital Flow: Observe if this positive sentiment translates into increased trading volumes or price action in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

It’s about connecting the dots between seemingly disparate markets to gain a comprehensive view. Today’s higher opening in the U.S. stock indexes is a compelling reminder of the interconnectedness of global financial markets. While cryptocurrencies have their own unique drivers, a positive Stock Market Performance often sets an optimistic tone for investors, potentially spilling over into the digital asset space. By staying informed about both traditional and crypto markets, you can better anticipate trends and position your portfolio for success. The journey of understanding these intricate relationships is truly remarkable , offering a deeper perspective on your investment decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‘risk-on’ sentiment mean in financial markets? A1: ‘Risk-on’ sentiment refers to a market environment where investors are more willing to take on higher-risk assets, such as stocks and cryptocurrencies, in pursuit of greater returns. This often occurs during periods of economic optimism. Q2: How closely does Stock Market Performance correlate with cryptocurrency prices? A2: The correlation varies. Historically, during periods of high economic uncertainty, both markets might fall together. In bullish times, strong stock market performance can often coincide with crypto gains due to shared investor sentiment and liquidity. However, specific crypto events can cause divergence. Q3: Should I adjust my crypto strategy solely based on stock market movements? A3: While stock market performance offers valuable context, it should not be the sole basis for your crypto strategy. Cryptocurrencies have unique drivers, including technological developments, regulatory changes, and community sentiment. A balanced approach considering both macro and crypto-specific factors is advisable. Q4: Which stock index is most relevant for crypto investors to watch? A4: Many crypto investors pay close attention to the Nasdaq Composite due to its heavy weighting in technology and growth stocks. These sectors often share investor enthusiasm with innovative assets like cryptocurrencies. Q5: What are some signs that crypto might decouple from traditional Stock Market Performance? A5: Decoupling can be indicated by significant crypto-specific news (e.g., major adoption announcements, regulatory shifts, or technological breakthroughs) that cause crypto prices to move independently of traditional stock market trends.

Binance has confirmed the listing of ZKC perpetual futures , a move set to ignite significant interest among traders. This new trading pair, ZKC/USDT, will go live at 2:00 p.m. UTC today, offering substantial leverage opportunities. What Exactly Are ZKC Perpetual Futures, Anyway? For those new to the concept, perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiration date. Unlike traditional futures, they do not expire, hence the term ‘perpetual’. This means traders can hold their positions for as long as they wish, provided they maintain sufficient margin. The upcoming listing involves ZKC perpetual futures , indicating that ZKC is a new or emerging cryptocurrency project that will now be accessible for derivatives trading on Binance. This provides a way for traders to gain exposure to ZKC’s price movements without actually owning the underlying asset. A key feature of this listing is the availability of up to 75x leverage. Leverage allows traders to open larger positions with a relatively small amount of capital. While this can amplify potential profits, it also significantly magnifies potential losses, making it a double-edged sword that requires careful consideration. Why Is This Binance Listing a Significant Development? Binance’s decision to list ZKC perpetual futures is a powerful signal of confidence in the ZKC project and its potential market demand. As a leading exchange, Binance brings immense liquidity and a vast user base to any asset it lists. This listing will likely: Boost ZKC’s Visibility: A listing on Binance’s perpetual futures market dramatically increases ZKC’s exposure to a global audience of professional and retail traders. Enhance Liquidity: More trading activity means deeper order books, making it easier for traders to enter and exit positions without significant price slippage. Offer Flexible Trading Strategies: Traders can now go long (bet on price increases) or short (bet on price decreases) on ZKC, allowing for more sophisticated strategies to capitalize on market volatility. Attract Institutional Interest: High-leverage products on reputable exchanges can sometimes draw attention from larger trading firms looking for new opportunities. This move underscores Binance’s continuous effort to expand its offerings and provide diverse trading instruments to its users. It also reflects the growing maturity and innovation within the decentralized finance (DeFi) and broader crypto ecosystem, where new projects like ZKC are constantly emerging. Navigating the Risks: What Traders Need to Know About High Leverage? While the opportunity to trade ZKC perpetual futures with up to 75x leverage sounds appealing, it comes with substantial risks that every trader must understand. High leverage can lead to rapid and significant losses, potentially wiping out an entire trading account in volatile market conditions. Consider these critical aspects: Magnified Losses: A small adverse price movement can result in a large percentage loss on your leveraged position. Liquidation Risk: If your position moves against you and your margin falls below a certain threshold, your position will be automatically liquidated by the exchange to prevent further losses, often at an unfavorable price. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, especially newer ones, are known for their extreme price swings. These fluctuations are amplified when trading with high leverage. Funding Rates: Perpetual futures contracts involve funding rates, which are periodic payments exchanged between long and short traders to keep the contract price close to the spot price. These can eat into your profits or add to your costs. Therefore, approaching leveraged trading with a robust risk management strategy is not just advisable, but essential for protecting your capital. Actionable Insights for Trading ZKC Perpetual Futures Responsibly For traders looking to engage with ZKC perpetual futures , a thoughtful approach is crucial. Here are some actionable insights to help navigate this new opportunity: Start Small: Do not commit a large portion of your capital, especially when first experimenting with a new asset and high leverage. Begin with a small position to understand the market dynamics. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: Always use stop-loss orders to automatically close your position if the price moves beyond a predetermined level, limiting potential losses. Conduct Thorough Research: Understand what ZKC is, its underlying technology, use cases, team, and market sentiment before trading. Don’t just trade on hype. Educate Yourself on Perpetual Futures: If you’re unfamiliar with these derivatives, take the time to learn how they work, including margin requirements, funding rates, and liquidation mechanisms. Manage Your Risk: Only risk capital you can afford to lose. Avoid emotional trading and stick to a predefined trading plan. By adopting a disciplined and informed approach, traders can better position themselves to potentially benefit from the new ZKC perpetual futures listing while mitigating the inherent risks. A New Chapter for ZKC and Binance Traders The listing of ZKC perpetual futures on Binance marks an important milestone for both the ZKC project and the broader crypto derivatives market. It offers a fresh avenue for traders to engage with a new asset, providing opportunities for capital growth through leveraged positions. However, the allure of high leverage must always be balanced with a clear understanding of the magnified risks involved. As the market goes live today at 2:00 p.m. UTC, traders are encouraged to exercise caution, employ sound risk management practices, and stay informed. The crypto market is dynamic and full of possibilities, but successful navigation requires both knowledge and prudence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are ZKC perpetual futures? ZKC perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on the price movements of the ZKC cryptocurrency without owning the actual asset. They differ from traditional futures because they do not have an expiration date, enabling traders to hold positions indefinitely, subject to margin requirements. What does ‘up to 75x leverage’ mean? Up to 75x leverage means you can open a trading position worth 75 times the amount of capital you actually put down as margin. For example, with $100 of your own capital, you could control a position worth $7,500. While this can amplify profits, it also equally magnifies losses. When will ZKC perpetual futures be available for trading on Binance? Binance announced that ZKC/USDT perpetual futures will be listed and available for trading starting today, at 2:00 p.m. UTC. What are the main risks of trading ZKC perpetual futures with high leverage? The primary risks include significant potential for amplified losses, liquidation of your entire position if the market moves against you, and exposure to the high volatility inherent in cryptocurrency markets. Funding rates can also impact your profitability. How can I mitigate risks when trading ZKC perpetual futures? To mitigate risks, it is crucial to use stop-loss orders, start with small position sizes, thoroughly research the ZKC project, understand the mechanics of perpetual futures, and never risk more capital than you can comfortably afford to lose.

51768923,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=809239,1757944816,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51768923.jpeg,Crypto business operators face prison time in new bill proposed in Poland,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/prison-time-for-crypto-in-poland/,"Anyone providing crypto services without permission may spend time in prison, on top of a hefty fine, according to a draft provision put forward by lawmakers in Poland. The proposal comes ahead of a second reading of the country’s upcoming cryptocurrency legislation that has already drawn serious criticism for threatening the survival of domestic platforms. Controversial text set to enter Poland’s crypto law Dealing with cryptocurrencies may soon become a risky undertaking in Poland, where a proposed legislative amendment seeks to hit unlicensed crypto operations with monetary penalties and even prison sentences. The new provision, suggested by three parliamentarians from the center-right conservative Civic Platform party, may completely block the development of the Web3 sector, leading Polish crypto news portal Bitcoin.pl warned in a report on Monday. The text, submitted by Joanna Frydrych, Dorota Marek and Krystyna Skowrońska, reads: “Whoever, without being authorized to do so, conducts activities related to the provision of services in the field of crypto assets … shall be subject to a fine of up to PLN 5,000,000 or imprisonment for up to 5 years, or both.” The total in Polish złoty, equal to nearly $1.4 million, is a massive amount for small local crypto businesses. The other potential punishment is also very harsh. Prison sentences cannot be shorter than 6 months, the article highlighted. The Sejm, the lower house of parliament in Poland, approved the bill on first reading earlier this summer and referred it to the Public Finance Committee for further refinement. The long-awaited legislation seeks to transpose the European Union’s new rules under the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation into national law. Both have been already criticized by members of the Polish crypto community. In August, a report predicted that MiCA compliance costs will close down up to 90% of exchanges in the country, Eastern Europe’s largest crypto market. They may have to spend up to 3 million złoty (around $800,000) on obtaining a license alone. Representatives of the crypto sector have complained that the draft law goes even beyond the MiCA standards. One of the debated proposals was to impose a 0.5% fee on the revenues of domestic coin trading platforms, which is not required by the EU. Cryptocurrency bill stirs Polish society Besides the crypto industry, opposition politicians have also attacked the government’s regulatory move. Among them, Law and Justice party lawmakers Janusz Kowalski and Michał Moskal, who recently proposed to cap the licensing fee at €10,000 (less than $12,000) Poland’s newly elected President Karol Nawrocki, who assumed office last month, is expected to veto the law if it’s adopted in its current form, as previously reported by Cryptopolitan. Commenting on the latest addition to the draft, Polish economist Prof. Krzysztof Piech alleged that the new provision can result in strange situations, when people who simply train their friends to work with cryptocurrencies are punished. It can also prevent stores from accepting crypto payments or Polish artists from issuing non-fungible tokens (NFTs), noted the prominent academic who focuses on finance. Piech, who is the head of the Blockchain Technology Center at Warsaw’s Lazarski University, was also quoted as stating: “This regulation is a legal nightmare. It uses a nuclear weapon designed to combat large, unlicensed exchanges and targets ordinary people with it – hobbyists, artists, lecturers, and small entrepreneurs.” Introducing a minimum prison sentence for acts, the “criminal” nature of which is often the result of ignorance and unclear definitions (and lack of money for lawyers), is a hallmark of totalitarian systems, “not a rule of law,” he insisted. According to Jacek Walewski, the author of the article and an organizer of public crypto consultations at the Sejm, it’s hard to understand what Polish politicians want. “Their ideas for regulating the cryptocurrency market in Poland are becoming increasingly bizarre! It’s as if MPs want to discourage Poles from using cryptocurrencies,” he concluded.

Key Ichimoku indicators continue to align in favor of the bulls, reinforcing the strength behind the trend. Pullback Fails To Shake Bullish Structure Trader Tardigrade, an analyst on X, noted in a recent update that Dogecoin (DOGE) has seen a pullback after reaching its recent high. Despite this retracement, the overall structure remains firm, suggesting that the market still favors strength on the higher timeframes. Related Reading: Dogecoin In Buy Zone: Bulls Eye $0.34 As Immediate Target According to the analysis, the Ichimoku indicators continue to show strong alignment. This setup reinforces the bullish outlook, as the cloud and key lines continue to support ongoing momentum. The update also highlighted that five previous long trades remain highly profitable. With the bullish conditions holding, there has been no reason to exit these positions yet. The consistency of these profitable trades underscores the reliability of the Ichimoku signals in tracking Dogecoin’s performance. However, the analyst made it clear that profit-taking will only be triggered by a bearish signal. Specifically, attention is on the potential for a Tenkan-sen/Kijun-sen cross, the Conversion line moving below the Base line, which would indicate a shift in momentum. Key Levels And Uptrend Score Furthermore, Trader Tardigrade outlined the key support levels for DOGE based on Ichimoku analysis. The Kijun-sen offers immediate support at $0.24770, while a broader support zone lies between $0.21517 and $0.22400 at the Kumo cloud. These levels are seen as critical areas where buyers may step in to maintain the bullish structure. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bullish Kumo Breakout, But Can DOGE Overcome The $0.23804 Barrier? The analyst also noted the significance of the Kumo cloud’s current color, which is green. This reflects a bullish bias in the market and adds another layer of confirmation to the ongoing uptrend. With the cloud trending positively, momentum appears to favor the bulls. Breaking down the trends further, the short-term outlook shows price trading above the Kijun-sen, signaling continued upward pressure. In the mid-term, DOGE remains above the Kumo cloud, further strengthening the case for sustained bullish momentum. On the long-term chart, the Chikou Span is positioned above the price, which reinforces the broader uptrend. Altogether, these conditions result in an overall Ichimoku score of +4, indicating a strong uptrend across multiple timeframes. Such alignment suggests that Dogecoin is well-positioned to extend its strength if support levels hold. In summary, the technical data presented by Trader Tardigrade corroborates his earlier assessment. DOGE’s current position, supported by a perfect alignment of bullish indicators and a total score of +4, confirms a strong uptrend.

Cloud Mining: A Stable Cash Flow Tool in a Volatile Market Compared to direct investment or frequent trading, cloud mining offers an alternative investment strategy: low barriers to entry and predictable returns . Investors don’t need to purchase mining machines or bear electricity costs; they can participate in mining by leasing computing power. The advantages of a multi-currency platform include: Risk diversification: No reliance on price fluctuations of a single currency Flexible configuration: Choose contracts based on your capital level and preferences Sustainable returns: Daily profit settlement provides a stable cash flow Fleet Mining Platform Overview and Advantages Fleet Mining is a multi-currency cloud mining platform that has recently attracted attention due to market fluctuations in major cryptocurrencies such as XRP. Its main advantages are as follows: Newbie-friendly: Sign up and receive a $15 bonus, with a zero-cost trial run. Flexible short-term contracts: Contracts last as little as two days, reducing the risk of fund freezes. Transparent pricing: All fees and dividends are publicly available on the official website. AI computing power optimization: Intelligent scheduling improves mining efficiency and reduces inefficient mining. Multi-currency support: BTC, ETH, USDT, XRP, DOGE, BNB, and more. Green and sustainable: The mining farm uses 100% renewable energy and meets carbon neutral standards. If you’re looking for guaranteed returns in a volatile market, you can refer to the practical cloud mining guide , starting with a small amount and then gradually expanding. Fleet Mining Contract Example Plan Investment Daily Return Duration (days) Total Return Starter Miner $100 $3.00 2 $106 Starter Miner $500 $6.25 5 $531.25 Standard Miner $3,000 $45.00 15 $3,675 Standard Miner $6,000 $96.00 20 $7,920 Advanced Miner $30,000 $540.00 45 $54,300 Advanced Miner $200,000 $3,800 55 $409,000 Advanced Miner $300,000 $6,000 60 $660,000 The contracts cover from entry-level trials to high-value turnover, and investors can flexibly choose according to their budget and affordability.

Risk and Reward Considerations Volatility Risk: XRP prices may fluctuate in the short term, but cloud mining yields are relatively stable. Liquidity Risk: Short-term contracts can reduce the risk of long-term fund freezes. Technical Risk: AI-powered computing scheduling can mitigate efficiency losses, but platform selection remains crucial. Example: Investor Alice invested $500 in a 5-day Starter Miner contract, earning $6.25 per day and a total return of $531.25, a 6.25% return rate. This eliminates the need to directly buy XRP and risk price fluctuations. Common Misconceptions and Corrections Misconception 1: Cloud mining is equivalent to direct cryptocurrency speculation Correction: Cloud mining generates mining revenue through computing power leasing, and the source of this revenue is relatively independent of short-term cryptocurrency price fluctuations. Misconception 2: High returns necessarily come with high risks Correction: Short-term contracts and small trials can help manage risk. Misconception 3: All platforms are trustworthy Correction: Choosing platforms with transparent contracts, AI optimization, and green mining farms is more reliable. Summary The XRP price has broken through $3.05, and the ETF has been approved, bringing active trading and institutional capital inflows to the market. However, short-term volatility remains significant. Multi-currency cloud mining platforms like Fleet Mining, with their flexible short-term contracts, daily dividends, and AI-optimized computing power, offer investors a solution for maintaining stable cash flow in volatile markets. For both novice and experienced investors, allocating a portion of their funds to cloud mining can help diversify risk and generate stable returns.

Peter Brandt, who has 50 years of experience, shared his analysis of Elon Musk-backed Dogecoin (DOGE). Accordingly, Brandt identified a bullish price trend for Dogecoin, the largest memecoin by market capitalization. At this point, Brandt expressed his reaction to Dogecoin surpassing $0.30 over the weekend, describing Dogecoin’s recent surge as “tremendous.” While Brandt highlighted DOGE's success, Dogecoin has been the best-performing altcoin among the top 15 assets by market capitalization over the last seven days. DOGE’s over 21% surge surpassed Solana’s 17%, Sui’s 9.63%, and HYPE’s 10% surge, which were the biggest gains outside of Dogecoin. Moreover, this increase in the Dogecoin price occurred despite the delay in the launch of the Rex Osprey Dogecoin ETF. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas had previously stated that the DOGE ETF would launch on Thursday last week. However, contrary to expectations, the DOGE launch didn't happen and was postponed until later. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart suggested this week for the launch. Seyffart announced that the DOGE ETF would likely launch on September 18th. Related News: Dogecoin ETF Approval Expectations Fail: Launch Postponed!

Nasdaq-listed insurtech company Reliance Global Group (RELI) has just announced a groundbreaking plan to make a significant Reliance Global Group crypto investment . The company intends to purchase up to $120 million in various cryptocurrencies, signaling a bold step into the future of finance. Understanding the Reliance Global Group Crypto Investment Strategy This isn’t just a casual dip into the crypto waters; it’s a carefully planned, two-phase process. Reliance Global Group is demonstrating a strategic approach to integrating digital assets into its portfolio. What exactly does this involve? Targeted Assets: The company plans to acquire leading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). These selections highlight a focus on established and high-potential digital assets. Phased Approach: The investment will unfold in two distinct phases, suggesting a methodical execution rather than an abrupt market entry. This allows for flexibility and adaptation to market conditions. Expert Oversight: To manage this substantial Reliance Global Group crypto investment , the company has formed a dedicated cryptocurrency advisory board. This board will provide expert guidance, ensuring informed decisions and robust risk management. The establishment of an advisory board is a critical detail. It underscores the company’s commitment to due diligence and expertise in a rapidly evolving market. It’s a move that adds a layer of credibility and professionalism to their venture. Why Are Traditional Companies Embracing Crypto? The news of Reliance Global Group’s move isn’t isolated. We’re seeing an increasing trend of traditional companies, from tech giants to financial institutions, exploring or directly investing in cryptocurrencies. But what drives this shift? Several factors contribute to this growing interest: Diversification: Cryptocurrencies can offer an alternative asset class, helping companies diversify their portfolios and potentially reduce overall risk exposure to traditional markets. Inflation Hedge: Many view Bitcoin, in particular, as a potential hedge against inflation, similar to digital gold. Growth Potential: Despite volatility, digital assets have shown incredible growth potential over the past decade, attracting investors seeking higher returns. Technological Innovation: Investing in crypto also means engaging with cutting-edge blockchain technology, which can open doors to new business models and innovations. For an insurtech company like RELI, a Reliance Global Group crypto investment could also signify an exploration into future applications of blockchain within the insurance industry, such as smart contracts or decentralized insurance protocols. Navigating the Digital Frontier: Challenges and Opportunities While the opportunities are vast, entering the cryptocurrency market also comes with its own set of challenges. Any significant Reliance Global Group crypto investment must consider these factors: Market Volatility: Crypto markets are known for their price swings. A $120 million investment requires a strong stomach and a long-term perspective. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, presenting uncertainties that companies must navigate carefully. Security Concerns: Safeguarding large crypto holdings from hacks and cyber threats is paramount. The advisory board will likely play a key role in establishing robust security protocols. However, the potential rewards often outweigh these risks for companies willing to innovate. The ability to be an early mover in a transformative technology can provide a significant competitive advantage and position Reliance Global Group for future success in the digital economy. What’s Next for This Strategic Move? The announcement by Reliance Global Group is certainly a milestone. As the company proceeds with its two-phase acquisition process, the crypto community will be watching closely. Will this inspire more traditional firms to follow suit? This Reliance Global Group crypto investment could potentially: Boost investor confidence in the broader crypto market, especially among institutional players. Influence other insurtech companies to explore similar digital asset strategies. Solidify the role of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana as preferred institutional investment vehicles.

The post quickly gained traction among crypto enthusiasts, but the numbers behind such a claim reveal how extraordinary that milestone would be. The $100 Target XRP’s current price is hovering around $2.99, with approximately 59.61 billion coins in circulation. This gives it a market capitalization of roughly $178 billion, positioning it as a significant player in the cryptocurrency market. A jump to $100 per token would push XRP’s market value to roughly $5.96 trillion. To put things into perspective, the overall cryptocurrency market currently sits at approximately $4 trillion. For comparison, Apple, the world’s largest publicly traded company, has a market capitalization of around $3.5 trillion, giving a sense of the scale involved with major digital assets and traditional market leaders. Achieving a $100 price would therefore require a single digital asset to surpass the size of the entire crypto market and any existing corporation. Buy as many #XRP as you can because $100 per XRP will happen sooner than you think! pic.twitter.com/lA7uRKqdlP — JackTheRippler ©️ (@RippleXrpie) September 14, 2025 Drivers Behind the Bullish Call JackTheRippler attributes his optimism to several factors: increasing regulatory clarity in the United States, Ripple’s ongoing product expansion, and broader institutional adoption of the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Recent legal developments have indeed reduced the regulatory cloud that long hung over Ripple. The protracted SEC v. Ripple case concluded last month after both parties withdrew their appeals , eliminating a major source of uncertainty. Ripple has also been expanding its ecosystem. The company unveiled RLUSD, its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, in December 2024, and activated the XRPL EVM sidechain around mid-2025, bringing smart contract features to the platform. Ripple continues to highlight hundreds of institutional customers using its payment solutions, underscoring XRP’s growing utility beyond simple speculation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Reality Check on Scale and Timing While these developments strengthen the fundamental narrative for XRP, the leap from $3 to $100 is unprecedented. To sustain a multi-trillion-dollar market cap, XRP would need massive inflows of global capital, dramatic increases in liquidity, and a significant redistribution of token holdings. Crypto markets have demonstrated their capacity for dramatic shifts, yet sustaining such a valuation would necessitate a worldwide redistribution of wealth into a single digital asset. The Bottom Line JackTheRippler’s forecast captures the enthusiasm of a community that has long believed XRP will play a central role in global finance. The regulatory progress and Ripple’s product rollouts provide tangible reasons for optimism. Still, the mathematics of a $100 XRP illustrates the extraordinary scale of such a move. Investors should view the claim as a bold expression of bullish sentiment rather than an inevitable outcome.

Just as the cryptocurrency world champions transparency and verifiable ownership, the realm of global commerce grapples with a shadow economy fueled by counterfeiting . This challenge, once seemingly insurmountable, is now being tackled head-on by innovative technologies. MarqVision, an AI-powered startup, recently made headlines by securing a monumental $48 million Series B round, marking a significant triumph in its mission to safeguard brands and redefine brand protection in the digital age. This story isn’t just about a successful funding round; it’s about a Harvard Law student’s audacious vision to leverage cutting-edge AI to solve a multi-trillion-dollar problem. The Trillion-Dollar Threat: Why Counterfeiting Demands a New Approach Imagine a global criminal enterprise worth over $3 trillion annually, accounting for approximately 8% of all global commerce. This isn’t a dystopian novel; it’s the staggering reality of counterfeiting, a pervasive issue that touches nearly every industry, from luxury fashion and pharmaceuticals to gaming and consumer electronics. Mark Lee, while a law student at Harvard, stumbled upon this colossal problem, a revelation that steered him away from a traditional legal career and onto an unexpected entrepreneurial path. He realized that traditional legal remedies were often too slow and reactive to combat an industry growing at 20% per year, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic pushed more commerce online, amplifying the problem across marketplaces and social media platforms. The impact of counterfeiting extends far beyond lost revenue for brands: Consumer Risk: Counterfeit goods can be dangerous, especially in sectors like pharmaceuticals, automotive parts, and electronics, posing significant health and safety risks. Brand Erosion: Fake products dilute brand value, damage reputation, and erode consumer trust. Economic Drain: It funnels money away from legitimate businesses, stifles innovation, and often funds other criminal activities. Legal Complexities: The global nature of counterfeiting makes legal enforcement incredibly challenging, requiring cross-border cooperation and sophisticated detection methods. Lee’s insight was clear: this universal problem required a universal, technological solution. His passion for computer vision became the foundation for MarqVision, a name cleverly combining ‘trademark’ (Marq) and ‘computer vision’ (Vision), signaling its core mission to combat trademark infringement and counterfeiting on an unprecedented scale. How AI Powers the Next Generation of Digital Guardians At the heart of MarqVision’s success lies its sophisticated application of AI , particularly computer vision technology. This isn’t just about simple image matching; it’s about developing intelligent systems capable of identifying nuanced patterns, logos, product features, and contextual clues that signify a counterfeit item or an infringing digital presence. The startup’s journey began with a focus on detecting and removing fake products online, a labor-intensive process traditionally requiring extensive human oversight. MarqVision’s AI-driven platform performs several critical functions: Automated Detection: Scans vast swathes of the internet – e-commerce sites, social media, forums – for unauthorized use of brand assets, including logos, product images, and copyrighted content. Deep Learning Analysis: Utilizes advanced deep learning models to understand product variations, identify subtle counterfeit characteristics, and even predict emerging infringement trends. Scalable Enforcement: Automates the process of sending takedown notices and managing disputes, significantly accelerating the removal of infringing content. Generative AI Integration: The fresh capital will further accelerate the integration of generative AI across its product suite, enhancing automation and predictive capabilities, potentially even generating synthetic data for better model training or assisting in legal document generation for enforcement. The shift toward leveraging AI for execution rather than just efficiency is a game-changer. As Mark Lee aptly points out, AI is expanding the total addressable market for software from mere efficiency tools into the actual execution of work, unlocking a market opportunity estimated at over $10 trillion. This fundamental transformation of service delivery is what attracted top-tier investors, seeing MarqVision not just as a software company, but as a leader in the burgeoning AI-led services space. A Monumental Leap: MarqVision’s Strategic Startup Funding Round Fast forward to 2025, and MarqVision has cemented its position as a formidable force in the brand protection landscape. The LA-headquartered AI startup recently closed a substantial $48 million Series B round, bringing its total capital raised to an impressive $90 million. This significant injection of startup funding underscores investor confidence in MarqVision’s technology, market traction, and ambitious vision. The funding round was led by prominent venture capital firms, including Peak XV Partners (formerly Sequoia Capital India & SEA), with strong participation from Salesforce Ventures, HSG (formerly Sequoia China), Coral Capital, and Michael Seibel, partner emeritus at Y Combinator. Returning backers like YC, Altos Ventures, and Atinum Investment also reaffirmed their commitment. This diverse group of investors highlights the global appeal and strategic importance of MarqVision’s mission. The allocation of the fresh capital is strategic and forward-looking: Allocation Amount (approx.) Purpose AI & Engineering Teams $24 Million Accelerate automation, integrate generative AI, enhance core technology. Enterprise Readiness $10 Million Scale platform for larger brands, develop features for enterprise clients. Regional Expansion $10 Million Enter new markets like Japan, strengthen presence in U.S., Korea, China, Europe. Operational Growth $4 Million General operational expenses, market penetration strategies. MarqVision’s rapid growth is a testament to its market fit, achieving $1 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) within eight months, $10 million in three years, and recently crossing $20 million ARR after four years, consistently doubling annually. Their ambitious goal of reaching $100 million ARR by mid-2027 reflects their confidence in their scalable, AI-driven foundation and commitment to customer experience. Beyond Detection: The Evolution of Holistic Brand Protection MarqVision’s journey began with a focus on fighting counterfeits, but its vision has expanded significantly. The company recognized that true brand protection extends beyond mere detection and removal of infringements. It’s about empowering brands with comprehensive control over their digital presence and, crucially, helping them recover lost revenue. Initially, Mark Lee envisioned a $5 billion software company, selling specialized tools to IP teams. However, mentorship from YC partner Michael Seibel pushed him to think bigger – to reimagine the entire workflow for IP and brand professionals. This led MarqVision to pivot towards end-to-end managed services, an opportunity Lee now believes is 100 times larger than his original plan. This holistic approach to brand protection encompasses: Infringement Detection & Removal: Identifying and eliminating counterfeits, unauthorized resellers, impersonations, and copyright violations across e-commerce, social media, and chat platforms. Revenue Recovery: Many clients report a roughly 5% boost in sales after implementing MarqVision’s platform, making it valuable not only to legal teams but also to go-to-market organizations focused on revenue impact. Digital Presence Control: Giving companies the tools to actively manage how their brand appears and is represented across all digital channels. Brand Intelligence: Future roadmap includes offering deeper insights into supply chains, pricing strategies, and reseller networks, providing actionable data for strategic business decisions. This redefinition of ‘services’ by AI, bringing software-like scalability and efficiency, has captivated investors. MarqVision is transforming what was once considered an unappealing category in technology into a dynamic, high-growth sector, drawing strong competition in its latest funding round. Securing Tomorrow’s Assets: The Future of Intellectual Property with AI The proliferation of digital content and e-commerce has made safeguarding intellectual property more complex and critical than ever before. Traditional methods are simply insufficient to keep pace with the scale and sophistication of modern infringers. MarqVision’s success story is a powerful illustration of how AI is not just augmenting human capabilities but fundamentally transforming the landscape of IP enforcement and management. Mark Lee’s ambitious vision is clear: “Our vision is to be the backbone of every global brand that owns IP – becoming the AI-led services platform for IP, content, and brand professionals worldwide.” This goes beyond simply protecting trademarks; it encompasses a broader commitment to securing all forms of intellectual property in an increasingly digital and borderless world. As companies expand their digital footprints, the need for robust, AI-powered solutions to monitor, protect, and manage their IP assets will only intensify. The implications of MarqVision’s approach for the future of intellectual property are profound: Proactive Protection: Moving from reactive takedowns to proactive identification and mitigation of threats. Global Scalability: Enabling brands to protect their IP seamlessly across diverse international markets and platforms. Data-Driven Insights: Providing valuable intelligence that helps brands understand the infringement landscape and adapt their strategies. Empowering Professionals: Freeing up legal and brand teams from tedious manual tasks, allowing them to focus on higher-value strategic work. As the digital economy continues to evolve, powered by innovations in AI and global connectivity, the importance of robust intellectual property protection will only grow. MarqVision stands at the forefront of this evolution, demonstrating how a visionary approach, backed by powerful technology and strategic startup funding , can tackle some of the most persistent and costly challenges facing global commerce today. MarqVision’s journey from a Harvard Law revelation to a leading AI-driven brand protection powerhouse is a testament to the transformative power of technology when applied to real-world problems. By securing $48 million in a strategic funding round, the company is poised to accelerate its mission, integrating advanced AI and expanding its global reach. This triumph not only signifies a major milestone for MarqVision but also heralds a new era for brand protection, where AI doesn’t just assist but leads the charge against counterfeiting and infringement, safeguarding brand integrity and boosting revenue for businesses worldwide.

Over the last month, however, Bitcoin has shed 2.58%, moving in a wide range between $107,000 and $119,000. Finbold’s AI prediction agent has projected that Bitcoin will trade at $118,167 by October 1, 2025, suggesting a gain of 2.7% from today’s price of $115,056. At present, BTC is changing hands just over three thousand dollars below the forecasted level. To reach this projection, Finbold’s AI agent drew on several large language models, including GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and Grok 3. By blending outputs from multiple models, the system delivers an averaged forecast designed to iron out inconsistencies and provide a more reliable view of the market. Finbold’s AI prediction agent BTC forecast. Source: Finbold The analysis also incorporated momentum-based indicators such as MACD, RSI, Stochastic oscillator, MACD slope, and the 50- and 200-day simple moving averages. Within this framework, Grok 3 suggested the most optimistic path with a 2.99% rise, while GPT-4o leaned more conservatively at 2.12%. BTC market activity Market activity remains robust alongside these forecasts. Trading volume in the past twenty-four hours reached $46.66 billion, marking a 48% increase. Bitcoin’s fully diluted valuation currently stands at $2.4 trillion, with a volume-to-market cap ratio of 2.02%. This backdrop is further shaped by the wider digital asset landscape. The Altcoin Index has climbed to 72 out of 100, a local high that reflects rising appetite for alternatives, even as Bitcoin dominance has slipped to near a seven-month low. Market commentators are paying close attention to these dynamics. Well-known analyst Michaël van de Poppe described the current setup as “very classic price action prior to the FOMC meeting.” He noted that it is common for both Bitcoin and altcoins to correct into the event, stressing that dips in this phase can be opportunities rather than causes for panic. In his view, Bitcoin is now confronting its final resistance before a potential breakout. “Breaking through the $117.5K–$118K and we’ll be going towards a new ATH,” he said. #Bitcoin faces the final resistance before we're going to be seeing a new all-time high. Breaking through the $117.5K-118K and we'll be going towards a new ATH.

If Bitcoin manages to decisively clear this level, it would not only validate Finbold’s AI target but also open the door to a renewed push toward record highs. With market momentum building and volatility elevated ahead of the FOMC meeting, the coming weeks could prove decisive in shaping the next phase of Bitcoin’s trajectory.

These new restrictions will also hit firms in China and India accused of helping Moscow move crude, as pressure builds from President Donald Trump, who over the weekend said he’s ready to slap “major” sanctions on Russia’s oil exports if the EU doesn’t stall again. Trump made it clear that the energy revenue funding Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine needs to be shut off, and quickly. “Europe has to move,” Trump said, warning that his administration’s sanctions will only kick in if European countries match the pressure. Crude imports from Russia have already plummeted in Europe, from 27% before the war to just 3% last year after 2022’s early sanctions, but natural gas is still flowing, especially to Hungary and Slovakia, which were granted temporary exemptions. The EU’s sanctions draft includes six Russian banks and energy firms, plus full blocking of Russia’s credit card systems, and a wave of new rules targeting crypto exchanges still doing business with the Kremlin. These platforms, mostly unnamed for now, are reportedly being used to move funds tied to Russian energy companies that are under older restrictions. The package also goes after refined products made from Russian crude, which would hit India and Turkey, two countries processing huge volumes of Moscow’s oil and sending diesel back into the European market. Trump pitches 100% tariffs while Hungary and India brace The United States has already pitched its plan to the Group of Seven. It includes tariffs of up to 100% on China and India, both of which continue buying oil from Russia. Trump’s team is pressing G7 leaders to act in “the coming weeks,” aiming to hammer the networks enabling Russia’s crude trade. For Brussels, this puts them in a tight spot: while they’ve criticized Moscow, they still rely heavily on Chinese markets and are trying to wrap up a trade deal with India. Hungary is especially exposed. Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has spent the last three years doubling down on Russian energy, could lose a lot if the exemptions disappear. The country has also gone deep into Chinese manufacturing, especially in the electric vehicle and battery sectors. “The US can really give a checkmate to Orban on Russian energy, if it wants to,” said Andras Deak, a researcher at the National Public Service University in Budapest. Andras warned that companies like Mol Nyrt., which supplies Slovakia’s only refinery, could be crippled by direct energy sanctions. Even so, Hungary is starting to look around. Viktor just signed a 10-year deal with Shell Plc for 2 billion cubic meters of gas, symbolic, considering the country needs several times that every year. He also traveled to the UAE and Qatar on Friday to talk about alternative fuel supplies. Hungary’s past diversification efforts, including projects with Azerbaijan and a pipeline through Croatia, might help if Russian imports get cut off completely. On the Indian coast, another angle to the story played out as the Spartan, a Suezmax tanker carrying 1 million barrels of Russian Urals crude, approached Mundra port, operated by Adani Group. The vessel had already been sanctioned by both the EU and UK last year for facilitating Russian oil shipments. It’s now expected to be one of the last sanctioned ships to unload at Adani’s terminal before a new ban kicks in. Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd., the operator of Mundra, issued an internal advisory on September 11 stating that from now on, no vessel sanctioned by the US, EU, or UK will be allowed to dock. An Adani spokesperson confirmed Monday that the rule is immediate but doesn’t affect ships that were already heading toward the port when the rule was announced. The Spartan appears to fall into that category. Over the first eight months of this year, Mundra took in about 180,000 barrels per day of Russian oil, compared to the 1.6 million barrels daily flowing into India overall from Russia. That oil usually goes to refineries run by Indian Oil Corp. and HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Many have seen their market net asset value (mNAV) dip below one, sparking concerns among investors. But what if there’s a strategic differentiator emerging in this challenging landscape? Standard Chartered’s Head of Crypto Research, Geoff Kendrick, highlights a significant Ethereum advantage for firms navigating these turbulent waters. Understanding the Shifting Sands: Why Firms Are Feeling the Squeeze In recent weeks, the market downturn has significantly impacted companies that have embraced cryptocurrencies as part of their balance sheets. Kendrick notes that their mNAV falling below one is a clear indicator of market pressure. This situation prompts a crucial question for corporate strategists: how can companies not only survive but thrive in an evolving digital asset ecosystem? Standard Chartered’s analysis suggests a divergence in resilience. While all crypto-holding firms face headwinds, those with an exposure to Ethereum (ETH) appear to possess inherent strengths that could position them more favorably for future growth and stability. This isn’t just about market capitalization; it’s about fundamental characteristics that provide a distinct Ethereum advantage . What Gives ETH Holders a Crucial Ethereum Advantage? Geoff Kendrick pinpoints several key factors that contribute to the superior resilience of companies holding Ethereum: Staking Yields: Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake allows holders to earn passive income through staking. This provides a consistent yield, offering a revenue stream that can offset market volatility and improve overall financial health. For a company, this isn’t merely a speculative holding but an income-generating asset. Regulatory Clarity: Compared to Bitcoin, Ethereum often benefits from a different regulatory perception, particularly in certain jurisdictions. As regulators worldwide work towards clearer frameworks, Ethereum’s ecosystem, with its diverse applications and ongoing development, might find itself in a more defined and therefore more secure position. This clarity reduces operational risk for institutional holders. Greater Room for Growth: Ethereum’s extensive utility, ranging from DeFi to NFTs and enterprise solutions, offers a broader scope for innovation and adoption. This inherent versatility suggests a larger potential for future value appreciation and ecosystem expansion, providing a substantial Ethereum advantage for long-term investors. These combined elements paint a picture of a more robust and adaptable asset for institutional portfolios, particularly when compared to Bitcoin’s primary function as a store of value. Mergers & Acquisitions: A Tale of Two Strategies The current market conditions, where mNAV is trading below one, could naturally lead to consolidation within the industry. Kendrick forecasts differing M&A strategies based on the primary crypto holding: For ETH-Holding Firms: The resilience offered by the Ethereum advantage , coupled with potential income from staking, could make these companies attractive acquisition targets. Buyers might see value in acquiring a firm with diversified crypto assets and a clear path to generating yield. For BTC-Holding Firms: Companies predominantly holding Bitcoin, such as MicroStrategy, might opt for a different approach. Instead of buying more Bitcoin in a downturn, Kendrick suggests they would be more inclined to acquire competitors. This strategy would allow them to consolidate market share and leverage existing infrastructure rather than simply increasing their exposure to a single asset type. This strategic divergence underscores the differing financial and operational implications of holding one asset over the other in a challenging market environment. Maximizing Your Institutional Crypto Strategy For firms considering or already holding cryptocurrencies, understanding these nuances is critical. The analysis from Standard Chartered provides actionable insights: Evaluate your portfolio: Consider the balance between speculative growth assets and income-generating ones. Ethereum’s staking mechanism offers a unique blend of both. Monitor regulatory shifts: Stay informed about global regulatory developments, as clarity can significantly impact asset valuation and operational feasibility. Look beyond price: While market price is important, factors like utility, ecosystem growth, and yield generation are increasingly vital for long-term institutional success. Embracing the Ethereum advantage means looking at the broader picture. The Future of Institutional Crypto Investment Standard Chartered’s perspective offers a compelling look into the evolving world of institutional crypto investment. The concept of an Ethereum advantage , rooted in staking yields, regulatory potential, and growth opportunities, presents a powerful argument for firms seeking resilience and strategic positioning. As the market matures, understanding these differentiators will be key to unlocking sustainable value and navigating the complexities of digital asset ownership. The future may indeed belong to those who strategically embrace the multifaceted benefits of Ethereum. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the core argument made by Standard Chartered regarding ETH and BTC? A1: Standard Chartered’s Geoff Kendrick argues that firms holding Ethereum (ETH) possess a significant “Ethereum advantage” over those holding Bitcoin (BTC) due to factors like staking yields, regulatory clarity, and greater growth potential, leading to more resilience in challenging market conditions. Q2: What specific benefits contribute to the “Ethereum advantage”? A2: The key benefits include the ability to earn passive income through Ethereum’s staking yields, a potentially clearer regulatory path compared to Bitcoin, and Ethereum’s broader ecosystem utility which offers more room for growth and innovation. Q3: How does the mNAV (market net asset value) relate to these predictions? A3: When the mNAV of crypto-holding firms falls below one, it indicates market pressure. Kendrick suggests that if this trend continues, it could trigger mergers and acquisitions, with ETH-holding firms being attractive targets and BTC-holding firms potentially acquiring competitors instead of more crypto. Q4: What different M&A strategies are predicted for ETH vs. BTC holders? A4: For ETH-holding firms, their resilience and yield generation could make them attractive acquisition targets. For BTC-holding firms, like MicroStrategy, the strategy might shift towards acquiring competitors to consolidate market share rather than increasing their Bitcoin holdings. Q5: Why is regulatory clarity considered a key advantage for Ethereum? A5: Regulatory clarity reduces operational risk and provides a more stable environment for institutional investors. As global regulations evolve, Ethereum’s ecosystem, with its diverse applications, may achieve a more defined and secure position, offering a competitive edge.

Key Takeaways: SEC Chair Paul Atkins says crypto firms will now receive warning notices before any enforcement actions. Atkins rejected Gensler’s broad view of crypto as securities and supports tokenized asset trading. The SEC has dropped several legacy cases and launched a Crypto Task Force to improve industry dialogue. In an interview with the Financial Times on Monday , SEC Chair Paul Atkins said the agency would now issue preliminary notices of technical violations before pursuing formal enforcement actions against crypto firms. “You can’t just suddenly come and bash down their door,” Atkins said. “Businesses can now expect to first receive a preliminary notice.” Atkins Breaks from Gensler’s Lawsuit-Heavy Crypto Enforcement Strategy The comments signal a marked break from the approach under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who was frequently criticized for using lawsuits as the primary tool to regulate the crypto industry. During Gensler’s tenure, the SEC launched legal battles against high-profile firms including Ripple Labs, Terraform Labs, Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken, actions that cost the industry billions in legal fees. Atkins said many of those actions lacked legal grounding and predictability. “It would shoot first and then ask questions later,” he noted, emphasizing the need for clearer process and dialogue.

In another key policy shift, Atkins pushed back against Gensler’s interpretation that most cryptocurrencies are securities. He said most tokens do not fall under securities laws and voiced support for trading tokenized stocks and bonds that carry the same legal rights as their underlying instruments. Since taking office in April, Atkins has led the SEC to establish a dedicated Crypto Task Force and has dropped several ongoing enforcement actions inherited from the Gensler era. The changes reflect a broader effort to rebuild trust with the industry and promote regulatory clarity. The new direction may signal a less adversarial relationship between U.S. regulators and the digital asset sector, at least for now. New Crypto Bill Aims to Limit SEC Overreach, Shield DeFi Developers Last week, US lawmakers released a revised draft of the Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2025, proposing clear regulatory boundaries between the SEC and CFTC, and creating a Joint Advisory Committee to promote cooperation and transparency. Both agencies would be required to publicly respond to committee recommendations, with a public roundtable set for Sept. 29. The bill introduces explicit protections for DeFi developers, validators, wallet builders, and liquidity providers, as long as the protocols remain decentralized. These safeguards address growing concerns following enforcement actions like the Tornado Cash case, which raised fears of criminal liability for open-source development. Airdrops, staking rewards, and DePIN tokens are also covered under new definitions, shielding them from securities laws. The draft aims to remove regulatory ambiguity, reduce friction, and encourage responsible innovation across emerging blockchain sectors.

""A hypothetical one EH/s fleet of BTC miners would have generated ~$55k/day in revenue during August, vs ~$58k/day in July and ~$44k a year ago,"" wrote analysts led by Jonathan Petersen. The hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain, and is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty. It is measured in exahashes per second (EH/s). U.S.-listed mining companies mined 3,573 bitcoin in August versus 3,598 in July, the report noted, and these miners accounted for 26% of the Bitcoin network last month, unchanged from July.

Today → 1.6 Billion DOT exist → 120M DOT/year minted each year → No supply cap What Ref. 1710… pic.twitter.com/OJMtDumAZC — Polkadot (@Polkadot) September 14, 2025 The measure was introduced on Polkadot’s “Wish for Change” track, a governance process designed to capture community sentiment on proposed updates. It received 81% approval, signaling broad consensus among participants. Polkadot founder Gavin Wood earlier proposed shifting from the Nominated Proof-of-Stake system to a Proof-of-Personhood model.Among the notable changes in the approach was moving Polkadot toward store-of-value properties with a proposed 3.14 billion DOT supply cap. Notably, this approval came on the backdrop of Polkadot broadening its institutional focus with the launch of Polkadot Capital Group on Aug. 19, a division created to link Wall Street firms with its blockchain infrastructure. The initiative seeks to help traditional finance players explore opportunities in asset management, banking, venture capital, exchanges, and OTC trading while highlighting use cases such as DeFi, staking, and real-world asset tokenization. Polkadot’s Current Cap at 1.6B DOT as it Shifts from Inflationary Model to Scarcity Framework Currently, the total circulating supply of DOT stands at 1.6 billion. Until now, Polkadot minted 120 million DOT each year, with no maximum supply limit. This meant that if the issuance model continued, supply would have grown to around 3.4 billion tokens by 2040 and over 5 billion by 2052. This inflationary framework raised long-term concerns for holders and developers, as predictable scarcity is a key feature for many blockchain ecosystems. The newly adopted model introduces a strict limit of 2.1 billion DOT. Issuance will decline in fixed steps every two years on March 14, also known as Pi Day. A chart released by Polkadot shows that annual issuance will drop from 120 million in 2025 to below 20 million by the early 2030s. By 2040, issuance will be minimal, and the total supply is projected to stabilize near 1.91 billion tokens. Source: Polkadot/X The fixed reduction mechanism prevents unchecked growth and aligns incentives between token holders and the network. Polkadot described the outcome as “scarcity, predictability, and long-term alignment.” By implementing a hard cap, Polkadot joins a group of blockchain networks that restrict supply growth to strengthen economic sustainability. Bitcoin, for example, reduces issuance through programmed halving events, while Polkadot’s approach applies stepwise reductions on a set schedule. The change may alter how DOT is perceived in the market. Investors and developers often weigh token supply structures when assessing the stability and potential value of a network. With predictable issuance and a capped supply, DOT now offers clearer monetary policy signals than before. How Will Capped Supply Affect Polkadot? As of this press time, DOT trades at $4.18, a 4.6% drop in the past day, reducing its rally in the past week to 3.9%. The technical pattern suggests the token bottomed at $3.02 in June before reaching a $4.5 high earlier this month. Technical indicators such as the RSI and MACD signaled bullish divergences before DOT’s breakout, with both continuing to rise afterward. Chart analysis also reveals the token has been climbing along an ascending support line since its all-time low, forming an ascending triangle with resistance at $4.56, a pattern often linked to bullish momentum. Source: TradingView If this setup plays out, DOT could climb toward $6.30, the midpoint of its current range. How the price reacts at that level will be key in determining whether it has the strength to push higher toward the long-term resistance near $11. Notably, analysts are particularly bullish on the token. In a post on X, a crypto analyst noted DOT holds strong at $3.60 support, bouncing for the fourth time in its multi-year range. A rebound could push it toward $13, a potential 230% upside. The analyst noted that $3.60 is the key level to watch for a potential upside. However, a trade below $3.40 will invalidate the setup.

51773653,https://invezz.com/?p=2881678,1757950500,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Here’s why the Gemini stock may crash soon after the IPO,https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/15/heres-why-the-gemini-stock-may-crash-soon-after-the-ipo/,"Gemini stock price had a highly volatile first day as a publicly traded company. It initially popped to $45 after the much-anticipated Initial Public Offering (IPO) and then ended the day at $32. Here’s why this crash could be the start of a prolonged bear market. Gemini Space Station faces major headwinds Gemini, the crypto exchange launched by the Winklevoss Twins, launched its IPO on Friday, raising $425 million . It is now valued at over $3.4 billion, much lower than the peak valuation of over $7 billion a few years ago. The company faces significant headwinds in the near term that may impact its long-term performance. First, Gemini is primarily a crypto exchange that generates most of its revenue from the trading activity on its platform. This is a risky business as its revenue normally cools during bear markets. The concentration of its subscription-based revenue explains why a company like Coinbase has boosted its focus on other solutions like stablecoins, custody, and subscriptions. It hopes that this division will start making more money than the transaction one in the long term. Second, Gemini, despite its big name, is still a small name in the crypto industry. For example, data compiled by CoinMarketCap shows that the 24-hour volume in the spot market stood at just $94 million, much lower than other little-known companies like DeepCoin, Toolbit, and Pionex. Third, Gemini’s financial statement showed that its business was not doing well. Its results showed that its revenue rose from $98 million in 2023 to $142 million in 2024 as its net loss improved to $158 million, down from $319 million a year earlier. However, this year’s performance has not been good as its revenue dropped to $67 million in the first half of the year from the previous $73 million. The net loss rose sharply to $282 million. This weakness could persist, especially after Coinbase reported a weak financial report in July. The other notable risk for Gemini is that the crypto exchange industry has become highly competitive in the past few years. For example, Robinhood has now become a major player in the crypto exchange industry, especially with the recent Bitstamp buyout. Bitstamp handled over $300 million in volume in the last 24 hours. WeBull, the Chinese trading platform has introduced crypto to its platform, while companies like Binance and OKX have relaunched in the United States. All these companies have a superior competitive advantage than Gemini because of the coins they offer. Gemini has only 142 markets, while Binance has 2,120 and Bybit has 1,269. Additionally, the other parts of Gemini’s business are relatively small. For example, Gemini Dollar, its stablecoin, only has a market capitalization of over $52 million, a tiny amount in an industry with billions of dollars in assets. Most recent IPOs have plunged The Gemini stock price is also at risk based on the performance of other recently launched initial public offerings (IPO). After the initial jump, most newly listed companies have crashed by double digits. Circle stock price has plunged by 60% from the year-to-date high of $298, while Bullish is down by 58% from its post-listing high of $118. Klarna, the leading BNPL company that went public last wee, has also plummeted by 24% from its highest level. CoreWeave stock price had dived by 40% from the year-to-date high. Therefore, it is likely that the Gemini Space Station will also do the same and crash in the coming weeks as the post-listening momentum wanes.

The total value of assets borrowed from crypto lending apps has officially reached an astonishing all-time high of $41.5 billion. This unprecedented surge, reported by Unfolded, signals a significant shift in how individuals and institutions are interacting with digital assets. This record figure is not just a number; it represents a growing confidence and utility within the DeFi ecosystem. It shows that more people are looking to leverage their cryptocurrency holdings without selling them outright, using these platforms for various financial strategies. What’s Fueling the Phenomenal Rise of Crypto Lending Apps? Several key factors contribute to the explosive growth observed in crypto lending apps . These platforms offer unique advantages that traditional finance often cannot match, drawing in a diverse user base. Attractive Yields: Lenders are drawn by the opportunity to earn higher interest rates on their idle crypto assets compared to traditional savings accounts. Accessibility: DeFi platforms are open to anyone with an internet connection and cryptocurrency, removing many barriers of entry found in traditional banking. Capital Efficiency: Borrowers can access liquidity by using their crypto as collateral, enabling them to pursue other investments or meet short-term financial needs without liquidating their holdings. Innovation: Continuous development in smart contract technology and decentralized protocols makes these platforms more robust and user-friendly. The ability to generate passive income or gain access to capital quickly makes crypto lending apps an appealing option for many crypto holders. How Do Borrowed Assets on Crypto Lending Apps Actually Work? Understanding the mechanics behind these platforms is crucial. When you borrow assets on crypto lending apps , you typically provide other cryptocurrencies as collateral. This collateral ensures that the loan is secured, mitigating risk for the lenders. Here’s a simplified breakdown: Collateral Requirement: Borrowers deposit a certain amount of cryptocurrency (e.g., Ethereum or Bitcoin) into a smart contract as collateral. The value of this collateral usually exceeds the value of the loan. Loan Issuance: Once collateral is provided, borrowers can take out a loan, often in stablecoins like USDC or USDT, or other cryptocurrencies. Interest Rates: Borrowers pay an interest rate, which varies based on supply and demand within the specific lending protocol. These rates can be dynamic. Liquidation Risk: If the value of the collateral falls below a certain threshold relative to the loan, the collateral may be automatically sold to repay the loan. This is a critical risk to understand. This system allows for peer-to-peer lending and borrowing, all managed by transparent and immutable smart contracts on a blockchain. The Benefits and Challenges of Engaging with Crypto Lending Apps While the growth is exciting, it’s important to consider both the upsides and the potential downsides of using crypto lending apps . They offer significant opportunities but also come with inherent risks. Key Benefits: Liquidity: Users can unlock the value of their crypto without selling, maintaining their long-term positions. Income Generation: Lenders earn interest, creating a new stream of passive income from their digital assets. Financial Inclusion: These platforms are globally accessible, providing financial services to underserved populations. Potential Challenges: Smart Contract Risk: Vulnerabilities or bugs in the underlying code can lead to loss of funds. Liquidation Risk: Volatile crypto markets mean collateral values can drop rapidly, leading to automatic liquidations. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for DeFi is still evolving, which could impact platform operations and user funds. Centralization Risks: While aiming for decentralization, some platforms may still have centralized components that pose risks. Understanding these aspects helps users make informed decisions when interacting with these powerful financial tools. Navigating the Future: Actionable Insights for Crypto Lending Apps Users Given the dynamic nature of the DeFi space, especially with crypto lending apps , adopting a cautious yet informed approach is essential. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Thoroughly investigate any platform before committing funds. Look for audits, community reputation, and transparent operations. Understand Terms and Conditions: Be fully aware of interest rates, collateral ratios, liquidation thresholds, and any associated fees. Start Small: Begin with smaller amounts to familiarize yourself with the platform and its processes before committing larger sums. Diversify: Do not put all your assets into a single lending protocol. Spreading your investments can help mitigate risks. Stay Informed: The crypto market moves quickly. Keep up with news, security updates, and regulatory changes that might affect your borrowed assets or collateral. These steps can help users navigate the exciting yet complex world of crypto lending more effectively. The record-breaking $41.5 billion in borrowed assets on crypto lending apps undeniably marks a significant moment for decentralized finance. It underscores the growing utility and demand for alternative financial services built on blockchain technology. While the opportunities for earning and leveraging digital assets are immense, it is crucial for users to approach these platforms with a clear understanding of both their benefits and inherent risks. As the DeFi ecosystem continues to mature, informed participation will be key to unlocking its full potential and ensuring a secure experience for all involved. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are crypto lending apps? A1: Crypto lending apps are decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms that allow users to lend out their cryptocurrencies to earn interest or borrow cryptocurrencies by providing other digital assets as collateral, all managed by smart contracts on a blockchain. Q2: How did borrowed assets on crypto lending apps reach $41.5 billion? A2: This record was driven by increasing demand for capital efficiency, attractive yield opportunities for lenders, and the overall growth and adoption of decentralized finance, making it easier for users to access liquidity without selling their crypto. Q3: What are the main benefits of using crypto lending apps? A3: Key benefits include earning passive income on idle crypto, gaining liquidity without selling assets, and accessing financial services globally with fewer traditional barriers. Q4: What are the primary risks associated with crypto lending apps? A4: The main risks involve potential smart contract vulnerabilities, liquidation risk due to crypto market volatility, and evolving regulatory uncertainties that could impact platform operations. Q5: How can I safely participate in crypto lending?

According to a recent announcement , the Las Vegas-based company will fund the initiative through Montana data center asset sales and equity offerings. Meanwhile, Hyperscale plans to expand its Michigan campus from 30 MW to potentially 340 MW for AI and cloud computing operations. The move positions Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve, as the company already holds $1.33 million in digital assets, representing 11.9% of its market capitalization, through its mining operations. BREAKING: HYPERSCALE DATA JUST LAUNCHED ITS BITCOIN TREASURY WITH $100 MILLION! pic.twitter.com/7eSaWaDDdt — Coinvo (@ByCoinvo) September 15, 2025 Treasury Strategy Built on Mining Foundation Hyperscale’s subsidiary Sentinum has operated a Bitcoin mining business for years, creating what CEO William B. Horne called “a foundation of operational expertise in digital assets” that supports the MicroStrategy-style treasury approach. The company currently holds 11.1159 Bitcoin, worth approximately $1.23 million as of September 8, all of which was earned through mining rather than market purchases. Previous announcements revealed an aggressive accumulation timeline, including a September 2 plan to add $20 million in Bitcoin and September 5 reports showing holdings reaching 8.1% of market capitalization. Hyperscale will fund the $100 million program through proceeds from selling Montana data center land leases and power contracts, combined with its at-the-market equity offering. The company announced plans to divest two 10 MW Montana properties to concentrate resources on its Michigan flagship campus. Sentinum built and operates a fully functional data center on a single Montana property, having conducted crypto mining operations since acquiring the lease and power agreements in February 2023. The strategic focus shift allows Hyperscale to direct capital and management attention toward Michigan, where the company expects substantially higher long-term asset values. “This marks a pivotal moment in Hyperscale Data’s evolution,” Horne stated, explaining the company is “building a company anchored in two of the most dynamic forces of our era: artificial intelligence and digital assets.” Notably, the Michigan facility expansion represents a parallel growth strategy, with the current 30 MW capacity advancing to 70 MW over 20 months through the use of natural gas infrastructure, which enables on-site generation. The ultimate expansion goal is 340 MW capacity. However, it is subject to utility agreements, regulatory approvals, and appropriate funding for enterprise AI and cloud clients deploying GPU-based systems. Hyperscale maintains transparency through weekly crypto holdings reports, with recent disclosures showing $101,123.70 in XRP purchases through 33,120 tokens at $3.0533 average price.

Industry analysts warn that rising interest rates expose structural vulnerabilities in debt-financed Bitcoin strategies, with most participants potentially unable to survive credit cycles. Unlike historical wealth-building through leveraged real estate that generated rental income, Bitcoin produces no cash flow, forcing companies to rely on operational performance or asset appreciation to service acquisition debt. Notably, Hyperscale’s dual approach of combining AI infrastructure development with Bitcoin treasury management may position it differently, potentially benefiting from multiple growth catalysts. However, the strategy also exposes the company to volatility from both cryptocurrency price cycles and capital-intensive data center buildouts in an environment where Capital Group quietly generated $5 billion from Bitcoin treasury investments. The company’s planned divestiture of its subsidiary, Ault Capital Group, in Q1 2026 will position Hyperscale as a focused data center operator and digital asset holder once the separation is complete.

By 2031, Sonic (S) might touch $4.97. Fantom Integrates to Sonic (S) Chain On March 25, 2024, Fantom CEO Michael Kong announced the launch of the Sonic mainnet following the completion of its testnet. The proposal included a decentralized bridge to Ethereum for improved security, streamlined staking options, and the introduction of liquid staking. https://twitter.com/SonicLabs/status/1772275308105769312 Fantom fully rebranded as Sonic on January 16, 2025, to reposition itself within the market. As part of this transition, Sonic plans to introduce new features to increase community engagement and enhance its ecosystem’s utility, which could drive demand for its token. However, the price of FTM is expected to remain largely influenced by overall market sentiment and the platform’s adoption rate. The success of this rebranding will likely depend on how effectively Sonic aligns with the crypto market’s growing focus on regulatory compliance. Will Sonic (Prev.FTM) reclaim FTM’s all-time high of $3.48 soon? How high can Sonic (S) go in 2025? Let’s dive into Sonic’s price predictions for 2025 and beyond.

The RSI is at 46, suggesting bearish momentum with room for further downside. MACD also reflects negative sentiment with a slight bearish crossover. Support sits around $0.292, and a break below this could push the token lower toward $0.280. Resistance lies near $0.310 and $0.326, which must be reclaimed to reverse the downtrend. Overall, the chart points to sustained bearish pressure unless bulls step in to defend support and trigger a bounce toward higher levels in coming sessions.

The MACD shows bearish momentum, with the histogram in negative territory, though the pace of decline is slowing. The Balance of Power at 0.46 suggests sellers still dominate. Immediate support rests at $0.297, and holding above this could spark a corrective bounce toward $0.311 resistance. Failure to defend support may drag the price toward $0.290. Overall, Sonic is under pressure but may see a minor recovery attempt if bulls manage to defend current levels convincingly.

Based on our analysis, we are optimistic about its growth, projecting a $0.5405 price by 2025 and $3.46 by 2030. Despite its potential, investing in Sonic (S) involves risks typical of cryptocurrencies, including market volatility. Own research and assessing personal risk tolerance are essential for anyone considering S as a potential investment opportunity. Will Sonic reach $5? The price of Sonic could reach $2.88 by 2030, with price predictions suggesting a high of $3.46. However, achieving this depends on market conditions and overall blockchain adoption trends. Will Sonic reach $10? Based on our technical analysis, Sonic will not approach double-digit prices within the next 6 years. Our recent Sonic predictions suggest that by 2031, S could attain a price of about $4.97. Is Sonic a safe network? Sonic is regarded as a secure blockchain platform that utilizes its unique Lachesis consensus mechanism for high-speed and scalable transactions. However, as with any blockchain network, users should exercise caution, use official channels, and follow best security practices to protect their assets. Does Sonic have a good, long-term future? Sonic shows potential for a strong long-term future, with price predictions suggesting significant growth by 2030 and beyond. Analysts forecast prices could reach between $3.46 and $4.97, driven by its unique blockchain technology and increasing adoption in decentralized applications. However, market volatility remains a concern. Recent news/opinion on Sonic (prev.

When looking at individual crypto funds, it was seen that the majority of inflows were in Bitcoin. While Bitcoin experienced an inflow of $2.4 billion, Ethereum (ETH) experienced an inflow of $645.9 million. Looking at other altcoins, XRP saw an inflow of $32.5 million, Solana (SOL) $198.4 million, Sui (SUI) $14 million, and Chainlink (LINK) $1.5 million. “Bitcoin experienced the strongest recovery in market sentiment, attracting inflows of $2.4 billion, the largest weekly inflow since July.

REX Shares is launching the REX-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR) this week, developed in collaboration with REX-Osprey . The new product will offer investors the opportunity to directly invest in spot XRP in the US for the first time. XRP is the world's third-largest crypto asset by market capitalization, behind Bitcoin and Ethereum. The XRPR fund aims to directly mirror XRP's performance and will provide investors with direct access to the asset. The fund's investment objective was announced as tracking XRP price movements “exclusive of fees and expenses.” The REX-Osprey team had previously attracted attention with its SSK product. Related News: Watch Out: 29 Altcoins Have Massive Token Unlocks Coming Up Next Week - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List The fund's annual expenses include a management fee, distribution and service fees (12b-1), and other expenses are zero. Management expenses will be largely covered by REX Advisers, LLC. The fund will operate through a subsidiary, REX-Osprey XRP (Cayman) Portfolio SP, incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Several companies are currently racing to launch spot XRP ETFs. Eric Balchunas previously said the funds could be approved within two to four months. But the REX-Osprey approach circumvents this approval process with a clever legal solution; unlike most ETFs, the funds choose to be taxable C-corporations. Therefore, distributions to owners will be taxed within the fund before being distributed to owners as dividends. *This is not investment advice.

The bank’s survey shows that inflation remains high even after the COVID-era price increases. The BIS serves as the supporting arm for the world’s central banks. It cited the rise in premiums required by investors to hold 30-year government bonds in major economies as a sign of mounting concerns about the fiscal outlook. The arm suggested that the growing role of hedge funds in absorbing government debts also poses potential stability risks in the market. BIS warns of fiscal risks as hedge funds take on government loans Moody’s, a U.S. credit rating firm, stripped the American government of its AAA status earlier this year. Fitch also downgraded France to a record low last week. According to a Reuters report, BIS highlighted that this downgrade shows the scale of fiscal challenges targeting advanced economies amid stocks that continue to record higher prices. Hyun Song Shin, head of the BIS’s Monetary and Economic Department, gave the warning that financial markets may face trouble even before measures put in place could be triggered. He noted the increased rate of hedge funds taking on government debts, saying it could potentially amplify the problems. He warned that this is the time to be watchful of potential amplification channels that could propagate stress. Despite the risks highlighted, the BIS revealed little to no sign of global investors shifting their focus decisively from the U.S. asset market. It noted that some non-U.S. investors sold large stakes of U.S. bonds and equities in April and largely reversed in May and June. The bank suggested that global investors’ holdings of U.S. assets, combined with the slow portfolio allocation changes, mean any shift away would be gradual. The BIS has also published the first results of the latest Global Public Inflation Expectations survey. The survey covers thirteen advanced and eighteen emerging economies and revealed that the post-pandemic price increase confirms continued inflation expectations in the long term, particularly in countries that face price spikes. According to the survey, temporary inflation shocks are a risk that leaves a lasting challenge to public expectations. It also noted that most households continue to support the independence of central banks from governments. BIS sees elevated asset risks, urging vigilance in a fragile economy Shin highlighted a slowdown in the real economy, especially the U.S. labour market, citing concerns about the sustainability of stock market valuations. He said the equities market continues to post results last seen during the dot.com bubble, while corporate bonds remain unusually tight. The umbrella group for central banks flagged unusual moves in the currency market, noting that July’s dollar coincided with strong equity gains. The bank said the pattern does not align with traditional interest rate dynamics. Shin warned that the potential outcome of such ample financial conditions should be examined keenly. The BIS urged policymakers and investors to remain vigilant as elevated valuations of risky assets leave the global economy vulnerable to sudden corrections. Meanwhile, the U.S. tariff landscape continues to unfold major developments with no clear impact highlighted in the report. Cryptopolitan recently reported on how U.S. tariffs are affecting the petrochemicals market. The intensified pressures in the sector have forced China to redirect exports from the U.S. to Asian markets, which has led to oversupply and overcomplicated supply chain planning, according to the report. Ganesh Gopalakrishnan, TotalEnergies’ head of petrochemical trading, warned that if the tariffs continue, trade volumes may drop by another 15% after experiencing a 34% decline over the past five years. He highlighted that traders lacking the production facilities are at a greater struggle in the supply glut.

The company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) an initial registration statement to launch Robinhood Ventures Fund I (RVI), a closed-end investment vehicle that aims to buy stakes in private companies that are leaders in their industries. The fund, managed by a newly formed subsidiary called Robinhood Ventures , would be traded on the New York Stock Exchange, pending regulatory approval. Robinhood faced criticism earlier this year after it announced that it was offering users in the European Union access to private equity tokens. The company opened access to these tokens through tokenized shares in OpenAI and SpaceX, while also launching its own layer-2 blockchain network for users in the European Union to have access to tokenized publicly traded U.S. stocks. At the time, the company was forced to explain that its private equity tokens were held by a special purpose vehicle , after OpenAI warned that the tokens did not represent equity in the firm. Still, the company is pushing forward with offering private equity access to retail investors. “For decades, wealthy people and institutions have invested in private companies while retail investors have been unfairly locked out,” Robinhood Chairman and CEO Vlad Tenev said. Robinhood pointed out that the number of public companies in the U.S. has dropped by nearly half since 2000, while the private market has ballooned to over $10 trillion in estimated value, according to Federal Reserve data. If approved, Robinhood Ventures Fund I would invest in a small basket of private companies across various industries and hold them through IPO and beyond. Shares would be available to buy and sell through traditional brokerages.

The DOGE ETF — formally called the Rex Shares-Osprey Dogecoin ETF (DOJE) — was originally slated to debut last week, alongside a handful of politically themed and crypto-related ETFs. Those included funds tied to Bonk (BONK), XRP, Bitcoin (BTC) and even a Trump-themed fund. But DOJE’s debut never materialized. Now, Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart believe Wednesday is the most likely launch date, though they caution nothing is certain. “It’s more likely than not,” Seyffart said. “That seems like the base case.” Ahead of the introduction of the ETF, DOGE has been among the top performers over the past month, ahead 15% even including a decline of 3.5% over the past 24 horus. If launched, DOJE would mark a milestone as the first U.S. ETF to focus on a meme coin — cryptocurrencies that generally lack utility or a clear economic purpose. These include tokens like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Bonk, which often surge in popularity thanks to internet culture, celebrity endorsements and speculative trading. Balchunas described DOJE’s significance in a post on X: “First-ever US ETF to hold something that has no utility on purpose.” DOJE is not a spot ETF. That means it won’t hold DOGE directly. Instead, the fund will use a Cayman Islands-based subsidiary to gain exposure through futures and other derivatives. This approach sidesteps the need for physical custody of the coin while still offering traders a way to bet on its performance within a traditional brokerage account. The ETF was approved earlier this month under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which is typically used for mutual funds and diversified ETFs. That sets it apart from the wave of bitcoin ETFs that received green lights under the Securities Act of 1933, a framework used for commodity-based and asset-backed products. In short, DOJE is structured more like a mutual fund than a commodity trust. More direct exposure may be coming soon. Several firms have filed applications to launch spot DOGE ETFs, which would hold the meme coin itself rather than derivatives. These applications are still under review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has grown more comfortable with crypto ETFs since approving a slate of bitcoin products in early 2024. The broader crypto market has shown that investor demand can outweigh fundamental critiques. Meme coins have long drawn skepticism for having no underlying value or use case, but that hasn't kept them from drawing billions in speculative capital. Seyffart said the ETF market is likely to follow the same path. “There's going to be a bunch of products like this, whether you love it or need it, they're going to be coming to market,” he said. He added that many existing financial products serve no deeper purpose than providing a vehicle for short-term bets. “There’s plenty of products out there that are just being used as gambling or short-term trading,” he said. “So if there's an audience for this in the crypto world, I wouldn't be surprised at all if this finds an audience in the ETF and TradFi world.” Whether the DOJE ETF opens the door to more meme coin funds — or just proves the concept is viable — may depend on how the market responds this week.

This raises questions about AVAX's potential to rebound and reach the $40 mark. Institutional support could play a vital role, hinting at a possible recovery. Readers can explore which coins are showing promise for growth in these volatile times. Avalanche (AVAX) Shows Potential for Growth Amid Current Rally Source: tradingview Avalanche (AVAX) is on the rise, trading between $25.60 and $32.28. In the past month, it jumped nearly 20% and has surged 50% over six months. This bullish trend is underpinned by the relative strength index at a cautious 38.25, signaling more room to grow. If momentum continues, AVAX could challenge the next resistance at $35.10 and possibly reach $41.78. This could mean a potential increase of about 30% from its current level. While the MACD level is slightly negative, indicators suggest optimism. Keep an eye on the support level at $21.73, as it ensures a base for upward movement. Overall, AVAX is on an encouraging path. Conclusion Avalanche’s short-term dip hasn’t derailed its longer-term momentum. With a $1B institutional injection acting as a confidence boost, AVAX shows technical strength and clear upside potential toward the $40 zone. While resistance levels may test investor patience, steady support and growing market interest suggest that Avalanche remains a coin to watch closely as the next rally unfolds.

As the pros wait for a jaw-dropping 5,000% breakout potential, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming the red-hot token in the markets, interesting not just retail traders but, more and more, institutional investors as well. With the price action of XRP showing modest growth ahead, the groundbreaking traction of Mutuum Finance shows how the latest generation of DeFi protocols are revolutionizing the market. XRP Price Forecast In The Wake Of Institutional Support XRP trades at $3.17 as it holds in the wake of new institutional buying that analysts say may support a more enduring drive higher into the $4.50 area if the rally continues. The token’s new rally is a reflection of broader enthusiasm for established altcoins that are rising in terms of regulatory clarity and adoption of cross-border settlement use cases. Whereas investors consider possible upside, the fate of XRP is also being set against new momentum in newer DeFi players such as Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Presale Phase 6 Mutuum Finance is already at presale phase six, and it is here that the tokens can be bought for $0.035 with a 16.17 percent boost from the last phase. There is massive demand for the project in the market as it has already enrolled more than 16,300 investors and crossed $15.8 million. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also initiated a Bug Bounty Program worth $50,000 USDT for platform security. The bugs have been scored on four levels based on the designation critical, major, minor, and low. Mutuum Finance collateralization is capped by assets and differs as per the nature of risk an asset would pose. It encompasses supply capping, collateral and borrowing capping. The protocol is hedging market risk by overcollateralizing positions. The protocol also incentivizes the liquidators for closing the undercollateralized trades and thus risky positions are closed in real time. Collateral usage is still low for risk tokens but the most correlated ones are put into use to their maximum so that they are in a position to maximize their collateral. All these are used for insolvency risk mitigation in such a manner that no form of imbalance is formed between borrowing and lending in the protocol. User Community and Growth Development Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will establish an active user base by conducting an initiative campaign of a $100,000 giveaway . Ten users will be given $10,000 MUTM tokens each in return for propagating investments on the protocol. Security Framework and Back-up Plan Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an LTV build with risk-of-assets contingent one with subjective collateral. It also incorporates reserve factors as fall-back and a very bad market condition buffer. Risk assets are reserved more in an attempt to provide higher security to the protocol as well as users. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast-paced in leaving behind traditional plays like XRP in the dust as experts are forecasting a 5,000% breakout from where it is now in presale. Tokens are at $0.035 in Phase 6 and have already captured 16,300+ investors and attained $15.8M+ raised, with the subsequent phase looking forward to another pricing hike. Backed by a $50K CertiK bug bounty, a $100K community giveaway, and strong collateral and risk management, MUTM has upside potential with strong security and sustainability. While XRP is dreaming of $4.50 on institution flows, Mutuum Finance offers early investors much more up-side. Lock up your Stage 6 tokens now before the next big run.

The buybacks are expected to continue as it coincide with the PUMP token recovery. As things stand, the project has spent around $94.5 million buying back its own PUMP tokens and now owns approximately 6.582% of the circulating supply. Pump.fun’s aggressive buyback strategy was launched in July, not long after $PUMP’s initial coin offering raised $1.32 billion at a $0.004 price per token. Shortly after the launch, $PUMP hit an initial ATH of $0.01013, but by late July, it had dropped over 65% to lows of $0.002. Pump.fun price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Pump.fun token buybacks contribute to price recovery The buybacks, which have been going on daily with platform fees, have contributed to the recent PUMP recovery. For example, the token reached a high on the same day it made its latest purchase of 253.8 million PUMP. Those tokens were worth $0.008 per token at the time, and the purchase was valued at about $2.05 million. Pump.fun token buyback chart. Source: Pump.fun The buybacks have gradually reduced the circulating supply and created upward price pressure. On the good news track, Pump.fun also secured a Binance listing on September 11 while also reaching $800M in lifetime revenue . The recent price gain suggests traders are pricing in continued dominance. However, analysts advise caution as the platform and its token will suffer if memecoin hype fades. In the meantime, daily buybacks are expected to keep running at $1–2 million, with projections for a $1 billion annual rate given the platform’s $1.5 million daily revenue. Can the $PUMP token sustain its upward momentum? While metrics confirm holders are increasing, on-chain analysis has shown two early holders dumped 29.5B PUMP ($101M) below ICO price. While those whales exiting their positions is not exactly enough reason to become totally bearish, the fact that ICO participants still hold up to 55% of the supply should give any investor second thoughts. As things stand, there is mixed consensus on the $PUMP token, with many torn between buyback-driven scarcity plays and platform revenue/whale exit risks. In a bid to keep the current momentum, Pump.fun is reportedly extending its 30-day volume-based incentive program, which was initially launched in July 2025, to regain market share from rivals like LetsBONK.fun . The program rewards users with PUMP tokens based on trading activity, leveraging SDK updates for real-time tracking. It could work because it could stabilize trading volume and attract liquidity. However, excessive token distribution may lead to dilution if not carefully calibrated. Many wrote the $PUMP token off after its volatile launch and very loud criticisms about it being an “extractive” platform. However, the Pump.fun team has refused to go out without a fight and has been working hard to regain the trust of the ecosystem. That hard work is what has translated into new highs the token achieved early this month. and a growing holder count, but there is still a long way to go and investors are still very skeptical.

51773113,581184,1757952047,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51773113.jpeg,Memecoins vs. Altcoins: Market Cap Ratio Signals Potential Reversal,https://bitcoinist.com/memecoins-vs-altcoins-market-cap-ratio-reversal/,"Memecoins have been under heavy selling pressure since December 2024, with many declaring the sector as good as dead. Prices collapsed across the board, liquidity dried up, and retail enthusiasm that once fueled massive rallies seemed to vanish. For months, memecoins have trended lower, underperforming most of the broader crypto market and leaving investors skeptical about their long-term survival. Yet, despite the gloom, some analysts argue that dismissing memecoins entirely may be premature. As the market prepares for a new phase driven by shifting liquidity flows, institutional positioning, and macroeconomic catalysts, speculation could once again find fertile ground in this volatile sector. Top analyst Darkfost has gone as far as to suggest that the time to take a fresh look at memecoins may have arrived. According to him, data shows that the market is entering an area where memecoin dominance has historically regained strength, often sparking sharp rebounds. While risks remain high—memecoins are still among the most speculative assets in crypto—the potential for explosive gains continues to attract attention. Memecoin Dominance Signals Possible Rebound Darkfost highlights the importance of monitoring the Memecoin Dominance in Altcoin Markets chart , which compares the market capitalization of key memecoins against that of established altcoins. This ratio offers valuable insight into whether memecoins are gaining or losing influence relative to the broader altcoin sector. Since the massive rush that peaked at the end of 2024, memecoins have been in a prolonged decline, steadily losing both valuation and investor interest. The frenzy that once drove parabolic gains gave way to exhaustion, with most of the sector retracing sharply. Investors in memecoins understand the unique challenge of this asset class. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, memecoins often lack fundamental backing, making them highly speculative. As a result, timing entries and, more importantly, exiting positions quickly to secure profits are essential strategies. Hesitation can easily turn short-term gains into significant losses. Despite this, Darkfost observes that the memecoin dominance chart is signaling a potential turning point. The ratio has entered an area where memecoins have historically regained strength, marking the beginning of sharp rebounds. Early signs of reaction suggest that market sentiment may be shifting, with speculative capital slowly re-entering the space. If the trend persists, the conditions could align for a renewed memecoin mania. While it may not replicate the extreme fervor of late 2024, a resurgence in speculative appetite could drive significant rallies. For traders watching closely, the data implies that memecoins may once again become a hot narrative in the crypto cycle, though managing risk remains paramount. Market Cap Growth Analysis The chart of the Memecoin Market Cap (Daily) shows how the sector remains highly volatile, reflecting speculative behavior that defines this corner of the crypto market. After rebounding strongly from the July lows near $64B, the market surged to a local peak above $88B in early September. However, that momentum quickly faded, with the cap now retracing toward $75B, down nearly 5% in the latest session. The 50-day moving average at $68.7B has acted as a strong dynamic support throughout this recovery, showing that buyers continue to step in when valuations approach this level. Meanwhile, the sector’s ability to push above $80B and briefly test the $88B resistance highlights that speculative capital is still present, even if profit-taking remains aggressive. For now, memecoins are consolidating after a sharp upswing, and the market appears to be searching for balance. If capitalization holds above the $72–74B range, a renewed attempt to reclaim $80B could follow, reigniting bullish sentiment. On the other hand, a breakdown below the 50-day average would suggest fading momentum and open the door for a deeper retracement. Ultimately, memecoins remain sensitive to liquidity flows and broader risk sentiment, making timing critical.

In line with this, he predicted that the meme coin could rally to a new all-time high (ATH) and reach the psychological $1 level. Dogecoin Price Eyes 300% Rally To $1 Following Break Above Regional High In an X post, XForce predicted that the Dogecoin price could record a rally of over 300% to the psychological $1 level. This came as he noted that DOGE just broke above the previous regional high following its climb above $0.3 over the weekend. Based on this, the analyst declared that $1 is still programmed for the meme coin. Related Reading: The Dogecoin Bullish Reset: A Clear Roadmap To $0.35 XForce admitted that there will be pullbacks along the way, but he expects the Dogecoin price to reach this $1 level eventually. The analyst also drew attention to the alternative idea that could lead DOGE to double-digit prices if it continues as a strong impulse. His accompanying chart showed that the meme coin could rally to as high as $18. The Dogecoin price rallied over the weekend in anticipation of the REX-Osprey DOGE ETF, which will be the first fund to provide institutional investors with exposure to the foremost meme coin. This provides a bullish outlook for the meme coin, seeing as it could inject new liquidity into its ecosystem. Furthermore, the Fed is set to make the first rate cut this year at this week’s FOMC meeting, which could also be bullish for the Dogecoin price as it would boost risk-on sentiment. Amid this recent rally, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto has also declared that the meme coin will reach $1 in this cycle. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that DOGE may consolidate for a bit around these levels before it makes its next leg up toward $0.45. Analyst Issues Warning On DOGE In an X post, crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto issued a warning on the Dogecoin price, noting that it is at the monthly supply at the moment. He further remarked that if DOGE isn’t breaking out, then it is technically just retesting the prior point of breakdown. Related Reading: What A Dogecoin ETF Approval Means For The Future Of Crypto CrediBULL Crypto stated that a great time to be bullish on the Dogecoin price and jump into longs was before this recent rally. Now, he believes that it is time to be more cautious, as this is the most likely place for DOGE to face a rejection and record lower highs if the bottom isn’t in yet. There is also the possibility that the meme coin could crash if the Fed rate cut and DOGE ETF launch turn out to be a ‘sell the news’ event. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.28, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

PayPal also plans to integrate crypto into its new P2P payment flow. The initiative will simplify digital asset transfers for U.S. PayPal users, including between PayPal and Venmo. Users will also get to send crypto to a rapidly growing number of digital wallets worldwide that support crypto and stablecoins. Paypal confirmed that friends-and-family transfers through Venmo and PayPal will still be exempt from 1099-K reporting. Users were reassured they won’t receive tax forms for gifts, reimbursements, or splitting expenses. The goal: “personal payments stay personal.” “Whether you’re texting, messaging, or emailing, now your money follows your conversations. Combined with PayPal World, it’s an unbeatable value proposition, showing up where people connect, making it effortless to pay your friends and family, no matter where they are or what app they’re using.” – Diego Scotti , General Manager, Consumer Group at PayPal. PayPal noted that P2P and other consumer total payment volume saw solid growth in the second quarter and increased 10% year-over-year. A growth attributed to the company’s focus on improving user experience and increasing user discoverability, making it easier to move money globally. PayPal also revealed that Venmo saw its highest TPV growth in three years. The company believes that P2P is poised for even greater momentum in the future since PayPal World unlocks seamless interoperability and PayPal and Venmo connect to billions of wallets worldwide. Users can enter the PayPal app, enter the payment details or request, and generate a unique, one-time link to share. The payment links can be shared via text, DM, email, or chat. They can also add a note, an emoji, and a payment note. PayPal added that unclaimed links will expire after 10 days, and users can send a reminder or even cancel the payment before the link is claimed. PayPal introduces Pay with Crypto PayPal also introduced Pay with Crypto on July 28, connecting merchants to a $3+ trillion market. The payment solution enables instant crypto-to-stablecoin or fiat conversions. Pay with Crypto also supports transactions across 100+ cryptocurrencies and wallets such as Coinbase and MetaMask. The company also maintained that Pay with Crypto has a transaction rate of 0.99%, which decreases the cost of transactions by up to 90% when compared to international credit card processing. The digital payment firm acknowledged that Pay with Crypto expands its mission to transform commerce by integrating crypto and digital currencies into a platform that connects fiat and digital payments. The company said the initiative offers consumers diverse payment options and unlocks global growth for merchants. PayPal also revealed that starting in 2026, Venmo users will be able to shop online and in-store at millions of merchants globally that accept the platform. The company hopes the initiative will expand the reach of its two-sided network, drive more demand for merchants, and offer consumers more choice and flexibility. Don’t just read crypto news.

With the crypto world on alert, excitement mounts over potential price shifts for PI. This upgrade could mark a pivotal moment, possibly setting the stage for significant market movements. Curious about the coins poised for growth? Dive deeper into the latest developments. Pi Network's Steady Climb: Signs of Positive Momentum Source: tradingview The Pi Network's coin is trading within a range of thirty-four to thirty-seven cents. The next challenge it faces is at thirty-nine cents, while a safety net exists at thirty-two cents. Recently, Pi has seen a slight increase of about a quarter percent in the last week, though it dropped over ten percent in the previous month. Over six months, it's down almost seventy percent. But with the Relative Strength Index at a low thirty-four, there's potential for growth. If Pi breaks past the resistance at forty-two cents, it could rise by roughly fifteen percent from the current range. Although still on a recovery path, Pi Network shows signs of catching up with its moving averages. Conclusion Pi Network’s upcoming testnet upgrade could be the turning point that brings renewed energy to its price action. Despite recent setbacks, technicals suggest room for growth if resistance levels are cleared. With anticipation building around the long-awaited mainnet launch, PI stands at a critical juncture — one that could decide whether it reclaims momentum and begins a stronger climb in the months ahead.

BTC’s rally stalled over the weekend as buying pressure waned, with the price dipping to $115,314. To make matters worse, a Bitcoin whale who sold $4 billion in Bitcoin two weeks ago has started offloading their holdings yet again. Bitcoin ETFs Register Strong Inflows Spot Bitcoin ETFs are witnessing renewed inflows as institutional interest and appetite return. The US-listed ETFs registered $642 million in inflows on Friday, the fifth straight day of gains. This pushed cumulative net inflows to nearly $57 billion, with total net assets at $153 billion. Fidelity’s FBTC led the inflows on Friday with over $315 million in net inflows, followed by BlackRock’s IBIT with $264 million. Trading volumes across Bitcoin ETFs topped $3.89 billion, indicating significant institutional interest. The jump in inflows comes amid a quiet start to the month, indicating a shift in investor sentiment as macroeconomic conditions improve. Bitcoin ETFs have registered $2.34 billion in net inflows over the past five days. US Could Create Strategic Bitcoin Reserve This Year: Alex Thorn Galaxy Digital’s head of firmwide research, Alex Thorn, believes the US government will create the highly anticipated Bitcoin reserve by the end of the year. Thorn stated in a recent post on X, “I still think there’s a strong chance the US government will announce this year that it has formed the strategic Bitcoin reserve (SBR) and is formally holding BTC as a strategic asset. Market seems to be completely underpricing the likelihood of such an announcement.” President Trump signed an executive order to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve in March. However, a formal plan is yet to be confirmed. Thorn believes recent developments suggest the plan to create a strategic reserve is in motion. US lawmakers recently introduced a bill directing the US Treasury to examine and produce a report on the feasibility and technical considerations of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Trump’s crypto liaison has also confirmed the administration remains keen on the idea of a strategic reserve. However, not everyone shares Thorn’s optimism. According to Dave Weisburger, former chairman of CoinRoute, a strategic Bitcoin reserve will only come to fruition in 2026. “I have made the point many times that this administration is too smart to announce ANYTHING until AFTER they accumulate to their initial target... My only disagreement, Alex, is I think it happens in 2026, not this year.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin’s (BTC) rally stalled over the weekend after the flagship cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $116,833 on Friday. It registered a marginal drop on Saturday before falling 0.56% on Sunday to settle at $115,314. The flagship cryptocurrency rallied to an intraday high of $116,802 during the ongoing session before losing momentum and dropping to its current level. BTC stalled around $116,000 thanks to a jump in selling pressure after a Bitcoin whale began dumping his holdings on the market. The whale in question had sold $4 billion worth of BTC last month, swapping the cryptocurrency for ETH. The whale started selling again after the price crossed $116,000, putting the brakes on the rally. Crypto analytics platform Lookonchain confirmed the development on X, stating, “After a two-week break, the Bitcoin OG who exchanged 35,991 BTC ($4.04B) for 886,371 ETH ($4.07B) is back to selling BTC . 2 wallets linked to this Bitcoin OG have deposited 1,176 BTC ($136.2M) to Hyperliquid in the past 2 hours and started dumping.” Whale activity can often provide a glimpse of where “smart money” is headed. BTC is hovering above its weekly close as it heads into a key macro week for crypto and other risk assets. According to data from TradingView, BTC dropped towards $115,000 over the weekend, falling to a low of $115,177. The flagship cryptocurrency avoided volatility on Friday and over the weekend, with popular trader Skew stating on X, “Pretty clear price is being walked down here yet again, going into a new week. Longs are being used as liquidity thus far ~ likely for fills. However, some pretty decent bid depth & liquidity just below $115K Time to pay attention.” Market participants were also muted about BTC’s short-term prospects, with popular analyst Rekt Capital stating, “The goal isn't for Bitcoin to break $117k in the short-term. The goal is for Bitcoin to reclaim $114k as support first. Because that's what would enable the premium-buying necessary to get a price above $117k later on.” BTC faced volatility over the past weekend as it reached an intraday high of $113,390 on Friday (September 5). However, it failed to stay at this level and settled at $110,670, ultimately registering a marginal decline. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell 0.41%. BTC recovered on Sunday, rising nearly 1% to end the weekend at $111,129. The price continued pushing higher on Monday, rising 0.85% to cross $112,000 and settle at $112,072. However, it lost momentum on Tuesday, dropping 0.47% to $111,547. Positive sentiment returned on Wednesday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $113,000 and settle at $113,983. Source: TradingView Buyers retained control on Thursday as BTC rose 1.37%, crossing $115,000 and settling at $115,540. The price continued pushing higher on Friday, rising 0.49% to cross $116,000 and settle at $116,106. Despite the positive sentiment, price action turned negative over the weekend as BTC registered a marginal decline on Saturday and fell 0.56% on Sunday, ending the day at $115,314. BTC reached an intraday high of $116,802 during the ongoing session. However, with selling pressure returning, it lost momentum and fell below $115,000.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/experts-xrp-will-explode-in-the-next-few-years-heres-why/,"A new analysis shared on X by popular crypto commentator Xaif has stirred excitement in the XRP community. In the video shared by Xaif, the speakers, whom he called maxis, declare, “ The [XRP] prices are going to skyrocket here at some point and I’m gonna tell you why,” pointing to three key drivers: a tightly held supply, strong market demand, and XRP’s unique real-world utility. The speakers highlight on-chain data showing that “more than 80 percent [of] XRP’s supply is in wallets that have not moved for over a year.” This, he explains, demonstrates “very strong holding conviction,” with most investors refusing to part with their tokens. Independent blockchain analytics from mid-2025 support this claim, confirming that roughly 80–85% of XRP remains dormant or locked in escrow. A limited tradable supply, when paired with rising demand, can create the conditions for sharp price moves. : Just listen, maxis talking… $XRP gonna EXPLODE in the next few years Because!! It offers REAL utility pic.twitter.com/EKlQpZM11f — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) September 14, 2025 Surging Demand According to the video clip, “there is a huge and high demand for XRP… it blasted off back up in November of 2024.” Market data shows that institutional and retail interest in XRP rose sharply late last year, driven partly by Ripple’s rollout of RLUSD , its U.S. dollar stablecoin launched in December 2024. Another factor contributing to the surge is growing confidence following the final resolution of the long-running SEC lawsuit. This uptick in adoption adds weight to the assertion that “people want to hold it.” Real Utility Beyond Hype The speakers contrast XRP’s fundamentals with meme tokens, quipping about coins that rise because “that one’s cute, it looks like the dog… It’s got Trump’s name on it.” XRP, he stresses, “actually has utility… they can settle cross-border payments without delays, without the fees of traditional banking. They can process billions in volume at a fraction of current costs.” This utility is well documented. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity service already enables near-instant, low-cost international transfers, and the XRP Ledger consistently settles transactions in three to five seconds at negligible fees . Such capabilities position XRP as a serious alternative to slow, expensive correspondent banking systems. Regulatory Tailwinds The speakers also point to fresh U.S. policy developments: “Trump has just signed the GENIUS Act… It’s taken [XRP’s] ability to utilize their technology from the question stage to making it doable now.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The GENIUS Act, enacted in July 2025 , establishes a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins and crypto banks in the U.S., providing clearer guidelines that reduce uncertainty for projects like Ripple. This significant law aims to harmonize innovation and consumer protection, establishing guidelines for stablecoin issuance, reserve backing, and regulatory compliance, thereby shaping the framework for digital assets in a structured and protective manner. He further notes, “They have recently applied for a bank license,” a move confirmed by Ripple’s filing for a U.S. national trust charter earlier this year. If approved, the license would give Ripple direct access to Federal Reserve payment systems, strengthening its institutional credibility. The Road Ahead The conclusion is straightforward: “XRP will explode in the next few years.” While no forecast is guaranteed, the pillars he cites—tight supply, accelerating demand, high-speed global payments utility, and clearer U.S. regulation—create a powerful bullish narrative. Investors should remain aware of market risks, but the evidence backing this thesis shows why many analysts believe XRP’s next chapter could be its most dramatic yet.

Known as the first public blockchain to implement sharding, Zilliqa has long been a pioneer in scalable Layer 1 infrastructure. With the rollout of Zilliqa 2.0 and an upgraded mainnet, the platform is on its mission to bridge institutional finance and DeFi. With over $50 million in digital assets under treasury management and a focus on developer accessibility, regulatory compliance, and enterprise-grade performance, Zilliqa is evolving into a blockchain built for speed and real-world adoption. Today, we sat down with Alexander Zahnd, Interim CEO and CFO of Zilliqa, to discuss the platform’s transformation and vision and what’s next in the race for scalable, interoperable blockchain infrastructure. Embracing the Ethereum Ecosystem The story of Zilliqa in 2025 is one of reinvention. In June, the network launched a new mainnet featuring full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility and a decentralized Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, shifting from its original architecture. This upgrade was more than a technical milestone. By embracing EVM, Zilliqa opened the doors to Ethereum’s developer community and ecosystem tools, eliminating previous entry barriers linked to its native smart contract language, Scilla. PoS consensus replaced the more resource-intensive Proof of Work, increasing the network decentralization and offering better incentives for validators. Most noticeably, Zilliqa cut block times to roughly one second, making it one of the fastest chains in the market today. Zilliqa now focuses on building ecosystem maturity by rolling out key decentralized finance infrastructure like bridges, decentralized exchanges, NFT marketplaces, and money market protocols. These tools will enrich the user experience and solidify Zilliqa’s position as a platform for both developers and institutions. Bringing Institutional Trust to Web3 Zilliqa’s enterprise vision spotlights its partnership with the Liechtenstein Legal Entity Identifier Network (LTIN). This partnership aims to address the gap between legacy financial systems and Web3 by bringing a strong compliance standard on-chain. Zilliqa’s history includes forays into gaming, creator economies, and the metaverse. These experiments showcased the ecosystem’s adaptability and addressed the challenges of allocating resources across different verticals. Currently, Zilliqa has recalibrated its focus back to its core competency: providing robust, scalable blockchain infrastructure and enabling developers and enterprises to build on top of it. This meant shifting focus from consumer-facing products, to streamlining efforts to create a sustainable ecosystem. This focus aligns with Zilliqa’s goal of competing with larger ecosystems through performance and enterprise-grade tools that meet the demanding requirements of regulated markets. The new mainnet and institutional initiatives like LTIN underscore this commitment to infrastructure excellence and ecosystem empowerment. Staying Competitive in a Multi-Chain World Zilliqa gained early traction as one of the first blockchains to implement sharding, a solution designed to increase scalability by dividing the network into parallel shards that process transactions simultaneously. While sharding still remains a technical advantage, its early adoption lagged due to ecosystem barriers, including the complexity of Zilliqa’s original smart contract language, Scilla. Meanwhile, Layer 2 solutions on Ethereum and Ethereum’s scaling upgrades have narrowed the gap. Zilliqa 2.0 marks a strategic pivot. While scalability remains essential, the focus is now on accessibility and speed. Full EVM compatibility opens the network to the largest developer community in crypto, eliminating the isolation that Scilla created. Fast block times and PoS consensus further strengthen its appeal. This combination of speed, ease of integration, and decentralization is Zilliqa’s current edge in a multi-chain landscape. UK & Asia remain a focus for Global Growth. Zilliqa’s strongest user base remains in Southeast Asia. However, the company views the UK as a key strategic market, particularly given the region’s evolving regulatory framework and appetite for blockchain innovation. Projects like The Winners Circle, which connects traditional fan engagement with Web3 experiences, reiterating Zilliqa’s approach in the UK, which involves verifiably and transparently bridging physical loyalty programs with digital tokens. By maintaining a strong network in Asia while cultivating strategic partnerships and projects in markets like the UK, Zilliqa is positioning itself as a truly global player, able to navigate regulatory requirements and deliver compliant, scalable blockchain solutions worldwide. As digital assets and decentralized applications grow in complexity and regulatory scrutiny, Zilliqa’s approach of combining fast, scalable infrastructure with real-world compliance and enterprise partnerships positions it to remain competitive. Zilliqa’s current progress shows how blockchain can bridge traditional finance and Web3, unlocking new possibilities for institutions and developers alike in an industry often criticized for hype and fragmentation.

Shiba Inu Coin has gained a huge fan base, but short-term volatility and declining investor interest are affecting the narrative. While SHIB remains a cultural and financial force, the current climate suggests traders are looking at new altcoins to track, namely projects with tangible use cases in the real world. One of the names being mentioned more often is Remittix (RTX) , a cross-chain DeFi protocol with a strong presale run and product launches on the horizon. Shiba Inu Price and Market Outlook Recent Shiba Inu news illustrates the challenge of sustaining momentum in the cryptocurrency market these days. Shiba Inu price has been hovering at $0.00001369, down by 5.61%, with market capitalization standing at $8.07 billion. The trade volume per day also fell sharply to $354.54 million, down by 42.34%, reflecting lower engagement from traders. This slowdown shows how SHIB is surfing waves of speculation, with the majority of investors asking whether it has enough to sustain interest in the next big cycle. Although the token remains one of the most discussed assets in the meme coin universe, analysts caution that a comeback to all-time highs might not be forthcoming. Instead, the story is shifting. As the talks of the next big altcoin 2025 intensify, holders are likening their SHIB holdings to new prospects like low gas fee crypto projects and live now crypto presales. The potential of projects that bring together scalability, accessibility, and crypto with real-world utility is drawing attention, especially since long-term viability remains a concern for SHIB. Remittix: Presale Momentum and Wallet Beta Launch One of the best crypto presales 2025, Remittix is positioning itself as a serious contender. Priced at $0.1080 per token , RTX has already raised over $25.6 million by selling over 661.8 million tokens. The project's differentiation is that it will simplify cross-border payments by enabling direct crypto-to-bank transfers — a cross-chain DeFi project targeting the $19 trillion payments market globally. Hype is building for Remittix Wallet Beta Launch on September 15th, which will be the project's very first working product. The mobile-first wallet will allow for the management of multiple assets, with real-time FX conversion and global payment rails. For many, this is a signal that Remittix is not just another upcoming altcoin to keep an eye on but one of the best DeFi projects 2025 with actual adoption potential. Referral Program and Community Rewards The other momentum driver is Remittix's new referral program, which rewards users with 15% in USDT, claimable instantly every 24 hours through the dashboard. The innovative system rewards daily instead of lengthy lock-up times, making it appealing for the investment of crypto at an early stage. Remittix has also announced a $250,000 community giveaway, which is contributing to the hype among investors seeking the next 100x crypto or low cap crypto gems. Together, the presale success, wallet beta testing, and incentive structures position RTX as one of the top crypto to buy now in September. Why Investors Are Taking Notice of Remittix ● $25.6M+ raised and 661M+ tokens sold in presale● Wallet Beta launching September 15● 15% referral rewards paid in USDT daily● $250,000 community giveaway live Shiba Inu price will continue to dominate headlines, but the growing appetite for new crypto projects such as Remittix shows where investors are focusing their interest. With utility-first products, strong presale support, and product launches already underway, RTX is quickly emerging as one of 2025's best new altcoins.

The first-ever memecoin-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) is set to launch. The Dogecoin ETF (DOJE), developed by the REX Shares-Osprey partnership, may begin trading this week after weeks of delays. The fund was expected to launch last week alongside Bonk (BONK), XRP, Bitcoin, and even Trump-themed ETFs. However, DOJE's launch didn't materialize. Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart pointed to Wednesday as a possible launch date but emphasized that there were no guarantees. “It seems more likely,” Seyffart said. “That's our base case scenario.” If approved, DOJE would be the first ETF built on a memecoin in the U.S. While memecoins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Bonk generally don't offer economic benefits, they are gaining popularity through internet culture, celebrity endorsements, and speculative trading. Related News: BREAKING: First XRP ETF to List on Exchange This Week - But Pay Attention to These Details Balchunas commented on this development in a post from his X account, saying, “For the first time in the US, an ETF containing an asset with no real use is coming.” DOJE will not be a spot ETF. Instead of holding DOGE directly, it will offer investors indirect exposure through futures and derivatives through a subsidiary based in the Cayman Islands. This structure will eliminate the need for physical storage of the coin and give investors access to DOGE performance through traditional brokerage accounts. *This is not investment advice.

51776738,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/staking-xrp-now-possible-xrp-tundra-launches-platform-with-no-minimum-requirement/,1757957092,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/51776738.jpeg,Staking XRP Now Possible: XRP Tundra Launches Platform with No Minimum Requirements,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/staking-xrp-now-possible-xrp-tundra-launches-platform-with-no-minimum-requirement/,"One of the biggest frustrations with staking platforms is the entry barrier. Minimum deposits often lock out smaller holders, leaving rewards accessible only to those with thousands of tokens. XRP Tundra has removed that obstacle. With its September 2025 launch, the project introduces a staking system that accepts any balance, making rewards available to every XRP holder, not just large accounts. The platform’s Cryo Vaults allow tokens to be locked for fixed terms with payouts in TUNDRA, while the original XRP remains secure on the ledger. At the same time, the presale priced at $0.30 per token delivers two assets for every purchase — one on Solana and one on XRPL — giving participants diversification along with accessibility. For a community that has long been waiting for practical staking, Tundra offers an inclusive solution that works for everyone. Staking for Every Holder Cryo Vaults are the core of Tundra’s system. Holders can commit XRP for seven, thirty, sixty, or ninety days and earn rewards in TUNDRA. There is no minimum balance, so whether someone holds 20 XRP or 20,000, they can participate on equal terms. The design ensures that the barrier to entry is not wealth or technical expertise but simply the willingness to engage. Flexibility comes from Frost Keys, NFTs that allow users to boost multipliers or reduce lock-up times. This added layer gives participants more control without undermining the simplicity of the base system. In a recent video, prominent market observer Token Empire emphasized that accessibility is crucial for adoption. Making staking accessible to all holders increases participation and encourages longer commitments, helping stabilize XRP’s community and reduce market volatility. Two Tokens for the Price of One Beyond staking, Tundra is running a presale that offers built-in diversification. Each purchase delivers TUNDRA-S on Solana and TUNDRA-X on XRPL at the presale price of $0.30. Instead of requiring multiple rounds or separate contributions, the system provides both assets in a single transaction. The two tokens serve different roles. TUNDRA-S is a utility token within Solana’s high-speed, low-fee DeFi environment, ideal for integrations and active use. TUNDRA-X anchors governance and reserves on the XRP Ledger, ensuring long-term stability and decision-making power. Together, they create a balanced model where one chain drives utility and the other reinforces security. For investors, it means exposure to both ecosystems without added effort. Audits and Verification for Trust Tundra’s developers have made verification central to their rollout. The platform has completed independent audits with Cyberscope , Solidproof , and Freshcoins . These assessments reviewed the smart contracts, tokenomics, and security assumptions, with results published openly for transparency. The team also underwent KYC verification with Vital Block . This additional layer confirms accountability at the leadership level and helps distinguish Tundra from anonymous presale projects. Combined, these measures provide the kind of assurance investors increasingly demand. Making XRP Work for Everyone The launch of XRP Tundra represents a new phase for Ripple’s community. Staking is now possible for every holder, regardless of balance. The presale adds diversification by distributing two tokens across Solana and XRPL. Independent audits and KYC verification build confidence in the system’s integrity. For the first time, XRP is not just a token to hold or transfer but an asset that can generate returns directly on the ledger. With no minimum requirement, the opportunity is open to all. Join the Launch The presale is live at $0.30 per token. Every purchase delivers Solana-based TUNDRA-S and XRPL-based TUNDRA-X, while Cryo Vaults let all XRP holders start earning yield on their balances. For those ready to turn idle holdings into productive assets, Tundra provides the answer.

This bold financial strategy is specifically designed to fund substantial Strive Bitcoin buys , signaling a clear and ambitious direction for the company in the dynamic cryptocurrency market. This move isn’t just about acquiring digital assets; it’s a strategic play to enhance shareholder value and solidify Strive’s position. What’s Behind Strive’s Ambitious $950M Capital Plan? The newly formed company, with its finalized board of directors, has outlined a comprehensive capital strategy that focuses on two key initiatives. These initiatives are carefully structured to maximize the impact on the company’s Bitcoin holdings and, consequently, its value per share. $450 Million At-The-Market (ATM) Share Offering: This program allows Strive to issue new shares into the market over time, providing flexibility in raising capital. $500 Million Stock Repurchase Program: Through this initiative, Strive plans to buy back its own shares from the open market. Together, these programs aim to strategically increase the value of Bitcoin per share for the company. This isn’t the first time Strive’s intentions regarding Bitcoin have surfaced; Bitcoin World previously reported that Strive’s CEO had indicated the firm would purchase over $700 million in BTC following the merger. The current $950 million plan significantly surpasses that initial figure, demonstrating even greater commitment. How Will These Initiatives Drive Significant Strive Bitcoin Buys ? The combination of an ATM offering and a stock repurchase program provides a dual approach to increasing Bitcoin exposure and shareholder value. The ATM offering enables Strive to raise capital efficiently, which can then be allocated towards purchasing Bitcoin. Furthermore, the stock repurchase program reduces the total number of outstanding shares. Consequently, as the number of shares decreases, the proportional value of the company’s existing Bitcoin holdings per remaining share theoretically increases. This strategic financial engineering highlights Strive’s confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term store of value and a crucial component of its future growth. The goal is clear: to enhance the intrinsic value for investors by directly linking it to the performance and accumulation of Bitcoin. Therefore, these initiatives are not merely financial transactions but fundamental pillars supporting Strive’s long-term vision in the digital asset space. Strive’s Strategic Vision: More Than Just Acquiring Bitcoin Strive’s capital plan is more than just a large sum of money; it represents a profound strategic commitment. By focusing on increasing Bitcoin per share, the company explicitly ties its success to the performance of the leading cryptocurrency. This approach positions Strive as a forward-thinking entity, ready to capitalize on the evolving digital economy. The merger that formed Strive, bringing together Asset Entity and Strive, was likely intended to create a more robust platform for such ambitious undertakings. The consolidation of resources and expertise has evidently paved the way for this significant capital allocation. Moreover, the move could inspire other traditional companies to explore similar strategies for integrating digital assets into their balance sheets, recognizing Bitcoin’s growing importance. What Are the Broader Implications of Strive’s Substantial Bitcoin Buys ? Such a significant capital plan from a newly merged entity sends a strong signal to the market. Firstly, it underscores the increasing institutional confidence in Bitcoin. When companies like Strive commit nearly a billion dollars to Bitcoin-related strategies, it legitimizes the asset further in the eyes of mainstream investors and corporations. Secondly, these substantial Strive Bitcoin buys could have a ripple effect. They might influence market sentiment positively, potentially contributing to increased demand and price stability for Bitcoin. Furthermore, the transparency of Strive’s plan, detailing how capital will be raised and utilized, provides a model for other firms considering similar ventures. This strategic clarity helps build trust and demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of both traditional finance and the cryptocurrency landscape. In conclusion, Strive’s announcement of a $950 million capital plan to fund Bitcoin buys marks a pivotal moment for the company and potentially for the broader crypto market. By leveraging an ATM share offering and a stock repurchase program, Strive aims to significantly increase the value of Bitcoin per share, reinforcing its strategic commitment to digital assets. This bold move highlights growing institutional adoption and sets a compelling precedent for future corporate engagement with Bitcoin. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Strive’s $950M capital plan? A1: Strive’s $950 million capital plan involves a $450 million at-the-market (ATM) share offering and a $500 million stock repurchase program, both designed to fund Bitcoin acquisitions and increase Bitcoin value per share. Q2: How will this plan impact Strive’s Bitcoin holdings? A2: The plan is specifically aimed at increasing Strive’s Bitcoin holdings. The capital raised from the ATM offering will be used for Bitcoin buys, and the stock repurchase program will enhance the value of Bitcoin per remaining share. Q3: What is an ATM share offering and a stock repurchase program? A3: An At-The-Market (ATM) share offering allows a company to sell new shares over time directly into the existing market. A stock repurchase program involves a company buying back its own shares from the open market, which can reduce outstanding shares and potentially increase earnings per share. Q4: Why is Strive focusing on increasing Bitcoin per share value? A4: Strive aims to increase Bitcoin per share value to enhance shareholder returns and demonstrate its strategic commitment to Bitcoin as a core asset. This aligns the company’s growth directly with the performance of the leading cryptocurrency. Q5: When will Strive execute these Bitcoin buys? A5: The article indicates that the $450 million ATM share offering and $500 million stock repurchase program are initiatives that Strive plans to execute, implying these Bitcoin buys will occur as part of this ongoing capital plan.

The statement was made while Chinese and American officials were locked in trade negotiations in Madrid, trying for the fourth time in four months to cool off a worsening economic feud. According to Reuters, China’s commerce ministry described Washington’s latest move as “a classic example of economic coercion,” urging the U.S. to drop the pressure and handle disputes through equal dialogue. Beijing’s anger was triggered by the U.S. lobbying the G7 and NATO to back secondary tariffs on Chinese imports. The White House claims China’s ongoing oil purchases from Russia are helping Moscow sidestep global sanctions. But China has made it clear that it doesn’t intend to follow U.S.-led sanctions, and it’s not going to stop buying Russian oil. The back-and-forth came as U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng began day two of closed-door meetings inside Spain’s Palacio de Santa Cruz. Talks on TikTok ownership reach tentative deal While trade tensions exploded, another major issue, TikTok, saw progress. Bessent confirmed that U.S. and Chinese officials had agreed on a framework to transfer ownership of the app’s U.S. business to an American-controlled entity. Final confirmation is expected during a call between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping on Friday. Bessent said the looming September 17 deadline forced negotiators to move quickly, but he also mentioned the timeline might be extended another 90 days to finalize details. He explained that both sides approached TikTok from completely different angles. “They’re interested in Chinese characteristics of the app, which they think are soft power,” Bessent said. “We don’t care about Chinese characteristics. We care about national security.” The earlier version of this deal, announced in March, didn’t go anywhere. This time, both delegations seem more serious. The U.S. Congress had already passed a law in 2024 demanding TikTok be sold or shut down entirely, citing surveillance risks and data exposure to Beijing. Trump, who credits TikTok for helping him win re-election, has 15 million followers on the app and doesn’t want it banned. “A deal was also reached on a ‘certain’ company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save. They will be very happy! I will be speaking to President Xi on Friday. The relationship remains a very strong one!!!” he wrote on Truth Social. Meanwhile, the White House recently launched its own official TikTok account to expand messaging on the platform. Chip tensions flare as China targets Nvidia The same day trade talks continued, China’s market regulator launched an antitrust investigation into U.S. chipmaker Nvidia, saying early findings showed it violated anti-monopoly laws. Bessent called the timing “poor” but didn’t comment further. The decision is widely viewed as payback for Washington’s decision to restrict chip and semiconductor exports to China, part of the growing tech war between the two governments. Wang Jingtao, an official with China’s cyberspace watchdog, confirmed that the proposed TikTok deal could include licensing agreements for intellectual property, including TikTok’s underlying algorithms. However, it’s still unclear whether ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, will hand over control of the platform’s full tech stack. Li Chenggang, China’s chief trade negotiator, said U.S. security arguments were just more “unilateral bullying” and hinted that China would only move forward with TikTok divestment if Washington made concessions on tech and trade restrictions. Scott confirmed that China had come to the table with “a very aggressive ask,” but stressed the U.S. wouldn’t compromise national security just to keep a social media app running. Negotiators from both countries have been meeting in European capitals since May, trying to stop the constant escalation of tariffs and halt the blockage of rare earth exports. Jamieson Greer, the U.S. Trade Representative, said the TikTok agreement showed both countries were at least willing to engage seriously. “It’s no secret that there are serious issues on trade, economics, and national security between the United States and China. To be able to come, sit down, quickly identify the issues, narrow them down to a very granular spot, and be able to come to a conclusion, subject to the leaders’ approval, I mean, that is remarkable,” Greer said. As of now, the Trump–Xi phone call scheduled for Friday is expected to lock in the TikTok ownership terms and possibly push forward other pending issues. China wants tech restrictions rolled back, while the U.S. continues to push allies to punish Beijing economically for its ties to Russia. Bessent said the Russia issue was only “briefly discussed,” but made it clear the White House isn’t backing down.

The move reflects growing concern that uneven licensing standards across the bloc could expose investors and markets to risk. Marie-Anne Barbat-Layani, president of France’s securities watchdog, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), told Reuters that the country wants oversight of the industry to be transferred to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) in Paris. The statement follows calls from Italy and Austria for a more harmonized approach to supervision of the crypto sector. MiCA Passporting Sparks Debate The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which came into force earlier this year, allows crypto firms to apply for licenses in one member state and then use that approval to operate across the bloc’s 27 countries—a process known as “passporting.” While the framework encourages consistency, regulators and policymakers have warned that it may create loopholes. Some jurisdictions are applying looser standards, potentially allowing firms to shop around for the easiest route to approval before expanding operations across Europe. Barbat-Layani explains that this oversight patchwork raises questions about whether companies are adequately supervised as they scale cross-border operations. The “Atomic Weapon” Option In a sign of France’s willingness to act unilaterally if needed, the AMF told Reuters it would not rule out challenging the validity of licenses granted elsewhere in the EU. Such a step would undermine the principle of passporting, which has long been a cornerstone of Europe’s single financial market. “We do not exclude the possibility of refusing the EU passport,” Barbat-Layani said. “It’s very complex legally and not a very good signal for the single market—it’s a bit like the ‘atomic weapon’ … but it’s still a possibility we hold in reserve.” The AMF did not specify which firms might face scrutiny or under what criteria their licenses could be rejected. A Key Juncture for Crypto Oversight At stake is the stability of a global crypto industry worth trillions of dollars. Regulators worldwide have repeatedly warned that inadequate oversight could trigger financial instability and harm retail investors. France just dropped a warning shot. Its regulator AMF says it may block crypto firms using MiCA licenses from other EU states. Translation: No sneaking in through the “easy countries.” Passport denied. Europe’s crypto fight just got real. — CeranosFinance (@CeranosFinance) September 15, 2025 By pushing for ESMA to take over supervision of the largest crypto firms, France and its allies are indicating that national approaches may not be sufficient to address the risks. Whether other EU members agree to hand more power to the bloc’s central regulator will determine how Europe balances innovation, investor protection, and market stability.

While Dogecoin continues to hold its place as a cultural cornerstone, Mutuum Finance is drawing headlines for its innovative approach to decentralized finance, with a focus on sustainable yield strategies and real-world integration. Mutuum Finance presale is in Phase 6 at a price of $0.035. The project has raised over $15.8 million in total amount and has over 16,300 token holders. As new investors enter the market this year, MUTM can redefine what long-term value looks like in crypto. Dogecoin Stands Its Ground in Market changes At the current time, Dogecoin (DOGE) stands at 0.29, and the trading volumes show that the community has continued to participate in it and that speculation of its presence in the wider cryptocurrency market is still ongoing. Although its price dynamics are still strongly dependent on the general market mood and momentum driven by social actors, Dogecoin still stays relevant because of its popularity as a digital asset. Meanwhile, such new entrants as Mutuum Finance are also getting into the debate as investors consider the pros and cons of bringing on board old tokens and new possibilities. Mutuum Finance Stage 6 Momentum At Stage 6 of presale, MUTM is being aggressively bought at $0.035 by investors. The demand is not indicative of leveling off as Stage 7 nears. To date, over 16,300 investors have already purchased tokens and over $15.8 million of capital has been raised by the project, which is a good indication of positive market interest and an increasing launch expectation. Accuracy in Price Discovery Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink oracles to provide protection in lending, trading, and liquidation transactions in USD-denominated assets prices and token values of assets like ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracle mechanisms, composite data feeds and time-weighted averages of decentralized exchanges are also employed to further reduce errors. The multi-layered use ensures the data on prices can be as accurate as possible even in the stressful situations in the market. Market volatility is the direct cause of protocol collateral management. The stability of the assets results in the decoupling of LTV and liquidation. Whether the tokens are riskier or more stable are allocated lower and higher quotas respectively. There are proportionate use of reserve multipliers (from 10% of the smaller assets to 35% of the riskier assets), in a manner that does not diminish diversification. Shaping the Future of DeFi Mutuum Finance is constructing a protocol to passively lend and borrow money, in a bid to achieve active capital management with the possibility of letting users borrow against securitised stacks of assets. It operates the platform under a stability algorithm and an interest rate optimization algorithm that work on the principles of efficiency and endurance of long-term capital utilization. Risk and Liquidity Protection The protocol actively controls both the liquidity and volatility in such a way that it is able to close illiquid positions on an effective basis. The exposure to risk is extremely limited, and the liquidation points are very clear. Stablecoins and ETH introduce additional LTV layers with risky assets being secured with less risky assets. A reserve factor is shared proportionally by the classes of assets, and allows trading opportunities maximization of safety of the reserves of the protocol. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is poised to be one of the strongest altcoins in the upcoming bull run. New investors seeking growth beyond meme-driven momentum in 2025 may find MUTM a smarter bet over DOGE.

A powerful new pro-crypto Super PAC has reportedly emerged, armed with an astonishing war chest of over $100 million. This significant development, initially highlighted by Eleanor Terrett of Crypto in America, signals a major push for digital asset advocacy ahead of the crucial U.S. midterm elections. It’s a game-changer that could dramatically influence how crypto is perceived and regulated in Washington. What is a Pro-Crypto Super PAC and Why Does it Matter? For those new to the political landscape, a Super PAC (Political Action Committee) is an independent political committee. It can raise unlimited sums of money from corporations, unions, associations, and individuals. Unlike traditional PACs, Super PACs can spend unlimited sums to overtly advocate for or against political candidates. The establishment of a well-funded pro-crypto Super PAC means a concerted effort to support candidates who champion digital assets and oppose those who might hinder innovation. This isn’t just about money; it’s about amplifying the voice of the crypto community in the halls of power. Advocacy: It will fund campaigns supporting crypto-friendly politicians. Education: It can educate voters and policymakers on the benefits of digital assets. Influence: It aims to shape policy discussions around blockchain and cryptocurrencies. The Impact of a $100M Pro-Crypto Super PAC on Elections With over $100 million at its disposal, this new pro-crypto Super PAC is poised to become a formidable force in the upcoming midterm elections. Such substantial funding allows for extensive advertising campaigns, voter outreach programs, and strategic endorsements. This level of financial backing can sway public opinion and even determine the outcomes of closely contested races. Eleanor Terrett emphasized that this particular committee is distinct from Fairshake, another prominent crypto-focused Super PAC. This indicates a growing, multi-faceted approach to crypto advocacy, suggesting a broader and more diverse effort to influence political outcomes. The goal is clear: to foster an environment where digital innovation can thrive. Navigating the Political Landscape with Crypto Advocacy The emergence of this powerful pro-crypto Super PAC highlights the increasing maturity of the cryptocurrency industry. It signifies a shift from purely technological development to active engagement in political processes. This engagement is crucial for several reasons: Regulatory Clarity: The industry seeks clear, sensible regulations rather than prohibitive measures. Innovation Protection: It aims to protect the nascent blockchain technology from overly restrictive laws. Economic Growth: Advocates believe crypto can drive significant economic growth and job creation. However, challenges remain. The crypto industry faces skepticism from some lawmakers and regulators. This Super PAC’s role will be to bridge that gap, presenting a compelling case for the potential of digital assets to a wider audience. What Does This Mean for the Future of Pro-Crypto Super PACs? This massive investment into a pro-crypto Super PAC sets a precedent for future political involvement from the digital asset sector. It demonstrates a long-term commitment to shaping policy and ensuring a favorable regulatory environment. As the crypto market continues to evolve, so too will its political footprint. For individuals invested in cryptocurrencies, this development offers a glimmer of hope for more supportive policies. It suggests that the industry is not just waiting for regulations to happen but is actively working to influence them in a positive direction. Keep an eye on the news as the midterm elections approach; the impact of this funding will undoubtedly become clearer. FAQs About the New Pro-Crypto Super PAC Q1: What is a Super PAC? A1: A Super PAC is an independent political action committee that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to support or oppose political candidates, but it cannot coordinate directly with campaigns. Q2: How much funding does this new pro-crypto Super PAC have? A2: This newly reported pro-crypto Super PAC has over $100 million in funding. Q3: Is this Super PAC related to Fairshake? A3: No, Eleanor Terrett of Crypto in America explicitly stated that this new political action committee is separate from Fairshake. Q4: What is the main goal of a pro-crypto Super PAC? A4: The primary goal is to advocate for policies favorable to the cryptocurrency industry, support crypto-friendly candidates, and educate the public and policymakers on digital assets. Q5: How might this funding impact the U.S. midterm elections? A5: The substantial funding can be used for extensive advertising, voter outreach, and strategic endorsements, potentially influencing public opinion and election outcomes in favor of crypto-friendly candidates.

But as many crypto speculators re-assess what makes a token sustainable, a rising newcomer, Remittix , is drawing comparisons to the meme-champion PEPE for its upside potential and real-world utility. This newcomer is making moves: wallet launches, centralized exchange listing plans, and built-for-use architecture that promise more than just speculation. The contrast is stirring interest from investors seeking the next altcoin with both community energy and usable tech. PEPE Price Prediction: Analysts’ Forecasts & Challenges Technicals around PEPE suggest a symmetrical triangle formation. Some analysts believe that if trading volume breaks above key resistance, PEPE could reach $0.000026. One analyst,Ali Martinez, forecasted roughly 111% upside from current levels if certain resistance is cleared. Other PEPE price prediction suggest downside risk. Some models expect PEPE to drop by about 20-25% over the next month if momentum fails to hold. PEPE is also under pressure due to its very large circulating supply and repeated volatility. Remittix: Why It’s Being Compared To PEPE & Seen As The Next Big Altcoin Remittix is being positioned by many as a token with meme-coin energy but built for serious utility, making people whisper that it could become the “next PEPE.” Its real-use case includes cross-border payments, wallet functionality for many cryptocurrencies, support for dozens of fiat currencies, and low gas fee transactions. What gives Remittix an edge over many meme or hype tokens is its focus on solving real-world problems. It aims at the $19-trillion remittance market. Its blockchain structure and tokenomics are built to reduce friction, offer low transaction cost, and include features like real-time FX conversions. Plus, its referral system gives users a 15% bonus in USDT for bringing others in. That adds both community incentive and passive income potential, which many memes don’t deliver. It has passed a CertiK audit with favorable results, has announced CEX listings (BitMart, LBank, etc.), and has seen high fundraising momentum. Key Selling Points of Remittix ● Real-World Utility: Built for actual use — not just speculation.● Low gas fees built into transactions, focusing on cost efficiency.● Security First: Audited by CertiK, one of the top blockchain security firms.● 15% Referral Bonus paid in USDT when you refer someone.● Momentum is building ahead of wallet launch. It’s Time To Consider RTX Remittix could be one of those rare tokens that balances community excitement with enough structure to matter. With a wallet going live shortly, confirmed centralized exchange listing plans, referral rewards, strong audits, and a real-world payments mission, it’s not just hype. It’s utility plus momentum. If you believe that utility-driven tokens will lead the market in 2025, buying Remittix now may make sense. There is a $250,000 giveaway going on to reward early supporters. With solid upcoming catalysts ahead, Remittix may offer better risk vs up-side than many meme coins that rely mostly on hype cycles.

Whale Alert, a prominent blockchain tracking service, reported a massive Bitcoin whale transfer involving 7,519 BTC. This colossal sum, valued at approximately $863 million, moved from the well-known exchange Coinbase to an entirely new and previously unknown wallet. Such a significant Bitcoin whale transfer is not just a routine transaction; it often signals potential shifts in market dynamics and prompts a deeper look into the intentions behind such large-scale movements. What Exactly is a Bitcoin Whale Transfer? When we talk about a Bitcoin whale transfer , we are referring to the movement of a very large amount of Bitcoin by an individual or entity known as a ‘whale.’ These whales are typically investors who hold substantial amounts of cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices with their transactions. Their moves are closely watched because they can often precede significant market events or indicate changing sentiment among major holders. Who are Whales? These are often early adopters, institutional investors, or large investment funds. Why are they important? Their large holdings mean their buy or sell orders can create considerable price volatility. How are they tracked? Services like Whale Alert monitor public blockchain data to identify and report these large transactions. This particular Bitcoin whale transfer from Coinbase, a major centralized exchange, to an unknown wallet adds an extra layer of intrigue. It suggests a deliberate move by a significant player to either consolidate holdings, prepare for an over-the-counter (OTC) trade, or simply enhance security by moving assets off an exchange. Why Do These Massive Bitcoin Whale Transfers Matter to the Market? Every substantial Bitcoin whale transfer carries potential implications for the broader crypto market. The sheer size of this $863 million transaction means it cannot be overlooked. Historically, such large movements have sometimes been precursors to market volatility, either upward or downward. When a whale moves coins off an exchange, it can be interpreted in several ways: Increased Security: Moving funds to a private, cold storage wallet is a common practice for enhancing security and reducing counterparty risk associated with exchanges. Preparation for OTC Deals: Large blocks of Bitcoin are often traded ‘over-the-counter’ to avoid impacting exchange order books and to secure better prices for large volumes. Accumulation or Distribution: It could indicate an intention to hold for the long term (accumulation) or prepare for a future large sale (distribution). For everyday investors, understanding the context of a Bitcoin whale transfer is crucial. While it doesn’t always lead to immediate price action, it offers a glimpse into the strategies of major market participants. This specific transfer could signal a long-term conviction from the whale, as they choose to self-custody their significant assets. What Could This Bitcoin Whale Transfer Mean for the Future? The recent Bitcoin whale transfer from Coinbase prompts several questions about its potential impact. While the immediate effect on Bitcoin’s price might not be dramatic, the long-term implications could be significant. Such movements can influence market sentiment, especially if they are perceived as a sign of institutional confidence or, conversely, a precursor to large-scale selling. Given the size of this particular transfer, it’s reasonable to consider a few scenarios: Potential Scenarios: Institutional Adoption: The unknown wallet could belong to a new institutional player entering the Bitcoin space, choosing to hold their assets off-exchange for security or regulatory reasons. This would be a bullish signal for wider adoption. Long-Term HODLing: The whale might be moving their BTC into deep storage, signaling a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and a commitment to ‘HODLing’ (holding on for dear life). Privacy and Control: Some large holders prefer the privacy and direct control offered by self-custody, especially for such substantial amounts. Ultimately, while the exact motives behind this specific Bitcoin whale transfer remain speculative, it underscores the dynamic and often opaque nature of large-scale cryptocurrency movements. It serves as a powerful reminder of the substantial wealth circulating within the digital asset ecosystem and the importance of monitoring on-chain data for market insights. Conclusion: Keeping an Eye on the Giants The movement of 7,519 BTC from Coinbase to an unknown wallet represents a significant event in the cryptocurrency landscape. Valued at $863 million, this Bitcoin whale transfer highlights the continuous flow of substantial capital within the digital economy. While the immediate reasons for such a transfer often remain private, it undoubtedly sparks curiosity and encourages a deeper analysis of market trends and whale behavior. These large transactions, though sometimes mysterious, are vital indicators for understanding the broader health and direction of the Bitcoin market. Keeping an eye on these giants of the crypto world helps us better navigate the exciting and ever-evolving digital asset space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a ‘whale’ in cryptocurrency? A ‘whale’ is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices with their transactions. Their movements are closely watched for market insights. Q2: Why did this Bitcoin whale transfer occur from Coinbase? While the exact reason is unknown, common motives for moving large amounts of Bitcoin from an exchange like Coinbase include enhancing security by moving to cold storage, preparing for an over-the-counter (OTC) trade, or simply consolidating assets for better control. Q3: Does a Bitcoin whale transfer always impact the price? Not always immediately. While a large transfer can sometimes precede price volatility, especially if it signals an impending large sale or purchase, many transfers are for security or OTC deals and do not have an instant, direct impact on exchange prices. Q4: How are these large Bitcoin transactions tracked? Blockchain tracking services like Whale Alert monitor public blockchain data. Since all Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger, these services can identify and report large movements between known and unknown addresses. Q5: What are the potential implications of this specific Bitcoin whale transfer? Potential implications include increased security for the whale’s holdings, preparation for an institutional over-the-counter deal, or a long-term ‘HODLing’ strategy. It also highlights ongoing institutional interest and the dynamic nature of large capital movements in crypto.

With today’s platforms becoming more flexible and player-focused, there are now plenty of ways to join the action without reaching for your wallet. Sweepstakes Casinos When it comes to playing casino games without spending a dime, sweepstakes casinos have become the go-to choice, especially in the United States. What sets these sites apart is their use of two distinct virtual currencies: Gold Coins for casual play Sweeps Coins for games that can lead to cash prizes. Using sweeps coins to play gives users the chance to win real-world rewards through sweepstakes entries, while still being able to play casino games that are found at traditional online casino platforms. These coins aren’t something you have to buy. Basically, many sites hand them out through sign-up promotions, bonus offers, or even by sending in a mail-in request. It’s an accessible system that opens the door to genuine prizes without asking players to risk their own funds. What really makes sweepstakes casinos stand out is how closely they mirror the feel of a traditional casino. You’ll find high-quality games, interactive features , and a sense of community, all wrapped in a no-pressure environment. Demo Modes One of the easiest ways to explore online casino games risk-free is through demo modes. These are free-to-play versions of popular titles (slots, blackjack, roulette, and more) that let you get a feel for the game without making a deposit. You’ll use virtual credits instead of real money, but the gameplay stays authentic. The visuals, sound effects, and features are the same as in the real-money version, so you’re getting the full experience without the pressure. This option is particularly useful if you’re just starting out. You can learn how paylines work, see how bonus rounds trigger, or understand the pace of a roulette wheel. Even experienced players often turn to demo mode when testing unfamiliar games or trying out new strategies. No Deposit Bonuses: Some online casinos offer no deposit bonuses, which provide real-money credit or free spins simply for signing up. These promotions are targeted at attracting new players, and although the amounts are usually modest, they do provide a chance to win real money without having to deposit. Typical no deposit bonuses include: A fixed sum (e.g., $10 or $20) credited to your account A set number of free spins on popular slot games These bonuses come with specific terms, usually wagering requirements, that must be met before any winnings can be withdrawn. Still, they offer a genuine opportunity to gamble for free with the possibility of cashing out profits. Referral and Loyalty Programs Online casinos aren’t only focused on getting new players through the door. They’re just as interested in keeping the ones they have. That’s where referral and loyalty programs come into play, offering rewards for things like inviting friends or simply showing up and playing regularly. Referral bonuses may include: Free spins Bonus money Entry into special tournaments While some loyalty rewards are tied to real-money wagering, others provide daily login bonuses or missions that offer small bonuses regardless of deposits. Free Casino Tournaments Some online casinos run free-entry tournaments that let you go head-to-head with other players, without putting down a cent. These events can be centered around popular games like slots, blackjack, or poker, and often come with real rewards. These can range from bonus credits to actual cash payouts. Prizes may vary, and you’ll be playing against a crowd, but the experience itself is high-energy and rewarding in its own right. It’s perfect for players who enjoy a challenge without having to buy their seat at the table. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

But, Remittix experts expect to flip the entry positions of investors to enjoy multiple-fold gains in 2025. With the rise in ETF inflows into altcoins, enhanced macroeconomic situations, and growing market demand, there are enough reasons why analysts are convinced there's upside potential for these alt cryptos. But which rises more? Cardano Price Stays Bullish At report time, Cardano is cooling off around a key support range, trading close to $0.8804. Here's an asset up by 8.29% in the past week, as the latest of back-to-back increases in trader and retail actions. According to Bitcoinsensus, a renowned crypto analyst, there could be a fractal cycle repeating itself. For the analyst, a historical bullish pattern is happening after a bottom is finalized. This could likely drive Cardano price close to the $1.40 mark, before rising to the $1.86 zone by the start of next year. Source: X (Twitter) Litecoin Whales Could Propel Growth Litecoin demonstrates similar market optimism. The crypto asset is on the brink of a breakout as whale buying pressure grows. This aggressive pattern of the deep-pocketed traders is timely and well-calculated. A similar trend happened shortly after Grayscale EFT Filing and MEI Pharma’s rebranding to the Lite strategy. Source: Sentiment on X (Twitter) On Wednesday, Litecoin recorded a sharp rise, which took the asset close to the $117 mark. The asset has since then moved sideways, before the last healthy correction. With the Litecoin price at $114, could there still be that element of surprise where it reenters the top 10 crypto ranking? Remittix Records Spike in Interest Remittix (RTX) , the last alt on our radar might be the most promising as it keeps attracting robust market interest from retail investors. This project has now amassed over 25.6 million through investor funding, selling over 662 million RTX tokens while at it. Investors are flocking to Remittix in droves for a part of its multi-trillion-dollar market dominance target, huge profit potential, and compelling use cases. Here's why momentum is rising around the project: ● Referral Program: Remittix users can now receive some additional earnings. They will earn 15% of the worth of tokens purchased by whoever they refer. Payouts get paid directly to the wallet of the user in USDT on the same day.● Beta Wallet Launch: This launch is set for September 15.

According to Reuters , the regulator fears that some firms are exploiting gaps in the European regulatory framework by seeking approval in countries with more relaxed oversight. AMF head Marie-Anne Barbat-Layani compared the potential move to a ”nuclear option,” stressing that while France keeps this possibility in reserve, such action would send a troubling signal for the EU’s single market. She noted that crypto firms are actively searching for “weak links” in the system to secure faster and easier licensing. Regulators Push for Centralized EU Oversight The AMF, together with Italy’s CONSOB and Austria’s FMA, has urged legislators to grant more powers to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). In a joint statement, the regulators said that the first months of MiCAR’s implementation revealed major inconsistencies in how national authorities handle crypto markets. They argued that only a central EU-level regulator could ensure uniform rules across member states, prevent regulatory arbitrage, and strengthen trust in the growing digital asset sector. Calls to Tighten Rules on Cybersecurity and Token Issuance Regulators in France, Austria, and Italy have also called for stricter cybersecurity measures and closer supervision of token issuance to protect investors and market stability. The push comes as major exchanges continue seeking entry into the European market through different jurisdictions. Gemini, for example, secured its MiCAR license in Malta, while Bitvavo and Kraken received licenses in the Netherlands and Ireland respectively. In June 2025, ESMA Chair Verena Ross voiced support for transferring regulatory powers to ESMA itself, though some EU member states remain opposed. The debate highlights the tension between national regulators and the vision of a truly unified European crypto market.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-15 17:42:33

Dogecoin is drawing strong institutional interest ahead of its first U.S. ETF, Solana is pushing infrastructure and DeFi growth, and Chainlink is expanding with real-world data contracts. Meanwhile, Remittix is offering a 15% USDT referral program, a $250,000 giveaway, and there is its wallet beta launch, the first working product in the Remittix ecosystem. Holding all four could offer both stability and high upside this month. Dogecoin: Meme Icon Turning Institutional Dogecoin (DOGE) has regained momentum with the upcoming REX Osprey DOGE ETF, which is expected to start trading in the U.S. Whale accumulation of about 280 million DOGE over the past week shows rising institutional demand. Prices have rebounded from levels of resistance in the $0.24 to $0.25 region; a breakout would take DOGE toward $0.30, provided volume is favourably aligned. Though no such high utility as is possible in chains or oracles exists in Dogecoin, its brand, liquidity, and upcoming ETF are giving fresh validity. Solana: Scaling Fast & Gaining Traction Solana (SOL) remains in favour with increasing enterprise action and expansions in the DeFi ecosystem. Access protocols and layer 2 projects are being integrated with SOL, as well as a steady demand for staking among institutional holders. Price action has been choppy, yet fundamentals such as developer activity, minimal latency throughput, and ecosystem expansion are strong. If there are any macro tailwinds in place, such as regulatory clarity or positive interest rate signs, then SOL rides in those to higher highs. Chainlink: The Oracle Backbone Growing Chainlink (LINK) is pushing forward with alliances that deepen its ties to real-world data. The U.S. Department of Commerce is now delivering verified GDP and CPI metrics on-chain via Chainlink across multiple blockchains. Rumours of a Grayscale LINK ETF filing have added speculative upside. LINK’s price has recently consolidated near $24.20, showing mixed but potentially bullish signals. Why Remittix Is Drawing Investor Focus Remittix is being compared to DOGE, SOL, and LINK because it delivers both an incentive structure and a product roadmap in contexts where those tokens are not. SOL has speed, LINK has data, DOGE has community; Remittix seeks to combine rewards, usability, and product rollout in a single offer. That makes RTX an intriguing option for those aiming for high growth with developing fundamentals. The project has already sold more than 662 million tokens, raised over $25.6 million, and trades at $0.108. It secured a BitMart listing right after surpassing the $20 million milestone and followed this with an LBANK listing once $22 million was cleared. A third exchange listing is now being prepared. Those figures show a robust early traction that many new tokens aim for, but few deliver. Compared with the size and maturity of Solana projects or oracles, Remittix’s early numbers suggest it may offer greater percentage gain potential if everything proceeds well. Important features that are drawing investor attention: ● Users can send crypto to bank accounts in over 30 countries● The tokenomics are deflationary and designed for long-term growth● The project is audited by CertiK, which builds trust and transparency● The wallet beta launches in Q3 2025● Mass market appeal beyond the crypto crowd With the wallet beta launching in 24 hours, plus incentives like the referral rewards and the giveaway, many believe Remittix could outperform volatile meme plays or slow growth utilities in the near term. Why Remittix Might Be The Best Bet Among These Four Dogecoin benefits from culture and upcoming ETF exposure, Solana continues growing its infrastructure and developer base, and Chainlink is earning relevance via data feeds and real contracts. Yet Remittix is mixing incentives and product delivery. While DOGE, SOL, and LINK all offer reasons to hold, RTX offers entry at a much lower cost with reward-rich features that may drive it past its peers this September.

Its unique ability to dynamically adjust its processing duration is at the heart of its superior performance. Imagine an AI that can ‘deliberate’ on a complex bug for hours, meticulously analyzing code, identifying patterns, and proposing solutions, rather than rushing to a suboptimal answer. This is precisely what GPT-5-Codex offers. This dynamic allocation of computational resources means the model can dedicate the necessary time to truly understand and resolve intricate coding problems, leading to more robust and accurate outputs. OpenAI’s internal benchmarks confirm this significant leap. GPT-5-Codex demonstrably outperforms its predecessor, GPT-5, on SWE-bench Verified, a rigorous benchmark designed to measure agentic coding abilities. Furthermore, it shows superior performance on tasks involving code refactoring from large, established repositories. These results are not just statistical improvements; they translate directly into tangible benefits for developers, promising faster development cycles, fewer errors, and more optimized code. The model’s capacity to handle nuanced coding challenges with such flexibility sets a new standard for AI assistance in software engineering, pushing the boundaries of what was previously thought possible for automated coding tools. The Competitive Edge in AI Development The landscape of AI development tools has become intensely competitive over the past year, driven by an insatiable user demand for intelligent coding assistance. Companies are racing to deliver the most effective and efficient solutions, and OpenAI’s upgrade to Codex with GPT-5-Codex is a direct response to this burgeoning market. OpenAI is strategically positioning Codex to fiercely compete with established players and innovative newcomers alike. Key competitors in this space include Anthropic’s Claude Code, Anysphere’s Cursor, and Microsoft’s widely adopted GitHub Copilot. The rapid growth in this sector is underscored by impressive market indicators; for instance, Cursor reportedly surpassed an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $500 million earlier in 2025, signaling massive adoption and value creation. The market is also seeing dramatic shifts, as evidenced by the chaotic acquisition attempt involving Windsurf, another prominent code editor, which resulted in its team being split between tech giants Google and Cognition. This intense competition is a testament to the transformative power of AI in coding, and OpenAI’s move to enhance Codex with GPT-5-Codex is a clear statement of intent: to not only participate in this race but to lead it. By offering a model with unparalleled adaptability and performance, OpenAI aims to solidify Codex’s position as the go-to AI coding solution for developers worldwide, ensuring it remains at the forefront of this technological revolution. Enhancing Code Quality with the Advanced Coding Agent Beyond generating and refactoring code, the new coding agent , GPT-5-Codex, has been meticulously trained for a crucial aspect of software development: conducting code reviews. This capability addresses a significant pain point for development teams, where manual code reviews can be time-consuming and prone to human error. To validate its effectiveness, OpenAI engaged experienced software engineers to evaluate the model’s review submissions. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive and insightful. Engineers reported that GPT-5-Codex submitted significantly fewer incorrect suggestions compared to previous models, a critical improvement for maintaining code integrity and reducing developer frustration. More impressively, the model was found to add more ‘high-impact’ suggestions, identifying subtle inefficiencies, potential security vulnerabilities, or architectural improvements that might otherwise be overlooked.

The Future of AI Coding : Real-time Adaptability Alexander Embiricos, OpenAI’s Codex product lead, provided crucial insights into the architectural brilliance behind GPT-5-Codex’s increased performance, particularly its dynamic ‘thinking abilities.’ He explained that while users might be familiar with GPT-5’s router in ChatGPT, which directs queries to different models based on complexity, GPT-5-Codex operates with a more fluid, integrated approach. Crucially, Embiricos noted that GPT-5-Codex has no explicit router under the hood. Instead, it possesses an inherent capacity to adjust how long it works on a task in real-time. This is a significant advantage over a router-based system, which typically decides the computational power and time required at the very outset of a problem. Imagine a scenario where an AI begins a task, and five minutes in, realizes the complexity is far greater than initially perceived. A router-based system might be locked into its initial allocation, potentially leading to an incomplete or suboptimal solution. GPT-5-Codex, however, can dynamically reassess and decide it needs to spend another hour, or even several hours, to achieve a superior outcome. Embiricos cited instances where he observed the model taking upwards of seven hours to complete certain complex tasks, demonstrating its unparalleled persistence and adaptability. This real-time, self-adjusting computational strategy is the future of AI coding , promising an era where AI agents are not just powerful, but also incredibly intelligent in managing their own problem-solving processes, leading to more profound and reliable results across the entire spectrum of software engineering challenges. OpenAI’s latest upgrade to Codex, featuring the revolutionary GPT-5-Codex, represents a monumental leap in the realm of AI development . By integrating dynamic thinking capabilities that allow the AI to adapt its problem-solving time from seconds to hours, OpenAI has created an unparalleled coding agent . This innovation not only boosts performance on critical benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and code refactoring but also elevates the quality of code reviews, providing high-impact suggestions and reducing errors. In a fiercely competitive market for AI coding tools, GPT-5-Codex establishes a new benchmark for intelligence, adaptability, and efficiency. For developers, particularly those in the fast-paced cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors, this means faster development cycles, more robust code, and an intelligent partner capable of tackling the most complex challenges.

However, the three wealthiest people have filled the trillion-dollar gap. According to Bloomberg, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg are now rivaling Berkshire’s $1.07 billion market cap. As of Friday, Elon Musk was worth $419 billion, Larry Ellison was worth $349 billion, and Mark Zuckerberg was worth $265 billion. Together, the three billionaires are worth $1.03 trillion, which is close to Berkshire’s market cap and comfortably surpasses the $800 billion-plus market values of JPMorgan, Walmart, and Oracle. As is market knowledge, Berkshire Hathaway generates around $370 billion in annual revenue and employs nearly 400,000 workers. Ellison and Zuckerberg increase their fortune, Musk loses $14bn Musk, Ellison, and Zuckerberg are worth so much because they’re the companies’ biggest shareholders. Musk owns about 13% of Tesla and 42% of SpaceX, Ellison holds about a 41% stake in Oracle, and Zuckerberg has around a 13% stake in Meta. The trio has also hugely increased their wealth as a group. Three of them have seen their fortunes balloon in recent years due to investor optimism around AI’s potential to slash corporations’ costs and supercharge their profitability. Ellison’s net worth has nearly doubled, increasing by $157 billion as Oracle stock has soared over 75% since January 1. Also, Zuckerberg’s wealth has jumped by $58 billion, fueled by Meta stock’s 29% gain in 2025. However, Musk’s fortune has shrunk by $14 billion this year, mostly from the displeasure with his involvement with the DOGE department under Trump. Meanwhile, Oracle’s stock price climbed as much as 43% last Wednesday alone, lifting the company’s market value by nearly $300 billion at its peak. This is after it projected rapid revenue growth fueled by AI demand. Tesla unveiled a Musk pay package last week. The proposed deal would grant Musk shares worth over $1 trillion if he manages to increase his company’s market value by around eightfold and hit a slew of operational targets within the next decade or so. Also, as reported by Cryptopolitan, Musk purchased around $1 billion worth of Tesla stock on Friday. He acquired roughly 2.57 million Tesla shares at prices ranging from $371 to $396. As a result, the electric-car maker’s shares rose by almost 6% in pre-market trading. Other wealthy people have also grown substantially richer this year. The 17 members of the $100 billion club have added a net $434 billion to their joint fortunes this year, boosting their combined wealth to $3.2 trillion at Friday’s close. This figure is greater than the market values of Alphabet or Amazon. Berkshire Hathaway’s investments fuel a 126% surge Berkshire Hathaway arguably has the world’s greatest living investor at its helm. Long term, its stock is up 126% in five years. During five years of share price growth, Berkshire Hathaway achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 26% annually. This EPS growth is higher than the 18% average annual increase in the share price. According to reports, the company has invested in steelmaker Nucor, homebuilders D.R. Horton and Lennar, with the total investments amounting to $1.8 billion. In addition to the mentioned investments, Berkshire Hathaway also placed a $1.6 billion bet on UnitedHealth, purchasing over 5 million shares. As reported by Cryptopolitan, the healthcare giant’s stock has jumped nearly 30% since Warren Buffett’s firm disclosed in mid-August that it bought shares between April 1 and June 30. Meanwhile, Berkshire’s shares have slid back 1.3% in the last week.

However, as investors eagerly await its debut, a crucial detail has emerged that could reshape expectations. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart recently shed light on this product, clarifying that it isn’t a straightforward pure spot XRP ETF , introducing a unique twist to its structure. Unpacking the Unique Structure of the XRP ETF What exactly makes this XRP ETF different from what many might expect? According to Seyffart, the Rex-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR), slated for launch this Thursday, employs an innovative approach to gain exposure to XRP. Instead of solely holding spot XRP directly, its structure also incorporates holdings of other global XRP spot ETFs. This multi-layered strategy aims to provide investors with access to the digital asset in a way that navigates current regulatory landscapes. While the fund’s official documents do mention the potential use of derivatives, Seyffart emphasized that these are not its primary mechanism for achieving exposure. The core of its strategy relies on a combination of direct spot XRP holdings and investments in existing global XRP spot ETFs, offering a diversified pathway to the asset. Why This “Workaround” for the XRP ETF? The term “workaround” might sound unusual, but it points to a strategic maneuver in the complex world of cryptocurrency regulation. Seyffart previously applied this description to the Rex-Osprey DOGE ETF, also expected to launch concurrently. He characterized this innovative approach as a deliberate design choice, likely intended to secure a faster approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Regulatory Landscape: The SEC has historically been cautious with cryptocurrency products, especially those involving direct spot exposure to assets other than Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have recently seen spot ETF approvals. Strategic Design: By diversifying its exposure through other global ETFs and potentially limiting direct spot holdings in certain jurisdictions, the fund aims to mitigate some of the regulatory hurdles that have stalled other crypto ETF applications. Faster Market Entry: This structure could enable the fund to come to market more quickly, offering investors earlier access to XRP exposure than a traditional, pure spot ETF might achieve. This method stands in contrast to the structures of the recently approved Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, which primarily hold the underlying asset directly. The Rex-Osprey model suggests a nuanced understanding of current regulatory preferences and a creative solution to enter the market. What Does This Mean for Investors in the XRP ETF? For potential investors, understanding the intricacies of this XRP ETF is paramount. While it offers a pathway to gain exposure to XRP, its hybrid structure comes with specific implications: Diversified Exposure: Investing in other global XRP spot ETFs could offer a degree of diversification within the XRP ecosystem, potentially spreading risk across different market participants and regulatory environments. Potential for Complexity: The multi-layered structure might introduce additional layers of fees or tracking error compared to a pure spot ETF. Investors should carefully review the fund’s expense ratio and performance metrics. Regulatory Clarity: The approval of such a product, even with a workaround, signals a cautious but evolving stance from regulators towards broader crypto assets. It could pave the way for other innovative crypto investment products. It’s crucial for investors to conduct their due diligence, understanding how this specific fund tracks XRP’s price and what potential factors could influence its performance. This isn’t just about buying into XRP; it’s about buying into a strategically structured investment vehicle. The Future of Crypto ETFs and the XRP ETF’s Role The launch of the Rex-Osprey XRP ETF , despite its non-pure spot nature, marks a significant moment for the digital asset space. It underscores the industry’s relentless pursuit of mainstream financial products that cater to institutional and retail demand for cryptocurrency exposure. This strategic move could serve as a blueprint for future crypto ETFs seeking regulatory approval, especially for assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. While not the pure spot product many hoped for, this ETF represents a pragmatic step forward. It reflects a growing maturity in the crypto investment landscape, where innovation often means navigating regulatory complexities with clever, well-thought-out solutions. The market will be watching closely to see how this unique fund performs and what precedent it sets for future digital asset offerings.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Rex-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR)? A1: The Rex-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR) is an investment product expected to launch this Thursday, designed to give investors exposure to XRP. It uses a unique structure, gaining exposure by directly holding spot XRP and other global XRP spot ETFs, rather than being a pure spot ETF. Q2: How does this XRP ETF differ from a “pure spot” ETF? A2: A pure spot ETF would primarily hold the underlying asset directly. This Rex-Osprey XRP ETF, however, diversifies its exposure by holding both direct spot XRP and investments in other global XRP spot ETFs, making it a hybrid product. Q3: Why is this structure considered a “workaround” for the SEC? A3: Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart suggests this structure is a “workaround” designed for faster approval from the U.S. SEC. By not being a pure spot product and diversifying holdings, it may address some regulatory concerns that have delayed other direct crypto ETF applications. Q4: Are derivatives a primary component of this XRP ETF? A4: No, while the fund’s documents mention the potential use of derivatives, analyst James Seyffart noted that this is not its primary method for gaining exposure. The main strategy involves holding spot XRP and other global XRP spot ETFs. Q5: What are the potential implications for investors? A5: Investors gain diversified exposure to XRP through a regulated product. However, they should be aware of potential complexities like additional fees or tracking errors that might arise from its multi-layered structure compared to a pure spot ETF. Diligence is key. Q6: Does this XRP ETF approval signal a broader shift in SEC policy? A6: While not a pure spot approval, the launch of such a product suggests a cautious but evolving regulatory environment for crypto assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. It could indicate a willingness to approve innovative structures that meet regulatory concerns. Share Your Thoughts!

Related Reading: Dogecoin Bulls Eye $0.54 ‘Final Boss’ Breakout, Says Top Analyst After weeks of consolidation, the token closed above the $3.03–$3.08 range, a level that had capped gains for months. This decisive breakout has shifted sentiment, with traders now eyeing higher targets as momentum indicators flash green. XRP Market Performance Analysis The XRP Technical charts confirm the bullish setup. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has crossed into favorable territory, hovering around 58, a level that historically precedes strong rallies. Volume has also spiked, reflecting growing buyer confidence. Analysts say this confluence of price action and momentum signals could pave the way for XRP’s next big move. Immediate resistance sits at $3.30, with further upside targets at $3.65 and $4.20. On the downside, support is clustered between $2.72 and $3.00, levels bulls must defend to keep the trend intact. XRP's price trends to the upside, but records a decline on short timeframes. Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview ETF Speculation Adds Fuel, But Doubts Remain Adding to the buzz is renewed speculation around a potential XRP ETF. Supporters argue that Ripple’s partial legal clarity and XRP’s utility in cross-border payments make it a prime ETF candidate. An approval, they say, could unlock institutional inflows and trigger a powerful demand surge. However, skeptics caution that XRP’s regulatory status remains murky in several jurisdictions. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP’s classification is still contested, raising doubts over whether an ETF is likely in the near future. Even if approval comes, some analysts argue that XRP’s utility-focused design may limit its appeal as a traditional investment vehicle. For now, ETF chatter remains speculative, but it has injected optimism into the XRP community as the token tests key levels. Whale Selling and Short-Term Pullbacks Despite the bullish setup, on-chain data shows that whales have offloaded over 160 million XRP in recent weeks. Historically, such large-scale selling reflects profit-taking and risk management by institutional players. Yet, XRP’s ability to stabilize around $3 despite this pressure signals strong retail demand. Short-term pullbacks have also been noted, with traders highlighting key support between $2.87 and $2.95. Analysts suggest these dips could provide entry points for bulls aiming for the next breakout above $3.30.

This comes amid a broader crypto market rally, which has sparked hopes of a continuation of the bull run . XRP’s Market Cap Surpasses Major Companies Companies Market Cap data shows that XRP’s market cap is larger than that of the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock , and also Sony. The altcoin’s market cap is currently at around $182 billion, while BlackRock and Sony boast a market cap of $173 and $174 billion, respectively. Meanwhile, based on its market cap, XRP currently sits as the 88th largest asset, just behind Xiaomi. It is worth noting that the altcoin has briefly surpassed banking giant Citigroup, Verizon, and Shopify following a rally of over 3% over the weekend. However, XRP has pared some of these gains and now looks to be consolidating in preparation for the next leg to the upside. XRP’s rally comes amid a broad crypto market rally, with other major altcoins like Ethereum, Dogecoin, BNB, and Solana recording significant gains. Some fundamentals could serve as a catalyst for higher XRP prices , as its market cap looks to surpass more companies on the global assets ranking. This includes the launch of the REX-Osprey XRP ETF that is set to take place this week. This will be the first U.S. XRP fund to provide institutional investors with spot exposure to the altcoin. This is expected to inject new liquidity into the XRP ecosystem. Meanwhile, the Fed is expected to make a rate cut at this week’s FOMC meeting. This is typically bullish for altcoins for XRP, although there is also the possibility that it may be a ‘sell the news’ event. XRP Eyes Rally To $3.6 Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has predicted that the XRP price could rally to $3.6 following its breakout above $3.05. He had earlier stated that there were two possible scenarios. One possibility is that it could break above $3.05 and then rally to $3.60, or it could dip to $2.80, break above $2.90, and then rally to $3.60. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Dark Defender highlighted $3.01 and $2.85 as the major support levels to watch out for as the XRP price prepares for another leg to the upside. The analyst stated that the targets are the $4.39 and the $5.85 Fibonacci levels. A rally to these price levels would mark a new all-time high (ATH) for the altcoin.

The DeFi team sent an onchain message to the attackers on Monday, requesting the return of stolen digital assets. The bounty offer includes a 30-day deadline with decreasing rewards after seven days. K9 Finance stated that the settlement becomes final when the recovery function is called. The protocol emphasized that code governs the agreement once the attacker accepts the terms. Shiba Inu developer Kaal Dhairya confirmed that authorities have been contacted regarding the incident. The development team remains open to negotiations with the perpetrators while investigating the security breach. Bridge Exploit Drains Millions in Assets Saturday's attack targeted the Shibarium bridge through compromised validator signing keys. Malicious actors executed a flash loan to purchase 4.6 million Bone ShibaSwap tokens. This purchase granted them majority validator control over the network. The attackers then signed fraudulent transactions to transfer funds from the bridge. The exploit drained approximately $2.4 million in various digital currencies from the protocol's reserves. Security teams, including Hexens, Seal 911, and PeckShield, are assisting with the ongoing investigation. The collaborative effort aims to identify vulnerabilities and prevent future attacks on the network infrastructure. Shibarium developers responded immediately by pausing stake and unstake functions across the platform. The team transferred stake manager funds to a hardware wallet secured by multisignature controls. These emergency measures protect remaining user assets from additional exploitation attempts. Dhairya emphasized that network security restoration represents the team's primary objective. User asset protection remains the top priority throughout the recovery process. The development team continues monitoring the situation closely. Token Prices Drop Following Attack The exploit triggered significant price declines across the Shiba Inu ecosystem tokens. SHIB dropped from $0.0000145 to $0.0000131, representing a 7% decrease. The decline reflects investor concerns about network security vulnerabilities. K9 Finance's KNINE token experienced a 10% drop, falling from $0.00000287 to $0.00000257. ShibaSwap's BONE token suffered the largest impact with a 38% decline. BONE prices fell from $0.31 on Sunday to $0.19 at current trading levels. The Shibarium attack follows another recent security incident involving THORChain co-founder John-Paul Thorbjornsen. Onchain investigator ZachXBT reported that Thorbjornsen lost $1.35 million through a Telegram meeting call scam on Friday. These incidents highlight ongoing security challenges facing decentralized finance protocols and individual crypto users.

Weekly chart breakout offers 1:29 risk-reward setup with a projected target near $1.70. Open Interest climbs as shorts pile in, setting up conditions for a possible short squeeze. Short-Term Signal Appears After Pullback Dogecoin (DOGE) was trading at $0.26 at press time, with a 24-hour trading volume of $6.15 billion. The asset has dropped 10% in the past day but remains up 13% over the past week. The recent drop comes after a multi-day rally, and one technical tool now points to a possible pause in the downtrend. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared that the TD Sequential indicator has printed a buy signal on the 4-hour chart. The setup appeared near the $0.263 mark. This tool is often used by traders to spot potential reversals after extended moves in either direction. According to Martinez, Buy the Dogecoin $DOGE dip, says the TD Sequential indicator! pic.twitter.com/N6RmDaDYD4 — Ali (@ali_charts) September 15, 2025 While the signal may suggest that sellers are losing strength, traders will likely wait for further signs, such as a shift in volume or price confirmation, before reacting. Breakout Confirmed on Weekly Chart A broader pattern has formed on the weekly timeframe. According to Trader Tardigrade, DOGE has broken out of a long-term symmetrical triangle, which formed over several months and is marked by converging highs and lows. Interestingly, the breakout came with a candle close above the upper trendline, pointing to a possible move higher. The setup carries a projected 1:29 risk-to-reward ratio, with a target near $1.70. The suggested entry zone is around $0.27, while downside risk is placed below $0.20. These types of structures are commonly used to frame trades around breakout zones after long periods of price compression. In addition, DOGE may also be forming a Power of Three (PO3) setup on the 1-hour chart. This model divides the price action into three stages: accumulation, manipulation, and distribution. The chart shared by Trader Tardigrade shows DOGE moving from a sideways range into a short decline, often viewed as the manipulation phase. $Doge /hourly #Dogecoin might be forming a Power of Three (PO3) trading setup pic.twitter.com/AZPMuI69gy — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) September 15, 2025 If the setup plays out as expected, the price could shift into the distribution phase, which typically involves a move higher. In this case, the next resistance area is seen around $0.33, based on past structure. Short Pressure Builds at Local Lows On lower timeframes, DOGE is seeing increased short interest. Analyst Cryptoinsightuk noted that Open Interest rose to 9.02 billion, while the funding premium turned negative at -0.0078. Spot volume also increased, showing higher market activity. The analyst stated, “Likely to see a strong reversal bounce at some point soon as these late shorts get squeezed.” In a downtrend, where a negative premium may also exist, and during which open interest increases, it is hazardous to think of the selling parties taking a position late in the move. If buyers do come through, short positions may be unwound with haste. A price drop shall manifest itself, assisting one in deciding whether this is a favorable bounce or the onset of an extensive reversal. The post Buy the Dip?

This opens the door to launching the ENA fee switch, eventually sharing some of the protocol’s revenues with token holders. The Ethena Foundation announced that the protocol reached the fee switch parameters as set by the Risk Committee. The ENA fee switch is the technology that deemed the protocol stable enough to share some of the revenues with ENA holders. The Ethena Risk Committee will have to sign off on the implementation of the fee switch, then put up a proposal for a community vote. Source: Ethena Foundation via X The fee switch was expected in the past week. The holders of staked ENA (sENA) may receive 4.5% to 15% annualized yield. Based on the current Ethena fees of $50 to $60M monthly, the revenues will be distributed over $750M in staked ENA. Fee switch will bring additional utility to ENA The fee switch milestone means ENA staking is no longer used for airdrops only. Additionally, the protocol will unlock $500M for buybacks, further rewarding the holders with potential market price growth. The fee switch was reached as Ethena carried a record value locked of over $13.2B . The other conditions to be fulfilled included a supply of USDe over $6B. The USDe market cap is now more than double the target at $13.7B. The second condition was for the protocol to reach cumulative revenue of $250M. The other milestone was for USDe to be added to four of the top five centralized exchanges with the highest derivative volumes. The condition was fulfilled after the token’s recent addition to Binance. The only element remaining is the technical governance process. The fee switch may mean Ethena may create up to $100M buying pressure based on current activity and fees. ENA price drops despite positive news The news of eventual buybacks and fee sharing did not turn immediately bullish for ENA. The token slid soon after the news, losing around 6.5% to $0.70. ENA price chart | Source: Coingecko ENA open interest is still around $1.10B, with over 77% long positions. However, a handful of short positions paid significant fees to hold, in expectation of a deeper crash. For now, the ENA price is still close to its usual range. Long positions were attacked first, with $6.15M liquidated in the past few hours. On Hyperliquid, ENA is extremely bullish, with over 81% of traders keeping long positions. The attempt to liquidate longs may be the reason for the price drop, while there is also pressure for ENA to expand following the fee switch news. Some of the short positions have significant unrealized gains, and traders may still try to cause an ENA correction to gain from liquidating more of the long positions.

Strong Momentum and Market Context Current market data shows XRP is trading at $3.02, with healthy on-chain activity and exchange volumes supporting the bullish case. This technical strength follows a long period of consolidation and a breakout to new cycle highs—an ideal sequence for trend continuation. The $2.70–$2.80 level now serves as a key invalidation zone for traders watching this move. #XRP looks incredibly strong on the daily. It doesn't get more bullish than this! pic.twitter.com/5R6QlJaGsC — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) September 15, 2025 Legal Clarity Fuels Confidence The recent resolution of Ripple’s lengthy court battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission removes a major overhang. Both parties have withdrawn their appeals, and the appellate court approved the withdrawals, effectively closing the case. This legal clarity has reduced regulatory uncertainty, making XRP more attractive to institutional investors and regulated trading platforms. Upside Targets and Technical Signals Market analysts observe that XRP is developing multi-week continuation patterns, indicating potential for additional price gains if the current momentum is sustained, pointing to possible further upside in its price trajectory. Conservative resistance lies in the $3.30–$3.50 range , while stronger bullish extensions could carry prices even higher. Sustained daily closes above those levels, supported by rising volume, would confirm the next stage of the rally. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Key Risks to Monitor Despite the bullish setup, risks remain. A decisive daily close below $2.70 would invalidate the breakout retest and potentially drag XRP back into its prior consolidation range. Broader macroeconomic shifts—such as changes in central bank policy or sudden large-scale token sales—could also disrupt momentum. Traders and investors should watch for daily candle confirmations, volume surges, and any new regulatory developments that could sway sentiment. The Bottom Line The chart shared by STEPH IS CRYPTO captures an ideal bullish structure: a breakout, a measured pullback, and a firm support flip. As long as XRP continues to hold the critical green zone and market volume supports the move, the phrase “it doesn’t get more bullish than this” rings true. Still, sustained strength and macro stability will be the ultimate proof that this technical pattern can deliver the next major rally.

A groundbreaking development has just been announced: the new Base Solana bridge . This innovative connection is set to revolutionize how users interact with two of the most dynamic blockchain ecosystems today. Imagine seamlessly moving your digital assets between Base and Solana – that’s now becoming a reality, opening up a universe of possibilities for decentralized finance (DeFi) enthusiasts and developers alike. What Exactly is the Base Solana Bridge and Why Does it Matter? Simply put, the Base Solana bridge is a technological pathway. It allows cryptocurrencies and other digital assets to travel effortlessly between the Base network and the Solana blockchain. Traditionally, these two networks operated in silos, making it challenging to transfer value directly. This bridge changes everything by creating a crucial link, fostering greater interoperability. Enhanced Interoperability: It breaks down barriers between distinct blockchain environments. Asset Mobility: Users can now transfer tokens, expanding their options for trading and investing. New Opportunities: This connection creates fresh avenues for decentralized applications (dApps) and services. The goal is to provide users with more flexibility and choice, ultimately enriching both ecosystems. How Does This Cross-Chain Connectivity Work? At its core, a cross-chain bridge like the Base Solana bridge operates by facilitating the secure transfer of assets. While the exact technical implementation can vary, the general principle involves locking assets on one chain and then minting an equivalent representation on the other. Alternatively, it might use a system of validators to confirm transactions across networks. This process ensures that your assets remain secure throughout the transfer. The bridge acts as a trusted intermediary, verifying the movement of funds. Users initiate a transfer, the bridge processes it, and then the assets become available on the destination chain. It’s designed for a smooth and efficient experience, minimizing complexity for the end-user. Unlocking Tremendous Benefits with the Base Solana Bridge The introduction of this bridge brings a host of advantages for everyone involved. It’s not just about moving tokens; it’s about fostering a more connected and efficient blockchain landscape. Here are some key benefits: Increased Liquidity: By connecting two major ecosystems, the bridge allows liquidity to flow freely. This can lead to better trading prices and more robust markets on both Base and Solana. Expanded DeFi Opportunities: Users on Base can now access Solana’s vibrant DeFi ecosystem, and vice-versa. This means more lending, borrowing, and yield farming options. Improved User Experience: Instead of relying on centralized exchanges for cross-chain transfers, users can now enjoy a decentralized, direct method, which is often faster and more transparent. Broader Developer Reach: Developers can build dApps that leverage the strengths of both Base and Solana, creating more innovative and versatile applications for a wider audience. Consider a scenario where you want to utilize a specific DeFi protocol on Solana but your assets are on Base. The Base Solana bridge makes this process straightforward. What Challenges Might Users Face with the Base Solana Bridge? While the benefits are clear, it’s also important to acknowledge potential challenges. Every new technology comes with considerations, and cross-chain bridges are no exception. Security Concerns: Historically, some bridges have been targets for exploits. However, developers are continuously enhancing security measures, and the Base Solana bridge is built with robust protocols. Always ensure you are using the official bridge interface. Transaction Fees: While often lower than centralized exchanges, cross-chain transfers will incur some transaction fees on both networks. Users should be aware of these costs. Learning Curve: For newcomers, understanding how a bridge works might require a small learning curve. However, user interfaces are designed to be as intuitive as possible. It is always advisable to start with small amounts when using any new bridge for the first time. Conduct your own research and understand the process before committing significant funds. The launch of the Base Solana bridge marks a significant milestone in the journey towards a truly interconnected blockchain world. This development is not just a technical achievement; it’s a testament to the ongoing innovation within the crypto space. It promises to unlock unprecedented levels of liquidity, foster new DeFi opportunities, and ultimately provide a more seamless and powerful experience for users and developers alike. As these two prominent networks converge, we anticipate a future where blockchain boundaries blur, paving the way for a more integrated and efficient digital economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some common questions about the new bridge: Q1: What is the primary purpose of the Base Solana bridge? A1: The primary purpose is to enable seamless and secure transfers of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets between the Base network and the Solana blockchain, enhancing interoperability between these two ecosystems. Q2: Is it safe to use the Base Solana bridge for asset transfers? A2: Developers design bridges like the Base Solana bridge with robust security protocols. However, it’s always recommended to use official interfaces and exercise caution, starting with smaller amounts for initial transfers. Q3: What types of assets can I transfer using this bridge? A3: Generally, users can transfer various cryptocurrencies and tokens that are supported by both Base and Solana. The specific list of supported assets will be available on the official bridge interface. Q4: Will using the Base Solana bridge incur fees? A4: Yes, cross-chain transfers typically involve transaction fees on both the originating and destination networks. These fees contribute to network security and processing. Always check the current fee structure before initiating a transfer. Q5: How does this bridge benefit the DeFi ecosystem? A5: The bridge significantly benefits DeFi by increasing liquidity, expanding access to various protocols on both chains, and fostering innovation by allowing developers to build applications that leverage the unique strengths of Base and Solana.

Large volumes of trading and stock market movements have caught investors' attention. A newly created wallet withdrew 21,925 ETH from the Kraken exchange, completing a transaction worth approximately $102.24 million. There was also intense activity on the PUMP side. A whale spent 3.22 million USDC to purchase 426.43 million PUMP in the last 36 hours. This transaction occurred at a price of $0.00755 per token, while the same whale had deposited 1.23 billion PUMP ($7.27 million) into Binance just two days prior. Meanwhile, another whale opened highly leveraged positions by depositing 5 million USDC on the Hyperliquid platform. His positions included 40x leverage on Bitcoin, 20x leverage on Solana, 10x leverage on FARTCOIN, 5x leverage on PUMP, and 3x leverage on LAUNCHCOIN. According to analysis firm Lookonchain, there has been strong whale interest in the MERL token in recent days. Two whales with short addresses 0x7Dac and 0xB5eE have withdrawn a total of 98.24 million MERL tokens (approximately $14.9 million) from exchanges in the last six days. Meanwhile, it was learned that the hacker who stole over $300 million from Coinbase users recently engaged in panic selling. He sold off 3,976 ETH ($17.98 million) at $4,522, a loss of $932,000 in just two days. On the institutional side, a major Solana purchase stood out. In a transaction brokered by Galaxy Digital, Forward Industries purchased 6,822,000 SOL ($1.58 billion) over the past five days. Following this massive purchase, which averaged $232, an additional $67 million in SOL purchases are still expected. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Shares New Altcoin It Will List Soloxbt.sol, one of the market's legendary on-chain investors, has recently made headlines with its gains. The investor achieved a 101x return on the KIND token and a 174x return on the Bagwork token, totaling $4.6 million in profit. Soloxbt.sol spent 34.3 SOL ($6,942) on the KIND trades and acquired 25.08 million tokens, earning $702,000. On the Bagwork side, the investor invested 19.6 SOL ($4,377) and amassed 23.87 million tokens, earning a notable $762,000 profit.

While large caps have held steady, smaller and mid-sized tokens are showing sharper reactions to news. That rotation has lifted Avantis, Pump.fun, and Mantle, each responding to different catalysts. The pattern reinforces how altcoin season often builds through concentrated liquidity rather than broad rallies. Avantis has surged on simultaneous listings across major exchanges. Pump.fun has extended its steady multi-week climb from its role as a Solana launchpad. Mantle is gaining traction from ongoing exchange support and strong derivatives turnover. Together, these three illustrate how altseason plays out when specific events bring in volume and fresh participation. Avantis (AVNT): Rapid Listings Create Immediate Demand Avantis is trading near $1.20 , up about 47% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Market capitalization sits around $290 million with trading volume above $1 billion. That turnover has placed Avantis among the most-traded tokens on Coinbase, while Binance, Upbit, and Bithumb also opened markets for the coin within the same hour of the launch. The rollout has given Avantis instant liquidity across both Western and Asian exchanges. That combination is rare, and it has clearly drawn traders seeking early exposure. Retail activity appears heavy, with order books showing active spot buying after the listings. The sudden access to multiple venues explains why price and volume expanded so quickly, and why Avantis has emerged as one of the sharpest movers in this stage of altcoin season. Pump.fun (PUMP): Continuous Platform Usage Sustains Growth Pump.fun is trading near $0.0082, up about 6.5% daily, with a market capitalization of around $2.9 billion. Circulating supply is 354 billion tokens against a maximum of 1 trillion, and daily volume is above $1.3 billion. The token has risen steadily over the past month, adding more than 40% in the last seven days. PUMP Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) The growth remains tied to its role as a Solana-based platform for rapid meme token creation. Constant issuance of new projects keeps transaction counts and trading fees high, which loops activity back into PUMP demand. Exchanges continue to show deep order books, confirming that traders are still engaging with the platform’s outputs. The persistence of activity over several weeks is what sets this move apart, turning Pump.fun into one of the more consistent performers during altseason rotations. Mantle (MNT): Derivatives and Exchange Incentives Keep Activity High Mantle is currently trading near $1.70 , up about 6% over the past day. Its market capitalization is roughly $5.6 billion, with a circulating supply of 3.25 billion tokens and a daily volume of $520 million. The price has steadily increased since early August, breaking above $1.40 and holding gains since. Momentum comes from sustained exchange support. Bybit has continued to feature Mantle pairs with liquidity incentives, and perpetual futures listings have expanded participation on other venues. This has encouraged both speculative and hedging flows, keeping MNT volume consistent. Traders watching technical levels note that Mantle has built support above prior ranges, suggesting continued participation while altseason remains active. Altcoin Season Outlook Avantis, Pump.fun, and Mantle show how altcoin season rewards different types of catalysts. Avantis demonstrates the power of simultaneous listings to drive immediate liquidity. Pump.fun shows how constant platform activity can sustain multi-week growth. Mantle illustrates how exchange partnerships and derivatives access support a steady climb. Altcoin season does not move every token in lockstep. Instead, it rewards those linked to real trading opportunities and user engagement. These three names capture the current shape of altseason: fast listings, persistent usage, and exchange-driven liquidity.

A meme coin uprising, a revolution powered not by banks or brokers but by communities who roar louder than Wall Street whales. In 2025, as global markets wobble between chaos and opportunity, a question electrifies degen circles everywhere: which are the best new cryptos to buy now before the next parabolic run makes millionaires overnight? Look closer, and the answer feels less like a choice and more like destiny. Rising from the ashes of forgotten coins, BullZilla ($BZIL) has emerged as the mythic challenger. Armed with a progressive price engine, an evolving presale mutation mechanism, and a community that grows hungrier by the hour, Bull Zilla isn’t just a coin, it’s a saga. Unlike meme tokens that rely on recycled hype, $BZIL introduces a staking furnace, roar burns, and a vault roadmap that blends storytelling with complex economics. Alongside Ripple (XRP) and Binance Coin (BNB), BullZilla claims its spot in the trinity of best new cryptos to buy now as presales heat up and whales sharpen their focus. Today, the BullZilla Presale is live. The ticker $BZIL has already charged through early milestones, crossing $420k+ raised with over 1,500 holders. Every 48 hours, or the instant $100k floods in, the price ticks higher, and with 24 stages mapped out, early believers are already securing allocations at fractions of a penny. For those seeking the best crypto presales to join early, there may never be a better window. In this arena, BullZilla, Ripple, and Binance Coin are rewriting the 2025 playbook. 1. BullZilla ($BZIL) — The Next 1000x Meme Coin Stage 3A. Price locked at $0.00005908. Over $420,000 tallied from a swelling community of 1,500+ holders. That’s where BullZilla stands today, a living, breathing experiment in how meme coins evolve when fueled by fire and precision. Market insiders already whisper the phrase: Next 1000x Meme Coin. Bull Zilla Presale isn’t just about early entry; it’s about riding a mutation mechanism that constantly adapts. Price increases every 48 hours, or sooner when a $100k wave rushes in. This creates scarcity that echoes legendary runs like Shiba Inu’s surge or Pepe’s viral blaze. But here’s the twist: Bull Zilla’s economics aren’t static. With Roar Burn mechanics destroying supply, a HODL Furnace rewarding believers, and a Roarblood Vault promising future utility, the project screams innovation. This is why $BZIL is among the best new cryptos to buy now. The Launch Sequence – Best New Cryptos to Buy Now BullZilla’s roadmap feels like a cinematic trailer: Phase I (Q2 2025): Team formation, site rollout, and third-party smart contract audit. Phase II (Q3 2025): Presale, token burns, referral ignition. Phase III (Q4 2025) : Staking Furnace lights up, early holders reap staking rewards. Phase IV (Q1 2026) : Final presale, token launch, exchange listings, Vault roadmap unleashed. This staggered progression creates a rhythm, allowing investors to track milestones with tangible results. How to Buy BullZilla Coins – Best New Cryptos to Buy Now To secure allocation before the next surge: Set Up a Wallet : Download MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Buy Ethereum (ETH) : Acquire ETH on Binance or Coinbase, then transfer to your wallet. Visit the Presale Site : Connect wallet to BullZilla’s official presale portal. Swap ETH for $BZIL : Confirm your swap. Allocations lock in instantly, claimable after presale ends. With a system designed for degen speed and institutional security, BullZilla lowers barriers while amplifying energy. Among the trending meme coins 2025, this is the Pepe Alternative and Shiba Inu Successor that most aligns with the next digital uprising. 2. Ripple (XRP) — The Institutional Bridge Ripple (XRP) isn’t a new face in crypto, but in 2025 it has re-entered conversations about the best new cryptos to buy now for one reason: clarity. After years of legal shadows, Ripple has begun navigating with precision, building partnerships with banks and central banks. Its XRP Ledger has positioned itself as the plumbing for cross-border payments, boasting near-instant settlement and microscopic fees compared to SWIFT-era dinosaurs. Financial institutions across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East now test XRP in real-world corridors. As countries explore CBDCs, Ripple’s partnerships offer the rails for adoption. This isn’t just about speculation; it’s about being the silent engine of institutional finance. For retail investors, XRP provides exposure to an infrastructure project that could become standard. 3. Binance Coin (BNB) — The Exchange Titan In every gold rush, there’s the company selling shovels. In crypto, Binance Coin (BNB) plays that role, powering the largest exchange ecosystem in the world. BNB is no longer just a discount token for trading fees, it’s a gateway to Binance Smart Chain, staking pools, DeFi projects, and utility far beyond the Binance exchange. The BNB burn mechanism consistently reduces circulating supply, creating token scarcity similar to Ethereum’s EIP-1559 effect. With quarterly burns continuing, investors see a shrinking supply matched against growing demand. This steady model of supply scarcity makes BNB one of the best new cryptos to buy now as 2025 progresses. Conclusion: Best New Cryptos to Buy Now Based on the latest research, the BullZilla , Ripple, and Binance Coin trio stand as clear leaders in the best new cryptos to buy now. BullZilla Presale surges forward with a roaring narrative and mechanics designed for exponential growth. Ripple leverages institutional corridors, while Binance Coin anchors itself in exchange dominance and ecosystem utility. As meme culture, regulation, and utility converge in 2025, one truth remains: early presale crypto positions often generate the most spectacular returns. Bull Zilla has already begun that mutation, cementing itself as the next 1000x meme coin. Joining early means catching the roar before the crowd. The market just got louder.

According to DeFiLlama , total value locked (TVL) on Solana has reached an all-time high of $13.25 billion , fueled by an 18% surge in the past week alone. This breakout is boosting market optimism that SOL could rally toward the $500 mark within the next four weeks. Over the past five months, Solana’s TVL ranged between $6.5 billion and $10 billion, but September marks the first time it has climbed past $12 billion – signaling accelerating network growth. Solana DEX Volume Surges 84% as 2.2M Daily Users Signal Bullish Breakout The last time this happened was during President Trump’s inauguration in January, when SOL rocketed from $168.88 to $295.83 within a week. Source: DefilLama Solana DEX volume has also returned above $5 billion , up 84% in the last 30 days for the first time since January. Data from Glassnode shows that Solana reserves on exchanges continue to decline rapidly. #Solana reserves on exchanges continues to decline quickly…traders shifting from $ETH to $SOL ? pic.twitter.com/LNADSRgJpU — Rand (@crypto_rand) September 15, 2025 A similar pattern occurred during Ethereum’s rally when traders rotated from BTC to ETH , and now it appears the same capital rotation is approaching SOL. Solana treasury companies continue to accumulate SOL tokens. In the past 24 hours, Galaxy Digital bought another 1.2M $SOL, and since Forward Industries announced its $1.65B raise, Galaxy’s total purchases have reached approximately 6.5M $SOL ($1.55B). Crypto trader Bluntz Capital believes all the bullish indicators have appeared on the Solana chart, with a 5-wave pattern pointing to a $500 SOL target by Q1 2026. this is how im counting $SOL now and i think >$500 into Q1 next year is not that unreasonable. pic.twitter.com/ZRfuPoLGjK — Bluntz (@Bluntz_Capital) August 29, 2025 Solana Price Prediction: Critical $229 Support Stand In the Way of a Bullish Rally On the technical side, Solana’s 4-hour chart shows the price currently trading around $236 after failing to sustain momentum above the $250 resistance level. The key short-term battle lies at the 20-day EMA near $238 and the 50-day EMA at $229. Source: TradingView A reclaim of the 20-day EMA would open the door for a retest of $250 and potentially extend toward $270 , representing a 14% upside move . If bulls can overcome this key level and sustain momentum, the next major target would be $500 in the coming weeks . However, if the price slips below the 50-day EMA , bearish momentum could build, targeting the 100-day EMA at $219 , and possibly falling further toward the 200-day EMA around $207 . The RSI has dropped sharply from near-overbought territory to around 49 , signaling weakening bullish strength and suggesting a period of consolidation or a potential retracement before the next breakout. $SNORT Gains Momentum as Degens Hunt for the Next 1000x Opportunity With Solana targeting new highs, many believe Snorter Bot ($SNORT) is the next project to take off. So far, the $SNORT presale has raised $3.94 million , showing serious demand before launch. Snorter Bot runs directly inside Telegram , giving users a way to buy new meme coins early , often before they hit major exchanges. With the right timing, that edge could mean the difference between a small gain and a life-changing one. How to trade like a pro with Snorter: Step 1: Paste a token address. Step 2: Sit back.

Prominent names in the ETF industry, as well as a known journalist, outlined some of the latest details. The REX-Osprey XRP ETF, $XRPR , is coming this week! $XRPR will be the first U.S. ETF to deliver investors spot exposure to the third largest cryptocurrency by market cap, $XRP . From REX-Osprey , the team behind $SSK . @OspreyFunds View Fund Prospectus:… pic.twitter.com/qMdKhfBZ0e — REX Shares (@REXShares) September 15, 2025 Although the ETF issuer, REX-Osprey, called the product a spot XRP ETF, details from Fox Business’ Eleanor Terrett shed a bit of a different light. She reposted the initial tweet, but indicated that the financial vehicle will operate as a “spot ETF with extras.” “To my understanding, it’s a spot product in a ’40 Act wrapper that holds real XRP plus cash, Treasuries, and some derivatives,” she said before adding that it “is more regulated than traditional spot products.” James Seyffart, Bloomberg’s ETF expert, also weighed in on the matter, confirming that the ETF should be going live for trading this week. Recall that the XRP ETF, alongside REX-Osprey’s DOGE ETF, were supposed to hit the markets last week but faced some last-minute delays. In this article , we explore the difference between REX-Osprey’s ETFs and regular spot exchange-traded funds. The SEC continues to delay making a decision on all other over a dozen XRP ETF applications, with the latest issuer to face this setback being Franklin Templeton. In terms of price actions, REX-Osprey’s announcement has failed to impact the underlying asset in any meaningful way. The asset is down by over 6% since the Saturday peak of $3.19 and slipped below $3 earlier today. As of press time, it fights to remain above that key support line.

In fact, the crypto asset continues to see notable whale accumulation, as fresh wallets actively withdraw large sums from centralized exchanges. Whales Bet Big on a Breakout According to the latest data shared by Lookchain, a newly created wallet recently pulled 5,297 ETH from Binance and Bitget. This stash is worth around $24.7 million. This follows a similar action by a different whale wallet, which secured an additional 13,322 ETH, equivalent to $61.65 million, from FalconX on September 15th. Just hours earlier, another newly created address withdrew 4,208 ETH, worth nearly $19.5 million, from Binance. These back-to-back transactions highlight a trend of continued whale demand for the altcoin, which currently appears to be in a strong accumulation phase. As whales continue to load up on ETH, sentiment is shifting bullish, with market commentators pointing to key levels that could determine its next trajectory. The crypto asset now faces mounting pressure around the $4,800-$4,880 zone, which is deemed a critical resistance that has repeatedly capped price action. A daily close above $4,880 is expected to trigger a strong breakout, powered by renewed momentum and the potential for a short squeeze. On the downside, the $4,200-$4,400 support continues to provide a solid foundation. This range has absorbed selling pressure, keeping the bullish structure intact. Beyond price levels, volume and institutional participation remain crucial. Substantial Upside Ahead Echoing a similar stance, Sean Dawson, head of research at on-chain options platform Derive.xyz, said that the crypto asset is primed for more gains even as ETH suffered a mild setback on Monday. “While some are worried that ‘the music is about to stop,’ the reality is more nuanced. We may see volatility and consolidation in September, driven by fiscal year-end flows and some profit-taking among ETH DATs. But the structural backdrop – falling rates, institutional positioning, and bullish derivatives markets – suggests there’s still substantial upside ahead. This is likely not the cycle top.” In an even bolder prediction, a market commentator observed that while ETH may face short-term downside pressure, the broader outlook over the next three to four months remains highly bullish and will ultimately hit $10,000 this cycle.

Amid broader market shifts and increasing interest in DeFi project tokens, Bonk’s rally has caught the attention of both retail and institutional players. Meanwhile, one innovative project with real utility (not just hype) is drawing fresh interest. For those that want exposure to crypto solving real world problems, there’s likely more to gain than chasing memecoin volatility. Pepe Coin Price: Surge, Technicals, and What’s Next Pepe is forming a symmetrical triangle on the chart. If it breaks out of this pattern, the next resistance target could reach around $0.000026. The meme coin recently crossed its 50- and 200-day EMAs, which is seen as bullish by technical analysts. Volume has spiked by about 137%, which confirms interest. Support zones are around $0.0000105-$0.0000106. If the price falls below that, the risk of pullback increases. Short-term predictions suggest Pepe may reach $0.0000120–$0.0000138 if demand, volume, and community momentum hold up. Some analysts even say that Pepe coin price could reach $0.0001 based on the weekly chart outlook. BONK: Reversal, Community, and What’s Driving the Move BONK is rallying: it has gone up 8.1% in the last 24 hours, and 28.5% over the past week. That outperformance puts BONK ahead of Bitcoin, XRP, and others on short-term charts. Despite recent gains, BONK is down slightly over the last month. Bonk’s community remains active, and its tokenomics (large supply, significant circulating share) mean that moves by whales or shifts in liquidity matter a lot. Analysts believe that BONK is on the verge of a breakout . Recent news and analyst commentary show BONK could benefit if meme-coins gain favor again, or if narrative around utility in community games and Solana DeFi keeps getting traction. Remittix: Real Utility in a Sea of Meme Coins Remittix (RTX) is drawing attention as something more than a meme coin. It offers features that set it apart in the crowded altcoin space. It is built for global payments and remittances. Its wallet will go live September 15, allowing users to send crypto payments and cross-border transfers in multiple countries. There is a referral reward system: when someone refers a user to Remittix, the referrer gets a 15% bonus paid in USDT directly to their wallet. Strong auditing (by firms like CertiK) and transparent tokenomics give more confidence to users who are tired of just speculative tokens. Key Features & Perks of Remittix Utility-first token powering real transaction volume. Solving a real-world $19 trillion payments problem. Momentum is building ahead of wallet launch. Real-World Utility: Built for actual use — not just speculation. The Remittix wallet reveal is live soon, a timely entry point. Access to function rather than promises gives it an edge. A $250,000 giveaway is active now, enhancing value for early adopters. It has also announced Centralized Exchange (CEX) listings on BitMart and LBank, with more on the way. Once listed, the token will gain more liquidity and visibility. A Smart Move Over Hype Investors chasing PEPE or BONK might get quick gains. But those gains come with risk. Remittix offers more solid ground: payments utility, lower fees, community rewards, and key launches ahead. If you want crypto with real utility, not just meme energy, it deserves your attention. Buying Remittix now gives you more than hype: you get early access, rewards, and plans for bigger exposure.

Davide Crapis, a research scientist, will lead the team working closely with the Foundation’s Protocol and Ecosystem arms. The Foundation revealed that the dAI Team will focus on two primary goals. The first is to give AI agents and robots mechanisms to pay, coordinate, and follow rules without intermediaries, which it described as the AI Economy on Ethereum. The second is to ensure AI development does not become dependent on a few centralized platforms by promoting open, verifiable, and censorship-resistant alternatives, which it described as the Decentralized AI Stack. Ethereum aims to build an AI economy with the dAI Team Davide Crapis, the team’s lead research scientist, revealed in a post that the group aims to bridge the gap between blockchain and AI agents. He noted that AI will be a big part of all humanity and the future of Ethereum usage. He described AI as a new frontier for Ethereum compared to earlier waves of DeFi. He also pledged that the team will build technology and support the interoperability of AI agents on-chain. We’re starting a new AI Team at the Ethereum Foundation (the dAI Team).

The standard is expected to be completed by November, and the final form will be presented at Devconnect in Buenos Aires. The Foundation also confirmed that the dAI Team will work on related standards and updates alongside channelling funds towards open-source projects supporting agent identity, reputation, and coordination. According to the Ethereum Foundation, the launch aligns with the firm’s core values and decentralized acceleration philosophy. The firm highlighted its neutrality, verifiability, and censorship resistance values, making it suitable for AI agent transactions. The company noted that Ethereum makes AI more trustworthy and AI makes Ethereum more useful, adding that neutral settlements could help AI transition from centralized architectures. The Foundation is expected to release job listings and resources to ramp up the project and form research collaborations with Silicon Valley companies. The team will link research, protocol work, and ecosystem funding to push forward the innovation of AI and blockchain interconnection. The Foundation noted that by providing standards, a settlement layer, and financing for decentralized agent infrastructure, Ethereum will be positioned as a foundational layer for future machine-to-machine and agentic economy. ETH price dips by over 2 % to $4,508 Ethereum token price is down 2.2% today, trading at $4,508.95 at the time of writing. The token has also recorded a 0.9% downside over the past 30 days and has a positive YTD of 36.14%. Cryptopolitan wrote last week that some analysts forecast the price of ETH could average $4,551 by the end of 2025 and potentially hit a high of $4,800. Longer-term projections showed that the token may range between $38,150 and $49,492 by 2031. A Cryptopolitan report estimated that the price would consolidate at $4,682 soon and stabilize at $4,420 or $4,505 support levels as bearish momentum builds up. It is also estimated that the token may trade around $7,492 by 2026, rising to over $10,200 by 2027 and above $15,800 by 2028. The report revealed that Ethereum’s role in DeFi, ongoing Layer 2 scaling, and institutional adoptions are the key drivers that will fuel the price rise in the longer term. However, some analysts warn that the volatile nature, regulatory conditions, and macroeconomic conditions remain influential to the price outcomes, leaving ETH’s price direction solely dependent on market dynamics.

Helius executives noted Solana’s position as the fastest-growing blockchain historically, leading the industry in transaction revenue while processing over 3,500 transactions per second. The executives also emphasized SOL’s financial productivity through design, offering a roughly 7% native staking yield, which contrasts with non-yield-bearing assets like Bitcoin. The company plans to capitalize on Solana’s native yield-generating architecture and capture opportunities in DeFi and broader on-chain activity. “We believe that Solana is a category-defining blockchain and the foundation on which a new financial system will be built,” said Dan Morehead, founder and managing partner of Pantera Capital.

BitMine’s stock price jumped from $4.26 to $26.06 , a 511.02% intraday increase, when the company announced its crypto-focused treasury strategy in June. The Solana Treasury Trend The market appears to be entering “Solana season,” similar to when Ethereum attracted companies like Sharplink Gaming and BitMine to launch ETH treasuries that later accumulated billions of dollars in Ether. Current Solana treasury companies, including DeFi Development Corp ., Upexi, and Sol Strategies, are already deploying hundreds of millions of dollars to accumulate SOL. Upexi Inc., a consumer products firm turned Solana treasury powerhouse, now holds over 2 million SOL valued at $447 million, with $142 million in unrealized gains and daily staking rewards of approximately $105,000. The firm also recently appointed former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes to its advisory board. CoinGecko data reveals that approximately eight Solana treasury companies have been established, collectively accumulating more than $1.5 billion worth of Solana, equivalent to over 1% of the entire SOL supply.

Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Solana-based infrastructure provider Helius, recently shared that Solana-focused treasury companies have raised between $3 billion and $4 billion to date, with more expected to follow. The SOL treasury companies' initial raises combined are about 3-4B (more are coming) This is before they buy more on the open market Unlike Bitcoin and MSTR, a non-trivial amount of this cash will be injected into SOL DeFi not financial advice — mert | helius.dev (@0xMert_) September 14, 2025 Unlike Bitcoin and Michael Saylor’s treasury company MicroStrategy (MSTR), a large percentage of capital raised by Solana treasury companies will be deployed into SOL DeFi, potentially increasing the SOL token’s value and overall ecosystem growth. Solana currently trades at $233.82, boasting over $13 billion in total value locked (TVL) across its DeFi ecosystem, second only to Ethereum. Global investment firm VanEck maintains a bullish outlook on Solana, predicting SOL could reach $520 before year-end. China’s DeepSeek AI recently projected that SOL could eventually target $1,000 by late 2026, well above its previous $295 all-time high.

In his view, too many holders are ignoring what the charts are showing, even though long-term signals suggest a decisive move could be on the horizon. He says that the real profits in this market will come from patience and belief rather than quick trades. The analyst argues that those who remain strong will be in the best position when the asset takes off. Writing on X, he urged the XRP community to adopt a bigger vision of what may lie ahead. Historical Patterns Point To A Potentially “Historic” XRP Move Egrag Crypto explains that the XRP two-month chart is flashing a rare setup. He notes that five strong body candles have formed at new all-time highs, something he calls unprecedented in structure. According to him, the parabolic curve building on the chart suggests that what lies ahead for the digital asset could be “truly historic .” He argues that if XRP falls below $2.00 , it could mirror Bitcoin’s era when it traded at $200, a price that later made those early buyers legendary in the crypto world. For him, those who buy the token at the $2 level will also be seen as “OGs” in the future. While many in the community focus on short-term moves , the analyst’s strategy is to buy low and sell high over time. He says it is fine for investors to trade a small portion of their holdings, maybe 10% to 20%, but most of the stack should be kept by investors for the long run . Egrag recalls the years when XRP traded below $1, and he kept urging people to buy, even when he got mocked for it. Looking back, he says conviction during those times is what makes real winners. Technical Signals Suggest XRP Must Clear $3.70 To Trigger Rally Looking at the charts now, Egrag points to one key price target. He says XRP needs to close above $3.70 with a strong two-month candle to confirm what he calls a “space mission moment.” According to him, this breakout would open the way for much bigger moves. While he supports cautious short-term trading, his main advice is to stay focused on the larger trend and be prepared for the next leg higher. At the same time, Egrag warns that trading is not easy. He says the market is a competition where only the strongest and most determined survive. For him, the right mindset is just as crucial as the charts. He closes his message with encouragement, saying that the rise may come soon, and those XRP investors who hold firm may reap the rewards.",XRP,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-15 19:00:03

Bitcoin Realized Cap Shows Acceleration In Inflows Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju has shared the trend in the Realized Cap of Bitcoin over its entire history. The “Realized Cap” here refers to an on-chain indicator that measures, in short, the total amount of capital that the investors as a whole have put into the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: XRP Bearish Signal: Whales Offload $486 Million In Asset When the value of this metric rises, it means the investors are feeding a net amount of capital into the network. On the other hand, it going down suggests the cryptocurrency is facing outflows. Now, here is the chart shared by Young Ju that shows how the Realized Cap has developed over the history of Bitcoin: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Realized Cap saw an acceleration in 2024, implying capital started to enter into the digital asset at a faster rate. In the past year and a half, the metric has seen an explosive growth of $625 billion. Interestingly, between 2009 and 2024, the Realized Cap cumulatively grew by $435 billion. This means that not only have recent capital flows overtaken these inflows that occurred over a much longer timespan, they have actually gained a notable distance. The much sharper capital inflows are a reflection of how BTC is growing as an asset. A relatively modest amount of inflows may have been enough to double the asset’s value in the past, but today, a huge amount of capital is needed to move the needle. A new catalyst for growth this cycle has been in the form of the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These investment vehicles allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without having to own any sats themselves. This has made these funds a popular way to invest for the traditional traders unfamiliar with cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges, and brought in previously untapped capital. In some other news, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has shared an update on how Bitcoin investor cohort behavior has recently looked from the lens of the Accumulation Trend Score. Related Reading: Analyst Sets Bold $1,314 Target For Solana After Cup-And-Handle Breakout This indicator tells us about whether the BTC holders are buying or selling right now. Below is the chart posted by Glassnode that shows the trend in the metric for the various investor groups. From the chart, it’s visible that the indicator is in the neutral-to-distribution region for all groups currently, a sign that the Bitcoin investors as a whole are in a phase of selling. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $115,400, up 3% over the last week.

A crypto analyst has highlighted $3.6 as the key resistance in this formation, noting that if XRP can clear this level, the path toward an ambitious End of the Year (EOY) target of $23 is expected to come into view, with short-term milestones anticipated along the way. XRP Price Bull Flag Signals Explosive Potential Crypto market expert Stedas has drawn attention to XRP’s weekly chart, highlighting the formation of a classic bull flag pattern, one of the strongest continuation signals in technical analysis. His XRP price analysis, shared in a post on X social media, shows that the cryptocurrency’s recent sideways movement and consolidation phase are forming the “flag” of the pattern after a sharp rally that created the “flagpole.” This structure typically suggests that a new explosive leg upward could soon unfold once resistance is cleared. Related Reading: XRP Price Gets Tighter: Here’s The Level Keeping It From Price Discovery According to Stedas, the critical level to watch is the $3.6 mark. A decisive break above this resistance could ignite XRP’s next rally phase, potentially unlocking price levels far beyond its current range and former all-time highs. The analyst has identified $6, $13, and even $23 as potential end-of-the-year targets. While these levels may seem ambitious, they align with the behaviours of bull flag patterns, which have historically driven powerful and sustained rallies following periods of consolidation. Notably, XRP’s momentum picked up after it reclaimed the $3 range earlier this month with strong buying pressure. However the price has since slipped to $2.97 following a 3.5% pullback in the past 24 hours. Despite the dip, Stedas’s bull flag framework suggests that XRP is shifting out of its stagnant zone and is now primed for acceleration. If market sentiment aligns with the technicals, the cryptocurrency could be looking at its most significant rally in years. The next few weeks may also prove decisive, as the market awaits confirmation of whether the analyst’s current setup can deliver on its bullish outlook. XRP Retests Fib Zone With $4.6 Target In Play Crypto analyst, Rose Premium Signals, has also shed light on XRP’s structure, focusing on its mid-term outlook. The analysis suggests that XRP has completed a bullish retest, strengthening the case for upside continuation. According to him, XRP has just bounced off the 0.5 – 0.618 Fibonacci retracement zone, a range that often serves as a textbook support level before continuation moves. Related Reading: XRP Price Confirms Descending Trendline Breakout, Here Are The Targets Rose Premium Signals has highlighted an entry zone between $2.85 and $3.05, which XRP has already tested and respected with notable strength. The analyst argues that this confirmation marks a valid long setup backed by clear technical structure, Fibonacci alignment, and broader market resilience. From this zone, the chart projects a climb toward $4.67, which serves as the first official target in this mid-breakout scenario.

Here’s When,https://timestabloid.com/crypto-proponent-xrp-pump-is-not-over-yet-5-is-coming-heres-when/,"Crypto analyst and X influencer QuantumFox has ignited debate with a striking claim: “the $XRP pump is not over yet,” predicting that the token will reach $5 before the end of this month. Accompanying the post was a detailed candlestick chart showing a breakout pattern and a sharp upward price projection. The bold call has captured the attention of traders and market watchers eager to assess whether such a dramatic surge is realistic. The Technical Setup XRP’s current price is hovering around $3.01 to $3.03, showing stability after a period of consistent upward trend. This reflects a relatively steady market position for the cryptocurrency, with its price movements being closely watched by investors and market analysts. QuantumFox’s chart highlights a falling-wedge breakout, a pattern traditionally associated with bullish reversals. Following the breakout, XRP retested the former resistance line and maintained momentum—a textbook sign of potential continuation. Independent market data confirm elevated trading volumes, suggesting sustained interest. Many technical analysts see interim resistance between $3.40 and $3.60 before any potential run toward $5. The $XRP pump is not over yet $5 is coming this month pic.twitter.com/M2DPEIDbrt — QuantumFox (@QantaFox) September 14, 2025 What It Takes to Reach $5 This Month Moving from about $3.05 to $5 in less than 30 days requires more than chart formations. The leap represents a 63% price increase, necessitating an average compounded daily gain of almost 1.7%. Such moves are not impossible in crypto markets but typically depend on strong catalysts. Analysts point to potential triggers such as large-scale institutional inflows, sudden adoption announcements by major payment networks, or decisive regulatory breakthroughs that could spark new investor demand. Without these drivers, a pure technical surge to $5 in such a short window is statistically aggressive. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Forces and Broader Context Beyond technicals, macroeconomic conditions remain critical. Global liquidity patterns, shifts in central bank policies, and the broader crypto market’s sentiment play a crucial role in driving or limiting price surges, influencing the trajectory of rallies in the cryptocurrency space. Recent U.S. economic data and Federal Reserve policy outlook continue to influence digital asset volatility. A supportive macroeconomic environment paired with positive sentiment across the cryptocurrency space might propel XRP’s growth. On the flip side, risk-averse shifts in traditional financial markets could dampen or even reverse its current upward momentum. Balancing Optimism with Caution QuantumFox’s prediction highlights the strong optimism prevalent among XRP supporters, and the breakout pattern on the chart clearly indicates bullish momentum , reflecting a potent mix of community sentiment and technical market strength. Experienced traders note that while reaching $5 is possible over time, hitting that level in just a month would need strong buying power and sustained confirmation of breakout patterns. Traders are advised to balance technical excitement with actual market conditions when making investment choices.

The dAI team has begun work under the leadership of Ethereum core developer Davide Crapis. The team's short-term focus will be on the ERC-8004 standard, which will enable AI agents to operate seamlessly. This standard will be unveiled at the Devconnect event in November. The long-term goal is to build a decentralized AI infrastructure. Crapis said in the announcement: We are launching a new AI Team (dAI Team) at the Ethereum Foundation. Our mission is to make Ethereum the consensus and coordination layer of choice for AIs and the machine economy. The new team will focus on two main areas: AI Economy: The ability of artificial intelligence agents and robots to make payments, coordinate, and follow rules without the need for intermediaries. Decentralized AI Stack: Stop leaving AI in the hands of just a few large corporations, but develop open, verifiable, and censorship-resistant alternatives. Related News: BREAKING: First XRP ETF to List on Exchange This Week - But Pay Attention to These Details To this end, the Ethereum Foundation will work closely with both the protocol team and ecosystem projects. This will align protocol improvements directly with the needs of AI developers. We will also fund innovative public benefit projects to support the ecosystem, ensuring Ethereum remains the “best home for AI.” According to Crapis, Ethereum makes AI more reliable, while AI makes Ethereum more useful: “As AI agents process transactions, they will increasingly need a neutral layer of value and reputation. Ethereum could be that layer; AI can free itself from dependence on a few centralized platforms.” *This is not investment advice.

One major wallet just withdrew over 500 billion SHIB to cold storage – a classic sign of long-term accumulation. Data from Arkham Intelligence shows that wallet 0x2…B0c6 now holds 510.4 billion SHIB, worth around $6.7 million . The timing is notable, as the transfer came just ahead of the upcoming launch of the first Dogecoin ($DOGE) ETF in the U.S. by REX-Osprey – a move that could ignite fresh momentum across the meme coin market. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: SHIB Offers 155% Upside Potential If This Happens Shiba Inu (SHIB) has started to pull back after touching key trend line resistance at $0.00001450 . This opens the door for a potential retest of that level from above , turning former resistance into support. The $0.00001200 zone is now the main support to watch. A strong bounce from this level could trigger a rally toward $0.00001750 , and eventually push SHIB back to its $0.00003400 swing high . That would represent a 155% upside potential from current levels. A confirmed breakout above trend line resistance would likely signal the start of SHIB’s next major leg up . This week’s expected interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve could act as the catalyst. Markets are anticipating a 25 basis point drop in the Federal Funds Rate – a move that typically sends investors chasing higher-yield opportunities. Among them, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is gaining traction, with early buyers betting it could explode as meme coin season heats up. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Is This Cycle’s Hidden Gem – $2.2M Raised In Just a Couple of Weeks Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is what you get when you mix a Shiba Inu, a six-pack of energy drinks, and zero risk management.

The country’s financial regulator, the AMF, said it might start rejecting those “passported” licenses as part of a larger push to hand crypto oversight to the European Securities and Markets Authority, also known as ESMA. Marie-Anne Barbat-Layani, president of the AMF, said crypto companies are “doing their regulatory shopping all over Europe,” picking countries with looser licensing standards to get easier access across the entire EU. Under the EU’s MiCA framework, which came into force this year, firms can get licensed in one member state and operate across all 27. France says this setup is now exposing serious gaps in how crypto firms are being watched, and it wants that fixed—fast. France joins Italy and Austria to demand ESMA control Marie-Anne told Reuters that France is keeping what she called the “atomic weapon” on the table—the option to flat-out reject licenses granted by other EU countries. “It’s very complex legally and not a very good signal for the single market,” she said, “but it’s still a possibility we hold in reserve.” She didn’t name any specific companies, but the AMF is clearly not playing around. On Monday, France teamed up with Italy’s Consob and Austria’s FMA to push for ESMA to take the reins on supervising major crypto firms. In a joint paper, the three regulators warned that national authorities were applying the MiCA rules in very different ways, leaving room for companies to exploit the weakest link. They wrote that the first few months under MiCA had already shown “major differences” in supervision. They want direct EU-level control to make sure the rules are applied the same way across the board. And they’re also asking for changes to MiCA itself, including tougher rules for crypto companies operating outside the EU, stronger cybersecurity standards, and better oversight of new token launches. A spokesperson for ESMA said the agency is “working intensely” to make crypto licensing and supervision consistent. They pointed to a paper the agency released last year that already called for lawmakers to consider giving it power to oversee crypto companies at the EU level. Malta remains under pressure as France pushes harder This whole conversation kicked up again earlier this year after ESMA reviewed how Malta’s financial regulator gave a license to a crypto company. The agency found that Malta didn’t do enough to evaluate the risks before handing over the green light, Cryptopolitan reported in July. Malta defended itself, saying it was proud of being one of the EU’s early adopters of crypto regulation, but the warning still landed. So far, countries like Luxembourg and Malta have granted licenses to big names. Luxembourg approved Coinbase, while Malta licensed Gemini, the U.S. exchange run by the Winklevoss twins. That raised eyebrows, especially from France, which hasn’t ruled out challenging these types of licenses if it feels the bar wasn’t set high enough. Right now, crypto firms are still going through the process of applying for MiCA licenses during a transition phase. No company has been named publicly as a direct target of a possible French rejection, but that threat is clearly on the table. Marie-Anne said the legal framework for rejecting a license isn’t easy, but France is prepared to go there if needed. And this isn’t some sudden change. France has been pushing for more EU-level oversight for a long time. ESMA chair Verena Ross has already said she’s open to the idea. But not every EU country agrees. Some are pushing back against giving up national control. That means the fight over who gets to watch crypto firms is far from over. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The proposal, outlined in a Truth Social post on Monday, would require approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). NEW: TRUMP SAYS “SUBJECT TO SEC APPROVAL, COMPANIES AND CORPORATIONS SHOULD NO LONGER BE FORCED TO “REPORT” ON A QUARTERLY BASIS (QUARTERLY REPORTING!), BUT RATHER TO REPORT ON A “SIX (6) MONTH BASIS.”“ pic.twitter.com/ywQVGbUx2x — DEGEN NEWS (@DegenerateNews) September 15, 2025 Trump Calls for Six-Month Earnings Reports, Citing China’s Long-Term Strategy “Subject to SEC approval, companies and corporations should no longer be forced to report on a quarterly basis, but rather to report on a six-month basis,” Trump wrote. He argued the change would save businesses money and give managers space to “properly run their companies.” Trump added that American firms are trapped by short-term pressures, contrasting it with what he described as China’s “50 to 100 year view” on corporate strategy. The idea is not new. During his first term, Trump directed the SEC to study the possibility of moving to six-month reporting, but the initiative stalled amid concerns about investor transparency. His renewed push aligns with arguments long made by business leaders such as JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett, who in 2018 co-wrote an op-ed criticizing the “unhealthy focus on short-term profits” created by quarterly reporting. Hillary Clinton also raised the issue during her 2016 campaign, warning against “quarterly capitalism.” The debate comes as some exchanges push for reform. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Long-Term Stock Exchange, backed by investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Founders Fund, is preparing to petition the SEC to allow companies to move away from quarterly reporting. “We hear a lot about how it’s overly burdensome to be a public company,” said Bill Harts, the exchange’s CEO. Supporters of the current system argue that quarterly filings provide transparency for shareholders and policymakers. They say regular updates from airlines, banks, and technology firms give early indications about everything from travel demand to loan losses and trends like artificial intelligence adoption. Economists also warn that reducing the frequency of reports could limit investor oversight and reduce market stability. Internationally, Trump’s proposal would bring U.S. rules closer to Europe and the UK, where companies report every six months but may choose to release quarterly results. In Australia, semiannual reporting is standard. By contrast, Chinese firms face stricter requirements, with listed companies obligated to publish quarterly, semiannual, and annual reports, while Hong Kong-listed firms operate under a six-month system. For crypto firms that have gone public in the U.S., such as Coinbase, the outcome of this debate could prove pivotal. Quarterly reports currently provide rare insight into trading volumes, custody services, and market demand. A shift to semiannual filings may lessen that visibility, reducing the frequency of updates that investors and regulators rely on to gauge the health of crypto businesses. Crypto Adoption by Public Companies Could Be Reshaped by Trump’s SEC Plan The debate over quarterly reporting comes as the Trump administration sharpens its focus on digital assets. In June, the White House released a 166-page report from the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, outlining plans to position the U.S. as a global leader in cryptocurrency and blockchain. Trump admin report calls for clear SEC/CFTC crypto rules, DeFi adoption & modern bank reforms. #Trump #CryptoRegulations https://t.co/qLYj3tAhZ2 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 30, 2025 Formed under Executive Order 14178, the group recommended sweeping reforms to modernize financial regulation, expand bank participation in crypto services, and give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission explicit oversight of non-security digital asset spot markets. The report also hailed the signing of the GENIUS Act in July , which created the first federal framework for stablecoins. The administration said the law would strengthen the role of the U.S. dollar in global finance while affirming its opposition to central bank digital currencies. The White House described the recommendations as a pathway to a “Golden Age of Crypto,” claiming to have already ended banking restrictions on the industry. Meanwhile, crypto firms are reporting stronger results as digital asset prices rebound. MicroStrategy posted $120.4 million in Q2 revenue alongside the purchase of 12,800 additional Bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 152,800 BTC. Block reported a 34% increase in Bitcoin revenue year-over-year, while Coinbase saw revenue hit $663 million, despite facing ongoing litigation with the SEC. Robinhood also turned a quarterly profit for the first time since going public. Analysts note that corporate adoption continues to accelerate, with businesses now holding more than 6% of Bitcoin’s supply , a shift that could reshape financial reporting if Trump’s SEC overhaul proceeds.

Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) demonstrate strong price action, but their growth potential faces natural limitations. This has investors examining newer alternatives like Layer Brett that could deliver superior returns. The evolving meme coin landscape offers both opportunities and challenges.

The token’s recent price movement demonstrates lasting cultural relevance. However, its massive market capitalization requires unprecedented demand for further gains. This mathematical reality limits percentage return potential. The best meme coin to buy now might not be the most established one. Dogecoin’s utility remains limited despite its popularity. This creates an opportunity for newer projects with better fundamentals. Shiba Inu’s ecosystem development continues gradually SHIB maintains progress with ecosystem expansions and token burns. These developments support price stability but haven’t driven explosive growth. The project’s large circulating supply creates constant selling pressure. This affects its ability to achieve dramatic appreciation. Investors seeking the best meme coin to buy now often look beyond established options.

KindlyMD (NAKA) , a company known for its Bitcoin holdings, experienced a dramatic and sudden decline. This significant drop has sent ripples through the investment community, prompting questions about its cause and potential wider implications. What Triggered the Dramatic KindlyMD (NAKA) Plunge? Today, KindlyMD (NAKA) shares plummeted by over 50%, closing at $1.34 after a staggering 51.83% decline. The primary catalyst for this sharp downturn, as highlighted by Julio Moreno, a senior analyst at CryptoQuant, was insider selling. This refers to the sale of shares by a company’s executives, directors, or major shareholders. Insider Selling: Key figures within KindlyMD sold off a substantial amount of their holdings. Market Reaction: Such sales often signal a lack of confidence from those most knowledgeable about the company’s future prospects. Immediate Impact: The market reacted swiftly and negatively, leading to the substantial price drop. This event underscores the critical role that insider activity can play in influencing investor sentiment and stock performance, especially for a company like KindlyMD (NAKA) that also navigates the volatile crypto landscape. Understanding Insider Selling: Why Does It Matter for KindlyMD (NAKA)? Insider selling occurs when individuals with privileged information about a company’s health and future prospects sell their shares. While not always indicative of wrongdoing, it can often be interpreted by the broader market as a red flag. For KindlyMD (NAKA) , a company that has attracted attention for its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, such an event can be particularly impactful. Investors often look to insider transactions as a barometer of a company’s internal health. If those closest to the operations are divesting their shares, it can lead external investors to question the company’s trajectory. Consequently, this can erode trust and trigger a wave of selling, further driving down the stock price. Is KindlyMD’s Bitcoin Exposure a Factor in Investor Jitters? KindlyMD (NAKA) has positioned itself with Bitcoin (BTC) holdings, which adds another layer of complexity to its stock performance. While Bitcoin can offer significant upside, it also introduces considerable volatility. When combined with negative news like insider selling, the inherent risks of crypto exposure can amplify investor concerns. Moreover, the perception that a company’s leadership is selling off shares while the company holds a volatile asset like Bitcoin can make investors particularly uneasy. They might question the long-term strategy or the confidence of the management in both the company’s core business and its crypto investment. Navigating Volatility: What Should Investors Consider After the KindlyMD (NAKA) Drop? For current and potential investors in KindlyMD (NAKA) , today’s events highlight the importance of thorough due diligence. It’s crucial to look beyond the headlines and understand the full context of insider selling, the company’s fundamentals, and its overall strategy. Research Thoroughly: Investigate the reasons behind the insider selling. Was it pre-scheduled, or did it indicate a sudden loss of confidence? Evaluate Fundamentals: Assess KindlyMD’s core business performance, revenue streams, and financial health independent of its Bitcoin holdings. Consider Risk Tolerance: Understand that stocks with exposure to volatile assets like Bitcoin, especially those facing internal challenges, carry higher risks. Diversification: Ensure your investment portfolio is well-diversified to mitigate the impact of sudden drops in any single stock. This situation serves as a powerful reminder that even companies with intriguing investment angles, such as Bitcoin exposure, are subject to traditional market dynamics and the influence of insider actions. The sudden and significant plunge of KindlyMD (NAKA) stock due to insider selling is a stark illustration of how internal corporate actions can profoundly affect market valuation and investor confidence. While the company’s Bitcoin holdings add a modern twist, the core principles of market reaction to insider activity remain timeless. Investors are encouraged to approach such situations with caution, relying on comprehensive research and a clear understanding of their investment goals and risk tolerance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly is insider selling? Insider selling refers to the sale of a company’s shares by its executives, directors, or major shareholders who have access to non-public, material information about the company. These individuals are considered ‘insiders’ due to their privileged positions. Why did KindlyMD (NAKA) stock fall so sharply? According to Julio Moreno, a senior analyst at CryptoQuant, the sharp decline of over 50% in KindlyMD (NAKA) stock was primarily triggered by significant insider selling. This often signals a lack of confidence from those closest to the company’s operations. Does KindlyMD’s Bitcoin (BTC) holding impact its stock price volatility? Yes, KindlyMD’s exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) can contribute to its stock price volatility. Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset, and fluctuations in its price, combined with other market factors like insider selling, can amplify investor concerns and lead to more dramatic stock movements for KindlyMD (NAKA) . What should investors do when a stock experiences a sudden plunge like KindlyMD (NAKA)? Investors should conduct thorough research into the cause of the plunge, evaluate the company’s fundamentals, and consider their personal risk tolerance. It’s often advisable to avoid impulsive decisions and consult with a financial advisor. Did you find this analysis helpful?

He noted that the sharp decline after Bitcoin reached $124,000 also led to a decline in social media interest and Google searches. “Search volumes have declined, but there's still some momentum in the market. People typically show more interest when prices are rising. Over the last three days, interest in Coinbase and Dogecoin has decreased, while interest in CoinMarketCap, OKX, Binance, and Hyperliquid has increased. This could be linked to increased speculation in altcoins,” Wedson said. Related News: This Altcoin's Developer Broke Project's Promise: Announced They Will Mint Additional Tokens According to the analyst, investors are initially turning to CoinMarketCap and then trading on exchanges in search of opportunities. However, social interest in leading cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP has reportedly fallen back to low levels. Wedson also highlighted Binance's dominance in spot trading volume, commenting, “Binance's spot volume surpasses all other exchanges combined. If this dominance persists, it could be a very interesting month for BTC, similar to the period when Bitcoin surged from 40,000 to 73,000 after the ETF launch.” *This is not investment advice.

51781186,https://cryptonews.com/?p=423504,1757964849,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51781186.jpeg,Base Now “Exploring” a Network Token – Is a Massive Airdrop Imminent?,https://cryptonews.com/news/base-now-exploring-a-network-token-is-a-massive-airdrop-imminent/,"Base, the Ethereum Layer-2 network incubated by Coinbase, is shifting its stance on tokenization. At BaseCamp 2025 in Stowe, Vermont, Base creator Jesse Pollak said the project is “beginning to explore” the launch of a network token , marking a reversal from Coinbase’s long-held position that no token was planned. The exploration of a network token comes on the heels of Linea’s token generation event last week , which saw Consensys’ Layer-2 network distribute more than 9.3 billion LINEA tokens to eligible users. The launch sparked speculation that Base could pursue a similar path, though Coinbase has stressed that no decisions have been made. Coinbase Considers Token Path After Linea’s $LINEA Airdrop Pollak emphasized that Base remains in the early stages of exploration, with no specifics yet on design, governance, or timing. “Base is a bridge, not an island,” he said during the livestreamed event, showing the network’s vision of deeper connectivity within the Ethereum ecosystem. While the project cautioned that there are “no definitive plans” for a token, it described the shift as part of a broader philosophical update, seeking to accelerate decentralization and expand opportunities for builders and creators. We’re exploring a Base network token. It could be a great tool for accelerating decentralization and expanding creator and developer growth in the ecosystem. To be clear, there are no definitive plans. We’re just updating our philosophy. As of now, we’re exploring it. https://t.co/BK3asbMpar — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) September 15, 2025 Launched in 2023, Base was designed as a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly chain. Until now, Coinbase has argued that a token was not necessary to achieve those goals. However, with the network’s recent milestones, such as sub-second, sub-cent transactions and a growing developer ecosystem, leaders say they are rethinking their approach as Base positions itself to play a central role in a global on-chain economy. Alongside the token discussion, Base announced new initiatives at BaseCamp. One update was the debut of an open-source bridge between Base and Solana, intended to allow seamless interoperability between ERC-20 and SPL tokens. We've built a bridge. @solana ⇌ @base . pic.twitter.com/6eacx3yMap — Coinbase (@coinbase) September 15, 2025 The bridge , now live on testnet, will allow users to move assets across chains, deposit and use SOL in Base applications, and expand liquidity for both ecosystems. It is expected to launch on the mainnet in the coming weeks. Base also unveiled updates to its builder programs and products. The second round of Base Batches , set to begin on September 29, will provide funding, mentorship, and global distribution to developers, culminating in a demo day at Devconnect in Argentina. Meanwhile, the Base app, an “everything app” combining social networking, payments, trading, and app discovery, has drawn over 1 million people to its waitlist since its invite-only beta in July. According to the project, more than $500,000 in creator earnings have already been paid out through the platform. Base Hits $5B TVL, Weighs Token Plans Amid Network Milestone The tokenization announcements come as Base reaches a new milestone in adoption. According to DeFiLlama , the network’s total value locked (TVL) recently hit an all-time high of $5.06 billion before falling to $4.99 billion earlier in the day, making it the sixth-largest blockchain by TVL. Lending protocols Morpho and Aave account for more than 60% of that figure, while stablecoins on the network hold a combined market capitalization of $4.3 billion. Base also recorded over 971,000 active addresses in 24 hours, with $21.1 billion in bridged assets. However, Coinbase’s Base network faced its first major disruption on August 5 , when block production halted for over 30 minutes. The outage temporarily affected deposits, withdrawals, and Flashblocks functionality. @base network releases 33-minute outage report revealing sequencer handover failure during high activity period as token launches hit 54,000 daily amid growth surge. #Base #Blockchain https://t.co/HaiQb4nB4N — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 6, 2025 Base later confirmed the cause was a failed sequencer handover within its high-availability cluster. As on-chain activity spiked, the active sequencer fell behind, prompting an automated system called Conductor to shift control to a backup. The handoff failed because the new sequencer was still being provisioned, leaving the network unable to produce blocks until the team manually intervened. The incident comes as Base experiences record adoption. The network recently overtook Solana in daily token launches, with more than 54,000 new tokens created on July 27. Since the relaunch of its app, which integrates platforms like Zora and Farcaster, Base has seen 1.6 million tokens deployed and nearly 3 million traders generating around $470 million in volume.

This massive movement, valued at approximately $278 million, has caught the attention of market observers and analysts alike. It raises crucial questions about the intentions behind such a large transfer and its potential ripple effects on the Solana ecosystem. What Does This Enormous SOL Transfer to Coinbase Institutional Signify? When a transaction of this magnitude occurs, it’s often referred to as a ‘whale’ movement. Whale Alert, a popular blockchain tracking service, first reported the event, highlighting the scale of the SOL transferred . Such large transfers typically suggest a few key possibilities: Institutional Interest: Moving funds to Coinbase Institutional, a platform designed for large financial entities, strongly implies institutional involvement. This could be an asset manager, a hedge fund, or a corporate treasury acquiring or preparing to manage a substantial Solana position. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Large blocks of cryptocurrencies are often traded privately via OTC desks to minimize market impact. The transfer to Coinbase Institutional could be part of such an arrangement, facilitating a direct sale or purchase without going through public exchanges. Custody Solutions: Institutions prioritize secure custody for their digital assets. Coinbase Institutional offers robust custodial services, suggesting the unknown wallet owner might be seeking enhanced security and compliance for their significant SOL transferred holdings. This event underscores the growing mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies like Solana, particularly among traditional financial players looking to diversify their portfolios. Understanding the Mechanics of Large-Scale SOL Transfers Blockchain technology makes every transaction transparent, even if the parties remain anonymous. The process of having 1,189,999 SOL transferred involves cryptographic keys and network confirmations, ensuring security and immutability. Coinbase Institutional plays a pivotal role in facilitating such large movements. They provide tailored services for institutions, including: Advanced trading platforms with deep liquidity. Secure custody solutions that meet regulatory standards. Dedicated client support for complex transactions. The fact that the funds moved to an institutional arm rather than a retail exchange suggests a strategic, well-planned maneuver. This level of activity often precedes or follows significant market developments, making it a point of keen observation for investors. What Are the Potential Market Impacts of Such a Significant SOL Transfer? Any substantial movement of digital assets can influence market sentiment and price action. The SOL transferred to Coinbase Institutional could have several implications: Short-Term Considerations: Potential Selling Pressure: If the transfer is for an OTC sale, it might signal an impending liquidation, which could put downward pressure on Solana’s price if the market anticipates a large sell-off. Market Speculation: The news itself can trigger speculative trading, with some investors betting on a price drop and others on a rally due to increased institutional confidence. Long-Term Outlook: Increased Liquidity: If the funds are intended for active trading by an institution, it could enhance Solana’s market liquidity, making it easier for large orders to be filled without significant price swings. Validation of Solana: Institutional engagement often serves as a vote of confidence in a blockchain project’s technology and future prospects. This can attract more investment and development to the Solana ecosystem. It is crucial for investors to monitor follow-up actions and broader market trends rather than reacting solely to the initial transfer. The underlying reasons for the SOL transferred are key to understanding its long-term impact. Staying Informed About Major SOL Transfers and Market Trends For those involved in the crypto market, tracking whale movements and institutional activity is an essential part of an informed strategy. Services like Whale Alert provide real-time data that can offer insights into market dynamics. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor On-Chain Data: Regularly check blockchain explorers and whale tracking services to stay updated on large transfers. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Large institutional moves can introduce volatility, so a diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks. Research Beyond the Headlines: Always delve deeper to understand the potential context and implications of major news. Why was the SOL transferred ? What are the possible next steps? The continuous flow of institutional capital into digital assets is a clear indicator of the maturing crypto market. Each significant transaction, like this substantial SOL transferred event, contributes to the evolving narrative of cryptocurrency adoption. In conclusion, the transfer of nearly 1.2 million SOL to Coinbase Institutional is more than just a large transaction; it’s a significant indicator of institutional engagement with Solana. Whether it signals an impending trade, a strategic accumulation, or enhanced custody, it highlights the growing role of major financial players in the digital asset space. This event reaffirms Solana’s position as a prominent blockchain platform attracting serious capital. Keeping an eye on such movements helps us understand the broader trends shaping the future of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is ‘Coinbase Institutional’? Coinbase Institutional is a suite of services provided by Coinbase designed for institutional clients, including asset managers, hedge funds, and corporations. It offers advanced trading, prime brokerage, and secure custody solutions for digital assets. Q2: Why are large cryptocurrency transfers called ‘whale’ movements? In the cryptocurrency market, individuals or entities holding a very large amount of a particular digital asset are often referred to as ‘whales.’ Their transactions, or ‘whale movements,’ are significant enough to potentially influence market prices and sentiment. Q3: Does a large SOL transferred to an exchange always mean a sell-off is coming? Not necessarily. While it can sometimes precede a sell-off, especially if the funds move to a retail exchange, transfers to institutional platforms like Coinbase Institutional can also indicate accumulation, OTC deals, or a shift to more secure custody solutions. It’s important to consider the context. Q4: How can I track large crypto transactions like this SOL transferred event? You can track large crypto transactions using blockchain explorers for specific networks (e.g., Solana Explorer for SOL) or specialized services like Whale Alert, which monitor significant movements across various blockchains and report them in real-time. Q5: What impact could this specific SOL transfer have on Solana’s price? The immediate impact is often speculative, as the market tries to interpret the whale’s intentions. Long-term, increased institutional involvement, regardless of the immediate action, can be seen as a positive sign for Solana’s maturity and potential for broader adoption.

In a report published Monday, Geoffrey Kendrick, the bank’s global head of digital assets research, said Ethereum treasuries are set to play a larger role in driving demand for the token compared with their Bitcoin and Solana counterparts. The assessment comes as publicly listed companies that hold cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets face increasing pressure from falling market valuations. Standard Chartered Sees Consolidation Ahead in Bitcoin-Focused DATs Digital asset treasuries have been one of the defining investment trends of 2025, helping push crypto prices to fresh highs earlier in the year. These firms rely on trading at a premium to the value of their holdings, known as market NAV (mNAV), to raise funds for further purchases. But in recent weeks, mNAVs for many DATs have slipped below 1, reducing their ability to buy additional tokens and triggering concerns about sustainability. Source: Standard Chartered Research Kendrick argued that this phase would mark a shakeout in the sector, with success depending on three factors: the ability to raise cheap funding, scale that attracts liquidity, and the generation of staking yield. He noted that Ethereum and Solana treasuries have an advantage over Bitcoin in this regard, as both networks offer staking rewards. “We think ETH and SOL DATs should be assigned higher mNAVs than BTC DATs due to staking yield,” Kendrick said. The analyst also noted market saturation among Bitcoin-focused firms. Inspired by Strategy’s aggressive accumulation of BTC, nearly 90 companies have launched similar models, collectively holding more than 150,000 BTC, six times more than at the start of the year. With valuations under pressure, Standard Chartered expects consolidation in this space, suggesting that acquisitions of smaller DATs by larger players could become more common. Such moves, however, would represent coin rotation within the sector rather than new demand for Bitcoin. Ethereum treasuries, by contrast, continue to expand. Kendrick said companies holding ETH have already accumulated about 3.1% of the cryptocurrency’s circulating supply since June. BitMine Immersion Technologies , listed on the NYSE American, is currently the largest ETH-focused DAT with more than 2 million ETH, representing about 5% of supply . Bitcoin miner turned Ethereum accumulator Bitmine now owns a total of 2,126,018 ETH worth $9.24 billion following the latest buy. #Bitmine #ETH #ETHTreasury https://t.co/e3MvMrg7lT — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 11, 2025 The firm is still only one-third of the way to its target and has continued buying despite the broader market pressure. Solana treasuries are smaller and less developed, with about 0.8% of the token’s supply held by DATs. Questions also remain over regulatory treatment, with reports suggesting Nasdaq-listed firms may need shareholder approval before allocating to crypto. Kendrick noted that this leaves Ethereum in a stronger relative position. According to Standard Chartered, DATs already hold 4% of all Bitcoin, compared with 3.1% of Ethereum and 0.8% of Solana. The bank sees Ethereum treasuries as better placed to maintain demand, thanks to staking rewards, a clearer regulatory outlook, and aggressive accumulation strategies. Ethereum is currently trading at $4,492, down 2.6% on the day but still up more than 150% since July, following institutional adoption and ETF inflows. Despite recent volatility, Kendrick concluded that DAT activity remains a more positive driver for ETH than for BTC or SOL going forward. Ethereum Treasury Firms Gain Ground as ETFs Attract Record Inflows Standard Chartered has doubled down on its view that Ethereum treasury companies may offer stronger upside than spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Kendrick said in August that firms buying Ether (ETH) for balance-sheet strategies are becoming increasingly attractive to investors as their net asset value (NAV) multiples normalize. According to Kendrick, the NAV ratios of treasury firms, market capitalization relative to ETH holdings, are now stabilizing near 1.0. This adjustment, he argued, makes them “very investable” for investors seeking ETH exposure, particularly as these companies provide a form of regulatory arbitrage compared with direct crypto ownership. He pointed out SharpLink Gaming , whose NAV multiple peaked at 2.5 before falling closer to parity, and BitMine Immersion Technologies, the sector leader with 2.15 million ETH ($9.7 billion) on its books. @SharpLinkGaming one of the largest corporate holders of Ethereum, has officially launched its $1.5B share buyback program. $SBET #Ethereum https://t.co/bWNct5LKjO — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 9, 2025 Together, Ethereum treasury companies now hold nearly 5 million ETH, or about 4.1% of the circulating supply, according to industry trackers. That figure rivals the holdings of U.S.-listed spot ETFs, which collectively manage 6.69 million ETH ($30.2 billion), equal to 5.5% of supply. BlackRock’s ETHA leads the pack with $17.25 billion in assets.

India and the U.S. will “fast-track” the discussions, said Rajesh Agarwal, India’s chief negotiator in the commerce ministry. He spoke at a briefing held alongside the announcement of the latest trade data, without sharing further details. Brendan Lynch, the United States trade delegate for South Asia, is scheduled for a one-day trip to New Delhi, according to Agarwal. Official numbers showed merchandise exports fell to 35.10 billion U.S. dollars in August from 37.24 billion U.S. dollars in July. The trade deficit reduced to 26.49 billion U.S. dollars from 27.35 billion U.S. dollars in the prior month. Washington imposed an extra 25% duty on Indian products beginning August 27, lifting the total tariff on Indian exports to 50 percent, ranking among the top rates faced by any United States partner. Sales to the U.S. market slipped to 6.86 billion U.S. dollars in August from 8.01 billion U.S. dollars in July. For the April-August period, India’s shipments to the United States reached 40.39 billion U.S. dollars. Officials said the full hit from the higher duties will show up in next month’s figures, since the additional levy took effect toward the end of August. India’s trade gap declined in August while exporters prepared for the impact of the 50% U.S. tariff. According to economists in a Bloomberg survey, the deficit was 26.49 billion U.S. dollars, compared to the 24.8 billion U.S. dollars shortfall forecast. This followed an eight-month peak of 27.35 billion U.S. dollars in July. Imports dropped 10.1 percent year-on-year in August to 61.59 billion U.S. dollars, while exports totalled 35.1 billion U.S. dollars, up 6.7 percent from a year earlier. The August data is the first full set of trade numbers since the United States announced a 25% levy on Indian goods on August 7 and doubled it 20 days later, citing New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil. The duties rank among the steepest globally and risk eroding the price edge of Indian products against rivals in Bangladesh and Vietnam. However, there were signs of a thaw last week as President Trump and PM Modi agreed to restart trade negotiations. India advances EU trade talks, plans import substitution strategy India is also pushing ahead with a trade agreement with the European Union. The next phase of negotiation is planned for October 6th-10th. The United States is India’s largest export destination, and the new tariff regime is expected to affect labour-intensive categories such as jewelry and textiles. Many exporters sped up deliveries before the higher duties kicked in. According to the data, outbound shipments to the U.S. reached 40.39 billion US dollars from April to August, compared with 34.21 billion US dollars in the same period the previous year. To cut reliance on imports, the government has marked out around 100 products in which domestic manufacturing could be scaled up. Officials say the plan is part of a broader effort to steady trade flows while talks proceed with major partners, including the United States and the European Union. Get seen where it counts.

Bitwise, a prominent crypto asset manager, has taken a bold step by filing an S-1 registration statement for an AVAX ETF . This pivotal move, as initially reported by Unfolded, signals a growing institutional appetite for Avalanche and could reshape how investors access this dynamic digital asset. What is the Buzz Around the Bitwise AVAX ETF Filing? Bitwise’s submission of an S-1 form to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a crucial regulatory step. It’s the preliminary application required to launch an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in the United States. For Avalanche (AVAX) enthusiasts and investors, this is monumental. An AVAX ETF would essentially create a traditional investment vehicle that tracks the price of AVAX. This means investors could gain exposure to Avalanche’s performance without the complexities of directly buying, storing, or managing the cryptocurrency itself. Instead, they would buy shares of the ETF through standard brokerage accounts, much like investing in stocks or other commodities. This simplification could dramatically lower the barrier to entry for a wider range of investors, including those in traditional finance who prefer regulated products. Why is an AVAX ETF Significant for Avalanche? The potential approval of an AVAX ETF carries profound implications for the Avalanche ecosystem. It’s not just about another investment product; it’s about validation and expanded opportunity. Consider these key benefits: Increased Institutional Adoption: An ETF provides a regulated, familiar, and accessible pathway for large institutional investors, such as hedge funds and pension funds, to allocate capital to AVAX. This could bring substantial new capital into the ecosystem. Enhanced Liquidity: Greater demand from institutional and retail investors, facilitated by an ETF, could lead to increased trading volume and deeper market liquidity for AVAX. This often results in more stable price discovery. Mainstream Legitimacy: A filing by a reputable firm like Bitwise, followed by potential SEC approval, lends significant credibility and legitimacy to Avalanche as a serious and investable asset class. It helps bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized technologies. Broader Investor Access: Beyond institutions, an AVAX ETF simplifies investment for everyday retail investors. They can easily integrate AVAX exposure into their diversified portfolios without needing specialized crypto wallets or exchanges. What are the Potential Challenges for the AVAX ETF? While the prospect of an AVAX ETF is undeniably exciting, the journey to approval is often rigorous and fraught with challenges. The SEC has historically maintained a cautious stance on cryptocurrency ETFs, especially those that directly hold the underlying digital assets, rather than futures contracts. Key hurdles Bitwise will likely need to address include: Regulatory Clarity: The evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. remains a significant factor. The SEC seeks assurances regarding investor protection and market integrity. Market Manipulation Concerns: Regulators are keen to ensure that the underlying spot market for AVAX is resistant to manipulation. Bitwise will need to demonstrate robust surveillance-sharing agreements and market oversight. Custody and Valuation: Secure custody solutions for the underlying AVAX and reliable valuation methodologies are critical components that the SEC scrutinizes closely. Bitwise’s comprehensive S-1 filing will need to meticulously address these concerns to pave the way for a successful launch. How Could an AVAX ETF Impact the Broader Crypto Market? The approval of an AVAX ETF would be more than just a win for Avalanche; it could set a powerful precedent for the entire altcoin market. Following the successful launches of Bitcoin spot ETFs earlier this year, the focus has shifted to other major cryptocurrencies. If an AVAX spot ETF gains approval, it could: Pave the Way for Other Altcoin ETFs: This could open the floodgates for similar ETF applications for other prominent Layer 1 blockchains and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, broadening the range of institutional crypto products available. Signify Market Maturation: It would underscore a maturing market where diverse digital assets are gaining recognition beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. This indicates a growing acceptance of the inherent value and investment potential across the crypto spectrum. Increase Overall Crypto Legitimacy: Each new regulated investment product further legitimizes the broader cryptocurrency industry in the eyes of traditional finance and mainstream investors. This development truly highlights the continuous integration of digital assets into mainstream investment vehicles. The Bitwise AVAX ETF application marks a significant milestone in the ongoing evolution of digital asset investment. It reflects a growing institutional appetite for diversified crypto exposure and solidifies Avalanche’s increasing prominence in the blockchain landscape. While the approval process will undoubtedly be rigorous, this filing is a strong indicator of the industry’s progression towards greater accessibility and legitimacy. It underscores a future where digital assets are seamlessly integrated into traditional financial portfolios, offering exciting new opportunities for investors worldwide. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an AVAX ETF? An AVAX ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is an investment fund that tracks the price of Avalanche (AVAX) cryptocurrency. It allows investors to gain exposure to AVAX through traditional brokerage accounts without directly owning or managing the digital asset. Who is Bitwise? Bitwise Asset Management is a leading cryptocurrency asset manager known for creating institutional-grade investment products. They manage several crypto funds and ETFs, including a Bitcoin spot ETF. What is Avalanche (AVAX)? Avalanche (AVAX) is a high-performance blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications (dApps) and custom blockchain networks. It is known for its speed, scalability, and low transaction fees. How long does an ETF approval process usually take? The ETF approval process can vary significantly. It often involves multiple rounds of review and feedback from the SEC, potentially taking several months to over a year, depending on the complexity and regulatory environment. Will an AVAX ETF guarantee price increases? No, an AVAX ETF does not guarantee price increases. While it can increase accessibility and potentially demand, the price of AVAX will still be subject to market forces, supply and demand, technological developments, and broader cryptocurrency market trends.

By 2028, SPX may achieve a peak price of $5.59 and an average trading price of $5.24. In 2031, the target price for SPX is between $8.39 and $9.09, with an average price of $8.74. SPX6900 (SPX) functions primarily on the Ethereum network. The token was created as a meme to entertain wider audiences. It has no real connection with stock market, equities, or securities. The meme coin generates interest through spot trading, market speculation, or perpetual and leveraged trading on different decentralized exchanges; the latter is not recommended for non-professionals due to its high risk and highly volatile nature. SPX6900 is traded on different centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges. The most popular centralized exchange for trading SPX tokens is Bybit, which has the highest trading volume for this meme coin. SPX6900 (SPX) can be stored in various wallets, including Trust Wallet, Bitget Wallet, and hardware wallets like Ledger. It can also be stored on a centralized exchange like KuCoin and another option could be Kraken, providing easy access to the coin. Early users attest to its credibility and remarkable price performance; however, the meme token still holds the interest of many investors with a daily trading volume in millions and a current circulating supply of 930.99 million SPX, which is also its total supply, although its max supply will be 1 billion tokens. Starting as a non-serious venture, the coin established itself as one of the most high-ranking coins of the year 2024. It was initiated as a useless token but ultimately ended up earning profits in the millions. For example, over a month, SPX earned up to a 9000% return following its ascent through September 2024.

Investing in SPX necessitates an evaluation of the SPX market and its emphasis on adaptability. Despite the earlier price spikes and enormous price gains, investors are advised to exercise caution on account of the market volatility of meme coins.

With the current price action, this seems quite possible, as the token is trending above $1 and its market cap will nearly double when it reaches this level. Will SPX reach $3? Per SPX price prediction, it has a chance of reaching $3 by 2026 if positive sentiment prevails, which makes SPX tokens a good purchase option. Will SPX reach $5? To reach $5, SPX’s value along with its market cap will have to increase fivefold. Though not impossible, there are chances of reaching this level by 2028. Does SPX6900 have a good long-term future? Long-term forecasts suggest a gradual increase in the value of SPX over the next two years.

The spotlight is now on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new DeFi protocol that is drawing institutional and retail capital as investors move out of older assets. Analysts highlight that Mutuum Finance token, now at $0.035, is picking up steam with predictions aiming for a potential run-up towards $1 in 2025. While XRP and other large-cap cryptos bounce, Mutuum Finance’s expanding ecosystem and increasing liquidity pools are positioning it as one of the more eagerly awaited names in the altcoin market. XRP Price Outlook Amid Market Rotation Ripple’s XRP is now trading at $3.17 as of today, with analysts noting that while the token has begun to demonstrate signs of recovery, its overall price outlook appears muted compared to past bullish cycles. XRP continues to be a leader in cross-border payments and regulatory discussion, but much of the market attention has turned to altcoins with more enticing near-term growth narratives. This leaves XRP with weakening momentum while newer projects like Mutuum Finance receive increasing investor interest in the digital asset market. Mutuum Finance Skyrockets to 6th Presale Phase The Mutuum Finance fundraising campaign has surged to over $15.8 million and more than 16,300+ investors have already invested. Stage 6 is underway at just $0.035 per token. With growth potential being eyed by investors, Mutuum Finance’s novel model of decentralized finance (DeFi) and staking opportunities put it on the radar of those players that can potentially deflect attention from XRP. Official Bug Bounty Program Mutuum Finance, in collaboration with CertiK, has an ongoing Bug Bounty Program with a prize pool of $50,000 USDT. The program is now open for white-hat hackers and security researchers to detect bugs in the project codebase. Bugs are classified on a severity basis, critical, major, minor, and low, and awards are given accordingly. The goals of the program are to strengthen the security of the platform, protect investors, and ensure users are safe across the ecosystem. Dynamic Interest and Liquidity Models Mutuum Finance runs a dynamic interest rate model that is liquidity-balanced. In times of low interest rates, lending is appealing, and users borrow and use the platform more. Repayments are initiated by higher rates, as are subsequent funding inputs. Fixed interest rates are appropriate for very liquid assets, stabilizing and allowing renegotiation on account of market fluctuation. As a fully decentralized platform, the rights of governance are in the hands of the MUTM token holders, providing autonomy for borrowers while ensuring system sustainability. The interest rate mechanism encourages long-term efficiency, enables automatic portfolio diversification, and renders the platform sensitive to the ever-evolving DeFi environment. Accurate Price Discovery Correct pricing enables lending, borrowing, and liquidation processes. Mutuum Finance utilizes Chainlink oracles to deliver market prices in USD as well as in natively supported tokens such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, composite feeds, and time-weighted averages of decentralized exchanges are also integrated on the platform for proper valuations even in the case of distressed market conditions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly gaining a following as one of the most tracked altcoins as funds cycle out of Ripple (XRP). Stage 6 tokens are set at $0.035, with Stage 7 priced 14.29% higher at $0.04, offering early buyers decent upside. The project has already raised $15.8M+ from 16,300+ investors, showing considerable traction. Analysts are expecting it to go up to $1 in 2025, which translates to gains of nearly 2800%. Join Stage 6 now and buy tokens before the next price explosion.

Its price has risen sharply in a short period, supported by a mix of new institutional activity and fresh investor enthusiasm. At the same time, a company is building a large reserve of DOGE, demonstrating its trust in the long-term role of the cryptocurrency. First U.S. Dogecoin ETF Sparks Market Excitement In the past day alone, Dogecoin has gained around 14%, pushing its weekly rise to nearly 38%. This strong run has carried the price to about $0.2963, the highest level the coin has seen in eight months. The next test for traders is whether DOGE can reclaim the $0.30 mark, which the token last reached during the early-year bull frenzy. Related Reading: Expert Crypto Trader Says Dogecoin Price Looks ‘Very Good’, Here’s Why Much of the price momentum comes from the announcement of the first-ever Dogecoin exchange-traded fund in the United States. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas announced that the Rex-Osprey Doge ETF, also known as DOJE, is set to debut. While the launch, initially scheduled for last Friday, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart later explained that trading would begin the following week instead. Even with the slight delay, the confirmation from Rex Shares that the ETF is coming has been enough to push enthusiasm higher. The new product is being rolled out under the Investment Company Act of 1940, showing that it is structured to meet strict U.S. regulatory standards. It also arrives at a time when more than 90 other crypto ETFs are waiting on SEC approval. For Dogecoin, the arrival of DOJE is a key moment because it opens the door for bigger investors and institutions to buy in through a regulated channel. CleanCore Solutions Targets 1 Billion DOGE For Corporate Treasury Alongside the excitement over ETFs, large corporate players are entering the Dogecoin space. CleanCore Solutions, a U.S.-listed company, recently announced that it has already secured more than 500 million DOGE. The company now plans to double this amount and hold 1 billion DOGE within the next month. Securing a substantial amount of DOGE for its own treasury would solidify Dogecoin as part of its long-term strategy. Related Reading: XRP Price Is Ready To Break Out, But You Should Watch Out For $3.13 To make sure the holdings are stored securely, the company is working with Bitstamp for custody on behalf of Robinhood. CleanCore’s long-term target is to control up to 5% of Dogecoin’s total circulating supply, a move that would give DOGE a powerful corporate backer. The entry of CleanCore, combined with the upcoming ETF launch, provides Dogecoin with both institutional credibility and retail excitement simultaneously. The latest developments could give the popular meme coin enough momentum to push even higher, with another double-digit gain possible before the end of the week.

Within the period of bullish action, Bitmine Immersion has gone on a significant buying spree, acquiring thousands of ETH in the month of September alone. Bitmine’s Unstoppable Ethereum Buying Spree Ethereum’s price is experiencing a newfound upward strength as the leading altcoin draws dangerously closer to the $4,700 level. While ETH is gaining bullish traction, Bitmine Immersion Technology Inc., a leading treasury company, is doubling down on the asset with its steady, significant purchases. In a post from Crypto Patel on the social media platform X, the expert revealed that the treasury company has been buying ETH at a massive scale this month alone. The company’s frequent and substantial ETH acquisitions demonstrate its robust belief in the asset’s potential for long-term growth. Even as market fluctuations continue to test investor confidence, Bitmine appears to be unshaken by the previous price swings. This substantial acquisition fuels the argument that ETH’s place in the future of smart contracts and decentralized finance is still far from fully priced in. Data shared by Crypto Patel shows that the company has scooped up over 276,800 ETH in just 14 days, valued at roughly $1.3 billion. It is worth noting that this 276,800 ETH was acquired in just 2 weeks, particularly on September 7 and 14. In the first week of this month, Bitmine accumulated 74,300 ETH, while the second week saw 202,500 ETH. Such a massive purchase reinforces Bitmine’s leading role in ETH treasury strategy and strengthens its position in the general crypto landscape. Considered an aggressive accumulation by any standard, Crypto Patel stated that the buying spree is a strong signal of institutional conviction in ETH’s long-term value. Large Investors Are Sharply Scooping Up ETH During this renewed bullish action, ETH ‘s largest investors are making their presence felt once again in the market. Crypto Patel has outlined a growing positive sentiment among these large investors, also known as whales, as they continued to accumulate the asset. According to Crypto Patel, big money players on Ethereum are stacking more than ever before. On-chain data shows that Ethereum whales holding between 10,000 ETH and 100,000 ETH have just climbed to a new all-time high. Presently, a significant portion of the supply is controlled by these wallets, indicating increasing accumulation. In addition to indicating a notable growing pattern of accumulation, this recent spike in whale balances also suggests a strong belief in the altcoin’s prospects. Crypto Patel noted that whale confidence at this scale typically precedes large market moves. As large investors double down on the altcoin, the expert stated that strong on-chain support is forming.",Ethereum|Bitmine Immersion Technology Inc.|Crypto Patel|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|Ethereum treasury|Ethereum Whales|ethusd|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-15 20:00:34

In a video shared on X, Hilton explained that while XRP is currently down about 1.6% alongside a broader 1.4% dip in global crypto capitalization, the real catalyst lies ahead. “About one-ish in the afternoon … we’re gonna find out what the Federal Reserve is going to do about cutting that base interest rate,” he said, pointing directly to the Fed’s next policy announcement as the moment to watch. Exact Timing of the Fed Statement The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) concludes its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, September 17, 2025. At 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time, the Fed will release its official statement and updated economic projections, followed by a press conference with Chair Jerome Powell. Hilton’s reference to “about 1:30 in the afternoon” matches the typical window when traders brace for headlines. This mid-September meeting is one of the Fed’s quarterly gatherings that also includes the highly scrutinized Summary of Economic Projections—the “dot plot” revealing members’ forecasts for inflation, growth, employment, and the path of interest rates. We find out in 48 hours XRP family! pic.twitter.com/Fv52sL3uPs — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) September 15, 2025 What the Market Expects Current futures pricing assigns a 95–97% probability that the Fed will trim its benchmark rate by 25 basis points (0.25%), marking the central bank’s first cut of 2025. Analysts are debating whether policymakers might surprise with a more aggressive 50-basis-point cut, but consensus leans toward the smaller move. Beyond the headline number, traders will parse the statement and Powell’s comments for signals on how many additional cuts may follow this year. Why It Matters for XRP and Crypto Interest-rate policy is a powerful driver of risk appetite. Lower rates generally weaken the dollar and increase liquidity, conditions that can channel capital into speculative assets such as cryptocurrencies. A Federal Reserve leaning dovish , whether through a significant rate cut or hints at forthcoming easing, might amplify the crypto market’s recent rally, which propelled global valuations beyond $4 trillion and enabled XRP to reclaim the $3.00 threshold.

XRP’s Position Ahead of the Decision As of report time, XRP trades at $3.00, consolidating after a strong summer rally. The token’s price has mirrored the wider market’s seven-day advance of roughly 4%, aided by speculative flows anticipating looser monetary policy. Hilton highlighted that many investors are “sitting on the sidelines” waiting for clarity, a stance that could set the stage for swift moves once the Fed speaks. The 48-Hour Countdown With less than two days until the Fed’s 2:00 p.m. ET statement on September 17, XRP traders are watching both traditional and crypto markets for early signals. Whether the central bank delivers the widely expected quarter-point cut or surprises with a bigger move, the decision will likely set the tone for digital assets into the final quarter of 2025. Hilton’s message is clear: stay alert, because the Fed’s words on Wednesday could be the spark—or the brake—for XRP’s next major swing.

What Will Jerome Powell Say?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/its-a-huge-week-what-will-the-fed-decide-on-wednesday-what-will-jerome-powell-say/,"Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick said the Fed may scale back expectations of future interest rate cuts ahead of this week's interest rate decision. Sosnick stated that markets have almost certainly priced in a 25 basis point cut, saying, “The Fed doesn't want to disappoint the majority of people. However, they may dampen excessive optimism about future cuts. We could call this a 'hawkish rate cut.'” Noting that inflation is still out of control, Sosnick noted that core PCE and core CPI are trending upward again. As US-China trade talks continue, China's launch of an antitrust investigation into NVIDIA has created market unrest. NVIDIA shares fell 2 percent, Texas Instruments 2 percent, and Analog Devices 2.5 percent. Sosnick commented, “Trade talks are volatile. While the US is exerting pressure, China is also seeking responses from various angles.” Related News: Big Whales Are Quite Active: Here Are Their Altcoin Trading Activities in Recent Hours “A unanimous decision to ease policy is unlikely,” Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note. “The committee’s split means the policy statement will be brief and to the point, offering little information on the timing and extent of further easing.” *This is not investment advice.

This isn’t just any ordinary financial move; it targets an astonishing 1.5 billion USDT, allegedly held by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) across 187 distinct blockchain addresses. This bold action underscores the increasing intersection of geopolitics and cryptocurrency, bringing to light critical questions about digital asset control and national security. What Prompted This Unprecedented USDT Seizure Call? Israel’s declaration comes amid escalating concerns over the alleged use of cryptocurrencies by sanctioned entities. The National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing believes these digital assets are crucial to funding the IRGC’s operations. This move is a clear signal that governments are actively monitoring and seeking to disrupt illicit financial flows, even those traversing decentralized networks. The sheer scale of the requested USDT seizure — 1.5 billion dollars — highlights the significant financial muscle that entities like the IRGC are believed to wield in the crypto space. Such a large sum, if successfully frozen, would represent a substantial blow to their alleged financial infrastructure. It also sets a precedent for how nations might tackle similar challenges in the future. Understanding the nature of USDT is crucial here. USDT , or Tether, is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. Its stability makes it attractive for international transfers, especially in regions facing currency volatility or sanctions. This inherent utility, however, can be exploited for illicit activities, prompting governmental scrutiny and actions like the proposed USDT seizure . The Blockchain Verification Challenge: Is All $1.5 Billion Truly Linked? However, the path to executing such a seizure is fraught with complexities. While the call has been made, the actual enforcement on a decentralized blockchain presents unique hurdles. One of the primary challenges in this intricate situation revolves around verifying the ownership and true links of the identified addresses. Blockchain data firm Elliptic, a key player in crypto analytics, has expressed caution. According to a Decrypt report, Elliptic explained that it could not be certain if all 187 addresses disclosed by Israel are definitively linked to the Iranian military. This uncertainty is critical. In the blockchain world, while transactions are public, identifying the real-world entities behind addresses can be incredibly difficult. Misattributing funds could lead to significant legal and ethical complications. Therefore, thorough investigation and irrefutable evidence are paramount before any large-scale USDT seizure can proceed effectively. The process of tracing funds across various addresses and exchanges requires sophisticated tools and expertise. It often involves: Advanced analytics: Using specialized software to follow transaction trails and identify patterns. Exchange cooperation: Requiring centralized exchanges to identify account holders associated with specific addresses. International collaboration: Working with global law enforcement agencies to share intelligence and coordinate actions. Global Implications of the Proposed USDT Seizure If this proposed USDT seizure moves forward, it will undoubtedly send ripples across the global cryptocurrency landscape. It signifies a growing trend where national security concerns are increasingly impacting the operation and perception of digital assets. This event could potentially influence how other nations approach crypto regulation and enforcement, setting a new benchmark for international cooperation in combating illicit crypto finance. For stablecoin issuers like Tether, this situation presents a delicate balance. While they often cooperate with law enforcement, the decentralized nature of blockchain means that ‘seizing’ funds isn’t as simple as freezing a bank account. It typically involves instructing the issuer to blacklist specific addresses, rendering the tokens unusable and effectively taking them out of circulation. The incident also highlights the ongoing debate about the role of stablecoins in international finance. Are they merely tools for legitimate transactions, or can they become conduits for illicit activities? The answer often lies in the robust anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) policies implemented by exchanges and service providers, alongside the capabilities of blockchain intelligence firms to track suspicious movements. Israel’s call for a $1.5 billion USDT seizure linked to Iran’s IRGC is a landmark event in the intersection of national security and cryptocurrency. While the intention to curb terror financing is clear, the practicalities of execution and the challenges of blockchain verification remain significant. This situation serves as a powerful reminder of the evolving regulatory landscape for digital assets and the complex dance between state control and decentralized finance. The outcome of this unprecedented request will undoubtedly shape future policies and enforcement actions globally, making this a pivotal moment for crypto security and international relations. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is USDT? A1: USDT, or Tether, is a stablecoin designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to the US dollar. It’s widely used for trading and transfers within the cryptocurrency ecosystem due to its price stability. Q2: What is the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)? A2: The IRGC is a branch of Iran’s armed forces, designated as a terrorist organization by several countries, including the United States. It plays a significant role in Iran’s military, political, and economic spheres. Q3: How can cryptocurrencies be ‘seized’? A3: Seizing cryptocurrencies typically involves a legal process where authorities compel a stablecoin issuer (like Tether) or a centralized exchange to blacklist specific wallet addresses. This action prevents the tokens at those addresses from being transferred or used, effectively freezing them. Q4: What are the main challenges in executing a large-scale crypto seizure like this? A4: Key challenges include accurately verifying the ownership of blockchain addresses, overcoming the decentralized nature of crypto to enforce freezes, and ensuring international cooperation from exchanges and other jurisdictions. The anonymity of some crypto transactions also adds complexity. Q5: What does this event mean for the future of crypto regulation? A5: This event highlights the growing need for clearer international regulations regarding cryptocurrencies, especially concerning national security and illicit finance. It suggests increased scrutiny on stablecoins and greater collaboration among governments and blockchain intelligence firms to track and mitigate risks.
