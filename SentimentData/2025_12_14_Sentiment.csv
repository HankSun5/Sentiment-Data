Lawmakers are pushing to integrate digital assets into retirement planning . This move could redefine how long-term capital interacts with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and XRP. What once sat at the financial margins is now approaching the system’s core. The debate is no longer centered on hype or short-term trading. Instead, it focuses on structure, regulation, and long-horizon portfolio construction. Retirement accounts sit at the heart of America’s financial system. Any change here carries lasting consequences. Congress Turns Up Pressure on the SEC According to commentary shared by Pumpius on X, Congress is now urging SEC Chair Paul Atkins to act decisively . Lawmakers want crypto exposure permitted within 401(k) retirement accounts under regulated frameworks. This pressure aligns with broader efforts to modernize U.S. financial infrastructure. The push follows mounting concern that existing rules lag behind market reality. Digital assets have matured beyond speculative experiments. Institutional custody, compliance standards, and regulated products now exist at scale. XRP & BTC ARE COMING TO 410(k) RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS. Congress is now urging SEC Chair Atkins to immediately allow crypto exposure inside 401(k) retirement accounts. This is not about speculation It is about integrating digital assets into long term, regulated retirement… pic.twitter.com/MSvhbuInAe — Pumpius (@pumpius) December 13, 2025 Policy Momentum Behind the Shift Momentum accelerated after President Donald Trump signed an executive order in August 2025. The order directed regulators to expand access to alternative assets in retirement plans. Cryptocurrencies were explicitly included in that mandate. Shortly afterward, the Department of Labor withdrew its earlier cautionary guidance on crypto in 401(k)s. This withdrawal removed a key deterrent for plan fiduciaries. While not an endorsement, it restored regulatory neutrality. Congress has since reinforced this direction through formal correspondence. A bipartisan letter urged the SEC to update securities rules accordingly. Lawmakers framed crypto inclusion as a matter of market fairness and investor choice. Why Bitcoin and XRP Stand Out Not all digital assets are positioned equally for retirement inclusion. Bitcoin benefits from unmatched liquidity, global recognition, and established institutional products. XRP, meanwhile, stands out for regulatory clarity and financial infrastructure integration. Assets suited for retirement portfolios must meet strict criteria. They require deep liquidity, transparent markets, and institutional-grade custody solutions. Bitcoin and XRP increasingly satisfy these requirements. Their inclusion would likely prioritize modest allocations. The goal is diversification, not concentration. This mirrors how commodities or real estate entered retirement portfolios decades ago. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Trillions in Capital, Quietly Mobilized The U.S. 401(k) system holds over $12 trillion in assets. Even small percentage allocations could unlock enormous capital flows. Unlike speculative capital, retirement funds move slowly and persistently. This type of capital reshapes markets over time. It reduces volatility, deepens liquidity, and strengthens institutional confidence. The impact would be structural, not explosive. Risks, Safeguards, and Fiduciary Responsibility Critics remain cautious, citing volatility and fiduciary duty concerns. These objections center on investor protection, not outright opposition. Regulators are expected to emphasize disclosures, education, and allocation limits. SEC Chair Atkins has previously stressed investor education as essential. Any approval would likely include strict compliance requirements. This approach mirrors how other alternative assets were integrated. From the Margins to the Core Allowing Bitcoin and XRP into 401(k) accounts would mark a historic transition. Crypto would move from optional speculation to recognized financial infrastructure. The implications extend beyond price action. This is about legitimacy, permanence, and systemic integration. If approved, digital assets would become part of how Americans save for retirement. That shift could change markets for decades. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

If buyers hold the ongoing momentum, XMR’s estimated price might increase to the $400 range. Is Monero a good investment? Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality, which has created a strong demand in the market . Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice. Why is XMR up? Monero price analysis shows that XMR saw a sharp drop to $360 after failing to breach the $440 resistance. However, the bulls found support at the level, rising rapidly to $430 mark. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption, as it remains highly speculative . How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2030 suggests a minimum price of $1,048.76 and an average trading price of $1,142.11 . The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,208.35. Will XMR reach $1000? The chances of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinge on various factors, which will influence its future price movements. The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility creating an atmosphere of extreme fear are challenges that monero traders could face that could hinder significant growth. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, many investors have concerns regarding privacy, regulatory scrutiny, and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals, which impact the current Monero sentiment. Monero’s commitment to ring confidential transactions and the broader monero project gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

Monero historic price sentiment XMR price history Monero’s market value has changed dramatically since its launch in 2014, from less than $1 to over $475. May 2021 marked the highest point in Monero’s history. Monero’s price projections revealed the coin’s security. They provide investors with optimism that they will be freed from the persecution of some authorities simply by buying or selling Monero Across 2023, Monero’s price rose by 11.49%. The highest price was $278.56, and the lowest was $114.16. In January 2024, Monero stayed stable around the $150.00 mark as market momentum remained low. However, the stability was short-lived as February crashed to $101.95. However, XMR showed swift recovery as it closed the month near the $150.00 level again. In March and April 2024, XMR saw a steady decline from $150.00 to $120.00, where it found key support. In May 2024, XMR observed steady bullish pressure as the price rose from $120.00, approaching resistance at $150. In June 2024, Monero (XMR) traded within the $150 – $175 price range as either side struggled to make a clear breakthrough. In July, the crypto traded around the $155 mark as the price volatility remained relatively low. XMR opened trading at $156.05 in August and ended the month at $176.00, making remarkable gains. September was bearish for the asset, as the price declined below the $160 mark by the end of the month. In October, Monero observed a steep crash and has been making a swift recovery since then. In December, Monero made remarkable strides as the asset’s price broke past the $220 mark, albeit briefly as it closed the month below $200. In January, Monero saw a bullish January as the price rose from below the $200 mark to $238 by the end of the month. In February, the price fell towards the $215 mark as bears dominate the markets. In March, the price observes mixed momentum and closed the month slightly below $215. In April the consolidation continued until late into the month when it spiked past the $325 mark before ending the month around $275. In May the price continued rising rapidly as the bulls cruised past $300 ending the month around $320. During June the price continued to observe high volatility but observed low net change as the asset closed the month around $313. In July the price saw a huge spike in volatility as the price rose past $340 but the asset closed the month below the $310 mark. In August the price declined rapidly falling to the $260 mark by the month’s end. In September, the price rose to the $340 and while it did not maintain the level but managed to close the month above the $320 mark. In October the price continued to rise ending the month above the $340 mark, a trend separating it from most other cryptocurrencies that saw a decline during the period. In November, the bullish rally continued with XMR crossing the $400 mark by the end of the month.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XMR|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-13 20:40:00

The foundation, which is building what it describes as the world’s first decentralized and open AI operating system, reported that an attacker stole 520,010 $0G tokens that were later bridged out and routed through Tornado Cash. Additional losses included 9.93 ether and roughly $4,200 in USDT, bringing the total confirmed loss to around $520,000 at the time of the theft. Exploit traced to leaked private key According to the foundation , the attacker exploited an emergency withdrawal function in the affected reward contract after gaining access to a private key that had been inadvertently stored on a compromised cloud server. The key was linked to an Alibaba Cloud instance responsible for managing NFT status and reward updates. “The attacker accessed a leaked private key from an AliCloud instance,” the foundation said, adding that storing plaintext private keys locally was a critical operational failure, saying, “this is a practice we now know must never happen again.” Further investigation revealed that the breach was not limited to a single server. The foundation said multiple AliCloud instances were compromised after attackers exploited a critical vulnerability in the popular Next.js web framework, tracked as CVE-2025-66478, on December 5. Using internal IP addresses, the attacker was able to move laterally across systems, affecting a wide range of services. These included the alignment service, a validator node, the Gravity NFT service, node sale infrastructure, and several ecosystem products such as Compute, Aiverse, Perpdex, and Ascend. However, the foundation has maintained that no additional losses tied directly to user-held assets have been identified. CertiK, a blockchain security firm, flagged the suspicious withdrawals from a 0G-related reward contract earlier, estimating losses in line with figures that were later confirmed by the foundation. What’s next for 0G Foundation? 0G foundation claims that it has implemented immediate security measures. The organization has also patched the Next.js vulnerability and rebuilt affected services. As part of what 0G said it is doing to prevent a repeat incident, the foundation claims it will migrate all key-bearing services to Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), implement multi-signature wallet requirements for critical fund management, and adopt zero-trust security principles across its infrastructure. The hack incident that 0G Foundation reported comes after it raised over $290 million in November 2024, including a $40 million seed funding round led by Hack VC with participation from Delphi Ventures, OKX Ventures, Samsung Next, Animoca Brands, among other investors. That raise made it $325 million in committed funding for the platform. 0G conceded that the breach is “a painful but necessary wake-up call.” It also promised to release a full post-mortem report, which its community can look forward to knowing more about how the foundation lost $520,000 to bad actors.

The project’s initial funding round hit its cap in less than two weeks, securing a solid $500,000 and proving that investor appetite is substantial. This powerful momentum has carried directly into Phase 2, which has already generated $800,000 by selling 13 million tokens . With the current supply dwindling fast, analysts are forecasting an imminent transition to Phase 3. This shift represents a critical juncture for investors looking to enter before the price climbs higher. Avalanche Integrates Payments, GeeFi Delivers Total Financial Freedom Avalanche is making strides with stablecoin payments at Union Square Market and securing RWA tokenization partnerships in Hong Kong. While Avalanche builds infrastructure for traditional finance, GeeFi is capturing users by offering immediate, user-centric financial tools. The ecosystem is anchored by a non-custodial decentralized exchange (DEX), designed to ensure that traders retain absolute control over their private keys. This architecture eliminates third-party custody risks, providing a secure environment where asset ownership remains strictly with the user at all times, independent of centralized entities. Beyond secure trading, GeeFi is actively bridging the gap between digital wealth and real-world spending through its upcoming Crypto Cards. Developed in collaboration with payment giants VISA and Mastercard, these cards will allow holders to use their crypto assets at millions of merchant locations globally. This real-world application is bolstered by the GEE token’s deflationary model. A systematic burn mechanism continuously removes tokens from circulation, creating inherent scarcity that is designed to drive value upward as the platform’s user base expands and transaction volume increases. A Financial Structure Engineered for Massive ROI The economic model of the GeeFi presale is attracting significant capital from investors looking for outsized returns. Currently in Phase 2, GEE tokens are priced at a highly accessible $0.06 . This entry point is strategically set against a confirmed exchange listing price of $0.40 , locking in a 667% return for early supporters the moment the token hits public markets. The long-term outlook is even more impressive. With analysts projecting a future valuation of $2 per token, a $1,600 investment made today could grow to $60,000 , representing a staggering 3,233% ROI . The market has responded with overwhelming enthusiasm. With over 13 million tokens already sold and $800,000 raised in Phase 2 alone, the momentum is undeniable. This rapid accumulation has led experts to predict that the current phase will conclude ahead of schedule. Adding to the urgency are persistent reports of upcoming listings on top-tier centralized exchanges. Such events historically serve as powerful catalysts for price appreciation, further validating the project’s trajectory and potential for substantial market impact once public trading begins. Maximize Your Holdings with High-Yield Staking GeeFi offers more than just the potential for asset appreciation; it provides a robust mechanism for generating consistent passive income via its staking program. Accessed through the user-friendly GeeFi Wallet, the system features multiple tiers to accommodate various investment horizons. A flexible, no-lock tier delivers a solid 10% APR for those prioritizing liquidity. For investors willing to commit for fixed durations, the returns increase significantly: 15% APR for one month , 22% APR for three months , and an exceptional 55% APR for a twelve-month term . Additionally, the platform incentivizes growth through a referral program, granting a 5% bonus on contributions made via personal links. The Window for Early Entry Is Closing Rapidly GeeFi is distinguishing itself as a high-potential contender in the crypto space, backed by concrete utility and a strategic financial model. This presale represents a fleeting chance to secure a stake in a rapidly expanding ecosystem before it gains widespread mainstream recognition.

Interestingly, the “king of altcoins” is now barely hanging on to the psychological $3,000 price level. On Friday, December 12, the crypto market felt a wave of bearish pressure, with most large-cap assets witnessing significant price corrections on the day. According to the latest on-chain data, the Ethereum market appears to be experiencing heavy selling pressure. Ethereum Taker Volume Sees Notable Spike In a new post on the X platform, crypto analyst Maartunn revealed that the Ethereum price has been a victim of heavy selling pressure in the past day. This observation was based on the Taker Sell Volume metric, which saw a significant increase on Friday. This on-chain metric estimates the total volume of sell orders filled by takers in perpetual swaps of a particular cryptocurrency (Ethereum, in this case). In crypto trading, a taker refers to a market participant who fills an existing order in an exchange’s order book. Maartunn highlighted that the Taker Sell Volume across all centralized exchanges saw a notable uptick on Friday. Data from CryptoQuant shows that the metric rose to as high as 124.2 million ETH on the day. According to Maartunn, this significant spike in the Ethereum Taker Sell Volume is a clear sign of aggressive selling in the market. This level of selling activity put bearish pressure on the Ethereum price, explaining the latest correction to $3,000. 60,000 ETH Flows Into Centralized Exchanges Another on-chain signal that supports the theory of increased selling in the Ethereum market is the exchange inflow metric. According to data shared by Ali Martinez, significant amounts of ETH tokens have found their way onto centralized exchanges in the past day. Santiment data shows that 60,000 ETH tokens, worth approximately $200 million, flowed onto exchanges on Friday. As expected, this inflow activity led to a spike in the Ethereum supply on exchanges and the open market. With no adequate demand to mop up this increasing supply, this rising exchange inflow only puts downward pressure on the Ethereum price. As of this writing, ETH is valued at around $3,080, reflecting an over 4% decline in the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|ETH|ethereum price|Ethereum Taker Sell Volume|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-13 21:00:03

A new technical analysis highlights a roadmap with key recovery levels and outlines a potential timeframe when selling and profit-taking may become favorable. Dogecoin Triangle Pattern Signals Recovery Path In a recent X post, crypto analyst Jonathan Carter presented a new analysis of Dogecoin’s price action, predicting that a potential recovery may be imminent. Carter explained that Dogecoin is currently testing a critical support area around $0.135 within a long-standing descending triangle chart structure. The setup is unfolding over the 3-day timeframe, with price action remaining above the pattern’s lower boundary. This zone has become a key battlefield between buyers and sellers. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin Waking Up? Critical On-Chain Metric Explodes Higher Carter highlights that the ongoing support area offers a favorable risk-reward profile for market participants. Buyers stepping in at this level are attempting to prevent a breakdown that could invalidate the broader recovery outlook. This means holding above this support zone could keep Dogecoin’s bullish scenario intact. The descending triangle visible on the analyst’s shared chart shows a series of lower highs pressing against the stable support zone at $0.135. This compression often precedes a decisive move once the price reacts strongly at the base. Dogecoin’s current structure also suggests the market is steadily approaching that inflection point. The volume data at the bottom of the chart has yet to show strong expansion near the support area. This indicates that Dogecoin’s trading activity has been relatively muted, suggesting that the market may be waiting for confirmation before committing to a significant upward move. If Dogecoin successfully rebounds from the $0.135 support zone, Carter’s chart maps out several upside levels to watch. Initial recovery targets are seen around $0.155 and $0.190, where previous price reactions occurred. Clearing these levels would signal growing momentum and a possible end to DOGE’s downtrend. Further upside extensions projected on the chart include $0.250 and $0.310, which align with previous consolidation areas. A stronger continuation could open the path toward $0.370 and ultimately the resistance zone near $0.470. Resistance Zone Reveals When To Sell DOGE Carter’s Dogecoin chart clearly shows the $0.47 resistance zone, where sellers are expected to become active again. A rally into the zone would likely face increased selling pressure based on historical price behaviour. As a result, the resistance area serves as a strategic level for profit-taking rather than for new entries in Dogecoin. Related Reading: Binance’s USD1 Stablecoin Push Deepens Relationship With Trump’s Crypto Platform Overall, Carter’s analysis suggests that Dogecoin’s price is sitting at a pivotal technical level that could shape its next major move. The meme coin’s price is currently down, having crashed by over 22% year-to-date, according to CoinMarketCap. Despite this slip, Carter remains optimistic about DOGE’s recovery path. The recovery timeline highlighted in the analysis suggests that by 2026, the meme coin may have emerged from its downturn.

The project’s initial offering was a resounding triumph, with Phase 1 clearing its entire supply of 10 million tokens and securing $500,000 in just over one week. This early momentum has only intensified, propelling total funding beyond the $1 million mark, supported by a growing network of over 2,400 holders . As a decentralized ecosystem focused on user autonomy, GeeFi is resonating with those seeking alternatives to centralized control. Market experts now predict that Phase 3 could sell out in under 10 days , driven by increasing speculation regarding imminent exchange listings. Solana’s Institutional Adoption Paves the Way for GeeFi’s Utility The blockchain sector is witnessing a shift toward high-value, real-world applications. Solana has recently facilitated a massive $50 million commercial paper issuance by JPMorgan, proving that public blockchains can handle institutional finance. Additionally, Raise Network has launched programmable gift cards on Solana, bridging digital assets with retail commerce. While Solana demonstrates the power of blockchain infrastructure, GeeFi is delivering a complete consumer-facing financial ecosystem. Central to this vision is the GeeFi Wallet , a non-custodial mobile application that gives users absolute ownership of their private keys, offering security that centralized exchanges cannot provide. The app is already available on Android , with iOS availability coming soon. The ecosystem also features a powerful Decentralized Exchange (DEX) that connects 14+ networks , allowing users to swap assets fluidly across chains. Furthermore, the GeeFi Crypto Card will soon empower users to spend their holdings globally via the VISA and Mastercard networks. Securing a Strategic Position in Phase 2 The current GeeFi presale phase offers a rare chance to enter a high-potential project at a favorable valuation. In Phase 2 , tokens are priced at just $0.06 . This price point is generating significant demand because the confirmed listing price of $0.40 locks in a substantial 667% ROI for early buyers the moment trading begins. The upside is clear: a $1,200 allocation today could grow to $40,000 if the GEE token reaches a conservative $2 valuation , delivering a 3,233% return . With Phase 2 now 80% sold out , representing $800,000 raised from 13 million tokens sold, the inventory available at this price is diminishing quickly. Maximizing Portfolio Growth with High-Yield Staking GeeFi distinguishes itself by offering robust avenues for passive income, ensuring that long-term holders are rewarded. The platform provides industry-leading staking returns, including a massive 55% APR for investors who lock their GEE tokens for 12 months. For those requiring shorter commitment periods, GeeFi offers 22% APR for three months and 15% APR for one month. Additionally, the platform features a flexible staking option offering 10% APR with no lock-up requirement, allowing users to earn yield while maintaining full access to their funds. Community expansion is further encouraged through a rewarding referral program , which grants a 5% bonus in GEE tokens for every purchase made via a user’s unique referral link. This incentivizes users to help grow the ecosystem organically. The Next Major Crypto Opportunity Is Here Every market cycle reveals a handful of projects that redefine wealth for their early adopters, and GeeFi is exhibiting all the signals of a breakout success. Its impressive presale speed, combined with a roadmap of functional products, sets it apart from hype-driven tokens. Analysts are increasingly identifying GeeFi as a potential 100x gem , citing its strong utility and the massive ROI built into its presale structure. This is the final moment to acquire tokens at a foundational price before major exchange listings potentially send the value skyrocketing. With Phase 2 nearing its conclusion, acting now is essential to capitalize on this opportunity.

Tether puts out an all-cash proposal to buy Exor’s 65.4% stake for €2.66 per share, valuing the club at around €1.1 billion. The offer gives Juventus a 21% premium over its Friday close in Milan. Tether also says it will add €1 billion for club development and promises to buy all remaining shares at a price “at least equal” to its initial offer. Exor rejected the proposal right away. Exor says the board “unanimously rejects” the bid. John Elkann, the company’s Chief Executive Officer, says, “Juventus has been part of my family for 102 years,” and adds that four generations “have grown it, strengthened it, cared for it in difficult moments and celebrated it in happy ones.” John also says, “Juventus — our history, our values — is not for sale.” Agnellis holds Juventus while Tether increases pressure The bid shows up while the Agnellis look at possible disposals, including a review of Gedi Gruppo Editoriale, but Juventus is not part of that process. The family has controlled the team for more than a hundred years. The timing also meets Juventus at a difficult moment. The club sits seventh in Serie A and risks missing European competition, which would hit media and commercial income. The team has not matched the level it had during its run of nine straight Serie A titles, which ended in 2021. The problems extend beyond the pitch. In 2023, Italy’s football federation took 10 points off Juventus after an investigation into how it accounted for player transfers. Juventus shares have fallen 27% this year. None of this stops Tether. The crypto company now owns 11.5% of the team, a stake it built starting in February, and wants total control. Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s Chief Executive Officer, says, “For me, Juventus has always been part of my life. I grew up with this team.” Paolo also says communication between shareholders has been “very, very limited.” Tether brings cash while Exor keeps its identity The gap between the two sides is wide. Exor has a net asset value of €36.4 billion and holds Ferrari, Stellantis, and Christian Louboutin. Juventus represents a small slice of Exor’s overall value. Tether comes from a totally different background. It started in 2014, operated with no public offices for years, and opened its official headquarters in El Salvador in January. The company has no independent board and shares little about its structure. Even with that, Tether earns a huge profit. USDT, the stablecoin, is the most used token in crypto. Tether’s latest attestation shows $181 billion in assets, including $135 billion in US Treasuries. Profit passes $10 billion in the first nine months of 2025. Tether also invests in areas like AI and agriculture as it expands beyond crypto.

A colossal sum of 204,079,817 USDT, valued at approximately $204 million, was transferred from an unknown wallet directly to the major exchange OKX. This single USDT transfer represents one of the most significant stablecoin movements recently, prompting immediate questions about its origin and intent. What does such a massive movement of capital signal for the market? What Does This Massive USDT Transfer Actually Mean? First, let’s break down the basics. USDT, or Tether, is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. A transfer of this magnitude from a private, unknown wallet to a centralized exchange like OKX is a classic “whale” activity. Typically, such moves precede major trading decisions. The holder could be preparing to: Execute a large buy order for other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Provide liquidity for institutional or over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks. Redeem USDT for fiat currency , though this is less common directly via an exchange wallet. Simply move funds for safekeeping or to take advantage of exchange-specific services. This specific USDT transfer highlights the immense scale at which major players operate, often moving sums that rival traditional finance transactions with the click of a button. Why Should Everyday Crypto Investors Care? You might wonder why a single transaction between two wallets matters. The truth is, whale movements are powerful market indicators. A deposit of this size can signal incoming volatility. If the whale uses these funds to purchase a large amount of Bitcoin, the sudden buy pressure could push prices upward. Conversely, if they are moving to sell another asset, it could indicate a bearish outlook. Therefore, monitoring large USDT transfers to exchanges is a common practice for analysts trying to gauge market sentiment. Moreover, this event underscores the transparency of blockchain technology. While the wallet owner remains unknown, the transaction itself is public, verifiable, and instantaneous. This level of visibility is unprecedented in traditional finance, where such large transfers would be private bank affairs. Could This USDT Transfer Impact Market Stability? The sheer size of this transaction naturally leads to questions about Tether’s stability and liquidity. Moving $204 million in one go is a strong testament to the operational capacity of the Tether network and the depth of its reserves. It demonstrates that the stablecoin can handle enormous settlements without a hitch, which should bolster confidence among users. However, it also places a spotlight on the concentration of wealth—or “whale dominance”—within the crypto ecosystem. A single entity capable of moving such funds holds significant potential influence over short-term market dynamics. For the market to mature further, a broader, more distributed holder base is ultimately healthier. Decoding the Signal: What’s Next After the Deposit? The critical question everyone is asking is: “What will the whale do next?” The funds are now on an exchange, poised for action. The community and trading algorithms will watch OKX’s order books closely for unusually large buy walls in assets like BTC or ETH. This USDT transfer is not an endpoint; it’s the prelude to a potentially market-moving event. The coming days may reveal whether this capital is deployed aggressively or sits idle, each scenario telling a different story about institutional confidence. Conclusion: A Reminder of Crypto’s Scale and Transparency This $204 million USDT transfer is more than just a big number. It is a compelling case study in blockchain’s power, market psychology, and the evolving landscape of digital finance. It reminds us that the crypto market operates 24/7 with staggering sums, visible to all. While the ultimate purpose of this move remains shrouded in mystery, its detection and analysis showcase the sophisticated tools and keen interest driving this industry forward. For savvy observers, understanding the flow of stablecoins like USDT is key to understanding the market’s next move. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Whale Alert? A1: Whale Alert is a popular blockchain tracking service that monitors and reports large cryptocurrency transactions, typically those exceeding $1 million, across various networks. Q2: Why transfer to an exchange like OKX? A2: Centralized exchanges like OKX are the primary venues for converting crypto to other assets or fiat. Large deposits often precede major trades, as exchanges offer the necessary liquidity and trading pairs. Q3: Can we find out who owns the unknown wallet? A3: While the wallet address is public, the owner’s identity is pseudonymous and unknown unless they voluntarily disclose it or are linked through other means. Blockchain analysis can sometimes connect addresses to known entities. Q4: Does a large USDT transfer affect its price peg? A4: Typically, no. A simple transfer between wallets does not create or destroy USDT. The peg is maintained by Tether’s reserve management. Large-scale minting or burning of USDT is more relevant to the peg’s stability. Q5: Should I change my investment strategy based on this? A5: Single whale movements are data points, not standalone signals. They should be considered alongside broader market trends, news, and your own investment goals. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on one transaction. Q6: How common are transfers of this size? A6: Multi-million dollar transfers are relatively common, especially involving stablecoins and between institutional wallets and exchanges. However, a $200M+ transfer is notable and less frequent.

A federal jury found the 48-year-old director guilty of multiple counts of wire fraud and money laundering, after prosecutors said he siphoned the funds for personal use, including high-risk stock trades, cryptocurrency investments, luxury cars, watches, and five-star hotel stays in California and Spain. The series, originally titled “White Horse” and later renamed “Conquest,” had already received roughly $44 million in earlier funding. Rinsch began filming six short-form episodes with support from his mentor, Keanu Reeves, before pitching the project to studios. Between late 2019 and early 2020, he requested an additional $11 million to finish production. Prosecutors said he transferred the funds into personal accounts, losing about half through risky investments, then used the remaining funds on cryptocurrency and lavish spending. Court documents show he bought five Rolls-Royces, a Ferrari, high-end watches and clothing, luxury mattresses and bedding, and repaid $1.8 million in personal credit card debt, all with money Netflix believed was meant for the series. Rinsch argued at trial that the dispute was contractual and that he considered the payments as reimbursement for work already completed. US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Jay Clayton said the conviction comes after a one-week trial before US District Judge Jed S. Rakoff. He added, “Carl Erik Rinsch took $11 million meant for a TV show and gambled it on speculative stock options and crypto transactions. Today’s conviction shows that when someone steals from investors, we will follow the money and hold them accountable.” The charges carry maximum penalties of a total of 90 years in prison, although the actual sentence is expected to be shorter. Rinsch is scheduled to be sentenced on April 17, 2026. Rinsch was arrested in March this year in West Hollywood, California. Earlier reports suggest that he invested in popular meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE) and made $27 million in profits.

According to the commentators of the market, a number of early indications are indicating that this DeFi token is likely to see another huge jump and some of the forecasts are up to 800% in case the momentum is maintained. The initial investor enthusiasm suggests that the project structure and collaboration in developmental growth can be used as the basis of growth in the long term. Presale Progress and What Mutuum Finance is Building Mutuum Finance (MUTM) had its presale in early 2025, that was at $0.01 per MUTM. It is currently priced at $0.035 which is a 2.5x increment within six steps. The project raised over $19.30M, has risen to 18400 holders and sold 820M tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a DeFi lending protocol that is based on structured borrowing and reliable yield. Suppliers get depositing assets on a liquidity depositor and in return, get an mtToken which increases in value to be redeemed by borrowers paying interest. Collateral backed loans are open to borrowers with LTV and rate models to be determined by the use of the pool. V1 Launch and mtTokens Through its official X announcement , Mutuum Finance clarified a V1 will be used on the Sepolia Testnet, in Q4 2025. V1 has the liquidity pool, the mtToken system, Liquidator Bot and Debt Token. The initial assets will consist of ETH and USDT. The design of Mutuum Finance has mtTokens at the centre. They get redeemable worth as the interest gets added to the protocol. This links the incentive of users to actual borrowing components instead of the inflation. The support is furthered by a buy-and-distribute mechanism. A percentage of protocol revenue is spent to purchase MUTM in the marketplace. MUTM is bought on the open market and distributed to users who stake the mtTokens in the safety module. This unrelenting purchasing pressure, according to various observers, would help the price to go up as the platform usage increases. Considering these constituents, there is a bullish case on which some analysts map that MUTM might increase by a number of times relative to its present value. The long-term forecast indicates upside potential of up to 800% is achievable in case there is increase in borrowing demand following activation of V1. Layer-2 Expansion and Oracle Design Mutuum Finance will natively create an interest-based stablecoin according to the official roadmap. This stable coin is used as a way of creating internal demand and borrowing liquidity. Analysts believe that stablecoins pegged to real activity are better in increasing the stability of the system in the long term. Expansion on layer 2 is also scheduled. L2 network operating reduces expenses, speeds up processing and Emma allows greater borrowing capacity. The cheap cost will facilitate more uses thereby creating an opportunity towards growth to the mtTokens and the buy-and-distribute cycle. The protocol will be based on Chainlink oracles, fallback feeds and aggregated data to have the right valuations. The features are useful in eliminating the likelihood of inaccurate liquidations as well as ensuring stable lending circumstances. As these developments enter progression, analysts paint a second picture according to which MUTM may increase several hundred percent after its launch price as the stable coin and L2 plans enter the picture. Other models present potential growth as high as 800% in prolonged bullish situations. Building Security Foundations and Community Activity Mutuum Finance has security as one of its key concerns. The project is rated as 90/100 Token Scan successful and CertiK audit and the finished code is being analyzed by Halborn Security . The group also introduced a $50K bug bounty to identify code weaknesses early. The 24-hours leader board has increased community activity, as the highest daily contributor is awarded $500 of MUTM. The card payment support will make new users have less difficulty when buying the token and contribute to fueling consistent participation in the latent presale stages. With investors scouting new opportunities in existing crypto that have solid foundations, Mutuum Finance remains in focus due to its roadmap clarity, initial traction and capabilities that are future-oriented in offering decentralized lending.

GeeFi is leading this charge, having concluded a spectacular Phase 1 that distributed 10 million tokens and secured $500,000 from a dedicated group of over 2,400 investors . This momentum has only intensified, with the project now celebrating total sales exceeding 13 million tokens and raising more than $800K . As Phase 2 officially surpasses the 80% completion mark , this non-custodial ecosystem is proving its resilience and appeal. Market analysts are confidently predicting that Phase 3 will vanish in under 10 days , fueled by intensifying speculation regarding imminent listings on top-tier centralized exchanges. Moving Past Meme Coins for Utility-Driven Growth Shiba Inu (SHIB) is signaling a potential rebound, with whales accumulating supply and technical patterns pointing toward a rally to $0.000010 . However, smart money is increasingly rotating into GeeFi , a robust infrastructure project that experts are widely recognizing as 2026’s 100x gem . Unlike speculative assets reliant on social sentiment, GeeFi delivers a comprehensive solution for managing digital wealth. Its unified dashboard connects over 14 distinct networks , allowing users to bridge and swap assets instantly without navigating complex and fragmented DeFi interfaces. The GeeFi Team started development in 2023 and strategically launched in 2024 with a product-first philosophy. This ensures that investors are backing a fully operational platform rather than a mere concept. Built on a foundation of self-sovereignty, the ecosystem guarantees that users retain exclusive control over their private keys at all times. With a live Android application and an iOS version nearing release, GeeFi is delivering real-world utility today. This commitment to execution reinforces the growing conviction that it is indeed 2026’s 100x gem . Capitalize on the GeeFi Presale Advantage GeeFi is currently advancing through Phase 2 of its presale, where GEE tokens are available for just $0.06 . This entry price secures an immediate, guaranteed 667% return based on the confirmed listing price of $0.40 . The upside potential is staggering; a strategic investment of $1,800 today could balloon to $90,000 if the token hits the $3 valuation projected by analysts, delivering a massive 4,900% ROI . Demand continues to surge, as Phase 2 has now surpassed 80% , accumulating over $800K in funding through the sale of 13 million tokens . Industry observers are praising the presale’s structure and predict that Phase 3 will launch next week and sell out with extreme speed due to the rumors of major exchange listings. This overwhelming demand is a clear indicator that GeeFi is positioning itself as 2026’s 100x gem . Maximize Earnings via Staking and Referrals A major factor driving GeeFi’s sticky liquidity is its high-yield staking protocol, designed to reward long-term holders. Investors can lock their GEE tokens to earn 15% APR for one month , 22% APR for three months , or a dominant 55% APR for a 12-month duration . For those who require flexibility, a liquid staking tier offers up to 10% APR with no locked liquidity , ensuring funds remain accessible. To further accelerate adoption, GeeFi has implemented a generous referral initiative. Participants who share their unique invite link earn a 5% bonus in GEE tokens on all purchases made by their network. This mechanism incentivizes community growth and allows early adopters to compound their holdings significantly, creating a powerful cycle of wealth generation. The Window of Opportunity Is Closing Securing a position in a high-utility project before it captures mass market attention is the key to life-changing gains. The GeeFi presale represents a fleeting chance to enter before the wider crypto community reacts. With its deflationary mechanics, a live product ecosystem, and a roadmap that includes a crypto debit card, GeeFi is built for dominance. The rapid pace of token sales signals extreme confidence from smart money investors. As the market gears up for its next major cycle, projects with working products and strong fundamentals will leave speculative tokens behind. Ignoring GeeFi now could result in missed opportunities when it debuts on major exchanges, confirming the forecast that it is 2026’s 100x gem . The moment to act is now. Secure your stake today to capture the explosive upside experts are anticipating.

This development follows initial minor investments, as the USDT issuing company looks to deepen its involvement with the footballing institution. Tether Promises 1 Billion Euros For Sport Development If Bid Succeeds In Feb 2025, Tether announced a minority stake purchase of 8.2% in Juventus FC. The stablecoin issuer described this acquisition as a strategic move to integrate stablecoins and digital assets into everyday life. Two months later, Tether would boost its holdings to 10%, as the company’s CEO and lifetime Juventus supporter, Paolo Ardoino, explained the move as a commitment to long-term innovation. Taking this step further, the USDT operator has submitted an audacious bid to acquire the entire 65.4% controlling stake of the football club from Exor, the listed holding company of the billionaire Italian Agnelli Family. For context, Juventus FC ranks as the third-largest Italian club with a market valuation of $1.87 billion. However, the Old Lady, as it is popularly called, is the most decorated in the land, boasting 71 major honors, which include 36 Serie A championships. While Juventus’ momentum has slowed down in recent years, with its last league-winning campaign coming in 2020, the Italian giant has remained relevant by securing three domestic cup trophies since then. Paolo Ardoino explains that Tether’s objective is to contribute to Juventus’ growth and drive exceptional performance. The Tether CEO said: Tether is in a position of strong financial health and intends to support Juventus with stable capital and a long horizon. Our goal is to make a positive contribution to the club’s future, support its sporting performance at the highest level, and help Juventus continue to grow sustainably in a rapidly evolving global sports and media landscape. To this end, Tether has promised to invest 1 billion Euros in the club if the transaction receives approval from relevant regulatory bodies. However, footballing media The Athletic has reported that sources close to Exor state the Agnelli Family has no intent to divest their stake in Juventus, with the message being “the club is not for sale.” Notably, Juventus represents one of Tether’s investments, which also includes the Italian media company Be Water and the Canadian video platform Rumble. USDT Market Overview At the time of writing, USDT’s total market cap is valued at $186.24 billion, ranking as the largest stablecoin and third-largest cryptocurrency in the world.",Tether (USDT)|controlling stake|Exor|Juventus|stablecoin|Tether|USDT,EN,0,0,MARKET|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-13 23:00:27
55748789,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=866569,1765666842,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/55748789.jpeg,Bitcoin Macro Retracement Meets Mid-Range Battle – Will Bulls Reclaim Momentum?,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-macro-retracement/,"Bitcoin is facing a critical juncture as its macro retracement converges with a tight mid-range battle between $86,000 and $100,000. With bearish patterns confirmed and short-term support holding, the market now waits to see if bulls can reclaim momentum or if a deeper pullback is on the horizon. Bitcoin Confirms Macro Top: Bearish Phase Underway According to an update from Crypto Patel, Bitcoin appears to have confirmed a market top and is now transitioning into a broader macro retracement phase. The loss of a key bullish support level has shifted the market structure into a bearish phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Market Structure Strengthens Despite Slower Trading Activity — Here’s Why The chart shows that a Head and Shoulders formation has fully played out. Classical technical rules suggest that the 162% downside projection has already been achieved, reinforcing the view that a cycle top is in place and a larger trend reversal is underway. Looking at the macro Fibonacci retracement from the bear-market low to the recent peak, several key levels come into focus. These include the 0.382 retracement, which sits near $56,700, and the 0.5 level around $44,000, representing a zone of potential bear-market acceptance. Additionally, the 0.618 retracement near $35,000 stands out as the strongest long-term support area. On the liquidity side, an unfilled fair value gap between $98,000 and $100,000 acts as a magnet for a short-term relief bounce before the broader downtrend resumes. Overall, the macro outlook for Bitcoin remains bearish. While a bounce toward the $98,000–$100,000 region is possible, the dominant path points toward a deeper move into the $70,000–$60,000 Fibonacci supports. Traders are advised to wait for confirmation and remain flexible, respecting multiple scenarios as the market unfolds. BTC Trapped: $96,000–$100,000 Cap Meets $86,000 Support Bitcoin remains range-bound between two critical zones as noted by CyrilXBT. Price is hovering near the $90,300 area after facing another rejection from the $96,000–$100,000 supply zone and the 50-day EMA. This region has consistently capped upside attempts over the past several weeks. Related Reading: Report Reveals 65% Of Bitcoin Treasury Companies Struggling With Major Unrealized Losses On the downside, buyers continue to show up around the $86,000–$88,000 demand zone, preventing the price from slipping into a broader breakdown and keeping BTC locked within its current range. From a broader market perspective, Bitcoin previously cooled off while tech stocks surged. As momentum in tech begins to slow, BTC is attempting to stabilize, but a decisive reclaim of the $96,000–$100,000 zone is still required to shift momentum. A sustained move above $100,000 would open the door to trend reversal. Conversely, a loss of the $88,000 support could expose Bitcoin to a deeper pullback toward the $72,000–$76,000 region. Until either scenario plays out, price action remains choppy, and patience is warranted.

Neuner, widely known on social media as @cryptomanran, has maintained a critical stance toward XRP for several years and has shown little willingness to reconcile with its community. His latest remarks came after a public exchange on X, where he responded to speculation that growing interoperability between the XRP and Solana ecosystems could encourage a more cooperative relationship. Despite these developments, Neuner dismissed the idea outright, signaling that his view of XRP remains unchanged. XRP Gains Access to the Solana Ecosystem The renewed discussion followed a recent announcement by Hex Trust, an institutional digital asset custodian, which confirmed the launch of wrapped XRP (wXRP). This tokenized version of XRP is designed to operate across several blockchain networks, including Solana, Ethereum, Optimism, and HyperEVM. never!!! — Ran Neuner (@cryptomanran) December 12, 2025 Each unit of wXRP is fully backed by the native coin on a one-to-one basis and can be minted or redeemed through regulated custody systems. The wrapped asset is built using LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token standard, a framework intended to support secure cross-chain transfers without relying on traditional bridge infrastructure. As a result, XRP holders now have access to decentralized finance features such as lending platforms, liquidity pools, and yield-generating protocols on networks where the asset was previously unavailable. This development effectively places XRP within Solana’s broader DeFi environment, a move that some observers viewed as a symbolic convergence between two historically distinct communities. In response to this integration, Vibhu Norby, Head of Product Marketing at the Solana Foundation and previously an outspoken critic of XRP, publicly acknowledged the asset’s distinct role in the market. Norby stated that his perspective had evolved over time and that he now recognizes the strength of XRP’s use case and the resilience of its community. This shift prompted crypto investor Pedro Silva to suggest that the changing dynamics might offer an opportunity for Neuner to reassess his relationship with XRP supporters, particularly given his vocal support for Solana. Silva proposed that the presence of XRP within Solana’s ecosystem could serve as common ground. Neuner, however, rejected the suggestion with a brief but decisive response, indicating that he has no intention of softening his stance or engaging with the XRP community. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A History of Skepticism Toward XRP Neuner’s criticism of XRP dates back to at least 2018, following the asset’s sharp decline from its all-time high near $3.30. Over the years, he has repeatedly questioned the valuation model of the asset, its governance structure, and its perceived level of decentralization. While he has occasionally acknowledged positive developments surrounding the asset, particularly after Ripple’s legal victory against the former leadership of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, his broader assessment has remained negative. In early 2022, Neuner compared XRP unfavourably to other digital assets that were gaining traction at the time, including Terra’s LUNA and Solana’s SOL. He questioned why XRP continued to rank above these assets by market capitalization. Notably, LUNA suffered a catastrophic collapse later that year, while XRP retained its position among the leading cryptocurrencies. Neuner also made predictions in 2021 suggesting that XRP would fall out of the top tier of digital assets. Contrary to those forecasts, XRP maintained a strong market ranking and has since moved higher despite prolonged volatility across the sector. Other Critics Have Revised Their Views While Neuner has remained firm, other prominent figures who once dismissed XRP have publicly revised their opinions. Macro investor Raoul Pal acknowledged misjudging XRP after its sharp price appreciation in late 2024 and has since expressed a more favourable outlook. Similarly, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz has stated that XRP’s continued relevance is closely tied to its active global community, later describing it as one of the few crypto assets that has achieved genuine monetary use. Despite these shifts, Neuner’s latest comments suggest that he remains unwilling to reconsider his long-held perspective, even as XRP expands its presence across new blockchain ecosystems.

Burton is now facing 11 federal counts, according to a superseding indictment brought in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, which covers the following: conspiracy to commit wire fraud, two counts of wire fraud, seven counts of money laundering, and one count of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Cryptocurrency services have suffered nearly $3 billion in theft so far in 2025, making this year already more devastating than the entirety of 2024. The DPRK’s $1.5 billion hack of ByBit, the largest single hack in crypto history, accounts for the majority of service losses. By the end of June 2025, 17% more value had been stolen year-to-date (YTD) than in 2022, previously the worst year on record. If current trends continue, stolen funds from services could eclipse $4 billion by year’s end. Expanded federal indictment hits Bitcoin Rodney with 11 charges If convicted on all counts, Burton faces a maximum of 20 years in prison in federal courts for the wire fraud conspiracy and each wire fraud count, plus 10 years for each money laundering count and five years for the unlicensed money transmission offense. The charges represent a significant escalation from Burton’s original criminal complaint, filed in January 2024, which consisted of two counts linked to unlicensed money transmission, each carrying a maximum sentence of five years to be served. Burton was arrested in January 2024 at Miami International Airport carrying a one-way ticket to the United Arab Emirates, and has been detained since a federal judge refused his bail request because he constituted an “extreme flight risk.” $1.8B HyperFund scheme allegedly funded luxury lifestyle, not mining From June 2020 to May 2024, Burton and his co-conspirators managed HyperFund, which prosecutors claimed was a legitimate cryptocurrency investment platform known as HyperVerse, according to court documents. The scheme purportedly offered investors daily returns of 0.5% to 1%, intending to nearly double or triple their initial investments, claiming that investments could be made in vast crypto mining operations. It was a facade, prosecutors say, those mining operations didn’t operate. A superseding indictment alleges that Burton spent proceeds from investors on luxury condominiums, sports cars, and a yacht. Burton’s trial is set for March of next year. Burton maintained an enormous profile in the crypto community, hosting a 2021 Miami event featuring Shark Tank’s Daymond John and singer Akon, and made regular appearances on social media alongside notable figures like Jamie Foxx and Rick Ross. According to court documents, there has been one prior conviction for conspiracy to distribute cocaine. He told court papers that he considered this a bona fide business. Co-founder and Australian entrepreneur Xue Lee, or Sam Lee, he said, constructed an “elaborate deception” to deceive both his investors and Burton himself. Lee and promoter Brenda “Bitcoin Beautee” Chunga were charged with fraud and unregistered security offerings by the SEC in January 2024. Earlier reports indicate that Chunga has agreed to plead guilty, while Lee is still at large. Get seen where it counts.

In this guide, the commission outlines suitable practices and some common risks associated with various methods of storing cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the SEC highlighted the merits and demerits of different crypto custody methods in the bulletin, comparing self-custody with the use of a third-party service to handle digital assets for investors. The SEC’s release of an investor bulletin sparks excitement in the crypto industry The SEC’s recent decision sparked excitement among investors in the crypto ecosystem because it brought up a sense of protective measures set aside specifically for them. For instance, the bulletin noted that if investors opt to use a third-party custodian, they should first ensure they are familiar with the current custodian’s policies. This recommendation meant that investors should gain a clear understanding of whether they “rehypothecate” assets, which occurs when they decide to lend them out, or whether they prefer to integrate client assets into a single pool rather than storing each client’s cryptocurrency in individual accounts. Meanwhile, apart from this recommendation, the federal government agency’s guide also outlined various kinds of crypto wallets, discussing the advantages and disadvantages of hot wallets, which are related to the internet, compared to cold wallets that function as offline storage. In the bulletin, the commission argued that hot wallets expose investors to risks like hacking and cybersecurity threats. For cold wallets, the SEC claimed that they risk irreversible loss in the account of an existing failure in offline storage, if private keys are compromised, or if a device is stolen. Analysts noted that the federal government agency’s crypto custody guide suggests a significant shift in the Commission’s regulatory outlook. To support this claim, reports revealed that there was heightened resistance toward digital assets and the cryptocurrency industry under the leadership of Gary Gensler, a former Chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. On the other hand, sources close to the situation mentioned that Truth For the Commoner (TFTC) reacted to the news regarding the SEC’s guide on crypto custody. Responding, the TFTC stated, “The same agency that spent years trying to shut down the industry is now teaching people how to use it.” As the discussion heated up in the crypto industry, Jake Claver, CEO of Digital Ascension Group, which provides services to family offices, argued that the commission is offering significant value to crypto investors by enlightening potential crypto holders about custody and some suitable practices. Notably, the watchdog’s guide comes just one day after Paul Atkins, the Chairman of the federal government agency, shared that the traditional financial system is moving towards blockchain technology. The DTCC acquires greenlight from the SEC to begin tokenizing financial assets Reports dated Thursday, December 11, noted that the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), an American financial market infrastructure company that provides clearing, settlement, and trade reporting services to financial market participants, received a green light from the SEC permitting it to begin tokenizing financial assets like stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and government debt securities. Regarding this approval, sources familiar with the situation hinted that the commission released a valuable “no-action” letter to a branch of the DTCC. This letter gave the firm the go-ahead to introduce a new service aimed at tokenizing securities. The DTCC also commented on this announcement. The firm announced that the Depository Trust Company (DTC), a subsidiary of the DTCC and the world’s largest securities depository, has secured approval from a federal government agency to officially launch a new service that will convert real-world assets held by DTC into tokens within a controlled production environment. In the meantime, the DTCC intends to tokenize a group of highly liquid assets, including the Russell 1000 index, exchange-traded funds that track major indexes, and US Treasury bills, bonds, and notes. This service is anticipated to be accessible to users in the second half of 2026. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The mood of early investors shows that the interest is fast growing as the project goes through the major stages of its development and prepares to be released in a testnet. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is working on an alternative generation of a DeFi lending protocol that is designed to have a transparent set of mechanics and use cases. The protocol builds two synchronized markets. Under a P2C environment, users are able to deposit assets into a liquidity pool and then receive mtTokens that increase in conclusible worth as borrowers interest repay. Taking a hypothetical scenario as an example, somebody who provides ETH gets mtETH that eventually can be converted back to ETH in proportion to lending activity. The P2P environment favors collateralized borrowing. Borrowers place assets and select loan conditions. Utilization and LTV limits influence the rates and assists in safeguarding the users in the volatile environment of the market. The purpose of those structures is to render the system predictable to both parties in the lending process. On its official X account, Mutuum Finance stated that its V1 testnet will go live in Q4 2025 on the Sepolia network. The products it comes with are the liquidity pool, mtToken engine, Liquidator Bot and Debt Token. Originally supported assets will be ETH and USDT. Presale Growth and Momentum Mutuum Finance is a protocol that has attracted more than 18,400 investors and has raised over $19.30M. According to several analysts, the early involvement is significant as lending policies require good liquidity and general community ratings. The number of holders tends to increase and by the time the platform is operational, then it will have a higher pool participation. At the start of 2025, the MUTM token started with $0.01. It is currently priced at $0.035, which is an increment by 250%. According to many of the traders who follow the best crypto opportunities, this growth is an indicator of consistent demand which has been speared by the roadmap development of the project. Mutuum Finance has a total supply of 4B MUTM, and 1.82B is put aside during the presale. So far, 820M tokens have been sold. Analysts observe that such broad distribution is useful in supporting better liquidity expectation in the initial stage of the market of the project. The protocol offers 24-hour leaderboard, which rewards the most active individual in terms of his or her daily contributions with $500 in MUTM. Such a system maintains a constant user activity and ensures that there is visibility throughout the stage. CertiK Audit and Stablecoin Plans The CertiK audit of Mutuum Finance was rated 90/100 Token Scan, indicating that the code of the smart-contract has undergone a sufficient audit. The review of Halborn Security provides the second layer of verification when the project is ready to be tested in V1. The team is also working on creating a stablecoin pegged on the protocol interest generation. Analysts believe that this stablecoin could offer more liquidity and can grow borrowing activity in the future as it is used more. Phase 6 is in our sight and almost completely allocated. This change of the stage is gaining momentum due to the fact that the subsequent phase presents a price increment to the official launch price. The latest whale entry of approximately $100k gave impetus and indicated greater trust by bigger players. Investors tracking new crypto and the most popular cryptocurrency tendencies indicate that this kind of activity usually manifests itself when someone pays attention to a project just before a significant testnet launch or price change. As a steady development process continues, user engagement is growing, security outcomes are high, and Phase 6 is almost complete, Mutuum Finance is becoming one of the projects among the new cryptocurrency projects that could significantly grow in the coming years. Its 250% growth, growing community and future V1 testnet remain attractive to investors who may want to seek early investment opportunities in the token prior to the token attaining $0.06.

A new long-term technical comparison shared by crypto analyst ChartNerd places XRP’s price behavior since its July all-time high of $3.65 into an interesting context, implying that what XRP is doing now resembles a phase from its 2016 market cycle that points to an incoming huge rally. Related Reading: American Bitcoin Makes Big Buy, Adds 416 BTC To Its Stack Repeating 2016 Rejection And ABC Crash Structure According to crypto analyst ChartNerd, XRP’s current structure matches a similar price action that unfolded in late 2016. when price rejected an accumulation supply block and rolled into an ABC corrective move. That correction ultimately produced a 69% flash-wick decline that extended into the first quarter of 2017. The drop was severe and unfolded over several months, eventually pushing XRP to as low as $0.00240, but it eventually represented the end of the correction rather than the end of the bullish cycle. The chart accompanying the analysis, which is shown below, highlights a similar rejection pattern forming now. This pattern is based on how the XRP price rejected at its most recent all-time high in July. Since then, the monthly price chart has been printing consecutive red candles, with monthly closes consistently below opens. At the time of writing, XRP is about a 44% correction from this all-time high. This means a 69% correction is yet to play out in its entirety. Therefore, if history repeats, a full 69% ABC-style move from the all-time high would drag XRP back below $1 and as low as $0.8. This move is expected to play out into the first quarter of 2026. XRP Price Chart. Source: @ChartNerdTA Potential Drop Could Be A Set-Up For A Much Larger Rally XRP is currently trading at $2.04. Therefore, a deeper pullback below $1 will translate to a 51% decrease from the current price action. The idea of a deeper pullback from $2 is tough to imagine, especially given the inflows into Spot XRP ETFs. In fact, a pullback of that magnitude could test conviction across the market and cause many bullish traders to step aside. However, the technical analysis frames it as a structural reset rather than anything else. In 2017, the post-crash consolidation laid the groundwork for one of XRP’s most explosive rallies on record, ultimately delivering gains in excess of 110,000%. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin Waking Up? Critical On-Chain Metric Explodes Higher If this sequence plays out as expected, then the real bullish opportunity would develop later in 2026. From that reset zone, the chart projects a long-term advance to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension, placing a potential upside target around $27. The visual projection in the chart above shows a clean multi-month expansion zone that delivers a 2,300% gain after the corrective phase.

Short-term holders, which are classified as addresses holding BTC for only one to three months, spent most of the year in the green amidst the push to multiple all-time highs and ensuing drawdowns throughout the year. On-chain data from 2025 now provides a clearer answer to whether short-term exposure to Bitcoin actually paid off for holders, even though conditions look far less comfortable at the time of writing. Short-Term Holders Spent Most Of 2025 In Profit According to data from on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, Bitcoin short-term holders were in a profitable position for roughly two-thirds of 2025. On-chain profit and loss data shows that this cohort was in profit for about 66% of trading days, which translates to about 230 trading days. During the first half of 2025, Bitcoin’s price frequently traded above the average realized price of short-term holders, allowing recent buyers to lock in gains even as volatility remained elevated. This pattern became especially visible during mid-year rallies, when Bitcoin pushed above the $100,000 region and short-term profit margins expanded sharply. Each time the price reclaimed levels above the short-term realized price, realized gains dominated the distribution. Back in January, Bitcoin maintained a position above the short-term cost basis for nearly two consecutive months, creating the first extended window of sustained profitability for this cohort in 2025. A similar, and even more pronounced, phase unfolded between May and October, when short-term holders sat on substantial unrealized gains. During this period, the profit-and-loss margin climbed as high as 20 percent in July, coinciding with Bitcoin’s first breakout above $115,000. During this period, Spot Bitcoin ETFs were witnessing huge institutional inflows that cancelled out any profit-taking from short-term holders. BTC: STH Realized Profit and Loss. Source: CryptoQuant Current Picture Shows Short-Term Holders Underwater That favorable backdrop has changed into losses in recent weeks. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around the low-$90,000 range, while the short-term holder realized price is just above $100,000. This places the current profit/loss margin at a loss of about 10%. Interestingly, this margin recently fell to as low as negative 20% when the Bitcoin price broke below $85,000 in November, which is the deepest loss regime for short-term holders in 2025. Nonetheless, the 2025 data shows that short-term holding was profitable for most of the year, but the outlook is not favorable right now. Structurally, these deep loss pockets usually show up closer to the late stages of a correction than the early ones. Right now, the most important thing for short-term holders is for Bitcoin t o reclaim the short-term realized price and push back above $100,000. Until then, short-term holders will stay under pressure, even with the yearly statistics leaning in their favor.

One of them is Egrag Crypto (@egragcrypto), who continues to rely on large-scale chart data rather than short-term volatility. Despite recent weakness, his latest analysis is bullish. Using a linear regression channel, he suggests that XRP’s long-term price trajectory may still favor higher valuations. However, the asset must meet key technical conditions. The Current Market Position After delivering a notable performance in mid-2025, XRP’s momentum faded. The token recorded a strong advance in July 2025, rising by roughly 35% and briefly reclaiming the $3 level. That move, however, proved difficult to sustain. In August, XRP reversed sharply , declining by more than 8% and falling back below $3. #XRP – Linear Regression (Log-scales) Targets $3.4,$10, $27: Using the long-term Logarithmic Linear Regression Channel (log scale), three major price levels stand out as of December 2025 1⃣Mean Reversion → $3.40: A retest and rejection from $3.40 would be one of the… pic.twitter.com/3vIhXCCDRM — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 12, 2025 Although September brought a modest recovery of about 2.5%, the broader trend remained negative. From its July peak , XRP is now down close to 45%, with the asset changing hands around $2.02 as sellers attempt to turn the $2 area into resistance rather than support. Long-Term Perspective From Regression Analysis Egrag’s analysis focuses on XRP’s long-term structure using a linear regression channel on a logarithmic scale. The model tracks average price movement over time, with the central line reflecting long-term mean value. The upper and lower boundaries mark dynamic resistance and support across major market cycles. Monthly chart data shows that XRP dropped below the lower boundary of this channel during the market disruption caused by the Terra collapse in May 2022 . The asset remained outside the channel for an extended period. It moved back toward it during the broader recovery phase in late 2024, which also pushed prices back near $2. XRP briefly re-entered the channel in December 2024 and January 2025. However, renewed selling pressure from February onward forced it back below the lower trendline. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Key Price Zones Within the Regression Channel The analyst outlines several key price levels based on XRP’s long-term regression structure. The first area sits near $3.4, aligning with the January 2025 high and the lower boundary of the channel. He views this zone as a mean reversion area, where rejection would strengthen bearish signals, while a sustained close above it would suggest a shift back into bullish conditions. The next level sits around $10 , corresponding with the upper midline (+2 SD) of the channel and marking a phase of full trend expansion. At the top of the regression channel, the model points to a long-term target near $27, which Egrag Crypto believes is reinforced by multiple technical confluences if XRP reclaims the channel.

In a recent post, he suggested that XRP could one day reach as high as $10,000. Projections like these are commonly rejected on the grounds of market capitalization constraints . However, Pantoja argues that this perspective relies too heavily on today’s economic structure. His outlook is rooted in the assumption that future technological shifts, particularly those driven by advanced artificial intelligence, could fundamentally alter how value is created, transferred, and measured. Reframing the Market Capitalization Debate Pantoja acknowledged that a $10,000 XRP price seems unrealistic under today’s liquidity and market conditions. However, he argues that market capitalization is shaped by the economic environment. People say $XRP can’t hit $10k because of market cap. But, They ignore the Singularity… when AI outnumbers humans 10 to 1, value must transfer instantly. The addressable market explodes, market caps skyrocket. XRP was built for this. #XRP #Singularity pic.twitter.com/dfduO368vl — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) September 21, 2025 As autonomous AI systems expand economic activity, financial networks could scale dramatically. This would make valuations that appear impossible today more plausible. The Crypto Market’s Journey So Far To support his thesis, Pantoja places XRP within the broader historical development of digital assets. He points to the erosion of trust in traditional finance following the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent government bailouts as a catalyst for innovation. In the years that followed, Bitcoin emerged as an alternative store of value, while XRP was developed with a focus on fast and efficient value transfer . Later crises, including the collapse of Mt. Gox, tested the resilience of the ecosystem but also contributed to its maturation. The introduction of Ethereum further expanded the sector by enabling programmable financial applications, accelerating adoption, and institutional interest. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 AI Singularity and the Future of Financial Scale Pantoja’s thesis centers on the AI singularity, a theoretical point where artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence and operates at a vast scale. He anticipates a future in which automated systems execute most economic transactions. This would require financial infrastructure that supports instant settlement and constant availability. He argues that traditional banking systems may struggle under such demands. At a much higher price, XRP could deliver the liquidity needed for enormous transaction volumes. Some experts believe XRP works better at high prices like $10,000 . Pantoja shares this belief, maintaining that only a network valued in the hundreds of trillions could support such activity. Reaching this price would put XRP’s market cap above $500 trillion. Pantoja ultimately positions XRP as a potential backbone for global payments in an increasingly automated economy. He views Bitcoin as a long-term store of value and Ethereum as a platform for decentralized applications. XRP’s role is unique, as it was engineered to address the specific challenge of efficient cross-border value movement, and this role could help it reach unimaginable heights.

With bullish signals and steady inflows aligning, the market now watches whether this stability can spark a meaningful upside move. ETH Coils Below $3,200 Ahead Of A Decisive Move AltCoin Việt Nam, in a recent post, highlighted that ETH is positioned at an extremely tense moment on its chart, signaling that the asset is preparing for a major directional move. This immediate pressure is being fueled by a significant bullish divergence that has just appeared on the chart, marking the first time the signal has materialized in over a month. Related Reading: Why Ethereum’s Rally Isn’t Overheated – And Where Demand Must Grow Next The analyst reinforced the expectation of high volatility by referencing historical data. Their research shows a consistent history of 9–16% price volatility whenever ETH falls below the $3,200 level. Given that the price is currently fluctuating tightly around the $3,100 mark, this historical context provides a clear signal that a sharp volatility explosion may be imminent. Adding overwhelming conviction to the bullish case is the recent action of market movers. AltCoin Việt Nam reported that a single super large whale just opened a leveraged long position totaling a massive $392 million (equivalent to 120,094 ETH). This colossal bet on the upside demonstrates a firm, high-conviction among institutional players. Furthermore, the institutional framework continues to provide a reliable underlying demand. The Spot Ethereum ETF market is still actively attracting substantial capital inflows, totaling over $250 million this week. BitMine Technologies also purchased an additional 33,504 ETH (valued at $112 million) today, highlighting persistent institutional accumulation. Considering the confluence of technical divergence, historical volatility context, and massive whale and institutional purchasing, the market faces a critical juncture. AltCoin Việt Nam posed the final question: Can ETH break out strongly and immediately confirm the uptrend, or will it need to retest lower support levels before initiating the expected explosive rally? Buyers Step In As Ethereum Defends Key Support According to crypto analyst The Boss, ETH has shown a highly encouraging response from a key technical area. Ethereum has reacted positively with the $3,091 support zone, and is currently holding firmly above this level, which is a strong signal that short-term buying pressure remains resilient and active in the market. Related Reading: Ethereum Inches Toward A Critical Decision Point: Bullish Break Or Deeper Dive? As long as the price stays above the green line, the analyst confirms that the primary focus remains the upside, validating the potential for a move toward the resistance zone marked by the blue line. The Boss emphasized the importance of these structural defense moves, concluding that such strong reactions from established support levels are vital signals for confirming the validity of the current structure and providing clear direction of the prevailing trend.

55753880,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=878017,1765678070,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55753880.jpeg,Long-term Bitcoin holders drive market lower with covered call tactics,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/long-term-bitcoin-holders-drive-market-lower/,"Jeff Park, a prominent market analyst and investment manager currently serving as the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at ProCap BTC, says that long-term Bitcoin holders, often referred to as “whales” or “OGs,” are increasingly selling covered calls. In this strategy, they sell call options against a large existing holding, such as BTC and ETH, to generate extra income or yield. These options grant the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase an asset at a predetermined price in the future, while the seller retains a profit. Park argued that this practice gives rise to a drastic drop in the price of spot BTC. Park blames BTC OGs for recent price declines in the crypto market Regarding Park’s argument , sources highlighted that these major Bitcoin holders establish substantial sell-side pressure via their covered call strategy. On the other hand, they noted that market makers, who play a significant role in purchasing these covered calls, are on the other side of this trade. Therefore, this calls for an urgency for them to safeguard themselves by engaging in activities such as selling spot BTC to cover their position. This, in turn, lowers market prices, although analysts discovered a deep interest from traditional ETF investors. Meanwhile, recent reports have revealed that the BTC designed to support these options has been held for several years and does not demonstrate the presence of new demands or fresh liquidity in the market. As a result, these calls bring about a reduction in prices. To further elaborate on this point, Park mentioned that, “When you already own Bitcoin that you’ve had for over 10 years and start selling calls against it, only the act of selling calls adds new delta to the market—and that delta is negative—so you end up being a net seller of delta when you sell calls.” His analysis suggested that the option market has a significant influence on the price of Bitcoin. He also suggested that there is a high likelihood that this price will continue to fluctuate as long as whales continue to make short-term profits, particularly from their BTC holdings by selling covered calls. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the cryptocurrency separated from the stock market in the latter half of 2025. At this time, some analysts expressed their belief that Bitcoin is closely tied to tech stocks. Moreover, while stocks continued to reach their highest point, BTC significantly declined to approximately $90,000. Analysts express their belief that Bitcoin will begin to rise again Several analysts have shared their forecasts that Bitcoin will begin to surge again when the US Federal Reserve continues to implement interest rate cuts and allocate additional funds into the financial system. According to them, this move could indicate a positive sign for risky investments. Following their prediction, data from CME Group’s FedWatch tool indicated that approximately 24.4% of traders anticipated that the US Federal Reserve could consider another rate cut at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled for January next year. However, some analysts speculated that BTC might experience a decline to reach a record low of $76,000, arguing that its upward trend has already come to an end. The analysts made this assumption after t rader Roman, with the username @Roman_Trading, shared an X post on Thursday of this week, publicly displaying his recent analysis and informing his followers to prepare for an additional 17% decline in Bitcoin’s price. Following his statement, sources acknowledged that BTC/USD has been facing difficulties in bouncing back after reaching its recent lows close to $80,000. They argued that instead, it is moving within a channel that slopes upwards.

Since hitting a price bottom of $80,000 in late November, BTC has formed an ascending channel, recording a steady series of higher lows and higher highs. However, KillaXBT’s projection is expected to break this channel, potentially halting the nascent uptrend. Going by the recurring price pattern, the analyst states Bitcoin investors should anticipate a minimum 5% price decline after the 14th of December, hinting at a potential retest of the 85,000-$86,000 price zone. Given the asset’s broader bullish market structure, such a move may represent nothing more than a short-term pullback. However, the prolonged correction seen earlier in Q4 has already set a precedent, leaving room for another phase of deeper downside should momentum weaken. BTC To Bottom Below $50,000? In another X post , KillaXBT shares more bearish projections of the Bitcoin market. This time, the seasoned analyst predicts the crypto market leader will hit a price bottom of $48,905 despite recent price gains. KillaXBT’s bottom target represents Bitcoin’s price as of the approval of the BlackRock IBIT ETF, alongside 11 other Bitcoin Spot ETFs in January 2024. This projection is likely due to the common rationale that the present bullish run has been heavily supported by institutional inflows. Notably, the Bitcoin Spot ETFs have been central to these institutional inflows, boasting total net assets of $119.18 billion. The BlackRock IBIT holds over half of this traction as the undisputed market leader with $71.03 billion in net assets and $62.68 billion in cumulative net inflows. If Bitcoin were to return to its pre-ETF approval price levels, it would imply an estimated 46% decline from current market prices. Such a move would likely signal a sharp reversal in institutional positioning, suggesting that sustained ETF outflows, rather than retail capitulation, could emerge as the primary catalyst for a renewed crypto winter. At press time, Bitcoin continues to trade at $90,348, reflecting a 2.18% decline.

In recent days, Trump has publicly indicated that he is considering just two finalists — Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett, his current director of the National Economic Council — and described them as “the two Kevins”. The president stressed that he wants a Fed leader who will be willing to lower interest rates and consult with the White House on monetary policy. These remarks would mark a notable shift from the Fed’s traditional independence. As U.S. President Donald Trump named his top two candidates to replace Jerome Powell, markets reacted fast. Betting platforms and cryptographically linked prediction markets are showing massive support for Warsh. Traders now regard him as a credible alternative to White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett. In any case, Trump will likely announce his nomination long before Powell’s term ends in May 2026 . Traders push Warsh’s odds as Trump narrows Fed choices Within days, Warsh’s odds of becoming the next Fed chair soared from roughly 12% to above 38% . The move followed reports that Trump has trimmed his list to two finalists . Kevin Hassett remains the favorite to win. But his lead has weakened. Now, after Trump went public with his praise, traders recognize an actual path ahead for Warsh. Shareholders consider the Fed chair race as key. Trump has been vocal about slashing interest rates. He said that the United States should have the lowest rates of any major economy. That position matters to markets. Most traders expect the next Fed chair to advocate for quicker and more aggressive rate cuts than the existing stance. Warsh is viewed as open to that transition. His previous criticism of persistently high rates resurfaces in current debates. That has helped bolster market confidence that he’s more in line with Trump’s economic priorities. Trump himself has said that Warsh is among his biggest choices. He has also confirmed that he interviewed several candidates in recent days. Warsh is reported to have been robust in those discussions. Other candidates continue to be considered. They are Fed Governors Chris Waller and Michelle Bowman, as well as Rick Rieder of BlackRock. However, attention has shifted increasingly to Warsh and Hassett. Wall Street backing has also helped fuel Warsh’s momentum. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive, has signaled support for Warsh as a credible and steady option. That backing has reverberations across financial markets. Critics, on the other hand, have expressed concern. Some lawmakers fear that Trump’s selections might erode the Fed’s independence. They say pressure to cut rates quickly could aggravate inflation risks. Trump brushed those fears aside. He has made lower rates a litmus test for his next Fed chair. Markets bet on aggressive Fed rate cuts The Fed now fears small rate cuts by 2026. However, traders believe Trump will quickly move to cut rates further when he appoints a proponent of rate cuts. Most market indicators currently suggest that a few rate cuts will occur next year. Some have three cuts in mind, a far cry from the Fed’s median view. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee recently stated that the committee could cut more than the current forecast if inflation continues to cool. His comments worked to reinforce market perceptions. Depending on whom the president picks to replace Powell as Fed chair, it could be a decisive factor. A Warsh nomination may also mark a more rapid pivot to looser monetary policy.

In a swift change of financial gravity, the spotlight has shifted from the decentralized digital asset to the US government treasury. As liquidity becomes the defining force behind every major market move, the Treasury General Account (TGA) has emerged as the true engine capable of driving risk assets. Why Bitcoin’s Cycles Matter Less When Federal Cash Levels Shift The most important chart for 2026 isn’t Bitcoin, it’s the US Treasury’s checking account. Crypto analyst Kyle Chassé has noted that the reason crypto has stalled is because of the government’s liquidity plumbing. Meanwhile, the TGA has just surged to $1 trillion, creating a massive liquidity vacuum in the cycle. When the treasury replenishes its funds, it drains dollars from the broader financial system. However, to avoid a recession heading into 2026, the government must drain the account back down. Draining the TGA means pushing $150 billion to $200 billion back into the banking system. In addition, the Quantitative Tightening (QT) has officially ceased, meaning the government is done draining liquidity, and asset prices track liquidity . Analyst Theunipcs revealed that the third rate cut of 2025 has been released, bringing the target range to its lowest level in nearly three years. The Fed also announced a new liquidity injection of roughly $40 billion per month in Treasury bill purchases. This policy pivot is happening immediately after BTC bounced from a 35% correction, which is the deepest pullback BTC has seen so far in this cycle. At the same time, the most conservative trillion-dollar asset managers like Vanguard and Charles Schwab are pushing crypto products to their tens of millions of users for the first time. This isn’t the time to be bearish, but to be buying the dips aggressively. Weekly Support Holds As Bitcoin Searches For A Relative Trend Reversal A full-time crypto trader and investor, Daan Crypto Trades, highlighted that Bitcoin is currently trading only about 18% above its 2021 highs compared to the NASDAQ. Currently, the BTC/NASDAQ ratio is testing the Weekly Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a level that is providing support. Initially, BTC saw a clear breakout in this ratio during 2024 and early 2025, but since then, momentum has stalled as stocks continued to grind higher, fueled by the AI tech rally. According to the expert, the tech stock momentum is starting to cool, at least temporarily, and will watch if this ratio moves back in favor of BTC again for a while. Due to the rotation signal , BTC is already showing signs that the index, like the Russell 2000 (Small Caps), is starting to outperform, as the tech stocks are cooling off a bit.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|BTC/NASDAQ|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Charles Schwab|Daan Crypto Trades|EMA|Exponential Moving Average|Kyle Chasse|Nasdaq|Russell 2000|TGA|Theunipcs|Treasury General Account|Vanguard,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-14 05:00:10

Valued at approximately $207 million, this single transaction highlights the immense scale of “whale” activity that can influence market sentiment and stability. What does this massive movement mean for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem? Let’s dive in. What Does This Massive USDT Transfer Signal? When a sum this large moves off a major exchange like OKX, it immediately raises questions. This USDT transfer represents a significant withdrawal of liquidity from a trading platform. Typically, such movements can indicate a few key actions by a major holder, often called a “whale.” They might be moving funds to a private wallet for safekeeping, preparing for a large over-the-counter (OTC) trade, or repositioning assets ahead of anticipated market volatility. The destination being an “unknown wallet”—a private address not tied to a known service—adds a layer of intrigue and makes the whale’s intent a subject of intense speculation. Why Should Crypto Investors Pay Attention to Whale Movements? Tracking these large transactions is crucial for understanding market dynamics. Whale activity often serves as a leading indicator. A massive USDT transfer from an exchange to cold storage could be seen as a bullish long-term hold signal. Conversely, if funds move *onto* an exchange, it might signal an impending large sell order. For the stablecoin market, such movements test the robustness of minting and redemption mechanisms. For everyday investors, monitoring this activity provides context for price swings and helps gauge institutional sentiment. Consider the potential implications: Market Sentiment: Large withdrawals can sometimes cool sell-pressure fears, as coins are taken off the market. Stablecoin Health: It demonstrates the active, large-scale use of USDT for settling value. Security Focus: It underscores the importance of secure, private wallet solutions for high-net-worth individuals. Could This USDT Transfer Impact Market Stability? The direct impact of a single USDT transfer on the price of Bitcoin or Ethereum is often minimal. However, its psychological impact can be substantial. The crypto market is highly sentiment-driven. News of a $207 million move can trigger narratives about whale accumulation or preparation, influencing retail trader behavior. Furthermore, it highlights the concentration of wealth in crypto, a double-edged sword that can provide stability through large, patient capital but also poses risks if that capital exits abruptly. Actionable Insights from the $207 Million Movement Instead of reacting with fear or excitement, savvy investors use data like this to inform their strategy. Here’s how: Use Tracking Tools: Follow blockchain explorers and alert services like Whale Alert to stay informed. Context is Key: Don’t view one transaction in isolation. Look for patterns in whale behavior over time. Focus on Fundamentals: Whale moves are one data point. Always base your core investment thesis on technology, adoption, and macroeconomic factors. This particular USDT transfer is a powerful reminder of the market’s scale and the silent movements that happen behind the scenes every day. Conclusion: Decoding the Whale’s Message The recent $207 million USDT transfer from OKX is more than just a number on a screen; it’s a testament to the maturation of cryptocurrency markets. It shows that substantial value is being managed and moved with precision on blockchain networks. While the exact reason remains shrouded in the privacy of the unknown wallet, the transaction reinforces the critical role of stablecoins like USDT as the settlement layer for major players. For the observant investor, it underscores the importance of on-chain analytics in developing a complete market picture. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an “unknown wallet” in crypto? An unknown wallet is a cryptocurrency address not publicly linked to a known exchange, custodian, or entity. It is typically a private, user-controlled wallet, making the owner’s identity anonymous. Why would someone move so much USDT off an exchange? Primary reasons include enhanced security (holding in cold storage), preparing for a private large trade, or simply consolidating assets in a personal vault away from exchange-related risks. Does a large USDT transfer affect its price peg to the dollar? Typically, no. Reputable stablecoins like USDT maintain their peg through reserves and redemption mechanisms. Large transfers are a function of utility, not an attack on the peg. How can I track large cryptocurrency transactions? You can use blockchain explorers (like Etherscan for ERC-20 tokens) or follow social media accounts of tracking bots like Whale Alert, which report large moves in real-time. Is whale activity always a reliable indicator for my trades? No, it should not be used in isolation. Whale moves can be misleading and may represent unique portfolio management. They are best used as supplementary context alongside fundamental and technical analysis. What is the difference between USDT being transferred versus sold? A transfer moves the token from one wallet to another. A sale involves exchanging USDT for another asset (like Bitcoin) on a trading platform. This event was a transfer, not necessarily a market sale. Found this breakdown of the major USDT transfer helpful?

According to Farside Investors, the ETFs attracted $674 million, reaching a peak of roughly $16.6 million on Tuesday. Since the first SOL ETF went live in July and Bitwise followed on that page in October, the ETFs have continued to draw the attention of both institutional and traditional finance investors. James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg, singled out the launch of REX-Osprey’s staked SOL ETF and BSOL Solana ETF by Bitwise in July and October as the top ETF launches of 2025. Solana’s market cap has dropped over 2%even as ETF inflows continued to rise The volume of the Solana ETF flows reflects ongoing demand for SOL, both among institutional investors and traditional finance, despite a decline in price and on-chain metrics, such as total value locked, as part of a wider market pullback. For one thing, according to Nansen data, Solana’s market capitalization decreased by over 2% over the last seven days. SOL is also almost 55% off its January peak of close to $295, hit after the Trump memecoin debut on Solana. The token has traded below its 365-day moving average since November and is down approximately 47% from the September peak of $253. SOL still faces resistance in the $140-$145 range and has been unable to close above those levels in December. However, the emergence of new US-listed SOL ETFs and the increasing interest in on-chain capital markets from crypto executives and US regulators has brought these issues to the forefront. Market observers attribute SOL’s troubles to falling prices and weaker activity on the chain, leading to a decline in TVL during broader market weakness. The current disparity between ETF inflows vs. the SOL spot price trend indicates an abnormal market situation. With Solana ETFs continuing to see strong inflows, SOL’s market cap and pricing momentum have both soured, leaving analysts mired in the differences between institutional demand and broader trading sentiment. Kazakhstan has lined up projects focused on Solana Kazakhstan is advancing a countrywide crypto and blockchain strategy centered on Solana, according to FORMA Mayor Farhaj Mayan, who spoke at the Solana Breakpoint conference. The country has laid out plans, including the establishment of a Solana economic special zone, the launch of the Tenge stablecoin, dual-listed IPOs on AIX and Solana, training 1,000 developers, creating a national crypto asset reserve, and constructing a blockchain-based CryptoCity. Meanwhile, global bank JPMorgan has also recently executed a landmark commercial paper deal via the Solana blockchain, advancing real-world finance into decentralized infrastructure. The paper was executed on-chain and settled with Circle’s USDC stablecoin. The bank created the on-chain token representing the debt and handled settlement, with Galaxy structuring the issuance. Coinbase participated as investor and wallet provider, and Franklin Templeton, already active in tokenized funds, also invested. U.S. regulators have backed the trend. SEC Chair Paul Atkins recently called tokenization a major innovation for capital markets, telling FOX Business last week that it could transform the financial system in the next few years.

This colossal movement, valued at approximately $207 million, originated from an unknown wallet and landed at the major exchange OKX. Such a significant transaction immediately raises critical questions about market intent and stability. What Does This Massive USDT Transfer Actually Mean? When a USDT transfer of this magnitude occurs, it’s rarely a simple portfolio adjustment. This transaction represents one of the largest single movements of the world’s leading stablecoin in recent weeks. Analysts typically scrutinize such flows for clues about upcoming market activity. A deposit of this size to a centralized exchange like OKX often precedes major trading moves, potentially signaling an institution or wealthy investor preparing to execute a large order. Why Should Crypto Traders Care About Whale Movements? Tracking whale activity provides invaluable insights. These large holders, or ‘whales,’ possess the power to influence prices through their actions. Therefore, a USDT transfer to an exchange can be a leading indicator. Let’s break down the possible implications: Bullish Signal: The whale may be converting USDT into other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which could drive up prices. Bearish Preparation: Conversely, they might be moving funds to quickly sell other assets during volatility, potentially increasing selling pressure. Institutional Activity: This could be part of a treasury management operation for a corporation or fund, reflecting growing institutional involvement. Market Liquidity: Such a large injection of stablecoin liquidity into OKX can facilitate larger trades and improve market depth. How Does a USDT Transfer Impact Market Stability? Stablecoins like Tether (USDT) are designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar. However, massive movements can test this stability. The sheer scale of this USDT transfer demonstrates robust on-chain liquidity and confidence in the asset’s peg. It also highlights the critical role major exchanges like OKX play as liquidity hubs. For everyday traders, this event underscores the importance of monitoring on-chain data to understand the forces shaping the market beneath the surface. Actionable Insights from the $207 Million Transaction So, what can you do with this information? First, don’t panic. Whale movements are common, but they are a piece of the puzzle, not the entire picture. Use this data point alongside other market indicators like trading volume, open interest, and broader news. If you see a pattern of large USDT transfer events to exchanges followed by price movements, you can start to build a more informed trading strategy. Remember, transparency is key in crypto, and tools like Whale Alert bring this large-scale activity to light. In conclusion, the movement of over 207 million USDT is a powerful reminder of the scale and sophistication at play in today’s cryptocurrency markets. While the exact intent behind this specific USDT transfer remains unknown, it reinforces the need for vigilance and analysis. By understanding the potential motives of major players, from accumulation to risk management, individual investors can navigate the markets with greater clarity and confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a “whale” in cryptocurrency? A whale is an individual or entity that holds a large enough amount of a cryptocurrency that their trades can potentially influence the market price. Why do people track large USDT transfers? Large USDT transfers to exchanges are often seen as precursors to major buying or selling activity, providing clues about potential future price movements. Is a transfer to an exchange always bullish? Not necessarily. While it can signal an intent to buy other assets, it could also mean a holder is preparing to cash out or move funds for safekeeping, which might be neutral or bearish. How reliable is Whale Alert’s data? Whale Alert is a highly reputable service that monitors public blockchain data. Its reports on large transactions are considered accurate and timely. Can this transaction affect the price of USDT itself? It’s unlikely to break the USDT peg due to its size relative to the total supply, but it demonstrates high network usage and can affect exchange liquidity. What is OKX? OKX is one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, offering spot and derivatives trading to a global user base. Found this analysis of the major USDT transfer insightful?

Here’s What to Watch,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-spots-key-moment-for-xrp-heres-what-to-watch/,"Crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) has highlighted a key development in the XRP monthly chart. He pointed to the price action around the $1.99 region, which marked a major rejection point in 2017. He stated that XRP is now retesting this level, calling it a potential turning point. He described the setup as a key moment for the asset and noted the importance of holding above this zone. The chart presents a clear structure that builds interest around XRP’s movement. The market has spent years reacting to the same areas, which now carry new relevance as its price presses against them once again. These levels shaped earlier cycles, and they now act as the foundation for assessing whether the asset forms a sustained trend shift. Key moment for $XRP : Price is retesting the historic 2017 rejection level. Turning it into support would confirm a long-term trend reversal. pic.twitter.com/3803LDP3It — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 11, 2025 Historic Levels Shape the Current Test The $1.99 rejection in 2017, the $1.60 rejection in 2021, and the $0.70 rejection in 2023 appear as major turning points. Each marked a point where bullish momentum failed , and sellers regained control. This pattern created a long ceiling that capped progress for years. The current move places XRP directly on top of that 2017 barrier. Its price broke above the level earlier in the year and now retests it. Steph noted that “price is retesting the historic 2017 rejection level” and said that turning it into support would confirm long-term strength in the structure . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What Comes Next for XRP? XRP now enters a period where market participants monitor whether the $1.99 level holds. A confirmed support would give the digital asset its first long-term reversal since late 2024. Buyers pushed its price above all ceilings with conviction, and the current pullback tests the market’s commitment to this new range. If XRP closes the next few monthly candles above the zone, it strengthens the case for a sustained trend shift. However, failure to hold this level opens the possibility of a move toward $1.60. The market treated that region as resistance in 2021, and it now stands as a logical support if the price slips. $0.70 offers a deeper long-term reference, though the chart shows no current signal that the market targets it. The next stage depends on how XRP behaves around the 2017 support; a clean bounce would set a positive tone for the coming year .

Here’s What You Need to Know,https://timestabloid.com/swift-is-being-upgraded-to-ripple-xrp-heres-what-you-need-to-know/,"Crypto researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) has shocked the XRP community with a bold claim that SWIFT will be upgraded to Ripple. He backed up this statement with a presentation by Matthew Le Merle that placed Ripple inside a broader shift toward digital infrastructure. The remarks were made during a discussion on how traditional financial systems are facing a structural upgrade as more value moves across tokenized networks. Le Merle described the transition as an active process that already involves major companies, established assets, and new digital counterparts. His comments revived interest in what happens if a global payments system like SWIFT adopts blockchain rails built for real-time settlement. REMEMBER: SWIFT IS BEING UPGRADED TO RIPPLE Listen closely. https://t.co/UPWYCO8FBR pic.twitter.com/aJBJnG19bX — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) December 12, 2025 A Growing Focus on Digital Money Infrastructure Le Merle is a well-known figure who serves as an Advisory Board Director at Bitwise. During the presentation, he described how digital infrastructure now handles functions once limited to banks and legacy payment networks. He referenced custodians such as Anchorage and Fireblocks as examples of companies building the systems needed for modern finance . He said the sector keeps expanding because “we need infrastructure to allow for the digitalization of finance and commerce.” Digital Equivalents Replace Legacy Payments Le Merle then shifted to the category of money. He explained that traditional players now face digital counterparts. He stated that the industry is “taking things like Swift or Visa or Mastercard, and we’re upgrading them into digital equivalents, which have names like Ripple or Yellowcard.” That comment positioned Ripple’s XRP-powered payment system alongside a group of platforms designed for fast and frictionless value transfer . Le Merle also drew attention to stablecoins such as Tether and Circle, confirming investment positions in both companies. XRP is well-known for its dominance in the cross-border payment space among cryptocurrencies. As the world moves toward digital payments, dominating traditional cross-border payment flows is a natural evolution for the digital asset. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple’s Position if SWIFT Adopts Blockchain SMQKE focused on the scenario where SWIFT migrates to blockchain infrastructure. Le Merle’s remarks outlined a clear link between legacy networks and digital systems. If SWIFT chooses a model similar to Ripple’s, the XRP Ledger becomes a viable option for real-time cross-border settlement. Ripple already targets these functions through XRP-based liquidity routing and instant finality. Le Merle also mentioned BlackRock’s excitement to enter the tokenization space, a market where XRP has gained prominence . A blockchain upgrade for SWIFT would allow banks to move from messaging formats to on-chain operations. XRP gains utility in environments that require fast execution and continuous settlement . This shift increases the asset’s relevance in global finance and could have a major positive impact on its price.

Key Takeaways: Venezuela’s worsening economy and a weakening bolívar are driving wider stablecoin adoption, TRM Labs says. Stablecoins are increasingly used for daily payments as trust in banks and regulation erodes. Peer-to-peer platforms and USDT now function as substitutes for retail banking across the country. The findings point to growing reliance on digital assets for everyday financial activity, particularly as confidence in traditional banking systems erodes. Economic Strain and Sanctions Push Venezuelans Toward Stablecoins Venezuelans have spent nearly a decade navigating hyperinflation, sanctions-related constraints, and limited access to reliable financial services. Against this backdrop, TRM Labs said demand for stablecoins is likely to increase further if macroeconomic instability persists, a risk amplified by ongoing geopolitical tensions between the United States and Venezuela. The firm noted that stablecoins are increasingly being used not only as a store of value, but also as a medium of exchange for routine transactions. Regulatory uncertainty is also playing a role. Questions surrounding the authority and enforcement capacity of Venezuela’s crypto regulator, SUNACRIP, combined with lingering distrust in domestic banks, have left many citizens turning to blockchain-based alternatives. “Absent a material shift in Venezuela’s macroeconomic conditions or the emergence of cohesive regulatory oversight, the role of digital assets — particularly stablecoins — is poised to expand,” TRM Labs said. JUST IN: Venezuelan to integrate Bitcoin and stablecoin payments into the country's banking system. HUGE pic.twitter.com/mroPtScrQf — Bitcoin Archive (@BitcoinArchive) October 31, 2025 Data from the Chainalysis 2025 Crypto Adoption Index places Venezuela 18th globally for crypto adoption. When adjusted for population size, however, the country ranks ninth, underscoring how deeply embedded crypto usage has become among ordinary users. Peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions have emerged as a critical financial tool. TRM Labs found that more than 38% of crypto-related site visits from Venezuelan IP addresses were directed to a single global platform offering P2P trading services. These platforms, along with USDT-to-fiat conversions, have filled gaps left by unreliable domestic banking channels, even as users report intermittent service disruptions. Local platforms are also gaining traction, particularly those offering mobile wallets and bank integrations tailored to Venezuelan users. According to TRM Labs, these services enable informal settlement rails that support daily commerce despite infrastructure challenges. The report frames Venezuela’s crypto ecosystem as a response to necessity rather than speculation. Stablecoins, especially USDT, now underpin payroll payments, remittances, vendor transactions, and cross-border purchases. Western Union to Launch Dollar-Backed Stablecoin on Solana Western Union is also entering the stablecoin market with plans to launch the US Dollar Payment Token (USDPT) on the Solana blockchain in the first half of 2026. The token, issued by Anchorage Digital Bank, will allow users to move money globally with lower fees and faster settlement times, reducing reliance on traditional banking intermediaries and volatile currency conversions. Likewise, Visa has unveiled a new pilot that enables direct payouts in Circle’s USDC stablecoin for creators, freelancers, and gig workers worldwide. The initiative aims to make cross-border payments nearly instant while reducing dependence on traditional banking infrastructure.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $110K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $90,210 (-0.2%) Market capitalization $2.11 Trillion Trading volume (24-hour) $42.13 Billion (+18.9%) Circulating supply 19.87 Million BTC All-time high $124,457; August 14, 2025 All-time low $0.04865; Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $93,620.95 24-hour low $90,176.68 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $90,210 Price Prediction $ 97,689 (+5.52%) Fear & Greed Index 24 (Extreme Fear) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 7.85% (High) Green Days 11/30 (37%) 50-Day SMA $ 102,576 200-Day SMA $ 104,352 14-Day RSI 39.65 (Neutral) Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin declines toward $90K Resistance for BTC is at $94,375 Support for BTC/USD is at $88,420 The BTC price analysis for 14 December confirms that BTC faces a decline in bullish volatility as the price declines toward $90K. Currently, the price is aiming for a consolidation within a bearish channel. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin faces minor bearish pressure Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that Bitcoin faces bearish pressure as it declined toward $90K. Currently, the BTC price is facing selling domination around immediate resistance channels. The 24-hour volume has increased to $559 million, showing a surge in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $90,145, declining by over 0.2% in the last 24 hours. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and trades at 44, hinting that a bullish correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Buying domination rises around EMA trend lines The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bulls are strengthening their position to hold the price above the EMA trend lines. Currently, buyers are aiming for a trend continuation above $100K. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a negative region at 0.42, showing that short-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate a downward trend. Additionally, the MACD indicator has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $94,375, it will fuel a bullish rally to $97,312. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $88,420, beginning a bearish trend to $84,166. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in selling pressure as buyers failed to push the price above immediate fib levels. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC As reported by Cryptopolitan , PayPal has launched a sweepstakes running from November 17 to December 21, offering weekly prizes and a total of 1,008 winners for eligible U.S. residents. The company promoted the event on X, highlighting over $1 million in bitcoin prizes with no purchase required. Bitcoin price prediction December 2025 Bitcoin’s price dropped toward $84K due to the rising bearish threat. However, it is now facing minor accumulation, which could mean we’ll see a peak around December 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $95,000 and be pushed further, at least $105,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $82,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction December 2025 $82,000 $95,000 $105,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $110,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year. Bitcoin price prediction 2031 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $285,058 and potentially rise to a maximum of $350,548. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $303,555 throughout the year.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $110,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $100,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later. In mid-August, the price of Bitcoin surged above $124K. However, the price failed to maintain its momentum as it dropped below $110K in early-September. By the end of September, the price of Bitcoin dropped further and touched a low around $108K. In October, the price of Bitcoin crashed heavily below $110K. The price crashed further toward $84K in November.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|UNI|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-14 07:11:48

Two Reasons to Consider (Opinion),https://cryptopotato.com/is-ripple-xrps-price-undervalued-two-reasons-to-consider-opinion/,"Ripple’s XRP ranks #3 among all non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies for market cap weight. The company claims that the coin is not just a speculative asset, but also a very powerful utility token. Ripple developed the XRP network and launched it in June 2012 to make it easy for large banks and corporations, and even governments, to send huge payments internationally. By Jan. 2018, however, it had become a popular altcoin among crypto markets and has remained so ever since. That 2017-18 price boom for XRP, moreover, briefly made its founder, Chris Larsen, a cryptocurrency billionaire on paper. So Could XRP Make Stout Investors in 2025 and 2026 Millionaires? The short answer is “no,” but let me elaborate, because there are reasons to be bullish. Bitcoin’s price may be a fair point of comparison. While BTC last traded at $2 in June 2011, by Oct. 5, 2025, it traded above $126,000 within a flash 24-hour window surge. That was a 63,000x increase in 14 years. In fact, every $1,000 invested so early in Bitcoin would now be worth $63 million. So, if XRP’s price continues on a trajectory like Bitcoin’s, then by 2039, it would produce a similar result. Of course, to anyone in the know, this seems absolutely ridiculous, and it most probably is. But a more realistic comparison is market cap. XRP’s Price Upside vs. BTC 2011 – 2025 In order for XRP’s market cap to reach the weight of BTC’s during its all-time high price level in Oct., it would require only a 20(x) or 1,900% increase from the December 14 value. That would take the current XRP market capitalization to Bitcoin’s two-and-a-half trillion dollar market cap at the very start of Q4 this fall. Does XRP have this much upside left in its business model’s addressable market and in its crypto market valuation? BTC did in 2011. Bitcoin was the first globally successful cryptocurrency, and its hardcore minimalist design fulfilled the simplest banking function with the most demand. Meanwhile, it did so in a way to build a native Internet monetary currency using digital broadcast techniques. Moreover, Bitcoin incorporated a powerful economic flywheel to drain capital from the global financial system, acting as a capital sink. Is XRP comparable? Here are some ways that it might be. Although let’s face it, nobody is becoming an XRP millionaire if they invested $1,000 today. The XRP / SWIFT Prediction In November, a report on Yahoo Finance touted that “XRP could capture 14% of SWIFT’s $150 trillion by 2030.” On-Demand Liquidity, Ripple’s automated payments service using XRP tokens, handled $1.3 trillion in Q2 of 2025. That could be something like $5.2 trillion annually. Instead of waiting days for transfers to clear via SWIFT, businesses only have to wait seconds for XRP’s network to settle. A fourfold increase in XRP’s volume for large cross-border payments over Q2’s pace would reach that 14% of the SWIFT market share at 2025 volumes. This could, in theory, create additional demand for XRP tokens and raise their market value, but the market doesn’t seem to perceive and value the possibility. But as the global economy grows, so does the number and volume of such transfers. Meanwhile, Ripple is aggressively expanding business operations to onboard customers that make large payments cross-border. They’re not just hanging a completely automated, very simple, low-bandwidth, but powerful digital money network out there and letting whoever uses it use it. XRPL: An Ethereum Worth of XRP Market Cap? Meanwhile, the XRP Ledger is developing the Ripple token’s use case as a programmable smart contract for safe and reliable transactions. It turns complete computation using someone else’s computers over the network into a metered, enabled service for new forms of cloud computing. In December, XRPL activity surged to record levels. The fast-growing popularity of this base-layer blockchain for smart contracts opens up an entirely new market, in addition to XRP’s original purpose as a lightweight yet powerful, high-throughput payment service that leverages the Internet’s capabilities. While XRP’s market cap was $122 billion on Dec. 14th, Ethereum’s was $375 billion. At the height of its market cap in Sept., Ethereum topped $555 billion. If XRP turned out to be an Ethereum killer, it could add something like half a trillion dollars to its market cap from growth in its smart contract segment alone.

As a result, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is among the best cryptos to buy today while challenges against Shiba Inu cast a cloud on its outlook. People looking for the best cryptocurrency on which to invest are tracking MUTM’s presale numbers, and these numbers indicate an increase in interest for Mutuum Finance (MUTM), as it swiftly progresses with the presale. The heightened interest represents that people looking for the best crypto to invest are increasingly turning towards structured models of tokens as opposed to speculative ones. Shiba Inu Faces Mounting Technical Pressure Shiba Inu has been through a tough period, and it is no surprise that the token continues facing pressure as it moves further away from critical support. The price has dropped to $0.000008273 after several weeks of decline, as it continues a correction period that exceeds 16% for a month. Technical readings have done little to alleviate these concerns, as SHIB continues to remain below its strong support levels ranging from $0.000014 to $0.00001. The longer that price stays below these levels, the harder it will be for it to recover, and as such, fewer people are listing it as the best cryptocurrency to invest in. Momentum indicators, on the other hand, suggest caution. The 7-day and 30-day MAs are above the price chart, and the MACD trend is still negative, with a mild divergence. As a result, Shiba Inu does not feature on most rankings of the best cryptocurrencies for accumulation. Mutuum Finance Phase 6 Rise Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been generating considerable interest, and it has entered one of its most active phases as it marks 98% completion for presale phase 6. Those wanting to invest in the best cryptocurrency to buy today are taking advantage because it will be the last chance for them to invest in MUTM at $0.035. The presale so far has broken $19,500,000 and reached 18,480 total holders. The current value represents an increase of 250% from the first phase value of $0.01. Phase 6 is selling out fast, and the opportunity to acquire at this value will soon expire as Phase 7 will raise the value by almost 20% to $0.04 before eventually reaching a value of $0.06 at an assured launch price. Early buyers are poised for gains of approximately 500% upon listing. Investor engagement has also seen an increase with the inclusion of the daily leaderboard, which boasts a top 50 leaderboard display. The leaderboard also resets every 24 hours at 00:00 UTC, and the person who contributes the most will be eligible for a bonus reward of $500 once they have made at least one transaction within that period. It continues to drive activity around presale and yet again presents an added advantage for people searching for the best cryptocurrency to invest in today. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also been granted an independent audit review by Halborn Security as it reviews its lending and borrowing contracts. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to differentiate itself among weaker momentum tokens as it becomes increasingly clear that structure and usage continue to drive purchaser decisions. Its fast presale progress, imminent protocol launch, and growing number of holders are just a few factors why it has emerged as the best crypto to buy. Those who are looking for answers to what might be considered the best cryptocurrency to invest in will still be able to participate in Phase 6 before it closes, while the chance to own MUTM for $0.035 will soon be gone.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/dark-defender-xrp-is-inevitable-when-589-heres-why/,"The digital asset market continues to advance as new infrastructure rolls out across major networks. Developers move quickly, and users follow that movement as new options enter the market. XRP now sits in the middle of this activity. A new post from analyst Dark Defender (@DefendDark) added fuel to the momentum. He posted that “XRP is inevitable” while pointing to the arrival of wrapped XRP on Solana and the expansion of XRP activity on Flare. His post coincides with a period of rapid development for the asset, and his tone reflects the confidence many long-term holders express. He also revived the long-standing $589 price target that several figures promoted over the years. Things are unfolding fast for #XRP in DeFi. Wrapped XRP is live on Solana. XRP utility expanding on Flare. Liquidity is moving cross-chain. XRP is inevitable! When 589, #Ethereum ? — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) December 12, 2025 Growing XRP Access Across Chains Wrapped XRP (wXRP) is now live on Solana. This move expands XRP’s reach in the DeFi space and creates a new route for investors who want to operate within Solana’s ecosystem. The asset can be transferred across chains with immediate settlement. This will help users gain access to deeper liquidity pools. The integration will boost activity on Solana while offering XRP holders an efficient way to take part in lending markets or liquidity venues. Flare has also expanded its support for XRP . Builders on the network can add new utility through systems that allow collateral use, yield strategies, and other structured products. XRP now functions easily within this environment. This increases the number of roles the asset can perform within DeFi. These developments show a clear shift. XRP holders no longer need to remain on a single ledger to gain DeFi access. Liquidity now moves freely across chains. That movement strengthens the position of XRP in an ecosystem that rewards speed and versatility. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Revisiting a Long-Standing Target Dark Defender included a brief comment for Ethereum and a bold prediction for XRP. He pointed to the years of claims that XRP could reach $589 . The target sits far from the current market level, yet the idea continues to surface whenever the asset enters a period of renewed expansion. His post also suggested that XRP could surpass Ethereum . Supporters take this view when they see progress on cross-chain systems and new DeFi roles. If the digital asset reached $589, it would surpass both Ethereum and Bitcoin in market value. XRP is gaining more ground as cross-chain liquidity grows. With wXRP, users have new paths to deploy capital, and DeFi routes gain strength as builders add features. The market is excited and anticipating what XRP does next. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Key Takeaways: US prosecutors expanded charges against “Bitcoin Rodney” over the $1.8B HyperFund scheme. Burton faces decades in prison after being denied bail as a flight risk. HyperFund allegedly promised fake returns and blocked withdrawals. According to a superseding indictment unsealed Friday by the US Attorney’s Office for the District of Maryland, prosecutors now accuse Burton of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, two counts of wire fraud, seven counts of money laundering, and one count of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. If convicted on all charges, Burton could face up to 20 years in prison for each wire fraud-related count, up to 10 years per money laundering count, and an additional five years for the unlicensed money transmission charge. Expanded Indictment Deepens Case Against “Bitcoin Rodney” The new indictment marks a sharp escalation from the original criminal complaint filed in January 2024, which charged Burton with just two counts related to unlicensed money transmission. Those earlier charges carried a maximum sentence of five years each. Burton was arrested at Miami International Airport that month while allegedly attempting to leave the country on a one-way ticket to the United Arab Emirates. A federal judge later denied his bail request, citing him as an “extreme flight risk,” and he has remained in custody since. According to court filings, Burton and his alleged co-conspirators operated HyperFund, also known as HyperVerse, from June 2020 through May 2024. Rodney ""Bitcoin Rodney"" Burton, of Miami, Florida and Prince George's County, Md., has been indicted for his role as an alleged promoter of a $1.8 billion fraud scheme. https://t.co/xlOH6XRM4B — FOX Baltimore (@FOXBaltimore) December 13, 2025 The platform was marketed as a crypto investment opportunity promising daily returns ranging from 0.5% to 1% until investors doubled or tripled their money. Prosecutors claim those returns were falsely attributed to large-scale cryptocurrency mining operations that did not exist. By 2021, HyperFund allegedly began restricting and blocking investor withdrawals. The indictment further alleges that Burton used investor funds to finance a lavish lifestyle, including the purchase of luxury condominiums, high-end sports cars, and a yacht. His trial is currently scheduled for March next year. From Celebrity Events to Court Records: The Rise of “Bitcoin Rodney” Burton rose to prominence within crypto circles through aggressive marketing and high-profile appearances. He hosted a 2021 Miami event featuring “Shark Tank” investor Daymond John and musician Akon, and appeared publicly with celebrities such as Jamie Foxx and Rick Ross. Court records also reference a prior conviction for conspiracy to distribute cocaine. In recent court filings, Burton has maintained that he believed HyperFund was a legitimate business. He has placed blame on co-founder Xue Lee, also known as Sam Lee, alleging Lee orchestrated an elaborate deception that misled both investors and promoters. Lee and fellow promoter Brenda “Bitcoin Beautee” Chunga were charged by the SEC in January 2024 . Chunga has pleaded guilty, while Lee remains at large.

The country has been relying on blockchain technology amid a decade of economic pressures, caused by political tensions and other external factors. As a result, blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs has predicted that stablecoin usage will continue to grow if conditions in the South American country continue to worsen. TRM Labs noted in a report that as regional and geopolitical tensions, which have been worsened by the US-Venezuela tensions, continue, people would have no other choice but to continue adopting digital assets. Venezuela set to see rise in stablecoin usage Over the past months, Venezuela has become increasingly dependent on US-dollar pegged stablecoins even in the face of the threat of war, sanctions, and the hyperinflation of its currency, the bolívar. The country’s back-and-forth with the United States hit a critical point when the latter announced plans to conduct military strikes targeting drug cartels in the country. Trump has accused the cartel of smuggling illicit substances into the US, a claim that has been denied by Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. In its report , TRM Labs mentioned that the situation in Venezuela has now worsened, causing macroeconomic instability, which has led to the continued devaluation of the bolívar. At the same time, other factors, including regulatory challenges, reduced trust in traditional banking infrastructure, the uncertainty surrounding its crypto regulator, SUNACRIP, and its enforcement capacity, could prolong the population’s dependence on stablecoins, driving more usage. “Absent a material shift in Venezuela’s macroeconomic conditions or the emergence of cohesive regulatory oversight, the role of digital assets — particularly stablecoins — is poised to expand,” the report said. According to the recent Chainalysis 2025 Crypto Adoption Index report, Venezuela is currently 18th globally in terms of crypto adoption. However, the country’s rank increased to 9th when the metric is adjusted to account for population size. Peer-to-peer transactions go mainstream According to TRM Labs, peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, which are transfers made from one person to another person without the need for an intermediary, and USDT -to-fiat conversions, have emerged as key services that Venezuelans have been using in the absence of reliable domestic banking channels. The blockchain intelligence firm noted that it tracked several Venezuelan IP addresses and discovered that more than 38% were visits to websites offering P2P services. TRM Labs mentioned that the platform underscores its role in facilitating crypto access in the low-banking environment that has opened up in Venezuela due to the economic instability. “A significant share of crypto-to-fiat activity is facilitated through platforms supporting informal settlement rails — even amid reports of intermittent service disruptions,” TRM Labs said. “Local platforms also play a key role, particularly those offering mobile wallets and bank integrations suited to domestic users.” Venezuela’s crypto ecosystem was born out of nearly a decade of economic collapse, international sanctions pressure, and state experimentation with digital financial alternatives, the TRM Labs team added. Stablecoins, especially USDT, have been playing an important role in household and commercial transactions in the country. Despite sanctions evasion concerns, citizens continue to adopt stablecoins due to necessity rather than speculation or criminal intent. “For most Venezuelans, stablecoins now operate as a substitute for retail banking — facilitating payroll, family remittances, vendor payments, and cross-border purchases in the absence of consistent domestic financial services.” Businesses now accept crypto through platforms like Binance and Airtm. In addition, some employees are being paid in stablecoins, while universities have begun offering courses dedicated to digital assets.

According to the terms of the deal, the crypto exchange will provide advice for the country as it prepares to explore tokenizing up to $2 billion in state-owned assets. This latest development comes amid Pakistan’s move to introduce regulations to its crypto industry, which is expected to pave the way for its national stablecoin plans. The agreement, which was announced by the country’s finance ministry, sets the stage for Binance to provide its expertise on blockchain-based distribution of Pakistan’s sovereign bonds, treasury bills, and commodity reserves, including gas, metals, and commodities, according to Reuters. Pakistan taps Binance for advice on tokenization plans According to Pakistani Finance Minister Muhammed Aurangzeb, the MoU is a signal of the country’s reform trajectory and a step towards a long-term partnership with the crypto exchange. He mentioned that the next step will involve the execution, which the country is fully focused on. As a result of that, Pakistan is expected to deliver results with speed and quality in the shortest possible time frame. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao is no stranger to Pakistan, as he serves as a strategic advisor to the Pakistan Crypto Council. In a statement, Zhao mentioned that the agreement was a great sign for the global blockchain industry. He also added that for Pakistan, the agreement is expected to serve as the beginning of a move towards full deployment of the tokenization plan. The Binance MoU is non-binding and requires definitive agreements within six months. It is also subject to regulatory approvals. Aside from the MoU, Pakistan’s regulator has granted a preliminary clearance to Binance and HTX to begin local licensing. Both exchanges were awarded the No Objection Certificate, which allows them to register with the country’s Anti-Money Laundering system and prepare for full license applications. “This phased approach allows us to begin providing AML-registered cross-border services to Pakistani users while we continue working closely with PVARA toward full authorization,” Binance said in a statement. Moves to set up its crypto industry are underway Binance also mentioned that it is in line with its regulatory roadmap, a move that reflects its long-term commitment to supporting the country’s digital economy. Meanwhile, the certificates do not necessarily mean the chosen exchanges are permitted to operate. The clearance comes after the regulator, the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority ( PVARA ), called on exchanges to register for local licenses in September. Pakistan currently ranks as the world’s third-largest market by retail activity, according to PVARA Chairman Bilal Bin Saqib, who noted an estimated 40 million users and annual trading volume that surpasses $300 billion. The country has also discussed the need for regulation, as noted at a high-level meeting attended by senior officials from the country and representatives from the crypto exchange Binance. The government says it wants to create a transparent and secure framework for digital assets. The MoU also follows comments made by Bin Saqib earlier this month, confirming that the country will definitely launch its stablecoin. Bin Saqib claimed launching the stablecoin will provide the government with a better way to collate rising debt, noting that Pakistan is also trying to develop a central bank digital currency pilot. “We want to be at the forefront of this financial digital innovation that is happening,” Saqib said. “Why should we be at the tail-end of it when we have the muscle and the adoption?” Pakistan has been proactive in terms of setting up its crypto industry. Since the start of the year, the country has established the Pakistan Crypto Council and PVARA. In April, the Council and the Trump-backed World Liberty Financial signed a letter of intent to explore stablecoin infrastructure and real-world asset tokenization. The following month, the country announced the allocation of 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining and AI data centers. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Here’s What CNBC Said,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-is-finally-getting-mainstream-spotlight-heres-what-cnbc-said/,"The conversation around XRP has shifted tone in recent weeks, with attention moving toward increased institutional participation. Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto) shared a video of the shift, highlighting XRP’s growing institutional profile. The interview featured 21Shares Chief Strategist Adrian Fritz discussing why his firm launched a spot XRP ETF in the U.S. and what that signals about demand. Xaif sees the moment as a turning point for XRP. His post pointed to mainstream visibility and rising interest from asset managers. The CNBC interview showed how XRP now fits into the ETF landscape rather than sitting on its edges. XRP is finally getting the mainstream spotlight it deserves now featured on CNBC. 21Shares’ chief strategist breaking down the demand, growth, and why XRP was the natural next ETF in the U.S. market. $XRP season is just beginning. https://t.co/RqCYhFZqoU pic.twitter.com/Vc7BvHkFPh — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) December 12, 2025 A Strategic Move Into XRP During the interview, CNBC’s host asked why 21Shares chose XRP after already offering spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. Fritz explained that the decision followed a clear sequence. He described it as “a natural progression,” citing regulatory tailwinds in the U.S. alongside client demand. He added that 21Shares is moving “across the long tail of crypto assets,” with XRP standing out as “a natural next step.” The comments aligned closely with Xaif’s opinion. The video showed XRP positioned less as a speculative outlier and more as an asset entering a structured investment phase. 21Shares also carries history into the launch. Fritz highlighted the firm’s background as “Swiss born and raised,” noting its 8-year track record as it expands further into the U.S. market. That credibility forms part of the pitch, and its recognition of XRP reinforces the asset’s strong reputation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 ETF Competition and Market Depth The interviewer also raised concerns about saturation. Several spot XRP ETFs have entered the U.S. market, with the interviewer specifically mentioning Canary Capital’s ETF . Fritz rejected the idea that the market is already crowded. He argued that digital asset adoption remains early, suggesting there is space for healthy competition and growth. Fritz emphasized choice. He said a range of offerings benefits investors as interest grows beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. He also noted a pattern he had already observed. Clients tend to move “beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum,” with demand increasing for other crypto assets once access becomes simple. Why Visibility Matters for XRP Appearing on CNBC places XRP in front of traditional market participants who rarely follow crypto-native channels. Xaif highlighted this mainstream visibility and stated that XRP’s season is just beginning. The interview treated XRP as an investable asset within established financial rails. XRP ETFs have shown remarkable performance , and the 21Shares fund could increase the impact of these products on the asset’s price.

55766384,https://bitzo.com/2025/12/decentralized-betting-platforms-2026-best-no-kyc-crypto-sportsbooks,1765703867,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/55766384.jpeg,Decentralized Betting Platforms 2026: Best No-KYC Crypto Sportsbooks,https://bitzo.com/2025/12/decentralized-betting-platforms-2026-best-no-kyc-crypto-sportsbooks,"By 2026, decentralized betting has become a defined alternative to traditional sportsbooks rather than a fringe experiment. As custodial platforms tighten identity requirements, many users continue to favor no-KYC crypto sportsbooks built around self-custody and transparency. These platforms rely on blockchain architecture instead of personal data, offering a different trust model. This article examines why decentralized betting remains relevant, what true decentralization looks like in practice, and which no-KYC sportsbooks have proven viable in a stricter regulatory environment. Dexsport — A Trusted Crypto Sportsbook Without KYC Dexsport is a Web3-native sportsbook and casino designed for multi-chain crypto betting without identity verification. Built around instant access and self-custody, it allows users to register via email, Telegram, or DeFi wallets such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet and start betting immediately. Key characteristics of Dexsport include: No-KYC, wallet-native accessUsers retain full control over their funds, with no mandatory identity checks or custodial balances. Multi-chain crypto supportBets can be placed using Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tron, stablecoins, and other assets across multiple blockchains. Deep sportsbook coverageOver 100 betting options per match across major sports like football, basketball, MMA, and tennis, plus esports markets including CS2, Dota 2, and Valorant. Live betting and streamingIn-play markets are supported, with live streams available even without an active balance. Large casino libraryAccess to 10,000+ games, including slots, roulette, crash formats, and live dealer titles, all available without KYC. Transparent and verifiable architectureBets and outcomes are displayed via a public live betting desk, allowing real-time verification rather than opaque settlement. Audited and licensed operationDexsport operates under a recognized gambling license and has undergone smart-contract audits by CertiK and Pessimistic. Taken together, Dexsport illustrates how decentralized betting can function in practice: combining no-KYC access, on-chain transparency, and broad crypto support within a single sportsbook and casino ecosystem. Another Crypto Sports Betting Sites Alongside fully Web3-native platforms like Dexsport, several other crypto sportsbooks operate with limited or no KYC while offering varying degrees of decentralization. These platforms differ in custody models, transparency, and target audience, making them suitable for different types of bettors. Betplay — Fast Crypto Betting with Lightning Network Support Betplay is designed for speed-focused crypto bettors who want access to sports betting, live casino games, and poker from a single account. Its standout feature is Bitcoin Lightning Network support, which enables near-instant deposits and withdrawals and makes it well suited for fast, on-chain play. The platform supports BTC (both Lightning and on-chain), ETH, USDT, and several other cryptocurrencies. Registration is simple and does not require KYC under normal conditions, allowing users to start betting quickly. Sports coverage spans more than 40 disciplines, including esports, with a solid range of markets such as handicaps, correct score, and futures. Betplay operates without a traditional gambling license, which means higher wagering requirements and occasional payout delays can occur. Still, its speed, Lightning integration, and all-in-one account structure keep it attractive to users who prioritize fast execution over formal regulation. BetPanda — Privacy-Focused Betting with a Strong Casino Core BetPanda blends a crypto sportsbook with a casino offering more than 3,000 games from established providers like NetEnt, Pragmatic Play, and Play’n GO. In addition to slots, the platform includes crash games, table games, and live dealer titles, all accessible with instant crypto transactions. Supporting over 13 cryptocurrencies — including BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC, DOGE, and BNB — BetPanda emphasizes anonymity. Most users can play without KYC, and deposits and withdrawals are typically processed quickly. The sportsbook covers major global sports and some niche events, with live betting available, though market depth and advanced features are more limited than on larger platforms. Promotions focus more on cashback and VIP rewards than aggressive sports bonuses, making BetPanda better suited to users who value privacy and casino play over extensive sportsbook tools. Mega Dice — Large-Scale Crypto Casino with Expanding Sports Markets Mega Dice positions itself as a broad crypto gambling platform, combining a sizable casino with a growing sportsbook. The game library includes more than 5,000 titles from dozens of providers, alongside coverage of 35–40+ sports and esports markets. The platform supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, and many alternative assets, making it flexible for multi-coin users. Registration is fast via email or wallet connection, and no KYC is required for standard play. Live betting is supported, though sports markets are still developing and may feel less deep than those of dedicated sportsbooks. Mega Dice appeals to users who want variety in one place — casino games, sports betting, promotions, and crypto flexibility — even if it doesn’t yet match the depth of more specialized betting platforms. Why No KYC Betting Is Still Popular No-KYC betting platforms remain popular because they reduce custodial risk rather than simply avoiding verification. Traditional sportsbooks require identity checks and hold user funds, while no-KYC platforms allow bettors to interact directly through crypto wallets and retain control over their balances. Tighter regulation has increased data collection and account monitoring on custodial platforms, pushing some users toward wallet-native alternatives. Importantly, no-KYC does not automatically mean unregulated or unsafe—many decentralized sportsbooks rely on audited smart contracts, on-chain settlement, and transparent bet tracking to replace trust in intermediaries with verifiable systems. What “Decentralized Betting” Actually Means Decentralized betting is often used as a marketing label, but in practice it refers to how a platform handles custody, settlement, and transparency. Truly decentralized sportsbooks do not hold user funds in internal accounts. Instead, bets are placed through wallet-native interactions, with balances remaining under user control and settlements handled on-chain. This model differs sharply from custodial sportsbooks that simply accept crypto deposits while operating behind closed systems. In decentralized betting, smart contracts, public bet logs, and third-party audits replace trust in an operator. The more a platform relies on verifiable on-chain logic and transparent settlement, the closer it comes to genuine decentralization rather than branding alone. Final Perspective — The Future of Decentralized Sports Betting By 2026, decentralized sports betting has become a defined alternative rather than a niche experiment. No-KYC sportsbooks remain relevant because they reduce custodial risk and give users greater control through wallet-native access and transparent systems. Platforms like Dexsport highlight where this model is heading, combining true no-KYC access with audited infrastructure and on-chain bet visibility rather than relying on trust in an operator. Looking ahead, hybrid approaches are likely to dominate, but projects that place transparency and self-custody at the core—rather than treating them as features—will continue to shape the future of crypto sports betting beyond 2026.",More News,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-12-14 09:17:47
55766420,https://bitzo.com/2025/12/dynamic-crypto-collateral-how-to-swap-assets-while-maintaining-an-open-credit-line,1765704067,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/55766420.jpeg,Dynamic Crypto Collateral: How to Swap Assets While Maintaining an Open Credit Line,https://bitzo.com/2025/12/dynamic-crypto-collateral-how-to-swap-assets-while-maintaining-an-open-credit-line,"Crypto-backed credit lines have become a practical tool for investors who want liquidity without selling their digital assets. But as markets shift, the collateral you originally deposited may no longer be the optimal asset to support your credit line. Price movements, volatility, or a change in investment strategy can all create a need to adjust your collateral—ideally without closing your credit line or repaying the full balance. This is where dynamic collateral comes in. It allows borrowers to swap one crypto asset for another while keeping an active credit line open, preserving both liquidity and flexibility. The ability to adjust collateral on the fly represents a major evolution in crypto-backed borrowing. Below, we explain how dynamic collateral works, why it matters, and how platforms like Clapp make this process seamless. What Is Dynamic Collateral? Dynamic collateral is the capability to replace or adjust the crypto assets backing your credit line without interrupting the credit facility or triggering repayment. Instead of closing your loan to change collateral, you can simply swap the backing assets in real time. For example: If your credit line is backed by BTC, but you want to switch part of that collateral to ETH or SOL, dynamic collateral makes that possible without closing the credit line or affecting your liquidity. This flexibility allows borrowers to adapt to changing market conditions, rebalance their portfolios, or reduce risk—while still maintaining access to borrowed funds. How Dynamic Collateral Works Although implementation varies by platform, the general process is straightforward: Choose the asset you want to add or switch to (e.g., ETH instead of BTC). Deposit the new collateral while your credit line stays open. Withdraw or release the original collateral once the new asset fully covers your credit limit. The credit line remains uninterrupted, with no need for repayment or reapplication. As long as your LTV stays within safe limits, the system allows you to adjust your collateral portfolio freely. Clapp: A Practical Example of Dynamic Collateral in Action Clapp has built dynamic collateral directly into its crypto credit line system. This gives borrowers full control over the assets that back their credit limit—all without touching their outstanding balance or interrupting liquidity. Multi-Asset Support for Maximum Flexibility Clapp allows up to 19 different assets to serve as collateral, including BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, LINK, AVAX, and major stablecoins. With dynamic collateral, users can rebalance between these assets based on market conditions or strategic goals. Swap Collateral Without Closing the Credit Line Clapp enables borrowers to replace or adjust collateral at any time: You can add new collateral to strengthen your LTV. You can rotate from one asset to another while maintaining the same credit line. You can reduce exposure to riskier assets during volatility. This mechanism keeps the credit line intact, with no need to repay the balance. Pay-As-You-Use Structure Amplifies the Benefit Since Clapp charges interest only on the amount actually withdrawn—and unused credit has 0% APR —dynamic collateral fits naturally into its flexible credit model. Borrowers can fine-tune collateral positions while maintaining low carrying costs. Real-Time Liquidity Paired With Real-Time Collateral Management Because both borrowing and collateral adjustments are instant, Clapp functions as a dynamic liquidity tool. Users can respond to market shifts in real time while staying fully funded. When Dynamic Collateral Is Especially Useful Dynamic collateral offers practical advantages in several situations: Market volatility: Swap from high-risk to more stable assets to protect your credit line. Portfolio shifts: Add assets you want to accumulate long-term. Liquidity management: Release a portion of collateral when another asset becomes preferable. Strategic borrowing: Maintain optimal LTV levels without pausing your credit line. It gives borrowers the freedom to adjust their strategy without sacrificing liquidity. Final Thoughts Dynamic collateral represents the next generation of crypto-backed borrowing. It transforms credit lines from static lending tools into flexible, adaptive financial instruments. Borrowers gain the ability to rebalance portfolios, manage risk, and optimize collateral—all while keeping uninterrupted access to liquidity. Platforms like Clapp demonstrate how user-oriented borrowing can evolve. With multi-asset collateral, flexible repayment, pay-as-you-use interest, and dynamic collateral management, Clapp provides one of the most versatile and resilient credit-line structures in the crypto space. FAQ: Dynamic Collateral for Crypto Credit Lines What is dynamic collateral? Dynamic collateral is the ability to replace or adjust the crypto assets backing your credit line without closing the credit facility or repaying your entire balance. It lets you switch from one asset to another while keeping full access to liquidity. Why would I want to swap collateral? You may want to rebalance during market volatility, switch to assets you believe will perform better, reduce exposure to riskier tokens, or simply update your collateral strategy—all without interrupting your borrowing. Does swapping collateral close my credit line? No. With dynamic collateral, your credit line remains fully active. You can continue using your available limit and maintain liquidity while adjusting the assets that secure the credit line. How does Clapp support dynamic collateral? Clapp allows up to 19 assets—including BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, LINK, and stablecoins—to serve as collateral. Users can deposit new collateral, release old collateral, or rotate assets at any time as long as their LTV remains healthy. The credit line stays open throughout the process. Do I need to repay my outstanding balance to change collateral? No. Platforms like Clapp let you rebalance or replace collateral even if you have an active balance. The only requirement is maintaining a safe loan-to-value ratio after the adjustment. Is dynamic collateral safe? Dynamic collateral is safe when managed responsibly. Your LTV must stay within the platform’s limits to avoid liquidation. Swapping into highly volatile assets can increase risk, while swapping into more stable assets can reduce it. Will switching collateral affect my interest rate? No. The interest rate on a revolving credit line—such as Clapp’s 2.9% APR—does not change when you update your collateral. Interest is calculated only on the amount you have actually withdrawn. Who benefits most from dynamic collateral? Long-term holders, active traders, and users managing multi-asset portfolios benefit the most. Dynamic collateral allows them to adapt to market conditions, protect their exposure, and optimize borrowing without interrupting their credit line.

In 2026, the most competitive platforms are moving away from rigid loan structures and toward flexible models that let users control repayment, collateral management, and interest costs more effectively. Below are five crypto lending platforms offering the most adaptable terms this year, starting with Clapp , a flexible credit-line provider that has reshaped how users approach crypto-backed borrowing. 1. Clapp — Most Flexible Crypto Credit Line in 2026 Clapp leads the list for its revolving crypto credit line that gives users continuous, on-demand access to liquidity. The key distinction is the pay-as-you-use structure: borrowers pay interest only on the portion of funds they actually withdraw, while the rest of the credit limit remains at 0% APR. What sets Clapp apart in 2026: 0% APR on unused funds No repayment schedule — users repay anytime Multi-collateral support for up to 19 assets, including BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, LINK, and stablecoins Instant access 24/7 to USDT, USDC, or EUR Full integration with a wallet and in-app exchange For users looking to borrow against crypto without overpaying or committing to fixed terms, Clapp offers the most flexible structure available. 2. Nexo — Borrowing Options with Built-In Yield Features Nexo remains one of the most established names in the crypto lending market, offering both instant crypto credit lines and traditional loans. While not as granular or cost-efficient as Clapp’s pay-as-you-use model, Nexo provides a wide range of collateral options and borrowing tiers. Notable features: Variable interest rates depending on loyalty tier Borrowing in multiple fiat currencies and stablecoins Option to earn yield on unborrowed assets Flexible repayment without penalties Nexo is a strong choice for users who want a balance of borrowing flexibility and yield-generation tools. 3. Binance Loans — High Liquidity and Broad Asset Support Binance Loans offers straightforward crypto-backed loans backed by the liquidity of one of the world’s largest exchanges. Borrowers can access stablecoins or other cryptocurrencies against a wide selection of collateral assets. Key advantages: High liquidity and fast loan execution Long list of supported collateral and borrowable assets Different loan terms and LTV options Integrated repayment and collateral management within the exchange Binance Loans appeals to users comfortable operating within a centralized exchange environment who want predictable terms and dependable liquidity. 4. CoinRabbit — Fast, Simple Loans with Minimal Friction CoinRabbit focuses on delivering rapid access to crypto loans with minimal onboarding requirements. Its structure is straightforward: users deposit collateral, choose their loan amount, and receive liquidity quickly without extensive verification steps. Features: Very fast approval process Broad collateral support, including many altcoins No monthly payment requirements; flexible repayment windows Designed for users who want simple, centralized borrowing CoinRabbit’s ease of use makes it appealing to borrowers who prioritize speed and simplicity over more advanced features. 5. Arch Lending — Long-Term Borrowing with Predictable Terms Arch Lending rounds out the list with a model tailored to borrowers who need longer-term, stable loan structures. Unlike flexible credit lines, Arch provides fixed-term loans with clear repayment expectations and lower risk for users who prefer defined timelines. What Arch offers: Competitive fixed APRs Clear repayment schedules Support for major assets like BTC and ETH Longer-term loan options suitable for strategic planning Arch Lending fits borrowers who want predictability and stability rather than ongoing credit access. Choosing the Flexible Crypto Lending Platform in 2026 Platform Type Interest Structure Collateral Options Repayment Flexibility Liquidity Availability Best For Clapp Credit Line Revolving crypto credit line Interest only on funds used; 0% APR on unused limit Up to 19 assets (BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, LINK, stablecoins) No schedule; repay anytime Instant 24/7 in USDT, USDC, EUR Users who want maximum flexibility and cost efficiency Nexo CeFi credit line & loans Variable based on loyalty tier Wide asset selection Flexible, no penalties Instant in multiple currencies Borrowers seeking credit plus yield features Binance Loans Exchange-based crypto loans Fixed or variable depending on product Broad asset support Flexible within set loan terms Fast via exchange ecosystem Users who want borrowing integrated with a major exchange CoinRabbit CeFi crypto loan Interest on full borrowed amount Large range of crypto assets No monthly payments; repay anytime Very fast approvals Users who want simple, frictionless borrowing Arch Lending Fixed-term crypto loans Fixed APR for set loan duration Major assets like BTC, ETH Scheduled payments Fast but based on term structure Borrowers who prefer predictability and defined timelines Final Words Each of these platforms serves a different borrowing style: Clapp offers the most flexible structure with pay-as-you-use interest, no repayment dates, and multi-collateral support. Nexo combines flexible credit lines with yield features. Binance Loans delivers reliable liquidity through a major exchange ecosystem. CoinRabbit emphasizes speed and ease of use. Arch Lending provides long-term loan options with defined repayment terms. Together, they represent the most adaptable crypto lending solutions available in 2026, giving users multiple ways to unlock liquidity without selling their assets.

When markets are volatile—or when selling would trigger taxes or reduce future upside—borrowing USDT against your digital assets offers a practical, efficient alternative. You keep your crypto, maintain exposure to potential price appreciation, and still get the stablecoin liquidity you need. One of the most streamlined ways to do this today is through revolving crypto credit lines, with platforms like Clapp making the process especially flexible. Instead of forcing borrowers into fixed loan structures, Clapp provides an on-demand credit limit where interest applies only to what you actually withdraw. This approach helps users access liquidity while keeping borrowing costs low and preserving full control over their collateral. This guide explains how USDT loans work, the borrowing models available, and why modern credit-line platforms like Clapp are becoming the preferred method for unlocking stablecoin liquidity without selling a single satoshi or wei. Why Borrow USDT Instead of Selling Crypto? Borrowing USDT against your crypto provides several advantages: No taxable sale in many jurisdictions Preserved exposure to Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other holdings Instant liquidity in a stable asset Flexibility to repay on your terms Avoiding forced selling during market dips For anyone who wants short-term liquidity while protecting long-term investments, borrowing is often the more strategic option. Methods to Get a USDT Loan Without Selling Crypto There are three primary ways to borrow USDT while keeping your crypto intact. Each offers a different balance of flexibility, cost, and complexity. 1. Crypto Credit Lines: Flexible, Efficient, and User-Friendly A crypto credit line works similarly to a revolving credit facility. Instead of receiving one fixed loan, you get a credit limit backed by your crypto. You can withdraw USDT at any time and repay whenever you choose. The key advantage: Interest applies only to the amount you withdraw, not to your full credit limit. This model is especially useful when you need liquidity on demand but want to minimize carrying costs. Clapp: A Strong Example of a Crypto Credit Line Clapp offers a pay-as-you-use credit-line structure with several advantages: Interest only on withdrawn amounts; unused limit stays at 0% APR Instant USDT access, available 24/7 Multi-collateral support for 19 assets (BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, LINK, stablecoins) No fixed repayment schedule This structure makes Clapp a practical tool for long-term holders who want efficient liquidity without the rigidity of traditional loans. 2. Traditional Crypto-Backed Loans A traditional crypto loan gives you a fixed amount of USDT upfront. Interest starts accruing on the full balance immediately, and repayment schedules are usually predetermined. This setup works well when: You know exactly how much USDT you need You are comfortable with fixed terms You prefer structured borrowing However, it lacks the flexibility of credit lines and is less cost-efficient when you only need partial liquidity. 3. DeFi Borrowing Using Wrapped Crypto On-chain protocols such as Aave, Compound, or Maker allow experienced users to borrow USDT against wrapped versions of crypto—such as WBTC or wETH. Advantages:Fully decentralized control and transparency through smart contracts. Drawbacks:Technical complexity, gas fees, and a higher risk of liquidation in fast-moving markets. DeFi borrowing is best for users who actively manage collateral ratios and understand on-chain lending mechanics. Final Thoughts You don’t need to sell your crypto to access liquidity. Borrowing USDT against your digital assets gives you cash flow without sacrificing long-term upside or creating taxable sales. With the rise of user-friendly credit-line platforms like Clapp , crypto-backed borrowing has evolved into one of the most practical financial tools available to investors.

The names that continue popping up as people look at what crypto to buy today based on market analysis include Ripple and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The trend for tokens seeing structural strength instead of speculation-driven moves has been influential for market sentiment, and as a result, XRP and MUTM have been some of the cryptos that people believe will be next to explode. Ripple Gets Supply Relief as Selling Pace Slows Down XRP continues to undergo a tough month, going down by approximately -18% within 30 days and an additional -4% within 24 hours. The cryptocurrency is still Range Bound within a tight price range that has maintained low volatility and limited market participation. Despite that, it has been observed that there has been an important trend developing: there has been a considerable decrease in selling pressure. According to Glassnode statistics, XRP decreased its distribution from more than 101 million XRP on December 3 to approximately 51 million XRP on December 10, a decline of almost 49%. XRP market technicians are also watching a larger buildup pattern developing on larger time frames. The price level has engaged with the 0.382 to 0.5 Fibonacci demand area and is set to start moving upwards, as seen before its large breakout in 2017. A full completion of the pattern would see the price potentially reaching as high as $27.57, which would see XRP feature among the list of top cryptocurrencies making a recovery in 2025. Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum The presale event of Mutuum Finance keeps registering the strongest demand surge ever as it nears completion at 98% in Phase 6. Those who have been looking for the best cryptocurrency to invest in have been acquiring tokens at an accelerated rate due to the fact that this presale event will be the last chance for them to own it at a price of $0.035, as afterward, it will be sold at a higher rate. A total of $19,500,000 and 18,480 holders have joined so far. The price has already appreciated by 250% from its initial value of $0.01 based on an original valuation, and it will appreciate an additional almost 20% to $0.04 before reaching the launch price of $0.06. Those who acquire at the current price are set for an appreciation of 350% once it goes live. The demand has intensified given that the remaining allocation for Phase 6 continues to dwindle, and traders who normally look for the next big thing in crypto have been reacting swiftly to get an early start on the next price movement. The project continues to put out live updates, and it continues to enhance its reputation for transparency among investors who are choosing which crypto to buy today. Leaderboard Activity Fuels Constant Engagement Mutuum Finance (MUTM) retains a high level of daily engagement with its leaderboard reward system. The leaderboard ranks the top 50 participants, and it resets every 24 hours at 00:00 UTC. The participant who moves to position one gets a $500 bonus reward of MUTM once they have conducted at least one transaction within the session. It is with this program that Mutuum Finance retains a high level of daily engagement even on sluggish market times. Just about every trader wants an active market. Independent Audit Ensures Credibility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently engaged with a comprehensive security review conducted by Halborn Security. It will review various contracts within the lending and borrowing functionality. It’s one of the most reassuring developments for a buyer researching which crypto to invest in today, as there have been very limited third-party verifications among these emerging assets. The audit process contributes an additional degree of credibility among these developments, helping it remain at the forefront as among the best crypto to invest in based on a price point below $0.04. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) remains at the forefront due to the growing interest in visible tokens with limited-time price opportunities. Phase 6 is almost sold out, and getting into it at the price of $0.035 soon will be impossible, therefore making timing an essential factor for anyone interested in getting a strategic entry before the next price phase.

In a move poised to reshape cross-border payments, SWIFT , the global interbank messaging network, has confirmed it is building a blockchain-based ledger. Notably, this announcement has sparked speculation across the financial and crypto communities: Could this new ledger resemble the XRP Ledger (XRPL), renowned for fast, low-cost international transactions? SWIFT is modernizing cross-border payments with a blockchain-based ledger. Traditionally slowed by multiple intermediaries, international transactions can take days to settle. SWIFT’s shared, real-time ledger lets authorized institutions view every payment simultaneously, cutting delays, reconciliation errors, and operational friction. SWIFT hasn’t confirmed whether it will use the XRP Ledger or Ripple technology, but the parallels are clear. Both aim for fast, low-cost, real-time settlements between financial institutions. Therefore, SWIFT’s blockchain ledger could transform international banking. By enabling “always-on” payments, it offers near-instant access to funds, improved liquidity management, and reduced reliance on intermediaries—potentially lowering transaction costs. For financial institutions, the shared ledger provides real-time transaction visibility, enhancing risk management, efficiency, and settlement speed. For corporates and consumers, it promises faster cross-border payments, a smoother experience, and greater predictability. Though details on its architecture, blockchain protocol, and interoperability with networks like the XRP Ledger remain unclear, SWIFT’s foray into blockchain marks a turning point for global payments. The industry will keenly watch whether Swift’s ledger merely mirrors existing networks or pioneers new capabilities that could transform cross-border finance. Well, SWIFT’s blockchain initiative highlights a pivotal shift whereby leading financial institutions now see distributed ledger technology not as a fintech experiment, but as the future backbone of global payments. Conclusion SWIFT’s launch of a blockchain-based ledger signals a major shift in cross-border payments. By enabling real-time, secure, and transparent transaction tracking, it promises faster settlements, lower costs, and greater operational efficiency for banks worldwide. While it’s unclear if the ledger will leverage the XRP Ledger, SWIFT’s move underscores that distributed ledger technology is moving from theory to a core driver of global finance, potentially making instant, always-on payments the new standard.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-14 09:37:20

According to authorities, the criminals used the bank accounts to route illegal funds, moving them through hawala channels and digital asset transactions. According to the Indian police, the criminal syndicate has been able to launder funds in excess of Rs. 5.24 crore (approximately $578,724), which authorities were able to trace to a single account. Indian police noted that their attention was drawn to the syndicate, which operated out of a hotel in Dwarka. After carrying out due diligence and acting on a sure tip-off, they carried out a raid on the location, arresting four individuals connected to the criminal network. Indian police arrest nine suspects over illegal crypto activities According to the police, the four suspects arrested in the first raid were identified as Sultan Salim Shaikh, Sayed Ahmad Choudhary, Satish Kumar, and Tushar Maliya. Upon interrogation, the accused disclosed that they were a large-scale fraud syndicate that carried out fraudulent activities on the instructions of a top brass in their network. The suspects claimed they usually change locations to evade police raids and detection. During the interrogation, Shaikh revealed that he opened a current account with a bank some months ago at the instruction given by another handler, who promised him a 25% commission from any transaction that was carried out using the bank account. He also confessed to knowing that the bank account was being used for criminal activities, noting that he was given a mobile phone as part of the arrangement with the handler of the account. According to DCP (IFSO) Vinit Kumar, after analysis was carried out on the bank account, it showed that the suspect opened it with an initial deposit of Rs. 25,421 and has been using it for fraudulent activities since then. Between November 21 and 26, more than 10,423 transactions were carried out using the account, with the total transactions worth Rs. 5.24 crore. The police carried out subsequent raids, which led to the arrest of five more suspects: Shivam, Parbhu Dayal, Suresh Kumar Kumawat, Tarun Sharma, and Sunil. Authorities warn perpetrators to desist The authorities claimed that Kumawat emerged as an important link between the account suppliers and the leaders of the syndicate. He was in charge of laundering illegal proceeds through hawala channels. The money trail also involved some transactions where cash was withdrawn and paid to peer-to-peer operators who sent the criminals digital assets, which were always in the form of Tether’s USDT. The criminals then moved the USDT to those dictating the play at the top. The police claimed that investigations remain ongoing as they intend to get to the root of the issue. They have also issued a warning to criminals still at large, urging them to desist from their acts before the long arm of the law catches up with them. The Indian police have also issued several warnings to residents to be careful, as these criminals are coming up with more sophisticated means to target them and steal their funds. The rate of crypto-related crimes in India is currently on the rise, with authorities making moves to apprehend as many as possible. In a similar case, a transporter claimed he was scammed of Rs. 16 lakh after he was introduced to a fake crypto investment operated through a fake website. The victim was contacted on WhatsApp by a woman who promised to introduce him to a high-paying investment scheme. After subsequent chats, he sent the funds, and after a while, he discovered that he was unable to withdraw his funds.

Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA), both known for their massive early surges, are now showing weaker momentum, causing investors to refocus their attention on a new DeFi crypto priced at $0.035. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of the most watched tokens of the quarter as allocation tightens and development prepares for its next major phase. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin became one of the most recognizable assets in crypto after its explosive early run. Backed by social sentiment, heavy online presence and viral energy, DOGE rose from fractions of a cent into billions in market cap. That rise created life-changing gains for some holders. But those days are now fading. DOGE’s current market cap makes fast growth unlikely. Analysts reviewing its long-term charts expect mild recovery at best. Even optimistic forecasts show only 5% to 15% upside over extended periods. DOGE depends on hype to move. Without that hype, the token has stalled, trapped under key resistance levels and losing visibility among serious investors. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) also delivered a major surge in its early years. Its research-driven development approach and smart contract roadmap helped push ADA into a multi-billion market cap. Early supporters saw significant upside as the project gained global attention. Today ADA faces the same limitation as DOGE. Its valuation is too large to deliver explosive growth. ADA’s price continues to drift, stuck below the $0.50 zone. Many analysts believe ADA may only rise 10% to 20% without a major breakthrough. Competition in the smart contract space is also stronger than ever, reducing ADA’s ability to regain early momentum. These factors have led many early ADA investors to begin comparing new assets that sit at the bottom of their growth curves rather than the top. Mutuum Finance has become a leading candidate among those discussions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a decentralized lending protocol designed to support structured borrowing and lending. The system allows users to supply assets such as ETH or USDT while receiving mtTokens. These mtTokens increase in value when borrowers repay interest, creating yield tied to real activity. Borrowers use a dynamic model where interest levels change with liquidity, and loan to value limits protect positions from sudden volatility. This dual lending structure offers real functionality instead of relying on sentiment. Mutuum Finance began in early 2025 at $0.01 and has now climbed to $0.035, marking a 250% rise. The project has raised $19.250M, built a holder base of 18,500, and sold 815M tokens. Out of the total supply of 4B MUTM, 1.82B tokens, or 45.5%, were allocated to early buyers. Phase 6 is now over 96% allocated, with only a small amount left before Phase 7 introduces a near 20% price increase. The V1 testnet is confirmed for Q4 2025 through the official X account. V1 will include the lending pool, mtTokens, liquidation engine and debt module. ETH and USDT will be supported at launch, marking the first time users can interact with the protocol live. These combined updates explain why many traders view MUTM as one of the top crypto investments under $0.05. Yield Model and Oracle Development Mutuum Finance uses a tokenized yield system built around mtTokens. As borrowers repay interest, mtTokens become more valuable. A user who supplies $600 in ETH may see mtTokens grow as adoption increases. This gives MUTM a utility-driven foundation. The buy and distribute model reinforces this. A portion of the platform’s revenue is used to buy MUTM from the open market. Purchased tokens are then distributed to mtToken stakers. This creates natural buy pressure and rewards participation in the lending pool. Mutuum Finance is also developing an oracle system centered around Chainlink feeds. Accurate pricing is essential for lending protocols because incorrect values can result in faulty liquidations. By using Chainlink alongside additional data layers, the protocol aims to protect collateral positions and strengthen overall security. Because of these mechanics, analysts reviewing crypto predictions expect Mutuum Finance to reach a 5x to 7x range after V1 if borrower activity grows as projected. Long-term models show possible upside extending into the 400% to 600% range through 2027 if stablecoin borrowing and liquidity expansion support broader adoption. Layer-2 Expansion Prepare MUTM for Larger Growth Mutuum Finance is developing a USD-pegged stablecoin backed by borrower interest. This stablecoin will increase liquidity, offer predictable borrowing conditions and expand the set of assets available to users. Stablecoins are essential for lending platforms because they stabilize loan structures and support cross-asset borrowing. Layer-2 expansion is another core part of the roadmap. L2 networks offer faster transaction speeds and lower fees. Lending platforms depend on quick updates to collateral, liquidation triggers and interest movement. L2 integration will allow Mutuum Finance to operate smoothly as activity increases. These upgrades place the project in a strong position for the next cycle and separate it from meme tokens like DOGE and SHIB, which rely on sentiment, not utility. Security and Why Investors Are Moving Fast Mutuum Finance has completed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 Token Scan score. Halborn Security is reviewing the deeper logic behind collateral, interest and liquidation behavior. A $50,000 bug bounty is active for developers to help test the system. These layers give investors confidence that the protocol is preparing for live usage with safety at the center. The project’s 24-hour leaderboard also encourages daily participation, rewarding the top contributor with $500 MUTM. Card payment support increases accessibility, helping expand the global user base. With Phase 6 now above 96%, urgency is building fast. A recent whale entry of $115K accelerated the allocation even further, leaving only a small portion available at the current $0.035 price. Dogecoin and Cardano face limited upside. Mutuum Finance sits at the opposite end of the cycle. It is developing, utility-driven, audited, approaching a major release and nearly sold out in its key allocation stage.

The chart indicates where supply moved on-chain, highlighting price levels in which large amounts of XRP are held . These zones often act as friction points during rallies and pullbacks. Martinez summarized the data, stating that it highlights resistance at $2.17 and support at $1.96 and $1.78. Data from @glassnode highlights three key levels for $XRP : • $2.17 resistance • $1.96 and $1.78 support pic.twitter.com/WGxHPAVsv5 — Ali (@alicharts) December 12, 2025 What the Cost Basis Data Shows The heatmap displays dense supply bands layered across XRP’s recent range. The most concentrated cluster sits near $2.17. This level marks an area where a large share of tokens last changed hands . Traders who entered there may look to exit if the price returns, adding sell pressure. That makes $2.17 a clear ceiling unless demand overwhelms supply. Below the current price of $2.03, two major accumulation zones stand out. The first sits near $1.96. XRP has rebounded from this level multiple times in 2025. If XRP revisits this area, buyers who defended it before may step in again. The second zone at $1.78 reflects older accumulation. It represents deeper support where long-term holders built positions during earlier consolidation . Martinez did not project targets or timelines. He focused strictly on the levels identified by Glassnode’s data. The structure itself, however, offers insight into how XRP could behave as volatility returns. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 How These Levels Shape Near-Term Price Action If XRP pushes toward $2.17, the reaction there matters more than the move itself. A sharp rejection would confirm that sellers remain active at that level. That outcome would likely send the price back toward $1.96 for another test. Repeated tests weaken support, especially if volume fades. However, a clean break above $2.17 would signal absorption of supply. That scenario suggests stronger hands are willing to buy through resistance. A well-respected analyst recently highlighted $2.73 as a next short-term target , and a breakout could send XRP there. Once that overhead supply clears, the price often moves faster due to thinner resistance above. On the downside, failure to hold $1.96 shifts focus to $1.78. That level carries more weight because of the size and age of the accumulated supply. A strong bounce there would reinforce it as a structural floor. A decisive break would suggest that holders from earlier cycles have begun to exit. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin’s muted price action near $90,000 is being driven by covered call selling from long-term holders rather than weak spot demand. Market makers hedging those options by selling BTC are adding steady sell-side pressure that caps rallies. Options market activity is increasingly shaping short-term Bitcoin price moves, even as ETF inflows remain strong. He argues that widespread covered call selling by Bitcoin “whales” is quietly suppressing spot prices, even as institutional interest through exchange-traded funds remains strong. Bitcoin OGs Turn to Covered Calls to Generate Yield on Long-Held BTC Covered calls involve selling call options against Bitcoin already held, allowing sellers to collect premiums while giving buyers the right to purchase BTC at a predetermined price. Park said this strategy is increasingly favored by long-term holders, often referred to as “OGs,” who accumulated Bitcoin years ago and now use options markets to generate short-term income. The impact, however, extends beyond the options market. Market makers who buy these call options must hedge their exposure, typically by selling spot Bitcoin. That hedging activity introduces persistent sell-side pressure, pushing prices lower or capping rallies. “When you sell calls against Bitcoin you’ve held for more than a decade, the only fresh market exposure comes from the call selling itself,” Park said. “That exposure is negative, making the seller a net source of downward pressure.” Tom Lee: Bitcoin very likely hits $100k, maybe new ATH Same guy who said $250k by year end Now backpedaling to barely above current price while calling it bullish This is what talking your bags looks like when the trade goes against you https://t.co/eQf5mnnUUo pic.twitter.com/5U6KRVWlfX — Leshka.eth (@leshka_eth) December 14, 2025 Because the Bitcoin used to back these options already exists and does not represent new demand, the strategy fails to add fresh liquidity to the market. Instead, it shifts price influence toward derivatives trading, where options flows increasingly dictate short-term price action. Park said this dynamic helps explain why Bitcoin has remained choppy despite steady inflows into spot ETFs. The trend has coincided with Bitcoin’s partial decoupling from US equities in the latter half of 2025. While major stock indices continued to hit record highs, Bitcoin retreated from earlier peaks and hovered near $90,000. Some analysts had previously pointed to Bitcoin’s correlation with tech stocks, but recent price behavior suggests different forces are now at play. Analysts Split on Bitcoin’s Next Move as Fed Rate Cuts Loom Looking ahead, opinions remain divided. Several analysts expect Bitcoin to resume its rally once the US Federal Reserve continues its rate-cutting cycle, which would inject liquidity into financial markets and favor risk assets. CME Group’s FedWatch tool shows that 24.4% of traders are pricing in another rate cut at the January FOMC meeting. Others remain cautious. A growing camp warns that if covered call selling persists and macro conditions fail to improve, Bitcoin could revisit lower levels, with some projecting a drop toward $76,000. Last week, Bitfinex said the market is showing “seller exhaustion” following a period of heavy deleveraging and panic-driven exits by short-term holders.

Now, though, both of these issues seem behind it. The launch was successful in February, while the team has integrated numerous updates to the verification system, which has simplified the process, and millions of users have passed the KYC procedure. As such, one of the news pages dedicated to covering PI developments outlined what might be the next logical step in the ecosystem’s evolution. Millions of pioneers have already completed Pi KYC.

Are you… pic.twitter.com/80l923Q074 — Pi News (@PiNewsMedia) December 13, 2025 Utility Apps Next? Utility applications, just like the name suggests, are meant to make people’s lives easier by solving real-life problems. Pi Network’s current path indeed seems to be heading down that road, which is evident from the recently-concluded hackathon. As reported earlier this week, the team outlined the three winners and five honorable mentions, and the trend appears clear. The winner was Blind_Lounge – a privacy-first social and dating platform allowing people to connect anonymously and reveal identities only by mutual choice. In other words, it’s a utility app for dating. Interestingly, one of the honorable mentions (Kindrek) is a similar platform. The second place went to Starmax – a loyalty program app enabling Pioneers to spend the native token at participating businesses and earn rewards for their engagement. Another rep of the honorable mentions – Workflet for Pi – also falls into the utility category, as it serves as a platform built around role-based workspaces for productivity and collaboration. PallyPay and SimpleJoy have utility functions as well. The former is a group payment and bill-splitting app for everyday transactions like meals and trips, while the latter offers a curated library of full open-source, browser-based games that are free to play and easy to access. PI Price Update Despite the most recent developments within the Pi Network ecosystem, which included the integration of additional AI tools as well as some partnerships, the protocol’s native token has lost its October/November momentum. At the time, it stood close to $0.30 but it has dumped by nearly 50% since then and now struggles to remain above $0.20. It’s worth noting that its all-time low is at $0.172, which means that PI is not far from charting another one soon. ChatGPT believes there’s such a possibility in the week ahead, especially if it loses the $0.18-$0.19 support.

XRP Update (@XrpUdate), a crypto pundit with a large XRP-focused audience, suggested that buying XRP ahead of a potential Elon Musk announcement could be a smart move. The post offered no further details. That silence has driven intense speculation across the community as traders attempt to connect recent events surrounding Musk and his platform, X. XRP has a long history of reacting sharply to narratives tied to real-world usage and high-profile endorsements. With Musk preparing to roll out X Payments and facing regulatory pressure in Europe, the timing of the post has not gone unnoticed. Buy $XRP before Elon ANNOUNCES IT — XRP Update (@XrpUdate) December 12, 2025 XRP Update Signals Possible Catalyst XRP Update did not explain what the anticipated announcement could involve. The account also did not reference Musk directly in any official capacity. Still, the wording implied that something significant may be approaching . That was enough to fuel debate around two possible scenarios. Both theories tie back to recent developments involving Musk’s company and its financial future. Neither has been confirmed, and each carries very different consequences for XRP if they were to materialize. EU Fine Fuels Speculation The first theory centers on the €120 million fine (roughly $140 million) imposed on X by European regulators. Some community members have speculated that Musk could offset that cost through a strategic crypto investment. The idea suggests that Musk could acquire around $200 million in XRP , hold it into 2026, then use the gains to cover the penalty. Musk has not hinted at any such plan. Still, traders point to his history of market-moving comments and his past involvement with digital assets. Experts have also shared bullish predictions for XRP in 2026 . They believe Musk could make enough money to settle the fine through this strategy. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 X Payments Integration Narrative Returns The second theory involves X Payments. Musk has made it clear that payments will play a central role in X’s evolution. The system is expected to support peer-to-peer transfers and creator payments. That has reopened long-standing calls for XRP integration due to its focus on fast settlement and low transaction costs. The XRP community has pushed this narrative for years. No confirmation has ever come from Musk or X. Even so, speculation has intensified as the launch draws closer. If XRP were selected as a settlement or liquidity layer within X Payments, it would mark one of the most visible real-world use cases in the asset’s history.

According to reports from local media, the new regulations are set to be implemented next month and come amid concerns among businesses in the industry. Startups and businesses in the South Korean artificial intelligence sector have been calling on the government for a while. According to reports from industry sources, they have noted that the current regulations concerning the industry could stifle its growth and create an unnecessary burden on smaller firms. The AI framework act is expected to take effect on January 22, 2026, putting the needed guardrails into place to ensure the industry excels. South Korea set to implement AI framework in January According to industry sources , the national AI framework act, which is expected to take effect in January, will call for the establishment of a national AI committee, the formulation of a basic three-year AI plan, and the imposition of safety and transparency requirements, including disclosure obligations for some AI systems. If implemented, Korea would become the first country in the world to enforce a comprehensive AI regulatory framework. The European Union was the first to pass a regulation concerning artificial intelligence. However, it has plans to start applying most of the rules starting in August, with other provisions expected to be delayed until 2027. The regulations are also coming amid mounting pressures from businesses and firms as the global artificial intelligence race continues to heat up. “Companies may not have sufficient time to prepare for the new rules, as the enforcement decree is expected to be finalized only shortly before the law takes effect due to procedural requirements,” an official from the Korea Internet Corporations Association said. “This will be particularly overwhelming for startups.” AI startups grumble at the regulatory requirements A recent survey carried out by Startup Alliance showed that 98% of the 101 local AI companies said they have yet to establish a response system to comply with the new law. During the survey, 48.5% of the respondents mentioned that they were unfamiliar with the law and unprepared, while another 48.5% mentioned that they were prepared for the law, but were still not adequately prepared for it. “If the current implementation timeline is maintained, some companies may be forced to abruptly change or suspend services after Jan. 22,” another industry official said. The official mentioned that if the regulations are too strict, companies will have incentives to launch services overseas rather than in Korea. Meanwhile, industry watchers have noted that regulatory pressure is one of the major reasons why most Korean AI startups are considering Japan, which is looking at a softer approach. The worrisome aspect of the regulation is the mandatory watermarking rules that would require AI-generated content to be labeled to curb deepfakes and other forms of misuse. “Even AI-generated content often involves hundreds of people working to improve quality, but consumers may turn away once they are labeled as ‘AI-generated,'” an official at an AI content company said. The official also highlighted the unclear requirements concerning labeling, noting that the government did not take into consideration the views of those who fully understand content creation and other relevant experts. Meanwhile, this development comes as Korea joined other partners to sign a Pax Silica declaration. The development will ensure the countries involved will work together in building a trusted supply chain ecosystem for AI, critical minerals, and other areas.

Most larger-cap alts are also slightly in the red daily, as ETH is down to $3,100, while XRP sits at a pivotal support level at $2.00. Will BTC Lose the $90K Support? The primary cryptocurrency began the business week with high hopes of substantial price resurgance due to the FOMC meeting on Wednesday. A day before the US Fed met for the last time in 2025, the asset indeed went on the run and exploded by several grand to just over $94,500. It slipped following this multi-week peak but challenged it again on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve cut the rates by 25 bps. However, this was another fakeout as bitcoin quickly lost all of the momentum and dumped below $89,500. It bounced to $93,600 on Thursday afternoon, only to be rejected again on Friday and dip below $90,000. The bull managed to defend that level on Saturday, helping BTC climb to $90,500. However, the bears have been more persistent so far on Sunday as the cryptocurrency sits just under that coveted support. Its market cap has dropped below $1.8 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the altcoins is close to 57%. BTCUSD Dec 14. Source: TradingView Red and Green Most larger-cap alts are quite sluggish on a daily scale, so we will focus on their weekly performances. The chart reveals that although ETH has slipped by 1% in the past day, it’s actually 2% up weekly at $3,100. XRP has lost around 1% within the same timeframe and now struggles to remain above $2.00. TRX is down by 3%, while HBAR has plunged by 8%. In contrast, ZEC has exploded by 25% even though it has lost 5% of value since Saturday. MNT is up by 18% to $1.27, CC has gained 14%, while XMR has jumped by 9%. M has outperformed the rest with a 40% weekly surge, while QNT and KAS are down by 11% each.

Solana continues to be among the best cryptos to invest in based on infrastructure developments, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as the best cryptocurrency to invest in below $0.04 based on presale developments. Traders who analyze and determine which cryptocurrency to invest in are increasingly focusing on stability and future catalysts and have zeroed in on SOL and MUTM because of the upcoming market rebound. Solana Outlook Improves Despite Last Week’s Drop Solana continues to ride yet another tide of fluctuations, but it seems that experts hold a positive forecast on the midterm. The Solana price has fallen back into the $130 zone due to its inability to sustain a level above $140, but it should be noted that forecasts remain extremely bullish. According to forecasts, there could be a possibility of reaching $178 in 2025, $573 in 2028, and even $1,327 in 2031. Market sentiment prevailing within the Solana network remains generally positive despite some setbacks. Both overall sentiment and successful dApps and TVL growth are factors that make it clear why institutional investors remain interested in monitoring SOL as a leading cryptocurrency. Mutuum Finance Presale Acceleration Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been registering considerable interest during its presale and is currently in Phase 6, with 98% registration achieved. Those who are seeking the best cryptocurrency investment opportunities have been joining at a remarkable rate because it represents the last chance for getting MUTM at $0.035 before proceeding to the subsequent price level. A total of $19,500,000 worth of presale funds, with 18,480 holders, has been achieved. The current phase represents a 250% increase from the initial price of $0.01, and Phase 7’s adjustment at $0.04 is approaching soon, which will put more pressure on people who have not yet made a decision on which crypto to invest in. The listed price at $0.06 will bring an expected 400% increase for early birds. Momentum has been encouraged via the revamped dashboard, reflecting the top 50 holders and 24-hour leaderboard, which cycles daily at 00:00 UTC. The top investor will be awarded a bonus of $500 worth of MUTM once they have made at least one transaction, thus promoting activity. It should be noted that this dynamic continues as members have named MUTM the next big crypto in which they plan to invest at the start of 2026. A Framework That Suits All Lenders Mutuum Finance continues with its road map as it readies for the launch of its dual lending platform. The platform will include Peer-to-Contract markets for conventional ETH/USDT liquidity and Peer-to-Peer markets for individual borrower and lender connections. Both will be running concurrently to enable malleability and still allow for there being opportunities for return on investment. It should be noted that as a result of this roadmap, traders interested in finding out what the best cryptocurrency to invest in are looking to MUTM. Security Measures Strengthen Investor Confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been under an independent audit review conducted by Halborn Security, examining its lending and borrowing contracts. These additional checks, coupled with the presale transparency offered on a real-time basis, have offered confidence among participants observing what crypto to invest in at these times as they navigate through December. Combined developments and activity, as well as review processes related to security, make it among the best crypto to invest in at present. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) keeps pushing forth with more and more eyes on it as traders contemplate their moves for December. Phase 6 will soon be complete, and the chance to enter at a price of $0.035 will soon be gone for this crypto to buy now.

This move has sent ripples through the digital asset space, prompting investors to ask: what’s driving this decline, and what comes next? Why Did the Bitcoin Price Drop Below $89,000? Market movements are rarely caused by a single event. Therefore, understanding the Bitcoin price action requires looking at several potential factors. A key level like $89,000 often acts as both support and resistance. When it breaks, it can trigger automated sell orders, accelerating the downward move. Other common contributors to such shifts include: Broader Market Sentiment: Negative news or risk-off sentiment in traditional finance can spill over into crypto. Profit-Taking: After a period of gains, some investors may be locking in profits, increasing selling pressure. Liquidity and Leverage: High leverage in the market can lead to cascading liquidations when the price moves sharply. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Investors? For holders, a dip in the Bitcoin price can be a test of conviction. However, volatility is a fundamental characteristic of the cryptocurrency market. Historically, Bitcoin has experienced significant pullbacks during its long-term bull cycles. This current movement may represent a healthy correction rather than a trend reversal. Key considerations for investors now include: Portfolio Review: Assess your risk exposure and ensure your allocation aligns with your long-term strategy. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For some, a lower Bitcoin price presents an opportunity to accumulate at a discount using a disciplined DCA approach. Market Fundamentals: Look beyond the price chart. Network activity, adoption trends, and macroeconomic factors often provide a clearer long-term picture. Is This a Buying Opportunity or a Warning Sign? This is the crucial question on every trader’s mind. The answer depends heavily on your investment horizon and risk tolerance. Short-term traders might see increased volatility as a chance for quick gains, but it comes with higher risk. Long-term investors, often called ‘HODLers,’ might view this as a minor setback in a multi-year journey. Remember, past performance does not guarantee future results. Conduct your own research and never invest more than you can afford to lose. The Bitcoin price is influenced by a complex web of global factors, making precise predictions impossible. Navigating Market Volatility with Confidence Ultimately, successful crypto investing is less about timing every dip and peak and more about having a solid plan. The drop below $89,000 is a stark reminder of the market’s inherent unpredictability. By focusing on education, sound risk management, and a long-term perspective, you can navigate these waves without letting fear or greed dictate your decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How low could the Bitcoin price go after breaking $89,000? A: It’s impossible to predict with certainty. The next major support levels are often watched, but price action depends on market sentiment, news flow, and trading volume. Always be prepared for further volatility in either direction. Q2: Should I sell my Bitcoin now to avoid more losses? A: This is a personal financial decision. Panic selling at a loss is rarely a good strategy. Review your original investment thesis. If the long-term fundamentals you believed in are still intact, a price drop may not warrant a sale. Q3: What are the main technical levels to watch now? A: Traders will now watch how the price behaves around $88,000 and $85,000 as potential support. On the upside, reclaiming $89,000 and then $90,000 would be seen as a sign of strength. Q4: Does this price drop affect other cryptocurrencies? A: Typically, yes. Bitcoin is the market leader. A significant move in the Bitcoin price often pulls the entire crypto market, including Ethereum and major altcoins, in the same direction, a phenomenon known as ‘Bitcoin dominance.’ Q5: Where can I get reliable, real-time Bitcoin price data? A: Use reputable cryptocurrency data aggregators like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko, or check the spot price on major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, or Kraken for the most accurate, real-time information.

This development comes almost two years after the US Department of Justice brought criminal charges against two of the co-founders of the crypto Ponzi scheme. In January 2024, the US DOJ charged Xue Lee (Sam Lee) and Brenda Chunga (Bitcoin Beautee) for their roles in HyperFund. According to the prosecutors, the founders falsely claimed that the scheme’s investors would receive substantial returns paid from non-existent crypto mining operations. The fraudulent scheme, which also drew the attention of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), collapsed in 2022, leaving investors unable to withdraw their money. The SEC filed a civil action against the founders, stating that HyperFund lacked any real revenue source apart from investors’ funds. US DOJ Adds Wire Fraud Charge To HyperFund’s Promoter On Friday, December 12, the US Attorney’s Office for the District of Maryland announced new indictment charges against 56-year-old Burton for actively promoting the fraudulent HyperFund scheme. The new charges include conspiracy to commit wire fraud, two counts of wire fraud, seven counts of money laundering, and one count of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. The 56-year-old crypto promoter, who was initially facing two counts related to unlicensed money transmission, is now staring down at a protracted prison sentence if found guilty on all counts; a maximum of 20 years in federal prison for the wire fraud conspiracy and each wire fraud count, 10 years for each money laundering count, and five years for the unlicensed money transmission enterprise. The superseding indictment also accused Burton of misappropriating investors’ funds in the purchase of luxury condo homes, sports cars, and a yacht. The crypto influencer managed to build a crypto community following while hosting various celebrities, including Akon, Jamie Fox, and Rick Ross. According to court filings, Burton claimed that he was made to believe that he was operating a legitimate enterprise, causing him to mislead investors. The crypto influencer’s trial is expected to start by March 2026.

Despite the lack of bullish price action in recent weeks, the technical analysis proposes that the market structure continues to favor an upside continuation rather than the trend ending. This outlook places the next three to six months in a constructive zone for XRP’s price action, where the probability of further upside is higher than the risk of a downward move. Related Reading: Do Kwon Falls Hard — Terraform Labs Chief Gets 15 Years For Wire Fraud XRP Currently In Consolidation, Not Distribution The assessment of Egrag’s technical analysis is based on XRP’s price action currently ticking a list of boxes that points to the next move being up. The first of these boxes is what the analyst referred to as a regime shift, which occurred after the XRP price made a decisive breakout from a multi-year base around $0.5 last year. This decisive breakout shifted the market from accumulation to expansion. Pullbacks in this phase are usually corrective, not trend-ending. In that context, the current price action can be viewed as part of a natural pause rather than a signal that the larger bullish move has failed. Another central argument in the analysis is that the current price behavior represents consolidation rather than distribution. Egrag Crypto describes the market as being in a compression phase following an impulse, and this is a pause, not a top. Although XRP has spent about 13 months ranging within this structure, the analyst interpreted this as extended consolidation instead of a distribution process. Chart Image From X. Source: @egragcrypto On X EMA Structure Keeps Bullish Bias Intact Another reason as to why the trend is more likely bullish is because XRP is still trading in alignment with its long-term exponential moving average, which remains above the 21 EMA. That relationship preserves the bullish bias, even though price currently sits below the faster 9 EMA, but this only reflects short-term weakness rather than a structural breakdown. Beyond pure chart structure, fundamental developments have added weight to the case for longer-term appreciation. XRP is currently holding $2 as an important support zone, and recent developments have emerged that could increase bullish sentiment. An example is Ripple’s conditional approval alongside other crypto firms for a national trust bank charter from the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Related Reading: Solana’s Long-Awaited Firedancer Launch Sparks 5% Rally Although the outlook is much more bullish, there is always the possibility of turning bearish within the next six months. According to Egrag, this outlook can only turn bearish if XRP records a sustained monthly close below the $1.80 to $1.60 region. Taken together, the analysis concludes that XRP is more likely to resolve higher than lower over the next three to six months, even if there is price volatility along the way.

However, price action is often hidden from regular investors until pressure reaches a critical point. A new liquidation heatmap shared by Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) suggests that XRP’s liquidity buildup is no longer subtle. Liquidity above the current price is increasing again, and traders positioning against a move higher now face a growing risk. Although the market appears quiet, conditions are tightening. BREAKING: THE $3 LIQUIDITY CLUSTER IS EXPANDING AGAIN. PRESSURE IS BUILDING — ONCE THIS ZONE IS TAKEN OUT, $XRP CAN MOVE FAST. pic.twitter.com/PJAvP2FlFs — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 13, 2025 What the Chart Reveals About XRP Steph Is Crypto posted a Binance liquidation heatmap covering a multi-month window. The chart highlights a dense liquidity band centered near $3. That zone stands out clearly when compared to the surrounding levels. The analyst noted that this liquidity cluster is expanding again, and a decisive move could push XRP far above this level . Liquidation heatmaps visualize where leveraged positions are concentrated. Bright zones represent price levels where large pools of liquidations sit. These zones often act as magnets during periods of rising volatility. As more traders place shorts below resistance, the size of potential forced buy orders grows as the price pushes upward. The chart shows XRP trading well below the $3 level while liquidity continues to build above. This imbalance matters , as markets tend to move toward liquidity during decisive moves. When that liquidity grows over time, the pressure increases. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Short-Term Outlook as Pressure Builds In the short term, the expanding cluster raises the probability of a sharp reaction if XRP approaches $3. A break into that zone could trigger a cascade of liquidations. Forced buying would add momentum, potentially pushing XRP above the liquidity cluster close to $3.6 . Steph Is Crypto emphasized the speed such moves can carry. He stated that XRP will move fast after clearing this liquidity cluster. Liquidation-driven moves often unfold quickly, leaving little room for late positioning. However, until XRP challenges that area, it may continue to consolidate. Sideways action allows liquidity to expand further. Each day spent below resistance adds weight to the setup. If XRP clears the zone with strength, it could reset the market structure. Analysts have predicted a legendary breakout for the asset . If it experiences a decisive move, liquidity above $3 would thin, and price discovery would resume at higher levels.

There have been a few possibly manipulated leverage flushes over the past couple of weeks, but no clear direction for the asset. Bitcoin is at a “critical on-chain support” level, observed Alphractal CEO Joao Wedson on Saturday. He cited the “Realized Cap Impulse,” which is testing a decisive region, “historically, a zone that often precedes healthy pullbacks,” before cautioning that “demand needs to emerge now.” “If capital does not start flowing back in, the Realized Cap is likely to decline, increasing selling pressure and on-chain distribution, especially from more price-sensitive investors.” Bitcoin at a critical on-chain support The Realized Cap Impulse is testing a decisive region — historically, a zone that often precedes healthy pullbacks.

Going straight up from here would be acceptable too, but it seems less likely, given the bearish continuation pattern.” Meanwhile, Glassnode researcher “CryptoVizArt” said that the current consolidation range is “generating a magnitude of stress comparable to late January 2022, with Relative Unrealized Loss approaching 10% of market cap.” “This places the market in a regime where liquidity is constrained, and sensitivity to macro shocks is elevated, yet still below the levels typically associated with full bear-market capitulation.” The current $80K–$90K consolidation range is generating a magnitude of stress comparable to late Jan 2022, with Relative Unrealized Loss approaching ~10% of market cap.

The majority of analysts were leaning bearish this weekend, but a few maintained hope of a recovery. “Bitcoin is currently trading extremely correctively,” said analyst “Sykodelic” before adding that there were small pumps, sharp dumps, “hunting liquidity with no true direction.” The market needs to sweep lows at the low $80,000 range before any reversal, they said. “Overall, the market is telling us what we want to see for bullish continuation into 2026, so whilst this bottoming formation is taking hold, we just need some patience.” BTC was trading flat on the day at $90,300 at the time of writing, and a Sunday flush, as we’ve seen previously, could be on the cards again today.

The advisory comes amid a broader regulatory realignment that has seen the agency drop enforcement cases, approve tokenization pilots, and clear crypto firms for national bank charters. The SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Assistance released an investor bulletin outlining the mechanics of crypto asset custody and the trade-offs between self-managed wallets and third-party custodians. The guidance defines custody as the method through which investors store and access private keys, the passcodes that authorize transactions and prove ownership of digital assets. It warns that losing a private key results in permanent loss of access, while compromised keys can lead to theft with no recourse.

Check out our Crypto Asset Custody Basics Investor Bulletin. https://t.co/x4HMYMHLAe pic.twitter.com/bSbP25nzOc — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) December 13, 2025 Hot Wallets, Cold Storage, and the Security Spectrum The bulletin distinguishes between hot wallets, which remain connected to the internet for convenience, and cold wallets, which use physical devices like USB drives or paper backups to stay offline. Hot wallets expose users to cyber threats but enable faster transactions, while cold wallets offer stronger protection against hacking at the cost of portability and ease of use. The SEC notes that physical cold storage devices can be lost, damaged, or stolen, creating additional risks that may still result in permanent asset loss. Investors choosing self-custody control their own private keys and bear full responsibility for security, backup procedures, and technical setup. Those opting for third-party custodians must research how providers safeguard assets, whether they use hot or cold storage, and whether they engage in practices such as rehypothecation or asset commingling. The bulletin urges investors to confirm whether custodians provide insurance, how they respond to bankruptcy or hacks, and what fees they charge for transactions and transfers. Regulatory Shift Accelerates as Crypto Enters the Banking System The custody guidance arrives as the SEC pivots from enforcement-led oversight to policy development under Chair Paul Atkins, who told Fox News in August that the agency is “mobilizing” to make the US the global crypto capital . Atkins said divisions across the SEC are now focused on building a regulatory framework that supports innovation while protecting investors, marking a sharp departure from the litigation-heavy approach that defined the previous administration. That shift has already produced tangible results. The agency closed its multi-year investigation into Ondo Finance without charges this week, signaling greater tolerance for tokenized real-world assets. The SEC is ""mobilizing"" to become the crypto capital of the globe, SEC Chair Paul Atkins told Fox News on Thursday. #SEC #PaulAtkins https://t.co/p1p8MXub2h — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 15, 2025 Days earlier, the SEC granted the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation a rare no-action letter allowing it to tokenize US Treasuries, ETFs, and Russell 1000 components starting in late 2026. The DTCC said tokenized securities will carry the same ownership rights and investor protections as traditional instruments, bridging legacy infrastructure with blockchain-based settlement. Meanwhile, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency conditionally approved five crypto firms , including Circle, Ripple, BitGo, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Paxos, to launch or convert into national trust banks. The charters allow digital-asset companies to custody assets and offer banking services under a single federal standard, eliminating the need to navigate state-by-state regulations. Paxos received explicit permission to issue stablecoins under federal oversight, while Ripple’s charter excludes RLUSD issuance through the bank. OCC head Jonathan Gould said the approvals ensure the federal banking system “ keeps pace with the evolution of finance, ” dismissing concerns from traditional banks that the agency lacks supervisory capacity for crypto-native firms. He noted that the OCC has supervised a crypto-focused national trust bank for years and receives daily inquiries from existing banks about innovative product launches. The regulatory momentum extends beyond custody and charters. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission launched a pilot program allowing Bitcoin , Ether , and USDC as collateral in derivatives markets, while the OCC found that nine major US banks imposed “ inappropriate ” restrictions on lawful crypto businesses between 2020 and 2023.

Bitcoin analyst AndrewBTC emphasized that Japan holds the largest position in U.S. government debt, making a rate hike bearish for the Bitcoin price prediction outlook. Historical Pattern: BOJ Hikes Trigger 20%+ BTC Drops In a December 13 X post , the analyst examined the BTC chart and noted a consistent pattern: every Bank of Japan rate hike has preceded Bitcoin declines exceeding 20%.

Historically, BOJ rate increases have strengthened the Japanese yen, elevating borrowing costs and making investments in higher-risk assets less attractive. In conversation with Cryptonews, Ignacio Aguirre, CMO at Bitget, explained that a stronger yen “raises the risk of unwinding yen carry trades which is a move that can temporarily weigh on crypto valuations as leveraged positions reset across global markets.” Bitcoin now faces mounting pressure as investors reduce leverage and scale back exposure amid growing risk-off sentiment. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Weekly Chart Shows Broken Bull Structure The weekly Bitcoin chart reveals clear momentum deterioration following repeated failures to maintain support above the $100,000 psychological threshold, which has now converted back into solid resistance. Price has broken down from the previous distribution zone near cycle highs and is trending lower, with bearish structure validated by consecutive lower peaks and steady descent toward the upper- $80,000 region . Source: TradingView The RSI divergence indicator remains decisively bearish, currently positioned in the high-30s, displaying persistent weakness without any significant bullish divergence emerging. If this momentum continues, the next major weekly support zone sits near $70,000 , aligning with the prior range floor and representing the first area where substantial buying interest is likely to materialize. A more severe correction toward the $53,000 zone cannot be dismissed if $70,000 fails to hold, potentially marking a cycle bottom. MAXI Presale Opens Early Investment Access Before Bull Run Resumes If Bitcoin successfully defends the $90,000 level and avoids crashing to the $70,000 lows, a 2026 bull run would remain intact, and early-stage projects like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) would benefit from the upcoming liquidity flowing into risk assets.

Here’s the Target,https://timestabloid.com/chartist-shows-xrp-is-poised-for-major-price-rally-heres-the-target/,"XRP is trading in a compressed range while analysts await confirmation of its next directional move. The market has shown strength in recent weeks, but hesitation remains near key technical levels. Against this backdrop, Dark Defender (@DefendDark) has returned to a structure he first outlined earlier this year. His latest post suggests that XRP stands at a decisive point, with a long-awaited bullish phase now within reach. In his words, “The missing Monthly Wave 5 is poised for a Surge.” While XRP has already rallied strongly from its prior lows, Dark Defender argues that the broader Elliott Wave structure still lacks its final impulsive leg. The missing Monthly Wave 5 is poised for a Surge. The target is expected to be $5.85 #XRP is so Close to making this decision. pic.twitter.com/fT2boIuHr5 — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) December 13, 2025 A Revisited Structure From February The chart shared with the post highlights a structure first published on February 13, 2025. It shows a completed corrective sequence labeled A, B, and C, followed by a renewed impulsive advance. This corrective phase unfolded over several months, with XRP hitting its peak of $3.65 within this pattern. Toward the end of this pattern, XRP respected Wave 4 of a longer-term Elliott Wave pattern and formed a base near the $2 region. The chart also shows XRP reclaiming key support within the Ichimoku cloud before accelerating higher. That move marks a technical shift, showing that bearish control has weakened as buyers regain momentum. The current move appears to align with the early stages of a larger Wave 5 advance. Sub-waves are already visible on the daily chart. Wave 1 and Wave 2 have played out. The analyst outlines a sharp Wave 3 expansion followed by a brief pullback in Wave 4, and another advance to complete the sequence. This would line up the sub-waves with the longer-term bullish structure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 $5.85 XRP Price As The Primary Target Dark Defender places strong emphasis on the $5.85 level. He states, “The target is expected to be $5.85.” On the chart, this level aligns with a 261.80% Fibonacci extension. That extension projects from the prior corrective low and matches the termination zone of the projected Wave 5. Dark Defender has predicted this target multiple times , and the asset’s RSI behavior supports his thesis. Momentum remains elevated without showing a clear bearish divergence on the higher time frames. That condition often appears during strong impulsive advances rather than corrective bounces. Importantly, Dark Defender does not frame $5.85 as the end of the cycle. The February analysis he references highlighted higher extension levels. Those projections include $8.76 and an ultimate target of $18.22 . He treats these as continuation targets if Wave 5 unfolds fully on the monthly scale.

The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1, 2025, following the conclusion of its presale. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market remained flat, with major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), registering only marginal movement. BTC registered a marginal decline over the past 24 hours, while ETH is up almost 6%, trading around $3,109. Husky Inu (HINU) Reaches $0.00023749 Husky Inu (HINU) has completed the latest price increase of its pre-launch phase, rising from $0.00023658 to $0.00023749. ​The regular price increases are part of Husky Inu's pre-launch phase, which began on April 1. These increases help the project continue fundraising, empower its community, and reward token holders. The pre-launch phase’s primary goal is to secure capital, fund platform improvements, undertake marketing initiatives, and support broader ecosystem growth. Fundraising Struggles While Husky Inu’s token price increases remain on schedule, it is struggling to raise funds, with fundraising virtually grinding to a halt. The project has raised $905,549 so far, as investors remain wary and adopt a wait-and-watch approach. Husky Inu crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. It reached the $850,000 milestone in July and crossed $900,000 in October. The project’s official launch date is under four months away, but the team has not ruled out moving the launch to an earlier or later date. The team will conduct a series of review meetings to determine the project’s launch date. The first two review meetings were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025, while the third is scheduled for January 1, 2026. Crypto Market Calm Over Weekend The crypto market has remained relatively calm over the weekend following a week of volatility and selling pressure. Bitcoin (BTC) is marginally down over the past 24 hours, trading around $90,206. However, Ethereum (ETH) is up almost 1%, trading around $3,115. Ripple (XRP) followed BTC into a bearish trajectory, and is down nearly 1% as it struggles to remain above $1. Solana (SOL) is marginally down while Dogecoin (DOGE) is up 0.50% at $0.138. Cardano (ADA) remains in bearish territory, down almost 1%, and Chainlink (LINK) is down 0.66%, trading around $13.67. However, Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) have recorded noticeable declines over the past 24 hours. Despite major altcoins trading in the red, the crypto market cap is marginally up, while the 24-hour trading volume is down nearly 30% at $102 billion.

Yet some market watchers believe these firms might actually benefit from the changes ahead. British advertising giant WPP Plc has seen its stock price drop 60% this year after losing several major clients. Other companies in the sector, including Publicis Groupe SA and Omnicom Group Inc., have also declined, though not as sharply. Investors worry that AI will soon handle much of the hands-on work that agencies currently do. However, a growing number of analysts think these worries might be overblown. They say big brands will need agencies more than ever to help them manage advertising across an increasingly complicated media world. Stock recommendations for Publicis and Omnicom have recently reached some of their highest levels in years. “The industry is being disrupted, but it’s not being disintermediated — I think that’s the key,” said Mark Giarelli, an analyst at Morningstar. New AI tools raise c oncerns over in-house marketing New AI tools have gained significant ground this year. Google’s Nano Banana and OpenAI’s Sora 2 can create images and videos just from written instructions. Coca-Cola Co. ran a Christmas commercial made by AI for the second year in a row. Tech giants are also putting pressure on the industry. Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. have introduced their own tools that let brands design ad campaigns without hiring outside consultants. The biggest worry is that companies might use these automated systems to build their own marketing departments. In September, cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks Inc. said it created an entire advertising campaign by itself without help from any outside agencies. But Google and Meta cannot help brands figure out how to spread their advertising budgets across different platforms, according to Giarelli. This is where agencies can prove their worth, helping clients avoid spending money twice on similar audiences between Instagram Reels and Google Search, for example. This ability comes from information about consumer behavior that agencies have collected since the 1980s, when direct mail campaigns were the main marketing tool. “Ad agencies are quite good at understanding a variety of characteristics. They know where we are, what we’re thinking to some degree, and they’re able to tailor a marketing message based on that,” Giarelli said. The advertising world is getting more complicated at the same time. AI will likely allow companies to create personalized digital content “almost on the fly” for each individual consumer, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Matthew Bloxham. “There is going to be a strategic role for agencies,” Bloxham said. “With more complexity, you want more valued advice to help you navigate through, whether that’s the overall marketing strategy or media strategy.” Lower costs could spark advertising arms race Another reason to be optimistic about agencies comes from JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Daniel Kerven. He argues that lower costs for making ads should lead to more advertising and bigger spending from major brands. When AI makes all ads better in general, top advertisers might compete in an “arms race” to create “unforgettable experiences,” he said. The AI debate has hurt how investors value these companies. WPP’s forward price-to-earnings multiple has dropped to an all-time low. Omnicom’s valuation sits near its lowest point since 2020, while Publicis is closer to its 10-year average. If AI stocks rally in the broader market, it could hurt advertising agencies even more, since brokers often group them with companies expected to struggle against new technology. Some agencies face bigger challenges than others. WPP cut its financial guidance twice this year after losing several prominent clients to competitors.

The meme cryptocurrency saw over 1.1 million tokens removed from circulation, marking a significant shift in community activity. Data from Shibburn reveals that 1,157,800 SHIB tokens were burned during the latest 24-hour period. This figure stands in stark contrast to earlier in the week, when daily burns consistently remained below 200,000 tokens. The previous day recorded particularly weak activity, with only 69,420 tokens burned, a 62.96% decrease that coincided with broader market turbulence. The timing of this burn rate spike raises questions about community sentiment and strategy. SHIB currently trades at $0.000008191, down 2.82% over 24 hours and 2.61% across the past week. Despite ongoing price weakness, the sudden increase in token burns suggests holders remain committed to reducing supply. SHIB price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap Market Conditions Test Investor Resolve The cryptocurrency market continues to face headwinds following a prolonged sell-off that began in early October. A major liquidation event eliminated approximately $19 billion in leveraged positions, creating persistent downward pressure across digital assets. Glassnode, a prominent crypto analytics platform, characterizes the current environment as a ”mild bearish phase.” The firm notes that modest capital inflows cannot offset consistent selling from larger holders. This dynamic has left traders uncertain about near-term direction as 2024 draws to a close. Macroeconomic concerns have amplified market anxiety. Investors remain cautious as they assess potential impacts on risk assets. The sell-off has dampened enthusiasm across both major cryptocurrencies and alternative tokens. Upcoming Catalysts Could Shape 2025 Trajectory Several events scheduled for mid-December may influence Shiba Inu's path forward. Coinbase announced plans to launch perpetual futures for multiple altcoins, including SHIB, on December 15. This move will provide U.S. traders with additional tools for speculation and hedging. The exchange has also teased a system update scheduled for December 17. Members of the Shiba Inu community are watching closely for potential announcements that could benefit the token.

As part of “Operation Kryptolaundry,” the Brazilian police carried out 24 search-and-seizure warrants across the country. The police launched the special operation on December 9 with the goal of taking down fraudulent investment offerings and money laundering via cryptocurrencies. Crypto launderers linked to Bitcoin Pharaoh According to local reports, the crypto ring is connected to Glaidson Acácio dos Santos, known as the Bitcoin Pharaoh. The Brazilian police captured him back in 2021. Santos was the boss of Gas Consultoria, one of the biggest investment pyramid schemes in Brazil . Thousands of Brazilians lost millions of dollars after investing in Gas Consultoria. The crypto launderers followed the approach of the Bitcoin Pharaoh. They laundered millions of dollars through a mix of shell companies and cryptocurrencies since 2021. The criminals lured people through crypto investment opportunities. They advertised heavily on social media and pushed intense campaigns. They also organized meetups to build strong connections and trust with their victims. The legal entities behind the crypto launderers appeared to operate legally and offered “safe investments” in crypto with high returns. The Brazilian Federal Police discovered that the crypto criminal ring received around R$2.7 billion, or $500 million. The criminals moved the funds, and around R$404 million, or $75.5 million, were labeled as illicit funds. A huge chunk of this amount was concealed and sent to the leaders of the ring through crypto and dozens of shell companies. Courts in Brazil ordered the freezing of bank accounts containing around R$685 million, or $128 million. The courts also gave the green light to seize farms, commercial properties, and luxury real estate. The police carried out nine preventive arrest warrants, targeting 45 individuals and companies. Based on local news outlets, six people had been arrested in the Federal District and two in Spain. The apprehended people will face criminal charges of financial offenses, money laundering, organized crime, document forgery, and other related charges. In October of 2025, Santos or the Bitcoin Pharaoh, was sentenced to over 19 years in prison for criminal and corruption activities. Santos’s right-hand man, Daniel Aleixo Guimarães, was sentenced to over 16 years. Brazil busts $164M crypto cybercrime ring In early July of 2025, Brazilian authorities took down a complex crypto cybercrime ring that laundered over R$164 million, or $32 million. This was part of another plan by the Brazilian police called “Operation Deep Hunt.” The operation was successful in exposing a network of criminals who used fake credit card machines, forged documents, and engaged in illicit drugs. It resulted in the arrest of 32 people and the seizure of R$112 million, or $21 million. According to TRM Labs , the cybercrime ring utilized dark web marketplaces to acquire fake banknotes, cloned credit cards, and fake documents. The criminals then stole funds and laundered them using crypto. They then dispersed them through shell companies and fake bank accounts to hide the origins of the funds. The group re-injected the laundered proceeds into the economy through property and car purchases. Brazilian authorities successfully seized the illicit funds after working with Binance’s investigation team and other entities that helped with on-chain investigations.

Analysts suggest this institutional buying pressure could propel the Solana price prediction toward a $180 breakout. Bitwise Dominates Solana ETF Inflow Rankings Ahead of $180 Breakout Data from Sosovalue reveals Bitwise commands the lead with $608.81 million in inflows, while Grayscale and Fidelity follow with $97.74 million and $54.8 million, respectively. Last week, $SOL spot ETFs recorded 7 straight days of net inflows. pic.twitter.com/oSVTls5SzV — DustyBC Crypto (@TheDustyBC) December 14, 2025 Despite a 2% price decline over the past week, analysts say the growing institutional appetite for Solana is a necessary catalyst to finally breach the 2-month $180 resistance barrier. Beyond institutional interest through ETFs, Solana has been earning credibility from Wall Street in its campaign to become the blockchain infrastructure for capital markets. At the recently concluded Solana Breakpoint conference, Marc Antonio, Head of DeFi at asset manager Galaxy Digital, declared that Solana represents the only blockchain capable of processing tokenized securities at the scale that Wall Street executives like Larry Fink have long championed . Antonio emphasized, “We want Solana to be so dominant and we want Solana to have such good prices that when you compare the price of Nasdaq-listed Forward Industries on Solana versus Nasdaq, you want to buy on Solana. That’s the end state.” Solana Price Prediction: Technical Setup Shows Accumulation Before $180 Breakout Solana is consolidating below a long-term descending trendline following an extended corrective period, with price currently maintaining within a clearly defined accumulation zone spanning $120–$135. This area has repeatedly absorbed selling pressure, indicating sellers are exhausting their control, though the market hasn’t yet demonstrated a decisive reversal. The failure to recapture the $180 level maintains the broader structure as technically bearish, with that zone now functioning as the primary upside obstacle. Source: TradingView Momentum remains subdued, but the RSI is stabilizing in the low-40s and has begun printing mild bullish signals after a prolonged bearish stretch, suggesting downside momentum is diminishing. If SOL can break above the descending trendline and reclaim $180, the chart opens pathways for a stronger recovery toward the $210 region, which aligns with the next major resistance level. Pepenode Raises $2.3M To Position for Meme Coin Explosion If SOL finally breaks through $180 resistance and converts the $200 psychological level into support, meme coins like Pepenode (PEPENODE) could experience 10-50x post-TGE rallies. Pepenode is a new crypto project that’s already raised over $2.3 million despite challenging market conditions. It’s a game where you can “mine” coins without needing expensive computer equipment. You play the game in your web browser, set up virtual mining nodes , and upgrade your facilities to earn more tokens. The project is replicating the success strategies of PEPE and popular Solana memecoins that saw dozens of projects rally over 100x during the 2024 summer season. Now that more people are starting to purchase Pepenode’s mining rigs, the token price is expected to rise rapidly.

Since then, though, the asset has been in a free-fall state, losing nearly 50% of its value and currently struggling to remain above $2.00. When it comes to determining (or making an educated guess) its performance by the end of the year, we decided to ask around some popular AI models to get their perspective on the matter. Here’s how they disagree about XRP’s 2025 closing price. Stagnation Predictions ChatGPT was the most modest in its predictions for the weeks ahead. It believes that overall volatility in the cryptocurrency markets will pause by the end of the year, a forecast based on previous Holiday-season behavior. It noted that XRP is likely to remain sideways around its current levels and will end the year stuck somewhere between the crucial support at $2.00 and $2.20. It justified its “status quo” forecast by outlining the following mostly bearish factors: XRP is trading below key long-term moving averages (50-day and 200-day), a classic technical bearish signal. Lack of strong breakout momentum or divergence in macro sentiment. Continued market caution is reflected in volatility and fear indicators. Moderate and Bullish Google’s Gemini was more bullish on XRP as it noted that the asset has the legs for one more run by the end of the year. It said Ripple’s cross-border token can overperform if liquidity improves and there’s a “mild macro recovery,” which can send it flying to $2.80 or even $3.20 under more favorable conditions. Other AI forecasts envisioned a massive rally by December 31. Perplexity noted that a surge beyond $4.00 is not out of the question entirely if the ETF demand skyrockets and aligns with the following factors: Major technical breakout above key levels. Renewed market risk appetite. Favorable institutional or regulatory catalysts. Nevertheless, even Perplexity admitted that this is a very dramatic and unlikely scenario. Although still plausible, it added that the actual chances for such a massive price surge for a large-cap altcoin in just a few weeks, given the current market sentiment, are slim. Its most likely scenario puts XRP somewhere in the middle between the predictions made by ChatGPT and Gemini, at around $2.30 – $2.50. In conclusion, it’s easy to see why these AI models disagree when trying to forecast the price of a volatile altcoin in the next few weeks. In such a highly liquid and fluctuating environment, small shifts in sentiment or macro conditions can drastically tilt outcomes in days.

Notably, the outlook comes as Bitcoin ( BTC ) faces renewed bearish pressure that has seen the asset slip below the $90,000 level. In this context, as of press time, Bitcoin was changing hands at $89,257, down more than 1% over the past 24 hours. On a weekly basis, the leading cryptocurrency has gained less than 1%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Regarding the price outlook, the Rainbow Chart uses a logarithmic growth model to evaluate Bitcoin’s price across color-coded bands that reflect historical market sentiment, valuation extremes, and cycle positioning. Bitcoin price prediction As of its January 1, 2026 projection, BTC sits in the lower-middle valuation zones, suggesting it is neither overheated nor deeply undervalued. The chart plots Bitcoin’s price on a logarithmic scale and fits a long-term regression curve tied to adoption-driven growth rather than short-term volatility. Each color band represents a deviation from this trend, providing context within past market cycles. Importantly, the model does not predict exact tops or bottoms but instead highlights probabilistic valuation ranges based on historical behavior. For January 1, 2026, the chart projects that Bitcoin’s price could fall within the’Basically a Fire Sale’ band, spanning roughly $39,700 to $51,980, a range historically associated with extreme undervaluation and late bear-market conditions. Above it, the ‘BUY!’ band ranges from about $51,980 to $70,125, a zone that has often aligned with strong long-term accumulation opportunities. The ‘Accumulate’ band sits between approximately $70,125 and $90,650, closely aligning with Bitcoin’s current price and indicating fair value within the broader growth curve. Bitcoin Rainbow chart. Source: BlockhainCenter The light green ‘Still Cheap’ band extends from around $90,650 to $117,105, suggesting moderate upside if Bitcoin continues to track its historical adoption trend. Above that, the ‘HODL!’ band ranges between $117,105 and $153,445, a level typically associated with strong bullish momentum without speculative excess. Meanwhile, the ‘Is this a bubble?’ band rises from about $153,445 to $195,567, reflecting conditions where prices have historically begun to detach from long-term averages. The ‘FOMO intensifies’ band spans approximately $195,567 to $250,745, signaling heightened speculative behavior. Beyond that, the ‘Sell. Seriously, SELL!’ range runs from around $250,745 to $326,589, while the ‘Maximum Bubble Territory’ band stretches from roughly $326,589 to about $439,404, levels historically linked to major cycle peaks. Bitcoin’s ideal price for Jan 1, 2026 Given Bitcoin’s current price of approximately $89,200, the Rainbow Chart suggests that by January 1, 2026, BTC is most likely to trade between roughly $90,000 and $117,000 under neutral conditions, with a move toward $153,000 possible if bullish momentum strengthens. Conversely, even a significant breakdown below the trend would still place long-term structural support well above $50,000 according to the model.

Based on reports from both firms, the work will look at trading, prime services, custody, staking and lending for banks, funds and other large players. Building On Existing Work The firms said the push grows out of an existing arrangement in Singapore where Standard Chartered provides banking links that let customers move Singapore dollars in real time to and from Coinbase. That setup helped power Coinbase’s move into the island city’s business market on November 12, 2025. What They Plan To Explore Coinbase and Standard Chartered described five areas they will explore together: trading, prime services, custody, staking and lending. These cover order execution, financing and custody options that big clients typically demand. Both sides framed the effort as trying to give institutional users safer, regulated ways to hold and move digital assets. Why The Move Matters Institutional investors have been asking for services that resemble what they get in traditional markets — custody with strong controls, credit and financing options, and execution tools tied to regulated banking rails. Standard Chartered already rolled out spot trading for Bitcoin and Ether for its institutional clients earlier in the year, an effort that showed the bank is building its own crypto capabilities as demand grows. Middle Ground For Banks And Crypto Firms Coinbase brings its institutional trading platform and market access ; Standard Chartered brings global payment rails, FX handling and a bank’s compliance framework. The result, the partners say, should be a way for large investors to trade and custody digital assets while sticking to familiar banking rules and procedures. Other banks and prime brokers are also striking ties with crypto firms or building in-house services, so this announcement is part of a broader push to give big clients regulated choices. For institutional traders, having multiple, regulated routes to trade and settle crypto helps reduce single-point dependency and may lower operational risk. Public Launch Date Or Pricing Neither company provided a timetable or fee details when they announced the expansion. For now, the plan is to develop and test product ideas for institutional clients across regions where each firm operates.

His remarks center on comparative analytics that measure the current state of top-tier cryptocurrencies, and he emphasizes that recent sentiment-based metrics identify XRP as the only asset among the leading group that qualifies as undervalued at its present price. His video begins with a brief review of overall market activity, noting that major assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum showed gains alongside XRP, with each rising roughly 2% over the same period. He emphasizes that XRP has remained in a prolonged consolidation phase following a significant rise earlier in the year, characterizing this period as part of a broader pattern seen across the market. XRP Stands Alone… pic.twitter.com/iLtdUiSN0B — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) December 12, 2025 Consolidation Period and Broader Market Conditions Hilton describes much of the current environment as a continuation of volatility and uncertainty that has marked the industry in recent years. He remarks on the experiences many investors share, including holding positions that have yet to recover and navigating conditions that have produced repeated setbacks. Despite this, he maintains a long-term view, stating his belief in the utility and future adoption of blockchain technologies, including the technology behind XRP. Hilton describes the present market as a “wait and see” phase, suggesting that stronger momentum may not develop until global conditions shift. The market enters its next decisive period, which he associates with expectations for 2026. Sentiment Metrics and Undervaluation Claims The central point of Hilton’s commentary concerns a sentiment analysis identifying XRP as undervalued compared to other top 10 cryptocurrencies. Excluding stablecoins, he references assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, Solana, Tron, Dogecoin, and Cardano for comparison. According to the data he cites, XRP’s price of $2.03 places it below what sentiment indicators consider its fair value. He highlights that open interest remains flat and speculative activity limited, noting that this reflects a cautious market posture rather than heightened trading pressure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Supporting this position, Hilton points to XRP’s 30-day market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio of negative 6.1%. He explains that this indicates recent buyers are, on average, at a loss, which historically can align with favorable entry conditions for swing traders. Parallel metrics for Bitcoin show a neutral reading, while Ethereum appears mildly overvalued, reinforcing his argument that XRP stands apart in this category. Takeaway for Long-Term Participants Hilton concludes that the indicators do not signal instantaneous transformation in market sentiment but provide meaningful context for long-term value investors. His view is that XRP’s current range offers an advantageous position for those looking ahead to future appreciation.

They point to a year where low FX swings and a weaker US dollar created easy ground for borrowing in cheap currencies and moving into higher-yield ones, with a 17% return for the strategy this year, the strongest since 2009. Asset managers and banks like Vanguard, Invesco, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America expect the rate gap between rich economies and emerging countries to stay wide next year. They also expect the Federal Reserve and other large central banks to keep borrowing costs low. The US dollar has already fallen more than 7% in 2025, and many investors say that slide helps keep the carry engine running. Investors push into high-yield currencies This year gave investors several strong carry choices as emerging-market stocks, bonds, and currencies posted broad gains. Brazil and Colombia stood out. Both kept benchmark interest rates at high levels, and both saw their currencies jump more than 13% against the dollar. The future path, though, depends heavily on the US economy. Investors want slower growth that pushes the Fed to keep cutting rates, which would weaken the dollar further. A recession could trigger a rush out of risk, while a hot economy could revive talk of higher US rates. “With a weakening US dollar, carry should remain a source of return,” said Wim Vandenhoeck of Invesco. He expects strength in the Brazilian real, Turkish lira, and South Africa’s rand. On a Goldman Sachs podcast, Brian Dunne said shorting the dollar against the real, rand, and Mexican peso had been a strong call. An equal-weighted basket of that trade gained about 20% this year. Invesco sold the dollar against the rand and sold the euro against the Hungarian forint, with that position returning around 11% in 2025, including carry. Bank of America pushed into the real versus the Colombian peso, a rate-gap play that earned more than 2%. Traders track volatility risk into 2026 Another key question is whether FX swings stay calm. Carry trades depend on stable currencies because sharp moves can erase months of returns. Right now, expectations for swings are low. A JPMorgan gauge of emerging-market currency volatility for the next six months sits near its weakest point in five years. That calm worries some traders who think a rebound is due. “Volatility is very low in a lot of places,” said Francesca Fornasari of Insight Investment. “That’s my only worry, that the benign story is to some degree in the price.” Bank of America strategist Adarsh Sinha pointed to the US midterm elections and different rate paths across central banks as possible drivers of higher FX moves in the coming months. Even so, the turmoil sparked by President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement in April has faded. Vanguard said the shock should stay contained next year. “We don’t see enormous bouts of volatility associated with policy instability or recessionary risks,” said Vanguard.

Analysts across the industry now cite $800 as a realistic upside target for SOL in the next full-cycle expansion, driven by rising developer activity, growing institutional interest, and consistently increasing network usage. Yet even with Solana’s impressive trajectory, the project overshadowing nearly every long-term ROI model today is Ozak AI (OZ) . Its millisecond-speed predictive engine, autonomous multi-chain agents, and real-time, self-improving AI architecture give it a steeper, more exponential valuation curve than any large-cap asset can realistically match. Solana is showing massive momentum—but Ozak AI is building something even more powerful. Ozak AI Momentum Ozak AI continues attracting explosive attention because it enters the market with fully functioning AI infrastructure at a presale-stage valuation. Its predictive intelligence engine interprets market conditions in milliseconds, feeding on HIVE’s ultra-fast 30 ms execution signals to detect liquidity shifts and volatility patterns long before traditional systems react. SINT-powered autonomous agents run on top of this architecture, scanning and reacting across chains instantly, adjusting strategies without human input. With Perceptron Network’s 700K+ nodes supplying continuous cross-chain intelligence, Ozak AI becomes smarter and more accurate every day. This compounding intelligence effect is the backbone of Ozak AI’s aggressive long-term forecasts. Analysts aren’t projecting 50x–100x because of hype—they’re modeling exponential growth based on an AI system that continuously improves. With the OZ presale now exceeding $4.9 million, early investor confidence confirms that market participants recognize Ozak AI as one of the most promising intelligence-layer tokens of this cycle. Solana (SOL) Solana trades around $132 and continues forming one of the strongest structural recoveries in the market. Immediate support sits near $129, providing short-term stability, while deeper structural bases form around $124 and $118 — levels that historically trigger renewed accumulation from long-term holders. As Solana pushes higher, it approaches resistance at $137, followed by higher breakout levels at $142 and $148, zones where previous major rallies have ignited. Solana’s fundamentals remain exceptionally bullish. Its low fees, unmatched throughput, and large developer ecosystem set the stage for continued long-term expansion. Institutional interest has been rising throughout the year, and many analysts believe Solana is one of the few large-cap assets capable of revisiting and surpassing its prior all-time highs. Targets between $500 and $800 have become common among cycle analysts. But even at $800, Solana’s multiplier potential naturally remains limited by its already-large market size. Ozak AI vs Solana Solana grows through user adoption, ecosystem expansion, and network demand—all powerful drivers, but ultimately capped by market-cap gravity. Ozak AI grows through intelligence. Every additional dataset strengthens its predictive engine. Every multi-chain scan enhances its automated agents. Every new integration expands its AI-driven value. This means Ozak AI does not grow linearly—it grows exponentially. Solana may 4x–6x in a strong cycle. Ozak AI, beginning at a low presale valuation and driven by compounding AI intelligence, may multiply fiftyfold or even more. This difference explains why Ozak AI consistently dominates long-term ROI models. Why Ozak AI Leads Long-Term Projections Solana remains one of the best-performing large caps in the market, and its momentum justifies the growing calls for $800 targets. But Ozak AI’s architecture—based on speed, prediction, autonomy, and evolving intelligence—positions it in a different category entirely. It isn’t an ecosystem token or a meme token. It’s the intelligence layer for Web3—a system that improves itself continuously as data increases. Solana may hit new highs. Ozak AI may hit new horizons. As long-term investors position themselves for 2025–2026, Solana remains a powerhouse—but Ozak AI stands out as the project with the deepest upside, the most advanced utility, and the clearest path to exponential long-term returns.

At the forefront of this trend is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is developing traction as it continues to be recognized as the best cheap cryptocurrency to buy because it represents an intersection of early adoption and working DeFi functionality. At a price of $0.035 per token, it is increasingly becoming the next crypto to explode because of its rapid presale volume, with Phase 6 being sold out at a very rapid rate and an almost completely realized working DeFi lending and borrowing platform that aims at providing sustainable returns for all participants. Already exceeding 18,480 accounts on board, Mutuum Finance continues to overshadow prominent market altcoins as a superior and more attractive entry option for aspiring market participants looking for high market return on investment. Ethereum Consolidates at Main Support Area as Market Awaits Next Move Ethereum (ETH) is at a crossroads in an extremely critical phase and an identifiable accumulation pattern is emerging around a fundamental support level. The price band of $3,000–$3,100 represents the area where bulls and bears are secretly aligning for a fundamental breakout. Simultaneously, stabilization in BTC sets an encouraging background for ETH’s growth. At present, ETH manages to sustain itself slightly above $3,179 as it witnesses a liquidity harvest at approximately $3,471, and market participants are waiting and watching if it will rise towards $4,000 or drop towards $2,600. During this phase of market fluctuation, market participants have become increasingly interested in new opportunities with high adoption and utilization rates, and the focus has shifted to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM Presale Phase 6 Almost Sold Out Mutuum Finance shines as the best cheap cryptocurrency to buy as it nearly sells out Phase 6 of its presale. Already, more than 98% of presale tokens at a cost of $0.035 have been sold, giving early investors a last chance before Phase 7, which will include an increased price rate of $0.04. So far, more than 18,480 people have shown interest in the Mutuum Finance presale and have generated more than $19.45 million. It should be noted that apart from successful fundraising, Mutuum Finance is attracting many people with its unique platform and perfectly designed lending markets, making it a highly promising DeFi crypto. Real-time Earnings with mtTokens One thing that makes Mutuum Finance stand out is staking its mtTokens, which permit users to start receiving passive income as soon as they make deposits. Unlike traditional methods that allow people to receive income on withdrawals alone, mtTokens permit an immediate return. Also, with mtTokens, people can engage other DeFi services and at the same time receive income. Mutuum Finance enhances the usefulness and worth of MUTM. Its buy-and-distribute mechanism ensures that fees created as a result of lending and borrowing are eventually used to buy back MUTM and distribute it among mtToken stakers. It creates permanent buying pressure and relates the appreciation of value directly with platform usage and not pure speculation. As such, it makes for an operational and highly promising DeFi investment. Ethereum (ETH) is seen around $3,179, ranging within $3,000–$3,100. Conversely, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making headlines as the best cheap cryptocurrency to buy. Phase 6 presale at $0.035 is more than 98% sold out with 18,480+ participants and $19.45M raised. MUTM provides tangible DeFi applications: overcollateralized loans, rapid yield generation through mtTokens, and its buy-and-distribute model that correlates token value with platform usage. MUTM has been dubbed the next crypto to explode and has high potential to hit $1.

This single transaction, valued at approximately $1 billion, represents one of the largest stablecoin movements of the year. But what does this colossal USDT transferred event truly signify for the market? Let’s dive into the implications of this whale-sized maneuver. What Does This Billion-Dollar USDT Transfer Mean? When a whale moves this much capital, the market pays attention. The transaction involved moving Tether’s USDT stablecoin from a centralized exchange (HTX) to a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol (Aave). This specific action suggests the entity behind the transfer is seeking yield or lending opportunities within the DeFi space rather than simply holding assets on an exchange. The sheer scale of this USDT transferred operation indicates sophisticated institutional or whale activity with specific strategic intentions. Stablecoins like USDT serve as the lifeblood of crypto trading and DeFi ecosystems. They provide price stability in a volatile market and act as a bridge between traditional finance and cryptocurrency. Therefore, a movement of this magnitude directly impacts liquidity across multiple platforms. The destination—Aave—is particularly telling. Aave is a leading decentralized lending protocol where users can deposit assets to earn interest or borrow against their holdings. Why Would a Whale Move USDT to Aave? The decision to transfer such a vast sum to Aave likely revolves around several key financial strategies: Yield Generation: By depositing USDT into Aave, the whale can earn a passive yield from borrowers who pay interest on their loans. Collateral for Borrowing: The deposited USDT can be used as collateral to borrow other cryptocurrencies, enabling leveraged trading strategies without selling the original stablecoin position. Capital Efficiency: DeFi protocols often allow users to employ their capital more efficiently across multiple strategies simultaneously. Market Positioning: This could signal preparation for anticipated market movements or volatility where having assets in a lending protocol provides flexibility. This strategic USDT transferred to Aave demonstrates how sophisticated players utilize DeFi infrastructure. Unlike simply holding assets on an exchange, deploying capital in Aave turns static holdings into productive assets. The whale essentially transforms their billion-dollar position from idle cash into an interest-earning instrument with additional utility for future financial maneuvers. How Does This USDT Transfer Impact Crypto Markets? The immediate effect of this transaction is multifaceted. First, it removes a significant amount of liquidity from HTX, potentially affecting trading pairs and market depth on that exchange. Second, it injects substantial liquidity into the Aave protocol, which could influence lending rates and borrowing availability across the DeFi ecosystem. When such a large amount of USDT is transferred into a lending protocol, it typically increases the supply side, which might temporarily lower interest rates for USDT lenders on Aave. Moreover, transactions of this scale often serve as market signals. Other traders and institutions monitor whale movements for clues about market sentiment and strategic positioning. This particular move suggests confidence in the DeFi sector’s stability and yield opportunities despite broader market conditions. It also highlights the growing maturity of cryptocurrency markets, where billion-dollar positions can move seamlessly between centralized and decentralized platforms. What Are the Risks of Such Large Stablecoin Movements? While impressive in scale, transactions like this USDT transferred between platforms do carry certain considerations: Smart Contract Risk: Despite Aave’s established reputation, depositing $1 billion into any smart contract carries inherent technical risk. Market Impact: If the whale decides to withdraw or redeploy these funds suddenly, it could create liquidity shocks. Regulatory Attention: Transactions of this magnitude often attract scrutiny from regulatory bodies monitoring capital flows. Counterparty Risk: While reduced in DeFi compared to centralized platforms, there’s still reliance on protocol security and governance. However, the very occurrence of this transaction demonstrates growing confidence in DeFi infrastructure’s ability to handle institutional-scale operations. The fact that an entity feels comfortable moving $1 billion through these channels marks a significant milestone for decentralized finance adoption. The Future of Whale Movements in DeFi This billion-dollar USDT transferred event likely represents a trend rather than an anomaly. As DeFi protocols mature and offer competitive financial products, we can expect more institutional capital to flow from traditional exchanges to decentralized platforms. The transparency of blockchain tracking means these movements become public market signals, creating a new layer of market intelligence for all participants. The transaction underscores several key developments: the growing interoperability between centralized and decentralized finance, the increasing scale of operations within crypto ecosystems, and the sophisticated financial strategies now possible with digital assets. As infrastructure improves and yields remain attractive, Aave and similar protocols may see more of these monumental transfers. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for DeFi The movement of 1,000,000,090 USDT from HTX to Aave represents more than just a large transaction—it symbolizes the evolving landscape of digital finance. This whale’s decision to deploy capital in DeFi rather than keep it parked on an exchange highlights the growing sophistication and opportunity within decentralized ecosystems. As the market digests this USDT transferred event, it serves as a powerful reminder of how cryptocurrency and DeFi continue to redefine what’s possible with global capital movements. Such transparent, large-scale operations were unimaginable in traditional finance just a decade ago. Today, they occur on public blockchains for anyone to analyze, demonstrating the revolutionary potential of this technology. This transaction doesn’t just move value—it moves the entire industry forward. Frequently Asked Questions Q1: What is Whale Alert and how does it track such transactions? A1: Whale Alert is a blockchain tracking service that monitors large cryptocurrency transactions across public ledgers. It uses algorithms to identify substantial movements of digital assets and reports them publicly, providing transparency into whale activities. Q2: Why is the amount 1,000,000,090 USDT instead of a round number? A2: The specific amount likely includes transaction fees or represents the exact available balance after accounting for minor costs. In blockchain transactions, whales often transfer entire wallets contents rather than round numbers. Q3: Could this USDT transfer affect stablecoin prices? A3: While individual transactions rarely affect stablecoin prices directly, massive movements can impact liquidity on specific platforms. USDT maintains its peg through arbitrage mechanisms and reserve backing rather than individual transaction sizes. Q4: How long does it take to transfer $1 billion in USDT? A4: On the Tron or Ethereum networks where USDT commonly operates, such transfers typically confirm within minutes, demonstrating the efficiency of blockchain settlements compared to traditional banking systems. Q5: What percentage of Aave’s total USDT supply does this represent? A5: While exact percentages fluctuate with market conditions, a $1 billion deposit represents a significant portion of Aave’s USDT market, potentially making this whale one of the protocol’s largest liquidity providers. Q6: Are there tax implications for transferring this much USDT? A6: Tax implications vary by jurisdiction, but moving assets between wallets or platforms typically doesn’t create taxable events. However, earning yield or realizing gains through subsequent activities would have tax consequences in many regions.

55778511,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/12/how-solana-turned-three-low-cap-memecoins-into-a-cultural-narrative,1765725068,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/55778511.jpeg,How Solana Turned Three Low-Cap Memecoins Into a Cultural Narrative,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/12/how-solana-turned-three-low-cap-memecoins-into-a-cultural-narrative,"Solana has long been the platform for memecoins, which continue to rise, fueled by the network’s lightning-fast transactions and near-zero fees. The blockchain’s “Proof of History” feature is its calling card, validating transactions in order based on timestamps, a technical approach that makes it more efficient than other blockchains. Solana is also beginner-friendly. Meme-fueled tokens are easy to trade, exchange, and launch, making them a boon to cultural micromovements. The combination of speed, ease of use, and efficiency has welcomed memecoins grounded in a wide range of philosophies. At the core of the most recent wave of decentralized platforms is meme culture, which manifests in how interaction models, branding decisions, and user interfaces are evolving to cater to audiences that crave relatability, humor, aesthetics, or the desire to exit the matrix. Solana memecoin philosophies range from nostalgia to absurdity and nihilism; if there is a philosophy, you’ll find it embodied in at least one token. Here are three low-cap gems to watch out for in 2026, grounded in memorable philosophies. 1. $NONPC, the return to awareness and collective awakening The movement behind No NPC Society and its token $NONPC explores the idea that online interactions are increasingly and regrettably characterized by NPC (non-player character) behavior, or people acting mechanically without mindfulness or awareness. The project was launched with a focus on individual agency, digital consciousness, and collective awakening. Beyond a meme token, $NONPC is structured as a cultural identity protocol centered around the “NPC phenomenon” in digital life, personal awareness, and simulation theory. While meme tokens typically offer pure speculation, $NONPC combines a philosophy bridging NPC awareness, the simulation hypothesis , meme culture, DAO governance right from the start, and full transparency, including wallet governance. This token can appeal to the three main personality types of Solana memecoin investors - the hustler, the day trader, and the hodler - and potentially fulfill different investment purposes. Solana offers low barriers to entry and exposure to community members who support or are ready to open their minds to the no-NPC philosophy. 2. $HYPER, a philosophy of accelerated freedom Despite being conceived within the ideology of freedom from government intervention and existing payment infrastructure, low speed remains a major challenge for Bitcoin. The core idea of Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is that freedom increases as the friction between intent and action approaches zero. $HYPER becomes the emblem of this philosophy: a system where value moves at the speed of thought, where sovereignty is amplified through velocity, and where users transcend the slow, centralized, constraining structures of legacy finance. Bitcoin Hyper aims to use the best of both worlds by developing a Bitcoin L2 blockchain that runs on the Solana Virtual Machine. It aims to match Solana’s speed, as the Bitcoin blockchain can process only 7 TPS. For now, its market cap is just $69,740, but the combination of a solid use case and momentum makes the project fascinating. The SVM-powered Bitcoin L2 also addresses issues such as high fees, limited programmability in the BTC ecosystem, and the lack of native smart contracts. It targets developers who are familiar with the Solana tooling stack and Rust but want Bitcoin liquidity and security. Of course, there is always a risk with memecoins. There have been reports that the platform prevented holders from selling their $HYPER tokens at one point. One’s choice of exchange is very important. 3. $KEYCAT: The love for art above all else $KEYCAT celebrates the legacy of the Keyboard Cat meme. While its market cap is just $14M, it has a solid community, and the number of holders is steadily increasing according to CoinMarketCap. The meme goes back to Charlie Schmidt, an artistic kid of poor immigrant parents. His parents wanted him to become a doctor or a lawyer, but his heart was set on art. One of his vivid and fond childhood memories was drawing on both sides of a thin white cardboard delivered with his mother’s nylon stockings in the mail. He decided to major in architecture after high school because the “arch” sounded like “art.” Predictably, his studies at Washington State were unfulfilling until the school announced it was looking for art students to study in Tokyo. He had changed majors by that time and landed the opportunity. Upon returning to the US in the early 70s, he faced a devastating new reality: art majors were now a dime a dozen. He took different jobs and became busy surviving until one cold afternoon in his apartment in 1984 (ice in the toilet bowl and heating off to save money). He decided to record his cat, Fatso, playing the keyboard. He put a teal shirt on her, recorded a simple tune, held her up to the keyboard, and pressed “play.” With the arrival of YouTube, he uploaded the video; it became popular, and then the viral meme was born. How Solana became a home for cultural experimentation Web3 continues to evolve, democratizing culture, allowing artists to bypass gatekeepers and connect with one another directly, and opening the way for more voices to be heard. It prioritizes transparency, user ownership, and interoperability, resulting in a more democratic art market, an empowered role for creators, and the potential for new artistic expressions. Affordable, chaotic, and community-driven, Solana memecoins are transforming internet culture into on-chain action. Memecoin communities generate grassroots storytelling, and culture supplies attention instead of Solana needing to buy it. The blockchain’s low fees, fast finality, and large retail participation have made it the natural hub for memetic experimentation. Beyond a market, Solana is a home for cultural experimentation, and the philosophies of memecoins become the stories it tells. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The declining pressure is evident in reduced deposits into exchanges and a significant recovery in bitcoin’s (BTC) price over the last three weeks. Analysts at the research firm CryptoQuant reported that continued low selling pressure could trigger a relief rally in BTC. This uptrend could be supported by the 25 basis points interest rate cut announced by the Federal Reserve during the just-concluded Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Reduced Selling Pressure According to CryptoQuant, BTC recovered from $80,000 on November 21 to a monthly high of $94,000 a few days ago. At the time of writing, the asset was trading around $90,000, up 1% weekly. Bitcoin deposits into exchanges have fallen from 88,000 BTC in mid-November to 21,000 BTC today. The deposits began to decline after the cryptocurrency hit its all-time high of $126,000, as large players reduced their transfers to trading platforms. Currently, the share of total deposits from large players has plummeted from a 24-hour average high of 47% in mid-November to 21% today. Additionally, the average deposit has decreased by 36%, from 1.1 BTC to 0.7 BTC, over the same timeframe. Incoming Rally for BTC? The decline in exchange deposits and downward price pressure also comes as large investors and short-term holders realize their losses. About a month ago, new and old whales realized $646 million in losses, the largest since July. This came as bitcoin’s price first fell below $100,000. Since then, this cohort of investors has realized at least $3.2 billion in losses. On the other hand, short-term holders have been offloading their assets at a negative profit margin over the last four weeks. The lowest reading sits at -7%, while the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) hovers below 1. “Historically, selling pressure eases when market participants realize they have incurred heavy losses,” CryptoQuant analysts explained. If the selling pressure stays eased off, BTC could return to the $99,000 level, which is considered the lower band of the Trader On-chain Realized Price range. This level usually marks a resistance during bear cycles, alongside the on-year moving average and the Trader On-chain Realized price, which are $102,000 and $112,000, respectively.

SPX6900 (SPX) functions primarily on the Ethereum network. The token was created as a meme to entertain wider audiences. It has no real connection with stock market, equities, or securities. The meme coin generates interest through spot trading, market speculation, or perpetual and leveraged trading on different decentralized exchanges; the latter is not recommended for non-professionals due to its high risk and highly volatile nature. SPX6900 is traded on different centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges. The most popular centralized exchange for trading SPX tokens is Bybit, which has the highest trading volume for this meme coin. SPX6900 (SPX) can be stored in various wallets, including Trust Wallet, Bitget Wallet, and hardware wallets like Ledger. It can also be stored on a centralized exchange like KuCoin and another option could be Kraken, providing easy access to the coin. Early users attest to its credibility and remarkable price performance; however, the meme token still holds the interest of many investors with a daily trading volume in millions and a current circulating supply of 930.99 million SPX, which is also its total supply, although its max supply will be 1 billion tokens. Starting as a non-serious venture, the coin established itself as one of the most high-ranking coins of the year 2024. It was initiated as a useless token but ultimately ended up earning profits in the millions. For example, over a month, SPX earned up to a 9000% return following its ascent through September 2024.

In October 2023, SPX’s value spiked to $0.023 under bullish control, which was a considerable growth trajectory, but still, it remained far from market attention. December of 2023 saw a low price of $0.008, which was quite low as compared to the price in October as per crypto market historical data.

In September 2024, SPX6900 gained an enormous 5600% from September 12 to October 14, reaching $0.913, resulting in a massive market capitalization.

On November 21, SPX6900 stooped to $0.450, losing 50% of its value, which made holders cautious. However, the token regained its lost value and ended the year at $0.856. The meme token entered January 2025 with a price tag of $0.866, but it soon jumped to $1.55 as its circulation and acceptance increased. It corrected strongly in search of support at the start of February, attaining an average price of $0.66, but came down to the 0.46 range in March. In April, the coin was trending near $0.386 on the lower side, while in May, it saw a fabulous recovery, peaking at $1.11 along with some other cryptocurrencies. On June 11, the meme coin attained its all time high of $1.73, and on July 28, it marked another ATH at $2.27. SPX maintained a trading range of $1.06 to $2 in August under complete bullish dominance, proving itself a reliable asset, and was trading at an average price of $1.16 in September.

The jump is tied to structured products linked to Hong Kong and Singapore stocks, which climbed about 80% as families with deep pockets chase steady payouts and exposure to big tech names even after getting hit with heavy losses in earlier downturns. Banks are seeing rising orders for accumulators, which force buyers to pick up shares at preset prices over time, and fixed-coupon notes that pay monthly income. Investors are betting that the region’s AI rally, not caution, is the thing to follow. The activity comes at a time when equities across Asia are running hot on the back of the AI craze. Private banks are targeting their richest clients with structured notes tied to Alibaba and Tencent, two names now replacing earlier favorites like Nvidia . The appeal is simple: more control over stock exposure and predictable payouts. But the structure also creates risk if prices fall below key levels. Investors build positions through rising issuance Tony Lee, head of global equity-derivatives strategy at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said issuance “was very limited for the last few years, up until September of last year,” and he pointed to the recovery in China as the main driver. Tony said “the product underlyings have shifted from US stocks into Hong Kong stocks,” reflecting how regional sentiment changed as Chinese markets picked up this year. Asia still leads the world in these deals, with more than 60% of global sales coming from the region in the first seven months of 2025, based on industry figures covering China and Hong Kong. These notes usually deliver smaller top-end payouts than buying shares outright, but buyers want the monthly income, which is often higher than bond yields, and they want the built-in protections. Still, the guardrails are not bulletproof. The collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, the start of Covid, and the long slide caused by China’s crackdown on internet giants all hit investors who held similar products. Accumulators force regular buying at fixed prices. When markets rise, they give investors a discount. When markets fall, they force the buyer to pick up shares above the screen price. At CA Indosuez Wealth Management, Ting May Woo said many of the most-traded accumulators require buyers to take double the original amount of Alibaba shares if the price falls more than 10% to 20% from the starting level. That doubling effect has become a common feature and has made investors more sensitive to sudden drops. If any one of the three names falls 28% or more from the price at entry, the buyer must purchase shares at a higher price than what the market is trading at, or settle in cash at a loss. Every part of the deal depends on the relative performance of the stocks. AI names drive returns across the region Structured products tied to Chinese AI names are pulling in the most interest. Daniel So, senior trading strategist at Goldhorse Capital Management, said Alibaba is now the dominant underlying asset for structured notes issued across Asia this year. Daniel said coupons tied to Chinese AI names usually fall between 10% and 20% annualized, while index-based products sit closer to 10% to 12%. The performance explains the demand. Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares are up almost 90% this year, and the Hang Seng Tech Index gained 26% after years of lagging behind US tech benchmarks. At Royal Bank of Canada, Kin Lok Lee said 30% to 40% of its equity-linked notes in 2025 were tied to Hong Kong names, up from 20% in 2024, when about 80% of the fixed-coupon notes followed US stocks instead. Daniel said “investors who buy these notes usually can accept the worst-case scenario, which is to buy these shares at pre-determined strike levels higher than market prices, because they hold the belief that these stocks will eventually recover.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",Economy,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-14 15:15:50

The cryptocurrency market just witnessed a seismic shift. Whale Alert, the blockchain tracking service, reported a staggering 297,000,000 USDT transferred from the Bybit exchange to an unknown wallet. This single transaction, valued at nearly $297 million, immediately sent ripples through the crypto community. What does such a colossal USDT transfer signify? Is it a routine operational move, a strategic whale accumulation, or a signal of broader market sentiment? Let’s dive into the implications of this monumental movement. What Does a 297 Million USDT Transfer Really Mean? First, let’s break down the basics. A USDT transfer of this magnitude is never trivial. Tether (USDT) is the world’s largest stablecoin, designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar. When hundreds of millions move off a major exchange like Bybit, it typically indicates one of a few scenarios. The funds could be moving to cold storage for safekeeping, being redeployed to another trading venue, or prepared for a large over-the-counter (OTC) deal. The ‘unknown wallet’ label adds a layer of intrigue, meaning the destination is a private, non-custodial address not immediately linked to a known service. Why Are Whale Movements So Critical to Watch? Whales—entities holding vast amounts of crypto—can significantly influence market prices. Their actions often precede major price swings. Therefore, tracking a USDT transfer this large is crucial for several reasons: Liquidity Signal: Moving stablecoin off an exchange can reduce immediate buying pressure or signal a wait-and-see approach. Market Sentiment: Large accumulations in private wallets can hint at long-term holding strategies, potentially bullish for the asset being targeted. Operational Clarity: Sometimes, these are simply internal movements between exchange hot and cold wallets, a routine security practice. However, the sheer size demands attention. It represents a substantial portion of liquidity being pulled from one of the ecosystem’s key trading hubs. Could This USDT Transfer Impact Market Stability? While a single transaction is unlikely to break Tether’s peg, it does test the mechanisms of market stability. The immediate effect is often psychological, influencing trader behavior. If the market interprets this as a whale preparing to sell other assets, it could induce short-term fear. Conversely, if it’s seen as capital being positioned to buy, it could foster optimism. The health of the stablecoin ecosystem relies on transparency and the efficient movement of capital, which this USDT transfer demonstrates on a grand scale. How Should Investors and Traders React? For the average investor, panic is not a strategy. Instead, use this as a learning moment. Here are actionable insights: Monitor, Don’t React: One data point doesn’t make a trend. Watch for follow-up transactions or related market movements. Context is Key: Assess broader market conditions. Is Bitcoin in an accumulation phase? Are other stablecoins moving similarly? Verify Sources: Rely on multiple blockchain explorers like Etherscan or Tronscan to confirm Whale Alert’s data, ensuring you have the full picture. This event underscores the importance of on-chain analytics in modern crypto investing. The Bottom Line on Billion-Dollar Crypto Movements In conclusion, the 297 million USDT transfer from Bybit is a powerful reminder of the scale and opacity inherent in decentralized finance. It highlights the constant, massive flows of capital that occur behind the scenes. While its ultimate purpose remains shrouded, it reinforces key lessons: the market is driven by large players, transparency is evolving, and due diligence is non-negotiable. Such movements are not inherently bearish or bullish but are vital signs of the market’s dynamic liquidity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Whale Alert? A1: Whale Alert is a blockchain tracking service that monitors and reports large cryptocurrency transactions, typically those exceeding a certain value threshold, to provide market transparency. Q2: Why is an “unknown wallet” significant? A2: An “unknown wallet” is a private cryptocurrency address not labeled or associated with a known exchange, custodian, or entity. This makes the owner’s intent and identity unclear, fueling speculation. Q3: Could this large USDT transfer affect the price of Bitcoin or Ethereum? A3: Indirectly, yes. If the USDT is later used to purchase large amounts of BTC or ETH, it could create upward price pressure. Conversely, if it signals a withdrawal of liquidity from crypto, it might be seen as a cautious or bearish signal. Q4: Is it safe for Tether (USDT) to handle such large transfers? A4: Technically, yes. The Tether network is built to process large transactions. The greater concern is often about the concentration of assets and the reasons behind the move, not the technical capability. Q5: How can I track transactions like this myself? A5: You can use blockchain explorers for the relevant network (e.g., Tronscan for Tron-based USDT, Etherscan for Ethereum-based USDT) and follow analytics platforms like Whale Alert on social media for real-time alerts. Q6: Has Tether commented on this specific transfer? A6> As of this writing, Tether Operations Limited has not issued a public statement regarding this specific transaction. Large transfers between exchanges and private wallets are a normal part of ecosystem operations. Did this analysis of the massive USDT transfer help you understand whale movements better?

The Nvidia co-founder, once barely known in the capital, now sits at the center of a deal that could channel billions of dollars back to the $4 trillion chip giant. The White House approved exports of Nvidia’s advanced H200 chips to China, a move pushed through by Jensen after direct talks with Donald Trump. The US gets a 25% cut of the sales. Trump had once said he had “never heard” of Nvidia or Jensen, yet he overruled members of his own MAGA coalition to clear the path for the company. Competitors are trying to understand how a soft-spoken engineer gained this level of access. One person familiar with Nvidia’s strategy allegedly said, “I think game recognises game,” adding that the president’s control style “is effectively the way that Jensen runs Nvidia. There are no fiefdoms… and Jensen’s instincts kind of reign.” Jensen expands access and builds leverage Jensen did not spend much time in Washington before this year. People close to Nvidia say he questioned the “value proposition” of getting close to Trump after the November election. A source said Jensen “remembered enough from Trump 1 to know that he is mercurial as hell and you can’t really buy stability.” Others said he wanted to help the administration understand the artificial intelligence sector. While tech billionaires Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos attended Trump’s inauguration, Jensen stayed in Taiwan, celebrating the Lunar New Year with employees. His early entry to Trump’s circle came through Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Jensen said Lutnick opened their first talk with, “Jensen… I just want to let you know that you’re a national treasure, and Nvidia is a national treasure. And whenever you need access to the president, the administration, you call us.” Jensen said on a podcast that it was “completely true… they were always available.” Nvidia’s profile in Washington grew fast as the White House restricted exports of its H20 chips to China. That rule was part of Trump’s wider conflict with Beijing. To align with Trump’s demands for more US manufacturing, Nvidia joined a consortium pledging to invest half a trillion dollars domestically over four years. In April, Jensen flew to Mar-a-Lago and met Trump on the sidelines of a $1 million per head dinner. The administration eased some of its limits in the months that followed.Jensen kept a heavy schedule with Trump, meeting him privately at least six times and speaking to him directly on the phone. Jensen also traveled with the president to the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and the UK. He stood beside him at the White House AI Action Plan summit in July, where Trump said, “What a job you’ve done, man.” In October, Jensen contributed to a ballroom project for the president. Jensen pushes Congress and shapes the export fight Jensen’s push in Washington widened beyond the White House. He argued to lawmakers that banning US chip sales to Chinese AI developers would not stop their progress but would push China’s chipmakers to catch up. At a House foreign affairs committee hearing in May, he said Nvidia’s absence meant “competitors like Huawei [were] already stepping in.”Nvidia’s China teams conducted their own research on chipmaking rivals to support the company’s case. Nvidia focused on educating policymakers and that its predictions on China’s capabilities “were often proved accurate.” Nvidia’s advocacy on Capitol Hill was led by Tim Teter, the company’s top legal executive and a trusted adviser to Jensen. Nvidia avoided big industry associations and hired a Republican lobbyist who once worked for Ivanka Trump. A senior lobbyist said, “They had a one-person shop that didn’t lobby, and now have a much larger team.” The company’s arguments stayed centered on exports. Since Nvidia sells hardware instead of building AI models like OpenAI, it did not have to answer for fears about job losses or kids’ mental health. Jensen’s effort still met pushback. National security officials and think-tank researchers opposed Nvidia’s requests. Trump admitted that when he first heard about Nvidia’s market share, his instinct was to break up the company. Steve Bannon called the H200 deal proof that Trump was “badly advised.” Democrats such as Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized Jensen for mostly meeting Republicans. A bill that could have restricted H20 exports was dropped, but a new bipartisan bill now aims to limit the administration’s power to approve Nvidia’s chip sales. The first attempt to reopen H20 exports required Nvidia to hand the US a 15% cut, but Beijing pushed back against the lower-spec chips. Nvidia shifted to a plan to sell the more advanced H200 chips. Jensen convinced the White House that keeping Nvidia dominant required wide global sales. Former national security adviser Robert O’Brien backed that message, saying the US market alone could not absorb chips from Nvidia, Intel, and AMD.

The growing adoption rate of the XRP Ledger Protocol could push XRP to an average price of $9.79, with a possible maximum trading value of $10.45 in 2028. In 2031, the target price for XRP is between $15.67 and $16.97, with an average price of $16.32. XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future. Whether it will reach new highs or continue to grow steadily remains to be seen, and despite its history of legal battles with the Securities and Exchange Commission, this digital asset will undoubtedly play an important role in global financial institutions. So, how high can XRP realistically go? Will XRP reach 5 dollars? Let’s answer these questions in our XRP price prediction.

This descent is reflected by a downward curve on the RSI graph. If the bearish momentum continues to rise, the market can enter a period of instability. XRP price analysis on the 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis of XRP confirmed a bullish market trend for the cryptocurrency. Its value increased to $2.005 in the past four hours. The decreasing volatility signals fewer signs of reversal in the coming hours. The Bollinger bands are converging as volatility decreases.

The daily price analysis for the XRP/USD pair presents a bearish trend for the cryptocurrency. In the past 24 hours, the bears continued their lead, thereby creating detrimental circumstances for the investors. As a result, the coin value has dropped to $2.005 because of the declining momentum today. At the same time, the four-hour price analysis remained favorable to the buyers because of the latest positive turnover. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple, along with the rising adoption, might boost the XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisitions and CBDC developments make XRP a good long-term investment option. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. It is advised to proceed with caution. Why is XRP down? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has decreased as selling momentum picked up, driving the coin’s price from $2.02 to $2.005. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $2.26 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? If demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent, the coin could approach $5 by 2026. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.65, achieved on July 18, 2025. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a chance of reaching near $20 by 2031. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Still, the token provides a good buying opportunity to investors looking for long-term goals. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is expected to reach a maximum price of $16 by 2031, making it a valuable asset, particularly with the continued efforts of Ripple Labs. However, some regulatory uncertainties still exist for XRP. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research.

XRP historic price sentiment XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted to as low as $0.31, significantly decreasing XRP market cap. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. By the middle of May, XRP touched $2.57, and in July, it marked a new all-time high of $3.65. Near the start of August 2025, XRP was trending above $3, showing significant growth as the market sentiment was tilting toward the positive side; however, it lost $3 by the end of the month. In October through November, XRP traded around $1.83 to $3.10. At the start of December, XRP is trading around $1.99 to $2.18.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|XRP|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-14 15:45:00

Price weakness has kept the token below the psychological $2.00 level, even as institutional attention around Ripple continues to grow. While XRP consolidates, a new development highlights how large investors now seek exposure beyond public token markets. VivoPower Moves Ahead With Ripple-Approved Fund VivoPower International has received formal approval from Ripple to launch a $300 million institutional investment fund focused on Ripple’s equity. The initiative targets large investors rather than retail traders and centers on Ripple Labs shares instead of XRP tokens. This approach reflects a growing preference among institutions for structured and regulated exposure. Why does this matter now? Timing aligns closely with shifting regulatory and market conditions. Fund Structure and Operational Details The investment vehicle will operate through a joint venture between VivoPower and Lean Ventures, a Seoul-based asset manager with deep institutional ties. Lean Ventures manages capital for both South Korea’s government-linked entities and private institutions, giving the project strong local credibility. VivoPower’s digital asset subsidiary, Vivo Federation, will handle sourcing and acquiring Ripple Labs shares for the fund. Ripple has already issued written approval for the initial batch of preferred shares. VivoPower continues discussions with existing institutional shareholders to scale the vehicle toward its full $300 million target. This gradual build allows capital deployment to align with availability and pricing rather than rushed accumulation. Source: X Why South Korea Takes Center Stage South Korea sits at the core of the fund’s strategy. According to VivoPower advisory council chairman Adam Traidman, Korean institutions continue to show strong interest in Ripple’s long-term business growth. He noted that equity exposure can offer valuation entry points that differ from XRP’s spot price movements . This distinction appeals to investors focused on fundamentals rather than short-term market volatility. Lean Ventures managing partner Chris Kim reinforced that view, citing sustained demand for Ripple and XRP-related products across Korea. The country’s active digital asset market, combined with improving regulatory clarity, has encouraged institutions to explore larger and longer-term allocations. Korea’s role as a regional crypto hub strengthens the fund’s strategic positioning. Regulatory Progress Supports Institutional Confidence The launch coincides with broader regulatory milestones for Ripple. Recent developments, including Ripple securing an OCC banking license in the United States, have helped strengthen confidence among traditional finance players. These steps signal Ripple’s intent to integrate more deeply with regulated financial systems. As institutions weigh risk and compliance, such progress plays a critical role in decision-making. Revenue Expectations and Market Reaction VivoPower expects the fund to generate at least $75 million in combined management and performance fees over the next three years, based on the current target size. Any increase in fund scale or Ripple’s valuation could raise that figure. Following the announcement, VivoPower shares jumped about 13%, reflecting strong market reaction to the new revenue stream. Crypto analyst Crypto Eri highlighted that the fund offers structured access to Ripple-linked growth. This model allows institutions to bypass direct exposure to XRP price swings while maintaining alignment with Ripple’s broader ecosystem. Does this signal a broader trend? Institutions increasingly favor private equity-style exposure within the crypto sector. Ripple’s Institutional Path Expands The fund launch underscores Ripple’s expanding reach into long-term capital markets. While XRP price action remains subdued, institutional interest continues to evolve through regulated and equity-based channels. South Korea’s role in this shift stands out clearly. As retail markets remain cautious, Ripple’s strategy now speaks directly to institutions seeking scale, structure, and regulatory clarity.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-14 15:47:35

In this context, Canary Capital’s XRPC has emerged as the notable performer among U.S. spot XRP ETFs. Launched on November 13, 2025, XRPC set a new benchmark by posting the highest first-day trading volume of any ETF introduced this year, pulling in $59 million at launch and closing the session with about $250 million in assets under management. This performance edged out even the strong debut of Bitwise’s Solana ETF, positioning XRPC as a frontrunner in the push toward mainstream digital asset investing . By mid-December, XRPC’s assets had grown to approximately $343.7 million, with shares trading at roughly $21.33. U.S. spot XRP ETF performance. Source: XRP-insights Mixed returns from other XRP ETFs While XRPC leads the pack, other spot XRP ETFs have delivered mixed results amid rising overall interest. Grayscale’s GXRP, priced at $38, has accumulated $215.5 million in assets, supported by strong brand recognition. Bitwise’s XRP fund trades at $22 and has gathered $208.7 million in assets, appealing to more active traders. Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ, priced at $21.82, has $175 million in assets, pointing to growing competition from traditional finance firms. 21Shares’ TOXR, trading at $19.57, saw heavy November inflows totaling more than $666 million, though assets now stand at $239.9 million amid market volatility. REX-Osprey’s XRPR, the lowest-priced at $16.48, trails with $101.4 million in assets, while Bitwise’s BITW provides indirect exposure with a 5.01% XRP weighting valued at $56.3 million. Collectively, these funds have propelled the U.S. spot XRP ETF ecosystem to new heights, with cumulative assets under management surpassing $1.28 billion and total inflows approaching the $1 billion mark after a 15-day streak of net gains . This rapid accumulation has locked up more than 670 million XRP tokens, including 641.7 million held by dedicated funds and an additional 28.2 million via index allocations, which could tighten supply and influence market dynamics in the months ahead. Spot XRP price struggles Beyond the headline figures, the rise of XRP ETFs is highlighting a notable disconnect between investor demand and price performance. Despite steady inflows, XRP’s spot price has largely stagnated between $2.02 and $2.40. As of press time, XRP was trading at $1.99, down nearly 2% over the past 24 hours and off 2.4% on the weekly chart. XRP seven-day price chart.

Meanwhile, a separate TradingView chart shared on X shows MSTR sliding to about $178, as one trader targets $100 by mid January. Strategy Keeps Nasdaq 100 Spot as Saylor Repeats Bitcoin “Hoarding” Line Strategy, the company formerly known as MicroStrategy, kept its place in the Nasdaq 100 after the index’s annual reconstitution, and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor marked the decision with a message on X saying Bitcoin “hoarding” will continue. The Nasdaq said the reconstitution changes take effect before the market opens on Monday, Dec. 22, 2025. In the same update, the index added Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Ferrovial, Insmed, Monolithic Power Systems, Seagate Technology, and Western Digital, while Biogen, CDW, GlobalFoundries, Lululemon Athletica, ON Semiconductor, and Trade Desk will leave the benchmark. Strategy’s continued inclusion kept attention on its business profile. Reuters reported that the firm began as an enterprise software company, then pivoted in 2020 toward buying and holding Bitcoin, which led some market watchers to argue it now resembles an investment vehicle more than a traditional operating tech company. Ahead of the reconstitution, Reuters also reported that analysts had flagged the risk of passive-fund selling if Strategy lost its slot, while noting the company’s market value still met size requirements for the index. Separately, Reuters reported that MSCI has been weighing whether to exclude digital-asset-focused companies such as Strategy from some benchmarks, with a decision expected in January. Trader Flags $100 Target for Strategy Shares as Chart Shows Continued Downtrend Shares of Strategy, traded under the ticker MSTR, drew fresh attention after a post on X from the account @comic projected a drop toward $100 by mid January, citing a bearish technical setup visible on the daily chart. The post circulated alongside a TradingView chart that shows a steady decline from summer highs near $450, followed by a series of lower highs and lower lows into December. MSTR Daily Price Chart.

Price action formed a narrow upward sloping channel in recent sessions, which technicians often describe as a short term consolidation inside a broader downtrend. Volume bars beneath the chart show heavier activity during the earlier sell off, with more muted turnover during the latest sideways move.

Within the tech industry, top AI researchers now have such leverage that companies like Meta, xAI, OpenAI, and more are offering monetary compensation and incentives to attract and retain them. What are tech companies doing about the talent shortage? Fidji Simo, OpenAI’s applications chief, announced to staff this week that it is ending its policy requiring new employees to work at the company for at least six months before having access to equity, after previously shortening its vesting period from twelve months to six months in April. According to people familiar with the matter, the new policy aims to encourage potential hires to take risks and join the company without fear of being terminated before accessing their first equity payout. Elon Musk’s xAI also got rid of its vesting cliff in the summer when the company struggled with recruitment. The AI industry is experiencing an unprecedented demand for technical talent, with only an estimated 2,000 people worldwide possessing the specialized expertise needed to develop cutting-edge language models. This scarcity has created a bidding war between companies in the tech industry. OpenAI is already spending more on stock-based compensation than most technology companies, and the financial documents sent to its investors show that the company plans to allocate $6 billion, nearly half of its projected revenue, this year to equity awards. Tech investors argue that these increasing expenses reduce shareholder returns. In August, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg began to aggressively recruit OpenAI employees . According to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta has offered some researchers signing bonuses of up to $100 million, with total compensation packages reaching $300 million over four years. In response, OpenAI gave some of its top researchers and engineers one-time bonuses worth millions of dollars. Meta, Google, and Anthropic have also been actively recruiting, but retention rates vary significantly across companies. Anthropic is in the lead with an 80% two-year retention rate, Google DeepMind holds a 78% retention rate, while OpenAI and Meta hold 67% and 64% respectively. Companies like Anthropic emphasize mission and workplace culture rather than just monetary compensation like Meta. Why is it hard for xAI to recruit talent? xAI is having difficulties with recruitment due to several reasons. For one, the company has experienced a high turnover among senior leadership across legal, financial, and engineering positions. Some employees said they split from the company due to grueling work schedules, with one former legal executive announcing his departure from the company with a meme posted on LinkedIn. The image featured a man in a suit shoveling coal. Elon Musk’s close alliance with political figures like Donald Trump in 2024 and 2025, as well as his controversial statements on social issues, have also deterred some candidates. At least two engineers publicly cited Musk’s political activities as their reason for leaving positions at his companies. In July, the company’s Grok chatbot published antisemitic content, and the launch of Ani, an animated chatbot with revealing outfits, repelled some potential hires while attracting others. Despite these challenges, xAI has raised over $12 billion in funding and recently acquired X in an all-stock deal. The company’s acceptance rate has also improved since it shortened its vesting period.

Despite recent price pressure, development activity around the asset continues to expand. A new announcement from Hex Trust highlights how XRP’s utility now moves beyond its native ledger and into broader decentralized finance ecosystems. Hex Trust Introduces Wrapped XRP on Solana Hex Trust has announced the launch of wrapped XRP, known as wXRP, in partnership with cross-chain messaging protocol LayerZero. The wrapped asset represents native XRP on a 1:1 basis and will debut on Solana before expanding to other blockchains. Source: X This move allows XRP to participate directly in DeFi applications that operate outside the XRP Ledger. Why does this matter? It opens access to liquidity pools, swaps, and rewards systems that previously remained out of reach. How wXRP Is Structured Each unit of wXRP carries full backing from native XRP held in segregated custody with Hex Trust. Authorized merchants can mint and redeem the token in a controlled and compliant environment. This structure ensures that the circulating supply of wXRP always matches the XRP held in custody. A built-in burning mechanism supports parity by removing tokens when redemptions occur. Hex Trust will maintain institutional-grade custody standards, including auditability, insurance coverage, and anti-money laundering protections. These safeguards aim to meet regulatory expectations while supporting on-chain activity across multiple networks. LayerZero Powers Cross-Chain Access The wrapped token uses LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token standard. This framework enables wXRP to move seamlessly across supported blockchains without relying on unregulated bridges. As a result, users and institutions can interact with DeFi protocols across chains while maintaining consistent exposure to XRP. Markus Infanger, SVP of RippleX, noted that demand to use XRP across the broader crypto ecosystem continues to grow. He explained that the integration fits with ongoing work around RLUSD, offering regulated access to DeFi while allowing users to manage XRP positions across chains. Launch Liquidity and Network Expansion Hex Trust plans to launch wXRP with more than $100 million in total value locked. This initial liquidity aims to support stable trading activity from the start. Solana will serve as the first deployment network, followed by Optimism, Ethereum, HyperEVM, and other blockchains. Each expansion will extend XRP’s reach into new liquidity venues and application layers. The design also supports trading and liquidity pairing between XRP and RLUSD . This connection strengthens Ripple’s broader stablecoin and payments strategy while creating new options for DeFi participants. DeFi Use Cases Come Into Focus With wXRP, users can access swaps, liquidity provisioning, and rewards opportunities through supported DeFi platforms. Institutions can also engage with these activities under a regulated framework. The structure allows movement between chains without introducing third-party custodial risk. Does this change how XRP interacts with DeFi markets ? It creates a direct and compliant pathway that did not exist before. Giorgia Pellizzari, Chief Product Officer and Head of Custody at Hex Trust, said users of wXRP and RLUSD will benefit from assets built on compliant infrastructure. She emphasized that this approach enables broader DeFi utility across supported blockchains. XRP Utility Expands Beyond XRPL The wXRP launch follows Ripple’s recent XRPL v3.0.0 upgrade , which improved network stability and expanded DeFi-related features. Together, these developments reflect a broader effort to position XRP within cross-chain financial activity. While XRP’s market price remains under pressure, infrastructure expansion continues to progress. How quickly markets respond remains to be seen, but XRP’s functional footprint now reaches far beyond its original network.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|SOL|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-14 15:57:08

The guidance appears in recent research and reflects a shift toward incorporating digital assets within traditional wealth strategies. The bank framed Bitcoin not as a core holding, but as a complementary asset that may provide diversification benefits amid global economic uncertainty and domestic currency risks. Recent price swings and foreign exchange fluctuations have underscored the challenges many investors face, and Itaú’s report suggests disciplined, modest exposure could help address those issues. Itaú’s recommendation stems from internal analysis showing Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional stocks, bonds and fixed income, which has strengthened the case for including the asset in a broader investment mix. The bank noted that a calibrated allocation can offer exposure to potential long-term appreciation while managing overall risk. Rationale and Strategic Context Behind the Allocation Guidance Itaú’s decision reflects broader macro trends including geopolitical tension, shifting monetary policy and currency volatility in Brazil, where the real has fluctuated significantly. In its commentary, the bank’s strategists highlighted Bitcoin’s distinct dynamics and global, decentralized nature as key reasons for its potential role as a diversifier. The bank emphasized that timing the market is risky, and instead advocated for a long-term, disciplined approach in how investors build and maintain their Bitcoin positions. That view aligns with how modern portfolio theory treats small allocations to non-correlated assets. At the same time, Itaú is expanding its digital asset offerings through new products, including Bitcoin-related ETFs and funds, signaling a broader institutional embrace of cryptocurrency exposures that go beyond mere advisory notes. What Investors Should Know About the 1%–3% Recommendation Itaú’s specific range — 1% to 3% — is pitched as a controlled exposure, not a major shift in overall portfolio strategy. The bank’s research stresses that Bitcoin should remain a small strategic slice, intended to balance traditional assets rather than replace them. For Brazilian investors, the recommendation also accounts for the impact of exchange rate movements on returns, since Bitcoin’s performance in reais can differ sharply from its performance in dollars due to currency swings. While Bitcoin’s volatility persists, Itaú’s guidance places it alongside global institutional trends where banks and asset managers are cautiously integrating digital assets into long-term portfolio frameworks.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-14 15:59:52

Market commentators suggest that a select group of altcoins is beginning to separate from the rest, showing stronger signals and clearer development paths. Early investor sentiment indicates that while two established assets continue to hold influence, one low-priced altcoin under $0.05 is drawing rapid attention as momentum builds. Ethereum (ETH) and Pepecoin (PEPE) Ethereum remains one of the largest assets in the market, supported by years of development, ecosystem growth and institutional adoption. ETH delivered powerful gains in its early stages, helping long-term holders secure sizable returns. But as ETH’s market cap expanded, its price movement slowed. Analysts tracking crypto charts say ETH now struggles to break above key resistance zones, and each rally requires more capital than the last. Many traders believe ETH will continue to grow, but not with the explosive speed seen during its early years. Pepecoin (PEPE) offers a different story. It gained massive traction during its first viral surge. Its community-driven rise helped it secure listings and global visibility. But meme tokens depend on momentum, and that momentum has cooled. Analysts describe weaker demand, fading trend strength and a chart that struggles to retest previous highs. Several forecasts even show limited upside in the coming months. Because of this, many early ETH and PEPE investors are exploring new opportunities. They want projects with lower entry prices, stronger long-term structures and clearer growth windows. This is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters the discussion. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is developing a structured lending protocol built around predictable rules and sustainable incentives. The system lets users supply assets and earn yield through mtTokens, which increase in redeemable value as borrowers repay interest. Borrowers can access loans backed by collateral under defined LTV limits that keep the system safe during market fluctuations. Early traction is already visible. Mutuum Finance has raised $19.30M, attracted 18,400 holders, and reached a token price of $0.035. The project launched at $0.01 in early 2025 and has grown steadily since then. The presale is now in Phase 6, with more than 97% already allocated, and interest continues to rise as the next price step approaches. For investors watching top cryptocurrencies, these early signals fit the pattern of projects that gain traction before major development updates. Why ETH and PEPE Investors Are Turning Toward MUTM Many early ETH investors remember entering at low prices before the ecosystem expanded. Analysts say the same logic applies to Mutuum Finance. The project is early, priced low and preparing major releases. This is why some ETH holders are considering small allocations in MUTM as a long-term strategy. PEPE investors are also taking interest, but for different reasons. Some feel that meme-driven momentum is fading and they want exposure to a project with real mechanics rather than sentiment alone. Mutuum Finance fits this goal because mtTokens, LTV structures and lending rules give the protocol a clear function that operates independently from hype cycles. Mutuum Finance confirmed through its official X announcement that V1 will launch on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. The rollout includes the Liquidity Pool, mtToken system, Debt Token and Liquidator Bot. ETH and USDT will be the first supported assets. Analysts say having a clear timeline is one of the strongest signals for long-term investors evaluating potential best crypto opportunities before 2026. Many investors believe MUTM is following similar early steps seen in successful DeFi projects. Its focus on structure, yield mechanics and predictable rules separates it from meme tokens and helps explain the recent rotation from ETH and PEPE holders. Security Progress and Phase 6 Mutuum Finance also drives daily participation through a 24-hour leaderboard. The top contributor receives $500 in MUTM. This helps maintain consistent visibility and encourages investors to stay active. Card payment support adds accessibility, allowing new users to buy MUTM without needing a complex setup. Security progress is another area gaining attention. The project completed its CertiK audit with a 90/100 Token Scan score, which analysts say is strong for a protocol still in early development. Halborn Security is performing an additional review , and the team has launched a $50K bug bounty to uncover vulnerabilities before the testnet window opens. Phase 6 nearing full completion is one of the clearest indicators of rising demand. Only a small portion of tokens remain before the next price increase. Analysts who track presale phases point out that fast allocation often signals strong investor confidence. With more than 97% already taken, many traders searching for the best crypto to buy now are entering before the shift into Phase 7.

In his assessment, Ethereum has already moved through several key stages of the model and is now approaching a powerful expansion phase, provided the structure stays intact. Related Reading: American Bitcoin Makes Big Buy, Adds 416 BTC To Its Stack Wyckoff Accumulation Structure Taking Shape On Ethereum Chart Over the past several days, Ethereum has traded between roughly $3,050 and $3,400, repeatedly failing to secure a sustained move beyond either boundary. At the time of writing, Ethereum’s price action is trading around $3,100. This prolonged standoff has reinforced the view that Ethereum has returned to consolidating rather than trading in a defined trend, a behavior that aligns closely with the accumulation phase highlighted in a technical analysis by Merlijn The Trader. In his post, Merlijn described Ethereum’s chart as a “Wyckoff masterclass,” pointing to a sequence of events that align with textbook behavior from the Wyckoff accumulation schematic, which have been playing out for the entirety of 2025. According to the annotated structure, the spring occurred when ETH briefly dipped below $1,500 in the first half of the year. Price did not linger below that level for long, reclaiming the range within days and going on a rally that eventually ended at a selling climax (SC) of $4,946 Within this structure, the initial selling climax and automatic downtrend reaction established a clear range in which the cryptocurrency has been trading up until now. The chart labels show this as Ethereum moving through Phase D, and this has been highlighted by a downtrend in recent months. However, based on the Wyckoff framework, Ethereum seems to now be approaching the breakout zone, with a transition into a full Phase E and a potential vertical markup coming next if the structure continues to play out. Phase E Projection Points To Strong Upside Scenario If the Wyckoff roadmap continues to unfold as outlined, Merlijn believes Ethereum is setting up for a full Phase E, the final stage of the accumulation process. This phase is characterized by a sustained markup, where price exits the selling climax (SC) decisively and trends higher with increasing momentum. Ethereum / US Dollar: @MerlijnTrader on X The projection on the chart shows a sharp upside expansion once overhead resistance is cleared, with Merlijn pointing to $10,000 and higher as a long-term objective if the structure completes. The path higher is not expected to be linear. The model anticipates an initial push into new all-time highs, followed by a modest rejection around the $5,000 area before the price pauses to consolidate towards the Backup and Last Point of Support Related Reading: Do Kwon Falls Hard — Terraform Labs Chief Gets 15 Years For Wire Fraud According to the chart, this BU/LPS would likely form around $3,750.

Here’s What Is Happening,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-ceo-is-pushing-xrp-to-global-adoption-heres-what-is-happening/,"A recent post from community analyst Arthur presents a clear view of how senior figures across finance and technology respond after meeting Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse. According to the commentary, these individuals often begin with hesitation toward XRP but reportedly leave such discussions with a different assessment of its practical value. Arthur describes a pattern in which institutions that take the time to understand the asset’s utility subsequently choose to collaborate with Ripple or incorporate XRP into their operations. The post describes this trend as evidence of how consistent engagement and detailed explanations from the company’s leadership influence decision-makers who are evaluating modern payment solutions. EXPLAIN ME THIS : Every single time a CEO, a fund manager, a policymaker or a tech leader meets @bgarlinghouse … Every. Single. Time. They enter the room skeptical about XRP. They leave the room convinced and within weeks, they partner with @Ripple or integrate XRP into… — Arthur (@XrpArthur) December 12, 2025 Observations from Community Members Several observers expanded on Arthur’s points by emphasizing Garlinghouse’s approach in professional settings . Dr. XRP, another user contributing to the conversation, described Garlinghouse as experienced, educated, and composed, with a communication style that encourages participation rather than confrontation. He noted that during an event in Dubai, Garlinghouse emphasized the importance of evaluating the industry trajectory and cooperating across competing projects. Dr. XRP also mentioned that the discussion took place while Garlinghouse sat beside Lilly Liu, the president of Solana, and shortly afterward, a partnership between Solana and Ripple was announced. His comment attributed this outcome partly to Garlinghouse’s ability to engage effectively with industry counterparts. Ken Nguyen, another participant in the conversation, added that the underlying explanation for these institutional decisions is the straightforward utility that XRP offers for addressing inefficiencies in the existing financial architecture. He pointed out that established firms continue to explore systems capable of delivering faster and more reliable settlement, and that XRP fits within this category. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Assessment and Strategic Alignment Arthur’s post presents the view that once institutions examine the technology in depth, they frequently find alignment between their operational goals and Ripple’s infrastructure. The consistent theme across the commentary is that understanding the practical use case is central to institutional adoption . Rather than relying on promotional language, these assessments appear to be driven by direct communication, evaluation of technical capabilities, and examination of cross-border settlement needs. Arthur’s central argument is that direct engagement at the executive level is often the deciding factor in addressing skepticism, allowing institutions to assess XRP’s utility and move toward adoption.

Price action remains subdued, yet strategic developments around the asset continue to accelerate. At the Solana Breakpoint event in Abu Dhabi, Ripple delivered a clear message on XRP’s future direction, placing distribution and usage at the center of its roadmap. RippleX Executive Shares the Stage in Abu Dhabi Luke Judges, Head of Partner Success at RippleX , appeared on stage alongside Vibhu, a Solana Foundation product marketer known for his past criticism of XRP. The setting itself drew attention. Judges introduced RippleX as the unit responsible for supporting the XRP Ledger and XRP adoption. He stressed that Ripple did not attend the event to unveil a product launch. Instead, the focus centered on supporting ecosystem builders across chai XRP and Wrapped XRP Head to Solana Judges confirmed that XRP and wrapped XRP will enter the Solana ecosystem through Hex Trust and LayerZero. This move enables XRP exposure within Solana’s decentralized finance landscape. XRP will integrate into decentralized exchanges, lending protocols, yield platforms, and perpetual markets. What changes when XRP enters Solana DeFi? Access expands to tens of millions of Solana wallets, and liquidity no longer remains confined to a single network. Why Solana Fits Ripple’s Strategy Judges outlined three drivers behind the choice of Solana: new users, new demand, and market depth. Solana’s large and active wallet base provides immediate reach. Deep liquidity across its DeFi venues supports efficient trading and capital movement. Judges compared asset distribution to global currency access, stating that assets fail to scale when access remains limited. The message underscored Ripple’s view that isolation restricts growth. Vibhu acknowledged a change in outlook during the discussion. He explained that deeper exposure to XRP and its community reshaped his view on bringing the asset into Solana DeFi. He referenced opportunities around XRP-based yield, lending, and broader utility within Solana’s ecosystem. The exchange highlighted how cross-chain collaboration continues to reshape long-held narratives within crypto communities. How wXRP Supports Cross-Chain Use Wrapped XRP will function as a 1:1 representation of native XRP, with custody and issuance handled by Hex Trust. LayerZero’s infrastructure will support cross-chain movement, allowing wXRP to operate across multiple networks without relying on unregulated bridges. This structure allows institutions and users to maintain exposure to XRP while engaging in on-chain activity beyond the XRP Ledger . Judges noted that liquidity fragmentation limits asset efficiency. By embedding XRP across chains, Ripple aims to remove those barriers. The approach aligns with broader efforts to connect XRP with RLUSD and other on-chain assets across supported networks. RippleX Head of Engineering J. Ayo Akinyele has described Ripple’s long-term focus on a multichain future. He emphasized that crypto activity naturally spreads across networks rather than concentrating on a single chain. In this framework, the XRP Ledger continues to serve as a stable and predictable base layer. That foundation supports security and trust while enabling activity to extend outward. XRP Utility Takes Center Stage Judges closed the session with a clear statement: Ripple does not want XRP used only for trading. The company wants XRP used everywhere. The Solana integration represents one step in a broader distribution strategy that includes LayerZero, Wormhole, and Axelar. As XRP’s price remains range-bound, Ripple’s roadmap points toward expanding real-world and on-chain usage across ecosystems.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-14 16:04:21
