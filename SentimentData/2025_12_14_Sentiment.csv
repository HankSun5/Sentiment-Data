Lawmakers are pushing to integrate digital assets into retirement planning . This move could redefine how long-term capital interacts with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and XRP. What once sat at the financial margins is now approaching the system’s core. The debate is no longer centered on hype or short-term trading. Instead, it focuses on structure, regulation, and long-horizon portfolio construction. Retirement accounts sit at the heart of America’s financial system. Any change here carries lasting consequences. Congress Turns Up Pressure on the SEC According to commentary shared by Pumpius on X, Congress is now urging SEC Chair Paul Atkins to act decisively . Lawmakers want crypto exposure permitted within 401(k) retirement accounts under regulated frameworks. This pressure aligns with broader efforts to modernize U.S. financial infrastructure. The push follows mounting concern that existing rules lag behind market reality. Digital assets have matured beyond speculative experiments. Institutional custody, compliance standards, and regulated products now exist at scale. XRP & BTC ARE COMING TO 410(k) RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS. Congress is now urging SEC Chair Atkins to immediately allow crypto exposure inside 401(k) retirement accounts. This is not about speculation It is about integrating digital assets into long term, regulated retirement… pic.twitter.com/MSvhbuInAe — Pumpius (@pumpius) December 13, 2025 Policy Momentum Behind the Shift Momentum accelerated after President Donald Trump signed an executive order in August 2025. The order directed regulators to expand access to alternative assets in retirement plans. Cryptocurrencies were explicitly included in that mandate. Shortly afterward, the Department of Labor withdrew its earlier cautionary guidance on crypto in 401(k)s. This withdrawal removed a key deterrent for plan fiduciaries. While not an endorsement, it restored regulatory neutrality. Congress has since reinforced this direction through formal correspondence. A bipartisan letter urged the SEC to update securities rules accordingly. Lawmakers framed crypto inclusion as a matter of market fairness and investor choice. Why Bitcoin and XRP Stand Out Not all digital assets are positioned equally for retirement inclusion. Bitcoin benefits from unmatched liquidity, global recognition, and established institutional products. XRP, meanwhile, stands out for regulatory clarity and financial infrastructure integration. Assets suited for retirement portfolios must meet strict criteria. They require deep liquidity, transparent markets, and institutional-grade custody solutions. Bitcoin and XRP increasingly satisfy these requirements. Their inclusion would likely prioritize modest allocations. The goal is diversification, not concentration. This mirrors how commodities or real estate entered retirement portfolios decades ago. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Trillions in Capital, Quietly Mobilized The U.S. 401(k) system holds over $12 trillion in assets. Even small percentage allocations could unlock enormous capital flows. Unlike speculative capital, retirement funds move slowly and persistently. This type of capital reshapes markets over time. It reduces volatility, deepens liquidity, and strengthens institutional confidence. The impact would be structural, not explosive. Risks, Safeguards, and Fiduciary Responsibility Critics remain cautious, citing volatility and fiduciary duty concerns. These objections center on investor protection, not outright opposition. Regulators are expected to emphasize disclosures, education, and allocation limits. SEC Chair Atkins has previously stressed investor education as essential. Any approval would likely include strict compliance requirements. This approach mirrors how other alternative assets were integrated. From the Margins to the Core Allowing Bitcoin and XRP into 401(k) accounts would mark a historic transition. Crypto would move from optional speculation to recognized financial infrastructure. The implications extend beyond price action. This is about legitimacy, permanence, and systemic integration. If approved, digital assets would become part of how Americans save for retirement. That shift could change markets for decades. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

If buyers hold the ongoing momentum, XMR’s estimated price might increase to the $400 range. Is Monero a good investment? Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality, which has created a strong demand in the market . Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice. Why is XMR up? Monero price analysis shows that XMR saw a sharp drop to $360 after failing to breach the $440 resistance. However, the bulls found support at the level, rising rapidly to $430 mark. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption, as it remains highly speculative . How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2030 suggests a minimum price of $1,048.76 and an average trading price of $1,142.11 . The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,208.35. Will XMR reach $1000? The chances of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinge on various factors, which will influence its future price movements. The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility creating an atmosphere of extreme fear are challenges that monero traders could face that could hinder significant growth. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, many investors have concerns regarding privacy, regulatory scrutiny, and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals, which impact the current Monero sentiment. Monero’s commitment to ring confidential transactions and the broader monero project gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

Monero historic price sentiment XMR price history Monero’s market value has changed dramatically since its launch in 2014, from less than $1 to over $475. May 2021 marked the highest point in Monero’s history. Monero’s price projections revealed the coin’s security. They provide investors with optimism that they will be freed from the persecution of some authorities simply by buying or selling Monero Across 2023, Monero’s price rose by 11.49%. The highest price was $278.56, and the lowest was $114.16. In January 2024, Monero stayed stable around the $150.00 mark as market momentum remained low. However, the stability was short-lived as February crashed to $101.95. However, XMR showed swift recovery as it closed the month near the $150.00 level again. In March and April 2024, XMR saw a steady decline from $150.00 to $120.00, where it found key support. In May 2024, XMR observed steady bullish pressure as the price rose from $120.00, approaching resistance at $150. In June 2024, Monero (XMR) traded within the $150 – $175 price range as either side struggled to make a clear breakthrough. In July, the crypto traded around the $155 mark as the price volatility remained relatively low. XMR opened trading at $156.05 in August and ended the month at $176.00, making remarkable gains. September was bearish for the asset, as the price declined below the $160 mark by the end of the month. In October, Monero observed a steep crash and has been making a swift recovery since then. In December, Monero made remarkable strides as the asset’s price broke past the $220 mark, albeit briefly as it closed the month below $200. In January, Monero saw a bullish January as the price rose from below the $200 mark to $238 by the end of the month. In February, the price fell towards the $215 mark as bears dominate the markets. In March, the price observes mixed momentum and closed the month slightly below $215. In April the consolidation continued until late into the month when it spiked past the $325 mark before ending the month around $275. In May the price continued rising rapidly as the bulls cruised past $300 ending the month around $320. During June the price continued to observe high volatility but observed low net change as the asset closed the month around $313. In July the price saw a huge spike in volatility as the price rose past $340 but the asset closed the month below the $310 mark. In August the price declined rapidly falling to the $260 mark by the month’s end. In September, the price rose to the $340 and while it did not maintain the level but managed to close the month above the $320 mark. In October the price continued to rise ending the month above the $340 mark, a trend separating it from most other cryptocurrencies that saw a decline during the period. In November, the bullish rally continued with XMR crossing the $400 mark by the end of the month.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XMR|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-13 20:40:00

The foundation, which is building what it describes as the world’s first decentralized and open AI operating system, reported that an attacker stole 520,010 $0G tokens that were later bridged out and routed through Tornado Cash. Additional losses included 9.93 ether and roughly $4,200 in USDT, bringing the total confirmed loss to around $520,000 at the time of the theft. Exploit traced to leaked private key According to the foundation , the attacker exploited an emergency withdrawal function in the affected reward contract after gaining access to a private key that had been inadvertently stored on a compromised cloud server. The key was linked to an Alibaba Cloud instance responsible for managing NFT status and reward updates. “The attacker accessed a leaked private key from an AliCloud instance,” the foundation said, adding that storing plaintext private keys locally was a critical operational failure, saying, “this is a practice we now know must never happen again.” Further investigation revealed that the breach was not limited to a single server. The foundation said multiple AliCloud instances were compromised after attackers exploited a critical vulnerability in the popular Next.js web framework, tracked as CVE-2025-66478, on December 5. Using internal IP addresses, the attacker was able to move laterally across systems, affecting a wide range of services. These included the alignment service, a validator node, the Gravity NFT service, node sale infrastructure, and several ecosystem products such as Compute, Aiverse, Perpdex, and Ascend. However, the foundation has maintained that no additional losses tied directly to user-held assets have been identified. CertiK, a blockchain security firm, flagged the suspicious withdrawals from a 0G-related reward contract earlier, estimating losses in line with figures that were later confirmed by the foundation. What’s next for 0G Foundation? 0G foundation claims that it has implemented immediate security measures. The organization has also patched the Next.js vulnerability and rebuilt affected services. As part of what 0G said it is doing to prevent a repeat incident, the foundation claims it will migrate all key-bearing services to Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), implement multi-signature wallet requirements for critical fund management, and adopt zero-trust security principles across its infrastructure. The hack incident that 0G Foundation reported comes after it raised over $290 million in November 2024, including a $40 million seed funding round led by Hack VC with participation from Delphi Ventures, OKX Ventures, Samsung Next, Animoca Brands, among other investors. That raise made it $325 million in committed funding for the platform. 0G conceded that the breach is “a painful but necessary wake-up call.” It also promised to release a full post-mortem report, which its community can look forward to knowing more about how the foundation lost $520,000 to bad actors.

The project’s initial funding round hit its cap in less than two weeks, securing a solid $500,000 and proving that investor appetite is substantial. This powerful momentum has carried directly into Phase 2, which has already generated $800,000 by selling 13 million tokens . With the current supply dwindling fast, analysts are forecasting an imminent transition to Phase 3. This shift represents a critical juncture for investors looking to enter before the price climbs higher. Avalanche Integrates Payments, GeeFi Delivers Total Financial Freedom Avalanche is making strides with stablecoin payments at Union Square Market and securing RWA tokenization partnerships in Hong Kong. While Avalanche builds infrastructure for traditional finance, GeeFi is capturing users by offering immediate, user-centric financial tools. The ecosystem is anchored by a non-custodial decentralized exchange (DEX), designed to ensure that traders retain absolute control over their private keys. This architecture eliminates third-party custody risks, providing a secure environment where asset ownership remains strictly with the user at all times, independent of centralized entities. Beyond secure trading, GeeFi is actively bridging the gap between digital wealth and real-world spending through its upcoming Crypto Cards. Developed in collaboration with payment giants VISA and Mastercard, these cards will allow holders to use their crypto assets at millions of merchant locations globally. This real-world application is bolstered by the GEE token’s deflationary model. A systematic burn mechanism continuously removes tokens from circulation, creating inherent scarcity that is designed to drive value upward as the platform’s user base expands and transaction volume increases. A Financial Structure Engineered for Massive ROI The economic model of the GeeFi presale is attracting significant capital from investors looking for outsized returns. Currently in Phase 2, GEE tokens are priced at a highly accessible $0.06 . This entry point is strategically set against a confirmed exchange listing price of $0.40 , locking in a 667% return for early supporters the moment the token hits public markets. The long-term outlook is even more impressive. With analysts projecting a future valuation of $2 per token, a $1,600 investment made today could grow to $60,000 , representing a staggering 3,233% ROI . The market has responded with overwhelming enthusiasm. With over 13 million tokens already sold and $800,000 raised in Phase 2 alone, the momentum is undeniable. This rapid accumulation has led experts to predict that the current phase will conclude ahead of schedule. Adding to the urgency are persistent reports of upcoming listings on top-tier centralized exchanges. Such events historically serve as powerful catalysts for price appreciation, further validating the project’s trajectory and potential for substantial market impact once public trading begins. Maximize Your Holdings with High-Yield Staking GeeFi offers more than just the potential for asset appreciation; it provides a robust mechanism for generating consistent passive income via its staking program. Accessed through the user-friendly GeeFi Wallet, the system features multiple tiers to accommodate various investment horizons. A flexible, no-lock tier delivers a solid 10% APR for those prioritizing liquidity. For investors willing to commit for fixed durations, the returns increase significantly: 15% APR for one month , 22% APR for three months , and an exceptional 55% APR for a twelve-month term . Additionally, the platform incentivizes growth through a referral program, granting a 5% bonus on contributions made via personal links. The Window for Early Entry Is Closing Rapidly GeeFi is distinguishing itself as a high-potential contender in the crypto space, backed by concrete utility and a strategic financial model. This presale represents a fleeting chance to secure a stake in a rapidly expanding ecosystem before it gains widespread mainstream recognition.

Interestingly, the “king of altcoins” is now barely hanging on to the psychological $3,000 price level. On Friday, December 12, the crypto market felt a wave of bearish pressure, with most large-cap assets witnessing significant price corrections on the day. According to the latest on-chain data, the Ethereum market appears to be experiencing heavy selling pressure. Ethereum Taker Volume Sees Notable Spike In a new post on the X platform, crypto analyst Maartunn revealed that the Ethereum price has been a victim of heavy selling pressure in the past day. This observation was based on the Taker Sell Volume metric, which saw a significant increase on Friday. This on-chain metric estimates the total volume of sell orders filled by takers in perpetual swaps of a particular cryptocurrency (Ethereum, in this case). In crypto trading, a taker refers to a market participant who fills an existing order in an exchange’s order book. Maartunn highlighted that the Taker Sell Volume across all centralized exchanges saw a notable uptick on Friday. Data from CryptoQuant shows that the metric rose to as high as 124.2 million ETH on the day. According to Maartunn, this significant spike in the Ethereum Taker Sell Volume is a clear sign of aggressive selling in the market. This level of selling activity put bearish pressure on the Ethereum price, explaining the latest correction to $3,000. 60,000 ETH Flows Into Centralized Exchanges Another on-chain signal that supports the theory of increased selling in the Ethereum market is the exchange inflow metric. According to data shared by Ali Martinez, significant amounts of ETH tokens have found their way onto centralized exchanges in the past day. Santiment data shows that 60,000 ETH tokens, worth approximately $200 million, flowed onto exchanges on Friday. As expected, this inflow activity led to a spike in the Ethereum supply on exchanges and the open market. With no adequate demand to mop up this increasing supply, this rising exchange inflow only puts downward pressure on the Ethereum price. As of this writing, ETH is valued at around $3,080, reflecting an over 4% decline in the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|ETH|ethereum price|Ethereum Taker Sell Volume|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-13 21:00:03

A new technical analysis highlights a roadmap with key recovery levels and outlines a potential timeframe when selling and profit-taking may become favorable. Dogecoin Triangle Pattern Signals Recovery Path In a recent X post, crypto analyst Jonathan Carter presented a new analysis of Dogecoin’s price action, predicting that a potential recovery may be imminent. Carter explained that Dogecoin is currently testing a critical support area around $0.135 within a long-standing descending triangle chart structure. The setup is unfolding over the 3-day timeframe, with price action remaining above the pattern’s lower boundary. This zone has become a key battlefield between buyers and sellers. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin Waking Up? Critical On-Chain Metric Explodes Higher Carter highlights that the ongoing support area offers a favorable risk-reward profile for market participants. Buyers stepping in at this level are attempting to prevent a breakdown that could invalidate the broader recovery outlook. This means holding above this support zone could keep Dogecoin’s bullish scenario intact. The descending triangle visible on the analyst’s shared chart shows a series of lower highs pressing against the stable support zone at $0.135. This compression often precedes a decisive move once the price reacts strongly at the base. Dogecoin’s current structure also suggests the market is steadily approaching that inflection point. The volume data at the bottom of the chart has yet to show strong expansion near the support area. This indicates that Dogecoin’s trading activity has been relatively muted, suggesting that the market may be waiting for confirmation before committing to a significant upward move. If Dogecoin successfully rebounds from the $0.135 support zone, Carter’s chart maps out several upside levels to watch. Initial recovery targets are seen around $0.155 and $0.190, where previous price reactions occurred. Clearing these levels would signal growing momentum and a possible end to DOGE’s downtrend. Further upside extensions projected on the chart include $0.250 and $0.310, which align with previous consolidation areas. A stronger continuation could open the path toward $0.370 and ultimately the resistance zone near $0.470. Resistance Zone Reveals When To Sell DOGE Carter’s Dogecoin chart clearly shows the $0.47 resistance zone, where sellers are expected to become active again. A rally into the zone would likely face increased selling pressure based on historical price behaviour. As a result, the resistance area serves as a strategic level for profit-taking rather than for new entries in Dogecoin. Related Reading: Binance’s USD1 Stablecoin Push Deepens Relationship With Trump’s Crypto Platform Overall, Carter’s analysis suggests that Dogecoin’s price is sitting at a pivotal technical level that could shape its next major move. The meme coin’s price is currently down, having crashed by over 22% year-to-date, according to CoinMarketCap. Despite this slip, Carter remains optimistic about DOGE’s recovery path. The recovery timeline highlighted in the analysis suggests that by 2026, the meme coin may have emerged from its downturn.

The project’s initial offering was a resounding triumph, with Phase 1 clearing its entire supply of 10 million tokens and securing $500,000 in just over one week. This early momentum has only intensified, propelling total funding beyond the $1 million mark, supported by a growing network of over 2,400 holders . As a decentralized ecosystem focused on user autonomy, GeeFi is resonating with those seeking alternatives to centralized control. Market experts now predict that Phase 3 could sell out in under 10 days , driven by increasing speculation regarding imminent exchange listings. Solana’s Institutional Adoption Paves the Way for GeeFi’s Utility The blockchain sector is witnessing a shift toward high-value, real-world applications. Solana has recently facilitated a massive $50 million commercial paper issuance by JPMorgan, proving that public blockchains can handle institutional finance. Additionally, Raise Network has launched programmable gift cards on Solana, bridging digital assets with retail commerce. While Solana demonstrates the power of blockchain infrastructure, GeeFi is delivering a complete consumer-facing financial ecosystem. Central to this vision is the GeeFi Wallet , a non-custodial mobile application that gives users absolute ownership of their private keys, offering security that centralized exchanges cannot provide. The app is already available on Android , with iOS availability coming soon. The ecosystem also features a powerful Decentralized Exchange (DEX) that connects 14+ networks , allowing users to swap assets fluidly across chains. Furthermore, the GeeFi Crypto Card will soon empower users to spend their holdings globally via the VISA and Mastercard networks. Securing a Strategic Position in Phase 2 The current GeeFi presale phase offers a rare chance to enter a high-potential project at a favorable valuation. In Phase 2 , tokens are priced at just $0.06 . This price point is generating significant demand because the confirmed listing price of $0.40 locks in a substantial 667% ROI for early buyers the moment trading begins. The upside is clear: a $1,200 allocation today could grow to $40,000 if the GEE token reaches a conservative $2 valuation , delivering a 3,233% return . With Phase 2 now 80% sold out , representing $800,000 raised from 13 million tokens sold, the inventory available at this price is diminishing quickly. Maximizing Portfolio Growth with High-Yield Staking GeeFi distinguishes itself by offering robust avenues for passive income, ensuring that long-term holders are rewarded. The platform provides industry-leading staking returns, including a massive 55% APR for investors who lock their GEE tokens for 12 months. For those requiring shorter commitment periods, GeeFi offers 22% APR for three months and 15% APR for one month. Additionally, the platform features a flexible staking option offering 10% APR with no lock-up requirement, allowing users to earn yield while maintaining full access to their funds. Community expansion is further encouraged through a rewarding referral program , which grants a 5% bonus in GEE tokens for every purchase made via a user’s unique referral link. This incentivizes users to help grow the ecosystem organically. The Next Major Crypto Opportunity Is Here Every market cycle reveals a handful of projects that redefine wealth for their early adopters, and GeeFi is exhibiting all the signals of a breakout success. Its impressive presale speed, combined with a roadmap of functional products, sets it apart from hype-driven tokens. Analysts are increasingly identifying GeeFi as a potential 100x gem , citing its strong utility and the massive ROI built into its presale structure. This is the final moment to acquire tokens at a foundational price before major exchange listings potentially send the value skyrocketing. With Phase 2 nearing its conclusion, acting now is essential to capitalize on this opportunity.

Tether puts out an all-cash proposal to buy Exor’s 65.4% stake for €2.66 per share, valuing the club at around €1.1 billion. The offer gives Juventus a 21% premium over its Friday close in Milan. Tether also says it will add €1 billion for club development and promises to buy all remaining shares at a price “at least equal” to its initial offer. Exor rejected the proposal right away. Exor says the board “unanimously rejects” the bid. John Elkann, the company’s Chief Executive Officer, says, “Juventus has been part of my family for 102 years,” and adds that four generations “have grown it, strengthened it, cared for it in difficult moments and celebrated it in happy ones.” John also says, “Juventus — our history, our values — is not for sale.” Agnellis holds Juventus while Tether increases pressure The bid shows up while the Agnellis look at possible disposals, including a review of Gedi Gruppo Editoriale, but Juventus is not part of that process. The family has controlled the team for more than a hundred years. The timing also meets Juventus at a difficult moment. The club sits seventh in Serie A and risks missing European competition, which would hit media and commercial income. The team has not matched the level it had during its run of nine straight Serie A titles, which ended in 2021. The problems extend beyond the pitch. In 2023, Italy’s football federation took 10 points off Juventus after an investigation into how it accounted for player transfers. Juventus shares have fallen 27% this year. None of this stops Tether. The crypto company now owns 11.5% of the team, a stake it built starting in February, and wants total control. Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s Chief Executive Officer, says, “For me, Juventus has always been part of my life. I grew up with this team.” Paolo also says communication between shareholders has been “very, very limited.” Tether brings cash while Exor keeps its identity The gap between the two sides is wide. Exor has a net asset value of €36.4 billion and holds Ferrari, Stellantis, and Christian Louboutin. Juventus represents a small slice of Exor’s overall value. Tether comes from a totally different background. It started in 2014, operated with no public offices for years, and opened its official headquarters in El Salvador in January. The company has no independent board and shares little about its structure. Even with that, Tether earns a huge profit. USDT, the stablecoin, is the most used token in crypto. Tether’s latest attestation shows $181 billion in assets, including $135 billion in US Treasuries. Profit passes $10 billion in the first nine months of 2025. Tether also invests in areas like AI and agriculture as it expands beyond crypto.

A colossal sum of 204,079,817 USDT, valued at approximately $204 million, was transferred from an unknown wallet directly to the major exchange OKX. This single USDT transfer represents one of the most significant stablecoin movements recently, prompting immediate questions about its origin and intent. What does such a massive movement of capital signal for the market? What Does This Massive USDT Transfer Actually Mean? First, let’s break down the basics. USDT, or Tether, is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. A transfer of this magnitude from a private, unknown wallet to a centralized exchange like OKX is a classic “whale” activity. Typically, such moves precede major trading decisions. The holder could be preparing to: Execute a large buy order for other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Provide liquidity for institutional or over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks. Redeem USDT for fiat currency , though this is less common directly via an exchange wallet. Simply move funds for safekeeping or to take advantage of exchange-specific services. This specific USDT transfer highlights the immense scale at which major players operate, often moving sums that rival traditional finance transactions with the click of a button. Why Should Everyday Crypto Investors Care? You might wonder why a single transaction between two wallets matters. The truth is, whale movements are powerful market indicators. A deposit of this size can signal incoming volatility. If the whale uses these funds to purchase a large amount of Bitcoin, the sudden buy pressure could push prices upward. Conversely, if they are moving to sell another asset, it could indicate a bearish outlook. Therefore, monitoring large USDT transfers to exchanges is a common practice for analysts trying to gauge market sentiment. Moreover, this event underscores the transparency of blockchain technology. While the wallet owner remains unknown, the transaction itself is public, verifiable, and instantaneous. This level of visibility is unprecedented in traditional finance, where such large transfers would be private bank affairs. Could This USDT Transfer Impact Market Stability? The sheer size of this transaction naturally leads to questions about Tether’s stability and liquidity. Moving $204 million in one go is a strong testament to the operational capacity of the Tether network and the depth of its reserves. It demonstrates that the stablecoin can handle enormous settlements without a hitch, which should bolster confidence among users. However, it also places a spotlight on the concentration of wealth—or “whale dominance”—within the crypto ecosystem. A single entity capable of moving such funds holds significant potential influence over short-term market dynamics. For the market to mature further, a broader, more distributed holder base is ultimately healthier. Decoding the Signal: What’s Next After the Deposit? The critical question everyone is asking is: “What will the whale do next?” The funds are now on an exchange, poised for action. The community and trading algorithms will watch OKX’s order books closely for unusually large buy walls in assets like BTC or ETH. This USDT transfer is not an endpoint; it’s the prelude to a potentially market-moving event. The coming days may reveal whether this capital is deployed aggressively or sits idle, each scenario telling a different story about institutional confidence. Conclusion: A Reminder of Crypto’s Scale and Transparency This $204 million USDT transfer is more than just a big number. It is a compelling case study in blockchain’s power, market psychology, and the evolving landscape of digital finance. It reminds us that the crypto market operates 24/7 with staggering sums, visible to all. While the ultimate purpose of this move remains shrouded in mystery, its detection and analysis showcase the sophisticated tools and keen interest driving this industry forward. For savvy observers, understanding the flow of stablecoins like USDT is key to understanding the market’s next move. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Whale Alert? A1: Whale Alert is a popular blockchain tracking service that monitors and reports large cryptocurrency transactions, typically those exceeding $1 million, across various networks. Q2: Why transfer to an exchange like OKX? A2: Centralized exchanges like OKX are the primary venues for converting crypto to other assets or fiat. Large deposits often precede major trades, as exchanges offer the necessary liquidity and trading pairs. Q3: Can we find out who owns the unknown wallet? A3: While the wallet address is public, the owner’s identity is pseudonymous and unknown unless they voluntarily disclose it or are linked through other means. Blockchain analysis can sometimes connect addresses to known entities. Q4: Does a large USDT transfer affect its price peg? A4: Typically, no. A simple transfer between wallets does not create or destroy USDT. The peg is maintained by Tether’s reserve management. Large-scale minting or burning of USDT is more relevant to the peg’s stability. Q5: Should I change my investment strategy based on this? A5: Single whale movements are data points, not standalone signals. They should be considered alongside broader market trends, news, and your own investment goals. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on one transaction. Q6: How common are transfers of this size? A6: Multi-million dollar transfers are relatively common, especially involving stablecoins and between institutional wallets and exchanges. However, a $200M+ transfer is notable and less frequent.

A federal jury found the 48-year-old director guilty of multiple counts of wire fraud and money laundering, after prosecutors said he siphoned the funds for personal use, including high-risk stock trades, cryptocurrency investments, luxury cars, watches, and five-star hotel stays in California and Spain. The series, originally titled “White Horse” and later renamed “Conquest,” had already received roughly $44 million in earlier funding. Rinsch began filming six short-form episodes with support from his mentor, Keanu Reeves, before pitching the project to studios. Between late 2019 and early 2020, he requested an additional $11 million to finish production. Prosecutors said he transferred the funds into personal accounts, losing about half through risky investments, then used the remaining funds on cryptocurrency and lavish spending. Court documents show he bought five Rolls-Royces, a Ferrari, high-end watches and clothing, luxury mattresses and bedding, and repaid $1.8 million in personal credit card debt, all with money Netflix believed was meant for the series. Rinsch argued at trial that the dispute was contractual and that he considered the payments as reimbursement for work already completed. US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Jay Clayton said the conviction comes after a one-week trial before US District Judge Jed S. Rakoff. He added, “Carl Erik Rinsch took $11 million meant for a TV show and gambled it on speculative stock options and crypto transactions. Today’s conviction shows that when someone steals from investors, we will follow the money and hold them accountable.” The charges carry maximum penalties of a total of 90 years in prison, although the actual sentence is expected to be shorter. Rinsch is scheduled to be sentenced on April 17, 2026. Rinsch was arrested in March this year in West Hollywood, California. Earlier reports suggest that he invested in popular meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE) and made $27 million in profits.

According to the commentators of the market, a number of early indications are indicating that this DeFi token is likely to see another huge jump and some of the forecasts are up to 800% in case the momentum is maintained. The initial investor enthusiasm suggests that the project structure and collaboration in developmental growth can be used as the basis of growth in the long term. Presale Progress and What Mutuum Finance is Building Mutuum Finance (MUTM) had its presale in early 2025, that was at $0.01 per MUTM. It is currently priced at $0.035 which is a 2.5x increment within six steps. The project raised over $19.30M, has risen to 18400 holders and sold 820M tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a DeFi lending protocol that is based on structured borrowing and reliable yield. Suppliers get depositing assets on a liquidity depositor and in return, get an mtToken which increases in value to be redeemed by borrowers paying interest. Collateral backed loans are open to borrowers with LTV and rate models to be determined by the use of the pool. V1 Launch and mtTokens Through its official X announcement , Mutuum Finance clarified a V1 will be used on the Sepolia Testnet, in Q4 2025. V1 has the liquidity pool, the mtToken system, Liquidator Bot and Debt Token. The initial assets will consist of ETH and USDT. The design of Mutuum Finance has mtTokens at the centre. They get redeemable worth as the interest gets added to the protocol. This links the incentive of users to actual borrowing components instead of the inflation. The support is furthered by a buy-and-distribute mechanism. A percentage of protocol revenue is spent to purchase MUTM in the marketplace. MUTM is bought on the open market and distributed to users who stake the mtTokens in the safety module. This unrelenting purchasing pressure, according to various observers, would help the price to go up as the platform usage increases. Considering these constituents, there is a bullish case on which some analysts map that MUTM might increase by a number of times relative to its present value. The long-term forecast indicates upside potential of up to 800% is achievable in case there is increase in borrowing demand following activation of V1. Layer-2 Expansion and Oracle Design Mutuum Finance will natively create an interest-based stablecoin according to the official roadmap. This stable coin is used as a way of creating internal demand and borrowing liquidity. Analysts believe that stablecoins pegged to real activity are better in increasing the stability of the system in the long term. Expansion on layer 2 is also scheduled. L2 network operating reduces expenses, speeds up processing and Emma allows greater borrowing capacity. The cheap cost will facilitate more uses thereby creating an opportunity towards growth to the mtTokens and the buy-and-distribute cycle. The protocol will be based on Chainlink oracles, fallback feeds and aggregated data to have the right valuations. The features are useful in eliminating the likelihood of inaccurate liquidations as well as ensuring stable lending circumstances. As these developments enter progression, analysts paint a second picture according to which MUTM may increase several hundred percent after its launch price as the stable coin and L2 plans enter the picture. Other models present potential growth as high as 800% in prolonged bullish situations. Building Security Foundations and Community Activity Mutuum Finance has security as one of its key concerns. The project is rated as 90/100 Token Scan successful and CertiK audit and the finished code is being analyzed by Halborn Security . The group also introduced a $50K bug bounty to identify code weaknesses early. The 24-hours leader board has increased community activity, as the highest daily contributor is awarded $500 of MUTM. The card payment support will make new users have less difficulty when buying the token and contribute to fueling consistent participation in the latent presale stages. With investors scouting new opportunities in existing crypto that have solid foundations, Mutuum Finance remains in focus due to its roadmap clarity, initial traction and capabilities that are future-oriented in offering decentralized lending.

GeeFi is leading this charge, having concluded a spectacular Phase 1 that distributed 10 million tokens and secured $500,000 from a dedicated group of over 2,400 investors . This momentum has only intensified, with the project now celebrating total sales exceeding 13 million tokens and raising more than $800K . As Phase 2 officially surpasses the 80% completion mark , this non-custodial ecosystem is proving its resilience and appeal. Market analysts are confidently predicting that Phase 3 will vanish in under 10 days , fueled by intensifying speculation regarding imminent listings on top-tier centralized exchanges. Moving Past Meme Coins for Utility-Driven Growth Shiba Inu (SHIB) is signaling a potential rebound, with whales accumulating supply and technical patterns pointing toward a rally to $0.000010 . However, smart money is increasingly rotating into GeeFi , a robust infrastructure project that experts are widely recognizing as 2026’s 100x gem . Unlike speculative assets reliant on social sentiment, GeeFi delivers a comprehensive solution for managing digital wealth. Its unified dashboard connects over 14 distinct networks , allowing users to bridge and swap assets instantly without navigating complex and fragmented DeFi interfaces. The GeeFi Team started development in 2023 and strategically launched in 2024 with a product-first philosophy. This ensures that investors are backing a fully operational platform rather than a mere concept. Built on a foundation of self-sovereignty, the ecosystem guarantees that users retain exclusive control over their private keys at all times. With a live Android application and an iOS version nearing release, GeeFi is delivering real-world utility today. This commitment to execution reinforces the growing conviction that it is indeed 2026’s 100x gem . Capitalize on the GeeFi Presale Advantage GeeFi is currently advancing through Phase 2 of its presale, where GEE tokens are available for just $0.06 . This entry price secures an immediate, guaranteed 667% return based on the confirmed listing price of $0.40 . The upside potential is staggering; a strategic investment of $1,800 today could balloon to $90,000 if the token hits the $3 valuation projected by analysts, delivering a massive 4,900% ROI . Demand continues to surge, as Phase 2 has now surpassed 80% , accumulating over $800K in funding through the sale of 13 million tokens . Industry observers are praising the presale’s structure and predict that Phase 3 will launch next week and sell out with extreme speed due to the rumors of major exchange listings. This overwhelming demand is a clear indicator that GeeFi is positioning itself as 2026’s 100x gem . Maximize Earnings via Staking and Referrals A major factor driving GeeFi’s sticky liquidity is its high-yield staking protocol, designed to reward long-term holders. Investors can lock their GEE tokens to earn 15% APR for one month , 22% APR for three months , or a dominant 55% APR for a 12-month duration . For those who require flexibility, a liquid staking tier offers up to 10% APR with no locked liquidity , ensuring funds remain accessible. To further accelerate adoption, GeeFi has implemented a generous referral initiative. Participants who share their unique invite link earn a 5% bonus in GEE tokens on all purchases made by their network. This mechanism incentivizes community growth and allows early adopters to compound their holdings significantly, creating a powerful cycle of wealth generation. The Window of Opportunity Is Closing Securing a position in a high-utility project before it captures mass market attention is the key to life-changing gains. The GeeFi presale represents a fleeting chance to enter before the wider crypto community reacts. With its deflationary mechanics, a live product ecosystem, and a roadmap that includes a crypto debit card, GeeFi is built for dominance. The rapid pace of token sales signals extreme confidence from smart money investors. As the market gears up for its next major cycle, projects with working products and strong fundamentals will leave speculative tokens behind. Ignoring GeeFi now could result in missed opportunities when it debuts on major exchanges, confirming the forecast that it is 2026’s 100x gem . The moment to act is now. Secure your stake today to capture the explosive upside experts are anticipating.

This development follows initial minor investments, as the USDT issuing company looks to deepen its involvement with the footballing institution. Tether Promises 1 Billion Euros For Sport Development If Bid Succeeds In Feb 2025, Tether announced a minority stake purchase of 8.2% in Juventus FC. The stablecoin issuer described this acquisition as a strategic move to integrate stablecoins and digital assets into everyday life. Two months later, Tether would boost its holdings to 10%, as the company’s CEO and lifetime Juventus supporter, Paolo Ardoino, explained the move as a commitment to long-term innovation. Taking this step further, the USDT operator has submitted an audacious bid to acquire the entire 65.4% controlling stake of the football club from Exor, the listed holding company of the billionaire Italian Agnelli Family. For context, Juventus FC ranks as the third-largest Italian club with a market valuation of $1.87 billion. However, the Old Lady, as it is popularly called, is the most decorated in the land, boasting 71 major honors, which include 36 Serie A championships. While Juventus’ momentum has slowed down in recent years, with its last league-winning campaign coming in 2020, the Italian giant has remained relevant by securing three domestic cup trophies since then. Paolo Ardoino explains that Tether’s objective is to contribute to Juventus’ growth and drive exceptional performance. The Tether CEO said: Tether is in a position of strong financial health and intends to support Juventus with stable capital and a long horizon. Our goal is to make a positive contribution to the club’s future, support its sporting performance at the highest level, and help Juventus continue to grow sustainably in a rapidly evolving global sports and media landscape. To this end, Tether has promised to invest 1 billion Euros in the club if the transaction receives approval from relevant regulatory bodies. However, footballing media The Athletic has reported that sources close to Exor state the Agnelli Family has no intent to divest their stake in Juventus, with the message being “the club is not for sale.” Notably, Juventus represents one of Tether’s investments, which also includes the Italian media company Be Water and the Canadian video platform Rumble. USDT Market Overview At the time of writing, USDT’s total market cap is valued at $186.24 billion, ranking as the largest stablecoin and third-largest cryptocurrency in the world.",Tether (USDT)|controlling stake|Exor|Juventus|stablecoin|Tether|USDT,EN,0,0,MARKET|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-13 23:00:27
55748789,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=866569,1765666842,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/55748789.jpeg,Bitcoin Macro Retracement Meets Mid-Range Battle – Will Bulls Reclaim Momentum?,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-macro-retracement/,"Bitcoin is facing a critical juncture as its macro retracement converges with a tight mid-range battle between $86,000 and $100,000. With bearish patterns confirmed and short-term support holding, the market now waits to see if bulls can reclaim momentum or if a deeper pullback is on the horizon. Bitcoin Confirms Macro Top: Bearish Phase Underway According to an update from Crypto Patel, Bitcoin appears to have confirmed a market top and is now transitioning into a broader macro retracement phase. The loss of a key bullish support level has shifted the market structure into a bearish phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Market Structure Strengthens Despite Slower Trading Activity — Here’s Why The chart shows that a Head and Shoulders formation has fully played out. Classical technical rules suggest that the 162% downside projection has already been achieved, reinforcing the view that a cycle top is in place and a larger trend reversal is underway. Looking at the macro Fibonacci retracement from the bear-market low to the recent peak, several key levels come into focus. These include the 0.382 retracement, which sits near $56,700, and the 0.5 level around $44,000, representing a zone of potential bear-market acceptance. Additionally, the 0.618 retracement near $35,000 stands out as the strongest long-term support area. On the liquidity side, an unfilled fair value gap between $98,000 and $100,000 acts as a magnet for a short-term relief bounce before the broader downtrend resumes. Overall, the macro outlook for Bitcoin remains bearish. While a bounce toward the $98,000–$100,000 region is possible, the dominant path points toward a deeper move into the $70,000–$60,000 Fibonacci supports. Traders are advised to wait for confirmation and remain flexible, respecting multiple scenarios as the market unfolds. BTC Trapped: $96,000–$100,000 Cap Meets $86,000 Support Bitcoin remains range-bound between two critical zones as noted by CyrilXBT. Price is hovering near the $90,300 area after facing another rejection from the $96,000–$100,000 supply zone and the 50-day EMA. This region has consistently capped upside attempts over the past several weeks. Related Reading: Report Reveals 65% Of Bitcoin Treasury Companies Struggling With Major Unrealized Losses On the downside, buyers continue to show up around the $86,000–$88,000 demand zone, preventing the price from slipping into a broader breakdown and keeping BTC locked within its current range. From a broader market perspective, Bitcoin previously cooled off while tech stocks surged. As momentum in tech begins to slow, BTC is attempting to stabilize, but a decisive reclaim of the $96,000–$100,000 zone is still required to shift momentum. A sustained move above $100,000 would open the door to trend reversal. Conversely, a loss of the $88,000 support could expose Bitcoin to a deeper pullback toward the $72,000–$76,000 region. Until either scenario plays out, price action remains choppy, and patience is warranted.

Neuner, widely known on social media as @cryptomanran, has maintained a critical stance toward XRP for several years and has shown little willingness to reconcile with its community. His latest remarks came after a public exchange on X, where he responded to speculation that growing interoperability between the XRP and Solana ecosystems could encourage a more cooperative relationship. Despite these developments, Neuner dismissed the idea outright, signaling that his view of XRP remains unchanged. XRP Gains Access to the Solana Ecosystem The renewed discussion followed a recent announcement by Hex Trust, an institutional digital asset custodian, which confirmed the launch of wrapped XRP (wXRP). This tokenized version of XRP is designed to operate across several blockchain networks, including Solana, Ethereum, Optimism, and HyperEVM. never!!! — Ran Neuner (@cryptomanran) December 12, 2025 Each unit of wXRP is fully backed by the native coin on a one-to-one basis and can be minted or redeemed through regulated custody systems. The wrapped asset is built using LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token standard, a framework intended to support secure cross-chain transfers without relying on traditional bridge infrastructure. As a result, XRP holders now have access to decentralized finance features such as lending platforms, liquidity pools, and yield-generating protocols on networks where the asset was previously unavailable. This development effectively places XRP within Solana’s broader DeFi environment, a move that some observers viewed as a symbolic convergence between two historically distinct communities. In response to this integration, Vibhu Norby, Head of Product Marketing at the Solana Foundation and previously an outspoken critic of XRP, publicly acknowledged the asset’s distinct role in the market. Norby stated that his perspective had evolved over time and that he now recognizes the strength of XRP’s use case and the resilience of its community. This shift prompted crypto investor Pedro Silva to suggest that the changing dynamics might offer an opportunity for Neuner to reassess his relationship with XRP supporters, particularly given his vocal support for Solana. Silva proposed that the presence of XRP within Solana’s ecosystem could serve as common ground. Neuner, however, rejected the suggestion with a brief but decisive response, indicating that he has no intention of softening his stance or engaging with the XRP community. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A History of Skepticism Toward XRP Neuner’s criticism of XRP dates back to at least 2018, following the asset’s sharp decline from its all-time high near $3.30. Over the years, he has repeatedly questioned the valuation model of the asset, its governance structure, and its perceived level of decentralization. While he has occasionally acknowledged positive developments surrounding the asset, particularly after Ripple’s legal victory against the former leadership of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, his broader assessment has remained negative. In early 2022, Neuner compared XRP unfavourably to other digital assets that were gaining traction at the time, including Terra’s LUNA and Solana’s SOL. He questioned why XRP continued to rank above these assets by market capitalization. Notably, LUNA suffered a catastrophic collapse later that year, while XRP retained its position among the leading cryptocurrencies. Neuner also made predictions in 2021 suggesting that XRP would fall out of the top tier of digital assets. Contrary to those forecasts, XRP maintained a strong market ranking and has since moved higher despite prolonged volatility across the sector. Other Critics Have Revised Their Views While Neuner has remained firm, other prominent figures who once dismissed XRP have publicly revised their opinions. Macro investor Raoul Pal acknowledged misjudging XRP after its sharp price appreciation in late 2024 and has since expressed a more favourable outlook. Similarly, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz has stated that XRP’s continued relevance is closely tied to its active global community, later describing it as one of the few crypto assets that has achieved genuine monetary use. Despite these shifts, Neuner’s latest comments suggest that he remains unwilling to reconsider his long-held perspective, even as XRP expands its presence across new blockchain ecosystems.

Burton is now facing 11 federal counts, according to a superseding indictment brought in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, which covers the following: conspiracy to commit wire fraud, two counts of wire fraud, seven counts of money laundering, and one count of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Cryptocurrency services have suffered nearly $3 billion in theft so far in 2025, making this year already more devastating than the entirety of 2024. The DPRK’s $1.5 billion hack of ByBit, the largest single hack in crypto history, accounts for the majority of service losses. By the end of June 2025, 17% more value had been stolen year-to-date (YTD) than in 2022, previously the worst year on record. If current trends continue, stolen funds from services could eclipse $4 billion by year’s end. Expanded federal indictment hits Bitcoin Rodney with 11 charges If convicted on all counts, Burton faces a maximum of 20 years in prison in federal courts for the wire fraud conspiracy and each wire fraud count, plus 10 years for each money laundering count and five years for the unlicensed money transmission offense. The charges represent a significant escalation from Burton’s original criminal complaint, filed in January 2024, which consisted of two counts linked to unlicensed money transmission, each carrying a maximum sentence of five years to be served. Burton was arrested in January 2024 at Miami International Airport carrying a one-way ticket to the United Arab Emirates, and has been detained since a federal judge refused his bail request because he constituted an “extreme flight risk.” $1.8B HyperFund scheme allegedly funded luxury lifestyle, not mining From June 2020 to May 2024, Burton and his co-conspirators managed HyperFund, which prosecutors claimed was a legitimate cryptocurrency investment platform known as HyperVerse, according to court documents. The scheme purportedly offered investors daily returns of 0.5% to 1%, intending to nearly double or triple their initial investments, claiming that investments could be made in vast crypto mining operations. It was a facade, prosecutors say, those mining operations didn’t operate. A superseding indictment alleges that Burton spent proceeds from investors on luxury condominiums, sports cars, and a yacht. Burton’s trial is set for March of next year. Burton maintained an enormous profile in the crypto community, hosting a 2021 Miami event featuring Shark Tank’s Daymond John and singer Akon, and made regular appearances on social media alongside notable figures like Jamie Foxx and Rick Ross. According to court documents, there has been one prior conviction for conspiracy to distribute cocaine. He told court papers that he considered this a bona fide business. Co-founder and Australian entrepreneur Xue Lee, or Sam Lee, he said, constructed an “elaborate deception” to deceive both his investors and Burton himself. Lee and promoter Brenda “Bitcoin Beautee” Chunga were charged with fraud and unregistered security offerings by the SEC in January 2024. Earlier reports indicate that Chunga has agreed to plead guilty, while Lee is still at large. Get seen where it counts.

In this guide, the commission outlines suitable practices and some common risks associated with various methods of storing cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the SEC highlighted the merits and demerits of different crypto custody methods in the bulletin, comparing self-custody with the use of a third-party service to handle digital assets for investors. The SEC’s release of an investor bulletin sparks excitement in the crypto industry The SEC’s recent decision sparked excitement among investors in the crypto ecosystem because it brought up a sense of protective measures set aside specifically for them. For instance, the bulletin noted that if investors opt to use a third-party custodian, they should first ensure they are familiar with the current custodian’s policies. This recommendation meant that investors should gain a clear understanding of whether they “rehypothecate” assets, which occurs when they decide to lend them out, or whether they prefer to integrate client assets into a single pool rather than storing each client’s cryptocurrency in individual accounts. Meanwhile, apart from this recommendation, the federal government agency’s guide also outlined various kinds of crypto wallets, discussing the advantages and disadvantages of hot wallets, which are related to the internet, compared to cold wallets that function as offline storage. In the bulletin, the commission argued that hot wallets expose investors to risks like hacking and cybersecurity threats. For cold wallets, the SEC claimed that they risk irreversible loss in the account of an existing failure in offline storage, if private keys are compromised, or if a device is stolen. Analysts noted that the federal government agency’s crypto custody guide suggests a significant shift in the Commission’s regulatory outlook. To support this claim, reports revealed that there was heightened resistance toward digital assets and the cryptocurrency industry under the leadership of Gary Gensler, a former Chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. On the other hand, sources close to the situation mentioned that Truth For the Commoner (TFTC) reacted to the news regarding the SEC’s guide on crypto custody. Responding, the TFTC stated, “The same agency that spent years trying to shut down the industry is now teaching people how to use it.” As the discussion heated up in the crypto industry, Jake Claver, CEO of Digital Ascension Group, which provides services to family offices, argued that the commission is offering significant value to crypto investors by enlightening potential crypto holders about custody and some suitable practices. Notably, the watchdog’s guide comes just one day after Paul Atkins, the Chairman of the federal government agency, shared that the traditional financial system is moving towards blockchain technology. The DTCC acquires greenlight from the SEC to begin tokenizing financial assets Reports dated Thursday, December 11, noted that the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), an American financial market infrastructure company that provides clearing, settlement, and trade reporting services to financial market participants, received a green light from the SEC permitting it to begin tokenizing financial assets like stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and government debt securities. Regarding this approval, sources familiar with the situation hinted that the commission released a valuable “no-action” letter to a branch of the DTCC. This letter gave the firm the go-ahead to introduce a new service aimed at tokenizing securities. The DTCC also commented on this announcement. The firm announced that the Depository Trust Company (DTC), a subsidiary of the DTCC and the world’s largest securities depository, has secured approval from a federal government agency to officially launch a new service that will convert real-world assets held by DTC into tokens within a controlled production environment. In the meantime, the DTCC intends to tokenize a group of highly liquid assets, including the Russell 1000 index, exchange-traded funds that track major indexes, and US Treasury bills, bonds, and notes. This service is anticipated to be accessible to users in the second half of 2026. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The mood of early investors shows that the interest is fast growing as the project goes through the major stages of its development and prepares to be released in a testnet. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is working on an alternative generation of a DeFi lending protocol that is designed to have a transparent set of mechanics and use cases. The protocol builds two synchronized markets. Under a P2C environment, users are able to deposit assets into a liquidity pool and then receive mtTokens that increase in conclusible worth as borrowers interest repay. Taking a hypothetical scenario as an example, somebody who provides ETH gets mtETH that eventually can be converted back to ETH in proportion to lending activity. The P2P environment favors collateralized borrowing. Borrowers place assets and select loan conditions. Utilization and LTV limits influence the rates and assists in safeguarding the users in the volatile environment of the market. The purpose of those structures is to render the system predictable to both parties in the lending process. On its official X account, Mutuum Finance stated that its V1 testnet will go live in Q4 2025 on the Sepolia network. The products it comes with are the liquidity pool, mtToken engine, Liquidator Bot and Debt Token. Originally supported assets will be ETH and USDT. Presale Growth and Momentum Mutuum Finance is a protocol that has attracted more than 18,400 investors and has raised over $19.30M. According to several analysts, the early involvement is significant as lending policies require good liquidity and general community ratings. The number of holders tends to increase and by the time the platform is operational, then it will have a higher pool participation. At the start of 2025, the MUTM token started with $0.01. It is currently priced at $0.035, which is an increment by 250%. According to many of the traders who follow the best crypto opportunities, this growth is an indicator of consistent demand which has been speared by the roadmap development of the project. Mutuum Finance has a total supply of 4B MUTM, and 1.82B is put aside during the presale. So far, 820M tokens have been sold. Analysts observe that such broad distribution is useful in supporting better liquidity expectation in the initial stage of the market of the project. The protocol offers 24-hour leaderboard, which rewards the most active individual in terms of his or her daily contributions with $500 in MUTM. Such a system maintains a constant user activity and ensures that there is visibility throughout the stage. CertiK Audit and Stablecoin Plans The CertiK audit of Mutuum Finance was rated 90/100 Token Scan, indicating that the code of the smart-contract has undergone a sufficient audit. The review of Halborn Security provides the second layer of verification when the project is ready to be tested in V1. The team is also working on creating a stablecoin pegged on the protocol interest generation. Analysts believe that this stablecoin could offer more liquidity and can grow borrowing activity in the future as it is used more. Phase 6 is in our sight and almost completely allocated. This change of the stage is gaining momentum due to the fact that the subsequent phase presents a price increment to the official launch price. The latest whale entry of approximately $100k gave impetus and indicated greater trust by bigger players. Investors tracking new crypto and the most popular cryptocurrency tendencies indicate that this kind of activity usually manifests itself when someone pays attention to a project just before a significant testnet launch or price change. As a steady development process continues, user engagement is growing, security outcomes are high, and Phase 6 is almost complete, Mutuum Finance is becoming one of the projects among the new cryptocurrency projects that could significantly grow in the coming years. Its 250% growth, growing community and future V1 testnet remain attractive to investors who may want to seek early investment opportunities in the token prior to the token attaining $0.06.

A new long-term technical comparison shared by crypto analyst ChartNerd places XRP’s price behavior since its July all-time high of $3.65 into an interesting context, implying that what XRP is doing now resembles a phase from its 2016 market cycle that points to an incoming huge rally. Related Reading: American Bitcoin Makes Big Buy, Adds 416 BTC To Its Stack Repeating 2016 Rejection And ABC Crash Structure According to crypto analyst ChartNerd, XRP’s current structure matches a similar price action that unfolded in late 2016. when price rejected an accumulation supply block and rolled into an ABC corrective move. That correction ultimately produced a 69% flash-wick decline that extended into the first quarter of 2017. The drop was severe and unfolded over several months, eventually pushing XRP to as low as $0.00240, but it eventually represented the end of the correction rather than the end of the bullish cycle. The chart accompanying the analysis, which is shown below, highlights a similar rejection pattern forming now. This pattern is based on how the XRP price rejected at its most recent all-time high in July. Since then, the monthly price chart has been printing consecutive red candles, with monthly closes consistently below opens. At the time of writing, XRP is about a 44% correction from this all-time high. This means a 69% correction is yet to play out in its entirety. Therefore, if history repeats, a full 69% ABC-style move from the all-time high would drag XRP back below $1 and as low as $0.8. This move is expected to play out into the first quarter of 2026. XRP Price Chart. Source: @ChartNerdTA Potential Drop Could Be A Set-Up For A Much Larger Rally XRP is currently trading at $2.04. Therefore, a deeper pullback below $1 will translate to a 51% decrease from the current price action. The idea of a deeper pullback from $2 is tough to imagine, especially given the inflows into Spot XRP ETFs. In fact, a pullback of that magnitude could test conviction across the market and cause many bullish traders to step aside. However, the technical analysis frames it as a structural reset rather than anything else. In 2017, the post-crash consolidation laid the groundwork for one of XRP’s most explosive rallies on record, ultimately delivering gains in excess of 110,000%. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin Waking Up? Critical On-Chain Metric Explodes Higher If this sequence plays out as expected, then the real bullish opportunity would develop later in 2026. From that reset zone, the chart projects a long-term advance to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension, placing a potential upside target around $27. The visual projection in the chart above shows a clean multi-month expansion zone that delivers a 2,300% gain after the corrective phase.

Short-term holders, which are classified as addresses holding BTC for only one to three months, spent most of the year in the green amidst the push to multiple all-time highs and ensuing drawdowns throughout the year. On-chain data from 2025 now provides a clearer answer to whether short-term exposure to Bitcoin actually paid off for holders, even though conditions look far less comfortable at the time of writing. Short-Term Holders Spent Most Of 2025 In Profit According to data from on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, Bitcoin short-term holders were in a profitable position for roughly two-thirds of 2025. On-chain profit and loss data shows that this cohort was in profit for about 66% of trading days, which translates to about 230 trading days. During the first half of 2025, Bitcoin’s price frequently traded above the average realized price of short-term holders, allowing recent buyers to lock in gains even as volatility remained elevated. This pattern became especially visible during mid-year rallies, when Bitcoin pushed above the $100,000 region and short-term profit margins expanded sharply. Each time the price reclaimed levels above the short-term realized price, realized gains dominated the distribution. Back in January, Bitcoin maintained a position above the short-term cost basis for nearly two consecutive months, creating the first extended window of sustained profitability for this cohort in 2025. A similar, and even more pronounced, phase unfolded between May and October, when short-term holders sat on substantial unrealized gains. During this period, the profit-and-loss margin climbed as high as 20 percent in July, coinciding with Bitcoin’s first breakout above $115,000. During this period, Spot Bitcoin ETFs were witnessing huge institutional inflows that cancelled out any profit-taking from short-term holders. BTC: STH Realized Profit and Loss. Source: CryptoQuant Current Picture Shows Short-Term Holders Underwater That favorable backdrop has changed into losses in recent weeks. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around the low-$90,000 range, while the short-term holder realized price is just above $100,000. This places the current profit/loss margin at a loss of about 10%. Interestingly, this margin recently fell to as low as negative 20% when the Bitcoin price broke below $85,000 in November, which is the deepest loss regime for short-term holders in 2025. Nonetheless, the 2025 data shows that short-term holding was profitable for most of the year, but the outlook is not favorable right now. Structurally, these deep loss pockets usually show up closer to the late stages of a correction than the early ones. Right now, the most important thing for short-term holders is for Bitcoin t o reclaim the short-term realized price and push back above $100,000. Until then, short-term holders will stay under pressure, even with the yearly statistics leaning in their favor.

One of them is Egrag Crypto (@egragcrypto), who continues to rely on large-scale chart data rather than short-term volatility. Despite recent weakness, his latest analysis is bullish. Using a linear regression channel, he suggests that XRP’s long-term price trajectory may still favor higher valuations. However, the asset must meet key technical conditions. The Current Market Position After delivering a notable performance in mid-2025, XRP’s momentum faded. The token recorded a strong advance in July 2025, rising by roughly 35% and briefly reclaiming the $3 level. That move, however, proved difficult to sustain. In August, XRP reversed sharply , declining by more than 8% and falling back below $3. #XRP – Linear Regression (Log-scales) Targets $3.4,$10, $27: Using the long-term Logarithmic Linear Regression Channel (log scale), three major price levels stand out as of December 2025 1⃣Mean Reversion → $3.40: A retest and rejection from $3.40 would be one of the… pic.twitter.com/3vIhXCCDRM — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 12, 2025 Although September brought a modest recovery of about 2.5%, the broader trend remained negative. From its July peak , XRP is now down close to 45%, with the asset changing hands around $2.02 as sellers attempt to turn the $2 area into resistance rather than support. Long-Term Perspective From Regression Analysis Egrag’s analysis focuses on XRP’s long-term structure using a linear regression channel on a logarithmic scale. The model tracks average price movement over time, with the central line reflecting long-term mean value. The upper and lower boundaries mark dynamic resistance and support across major market cycles. Monthly chart data shows that XRP dropped below the lower boundary of this channel during the market disruption caused by the Terra collapse in May 2022 . The asset remained outside the channel for an extended period. It moved back toward it during the broader recovery phase in late 2024, which also pushed prices back near $2. XRP briefly re-entered the channel in December 2024 and January 2025. However, renewed selling pressure from February onward forced it back below the lower trendline. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Key Price Zones Within the Regression Channel The analyst outlines several key price levels based on XRP’s long-term regression structure. The first area sits near $3.4, aligning with the January 2025 high and the lower boundary of the channel. He views this zone as a mean reversion area, where rejection would strengthen bearish signals, while a sustained close above it would suggest a shift back into bullish conditions. The next level sits around $10 , corresponding with the upper midline (+2 SD) of the channel and marking a phase of full trend expansion. At the top of the regression channel, the model points to a long-term target near $27, which Egrag Crypto believes is reinforced by multiple technical confluences if XRP reclaims the channel.

In a recent post, he suggested that XRP could one day reach as high as $10,000. Projections like these are commonly rejected on the grounds of market capitalization constraints . However, Pantoja argues that this perspective relies too heavily on today’s economic structure. His outlook is rooted in the assumption that future technological shifts, particularly those driven by advanced artificial intelligence, could fundamentally alter how value is created, transferred, and measured. Reframing the Market Capitalization Debate Pantoja acknowledged that a $10,000 XRP price seems unrealistic under today’s liquidity and market conditions. However, he argues that market capitalization is shaped by the economic environment. People say $XRP can’t hit $10k because of market cap. But, They ignore the Singularity… when AI outnumbers humans 10 to 1, value must transfer instantly. The addressable market explodes, market caps skyrocket. XRP was built for this. #XRP #Singularity pic.twitter.com/dfduO368vl — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) September 21, 2025 As autonomous AI systems expand economic activity, financial networks could scale dramatically. This would make valuations that appear impossible today more plausible. The Crypto Market’s Journey So Far To support his thesis, Pantoja places XRP within the broader historical development of digital assets. He points to the erosion of trust in traditional finance following the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent government bailouts as a catalyst for innovation. In the years that followed, Bitcoin emerged as an alternative store of value, while XRP was developed with a focus on fast and efficient value transfer . Later crises, including the collapse of Mt. Gox, tested the resilience of the ecosystem but also contributed to its maturation. The introduction of Ethereum further expanded the sector by enabling programmable financial applications, accelerating adoption, and institutional interest. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 AI Singularity and the Future of Financial Scale Pantoja’s thesis centers on the AI singularity, a theoretical point where artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence and operates at a vast scale. He anticipates a future in which automated systems execute most economic transactions. This would require financial infrastructure that supports instant settlement and constant availability. He argues that traditional banking systems may struggle under such demands. At a much higher price, XRP could deliver the liquidity needed for enormous transaction volumes. Some experts believe XRP works better at high prices like $10,000 . Pantoja shares this belief, maintaining that only a network valued in the hundreds of trillions could support such activity. Reaching this price would put XRP’s market cap above $500 trillion. Pantoja ultimately positions XRP as a potential backbone for global payments in an increasingly automated economy. He views Bitcoin as a long-term store of value and Ethereum as a platform for decentralized applications. XRP’s role is unique, as it was engineered to address the specific challenge of efficient cross-border value movement, and this role could help it reach unimaginable heights.

With bullish signals and steady inflows aligning, the market now watches whether this stability can spark a meaningful upside move. ETH Coils Below $3,200 Ahead Of A Decisive Move AltCoin Việt Nam, in a recent post, highlighted that ETH is positioned at an extremely tense moment on its chart, signaling that the asset is preparing for a major directional move. This immediate pressure is being fueled by a significant bullish divergence that has just appeared on the chart, marking the first time the signal has materialized in over a month. Related Reading: Why Ethereum’s Rally Isn’t Overheated – And Where Demand Must Grow Next The analyst reinforced the expectation of high volatility by referencing historical data. Their research shows a consistent history of 9–16% price volatility whenever ETH falls below the $3,200 level. Given that the price is currently fluctuating tightly around the $3,100 mark, this historical context provides a clear signal that a sharp volatility explosion may be imminent. Adding overwhelming conviction to the bullish case is the recent action of market movers. AltCoin Việt Nam reported that a single super large whale just opened a leveraged long position totaling a massive $392 million (equivalent to 120,094 ETH). This colossal bet on the upside demonstrates a firm, high-conviction among institutional players. Furthermore, the institutional framework continues to provide a reliable underlying demand. The Spot Ethereum ETF market is still actively attracting substantial capital inflows, totaling over $250 million this week. BitMine Technologies also purchased an additional 33,504 ETH (valued at $112 million) today, highlighting persistent institutional accumulation. Considering the confluence of technical divergence, historical volatility context, and massive whale and institutional purchasing, the market faces a critical juncture. AltCoin Việt Nam posed the final question: Can ETH break out strongly and immediately confirm the uptrend, or will it need to retest lower support levels before initiating the expected explosive rally? Buyers Step In As Ethereum Defends Key Support According to crypto analyst The Boss, ETH has shown a highly encouraging response from a key technical area. Ethereum has reacted positively with the $3,091 support zone, and is currently holding firmly above this level, which is a strong signal that short-term buying pressure remains resilient and active in the market. Related Reading: Ethereum Inches Toward A Critical Decision Point: Bullish Break Or Deeper Dive? As long as the price stays above the green line, the analyst confirms that the primary focus remains the upside, validating the potential for a move toward the resistance zone marked by the blue line. The Boss emphasized the importance of these structural defense moves, concluding that such strong reactions from established support levels are vital signals for confirming the validity of the current structure and providing clear direction of the prevailing trend.

55753880,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=878017,1765678070,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55753880.jpeg,Long-term Bitcoin holders drive market lower with covered call tactics,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/long-term-bitcoin-holders-drive-market-lower/,"Jeff Park, a prominent market analyst and investment manager currently serving as the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at ProCap BTC, says that long-term Bitcoin holders, often referred to as “whales” or “OGs,” are increasingly selling covered calls. In this strategy, they sell call options against a large existing holding, such as BTC and ETH, to generate extra income or yield. These options grant the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase an asset at a predetermined price in the future, while the seller retains a profit. Park argued that this practice gives rise to a drastic drop in the price of spot BTC. Park blames BTC OGs for recent price declines in the crypto market Regarding Park’s argument , sources highlighted that these major Bitcoin holders establish substantial sell-side pressure via their covered call strategy. On the other hand, they noted that market makers, who play a significant role in purchasing these covered calls, are on the other side of this trade. Therefore, this calls for an urgency for them to safeguard themselves by engaging in activities such as selling spot BTC to cover their position. This, in turn, lowers market prices, although analysts discovered a deep interest from traditional ETF investors. Meanwhile, recent reports have revealed that the BTC designed to support these options has been held for several years and does not demonstrate the presence of new demands or fresh liquidity in the market. As a result, these calls bring about a reduction in prices. To further elaborate on this point, Park mentioned that, “When you already own Bitcoin that you’ve had for over 10 years and start selling calls against it, only the act of selling calls adds new delta to the market—and that delta is negative—so you end up being a net seller of delta when you sell calls.” His analysis suggested that the option market has a significant influence on the price of Bitcoin. He also suggested that there is a high likelihood that this price will continue to fluctuate as long as whales continue to make short-term profits, particularly from their BTC holdings by selling covered calls. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the cryptocurrency separated from the stock market in the latter half of 2025. At this time, some analysts expressed their belief that Bitcoin is closely tied to tech stocks. Moreover, while stocks continued to reach their highest point, BTC significantly declined to approximately $90,000. Analysts express their belief that Bitcoin will begin to rise again Several analysts have shared their forecasts that Bitcoin will begin to surge again when the US Federal Reserve continues to implement interest rate cuts and allocate additional funds into the financial system. According to them, this move could indicate a positive sign for risky investments. Following their prediction, data from CME Group’s FedWatch tool indicated that approximately 24.4% of traders anticipated that the US Federal Reserve could consider another rate cut at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled for January next year. However, some analysts speculated that BTC might experience a decline to reach a record low of $76,000, arguing that its upward trend has already come to an end. The analysts made this assumption after t rader Roman, with the username @Roman_Trading, shared an X post on Thursday of this week, publicly displaying his recent analysis and informing his followers to prepare for an additional 17% decline in Bitcoin’s price. Following his statement, sources acknowledged that BTC/USD has been facing difficulties in bouncing back after reaching its recent lows close to $80,000. They argued that instead, it is moving within a channel that slopes upwards.

Since hitting a price bottom of $80,000 in late November, BTC has formed an ascending channel, recording a steady series of higher lows and higher highs. However, KillaXBT’s projection is expected to break this channel, potentially halting the nascent uptrend. Going by the recurring price pattern, the analyst states Bitcoin investors should anticipate a minimum 5% price decline after the 14th of December, hinting at a potential retest of the 85,000-$86,000 price zone. Given the asset’s broader bullish market structure, such a move may represent nothing more than a short-term pullback. However, the prolonged correction seen earlier in Q4 has already set a precedent, leaving room for another phase of deeper downside should momentum weaken. BTC To Bottom Below $50,000? In another X post , KillaXBT shares more bearish projections of the Bitcoin market. This time, the seasoned analyst predicts the crypto market leader will hit a price bottom of $48,905 despite recent price gains. KillaXBT’s bottom target represents Bitcoin’s price as of the approval of the BlackRock IBIT ETF, alongside 11 other Bitcoin Spot ETFs in January 2024. This projection is likely due to the common rationale that the present bullish run has been heavily supported by institutional inflows. Notably, the Bitcoin Spot ETFs have been central to these institutional inflows, boasting total net assets of $119.18 billion. The BlackRock IBIT holds over half of this traction as the undisputed market leader with $71.03 billion in net assets and $62.68 billion in cumulative net inflows. If Bitcoin were to return to its pre-ETF approval price levels, it would imply an estimated 46% decline from current market prices. Such a move would likely signal a sharp reversal in institutional positioning, suggesting that sustained ETF outflows, rather than retail capitulation, could emerge as the primary catalyst for a renewed crypto winter. At press time, Bitcoin continues to trade at $90,348, reflecting a 2.18% decline.

In recent days, Trump has publicly indicated that he is considering just two finalists — Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett, his current director of the National Economic Council — and described them as “the two Kevins”. The president stressed that he wants a Fed leader who will be willing to lower interest rates and consult with the White House on monetary policy. These remarks would mark a notable shift from the Fed’s traditional independence. As U.S. President Donald Trump named his top two candidates to replace Jerome Powell, markets reacted fast. Betting platforms and cryptographically linked prediction markets are showing massive support for Warsh. Traders now regard him as a credible alternative to White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett. In any case, Trump will likely announce his nomination long before Powell’s term ends in May 2026 . Traders push Warsh’s odds as Trump narrows Fed choices Within days, Warsh’s odds of becoming the next Fed chair soared from roughly 12% to above 38% . The move followed reports that Trump has trimmed his list to two finalists . Kevin Hassett remains the favorite to win. But his lead has weakened. Now, after Trump went public with his praise, traders recognize an actual path ahead for Warsh. Shareholders consider the Fed chair race as key. Trump has been vocal about slashing interest rates. He said that the United States should have the lowest rates of any major economy. That position matters to markets. Most traders expect the next Fed chair to advocate for quicker and more aggressive rate cuts than the existing stance. Warsh is viewed as open to that transition. His previous criticism of persistently high rates resurfaces in current debates. That has helped bolster market confidence that he’s more in line with Trump’s economic priorities. Trump himself has said that Warsh is among his biggest choices. He has also confirmed that he interviewed several candidates in recent days. Warsh is reported to have been robust in those discussions. Other candidates continue to be considered. They are Fed Governors Chris Waller and Michelle Bowman, as well as Rick Rieder of BlackRock. However, attention has shifted increasingly to Warsh and Hassett. Wall Street backing has also helped fuel Warsh’s momentum. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive, has signaled support for Warsh as a credible and steady option. That backing has reverberations across financial markets. Critics, on the other hand, have expressed concern. Some lawmakers fear that Trump’s selections might erode the Fed’s independence. They say pressure to cut rates quickly could aggravate inflation risks. Trump brushed those fears aside. He has made lower rates a litmus test for his next Fed chair. Markets bet on aggressive Fed rate cuts The Fed now fears small rate cuts by 2026. However, traders believe Trump will quickly move to cut rates further when he appoints a proponent of rate cuts. Most market indicators currently suggest that a few rate cuts will occur next year. Some have three cuts in mind, a far cry from the Fed’s median view. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee recently stated that the committee could cut more than the current forecast if inflation continues to cool. His comments worked to reinforce market perceptions. Depending on whom the president picks to replace Powell as Fed chair, it could be a decisive factor. A Warsh nomination may also mark a more rapid pivot to looser monetary policy.
